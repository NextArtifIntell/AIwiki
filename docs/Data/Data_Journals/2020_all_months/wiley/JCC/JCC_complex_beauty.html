The first two gold atoms remained tied to the surface with a bond length similar to those belonging to other well-known related materials, while the other gold atoms do not spread over the surface; they preferred to form a new layer. The occurrence of relativistic effects produced a preferential triangle geometry for Au3and a combination of triangular units for Au4and Au5. The Au–Au average distance increased fromn= 2 ton= 5, indicating an expansion with a tendency to the bond distance found in the bulk. We are reporting an early 2D→3D transition of small folding, from Au3→Au4, followed by an Au4→Au5transition of evident 3D character.},

  abstract     = {Molecular simulations of nanoscale systems invariably involve assumptions and approximations to describe the electrostatic interactions, which are long-ranged in nature. One approach is the use of cutoff schemes with a reaction-field contribution to account for the medium outside the cutoff scheme. Recent reports show that macroscopic properties may depend on the exact choice of cutoff schemes in modern day simulations. In this work, a systematic analysis of the effects of different cutoff schemes was performed using a set of 52 proteins. We find no statistically significant differences between using a twin-range or a single-range cutoff scheme. Applying the cutoff based on charge groups or based on atomic positions, does lead to significant differences, which is traced to the cutoff noise for energies and forces. While group-based cutoff schemes show increased cutoff noise in the potential energy, applying an atomistic cutoff leads to artificial structure in the solvent at the cutoff distance. Carefully setting the temperature control, or using an atomistic cutoff for the solute and a group-based cutoff for the solvent significantly reduces the effects of the cutoff noise, without introducing structure in the solvent. This study aims to deepen the understanding of the implications different cutoffs have on molecular dynamics simulations.},

  abstract     = {We develop a new scheme for evaluating different molecular integrals using Gaussian type orbitals. In this new scheme, the evaluation of integrals is performed in two steps during runtime. The first step is a top-down procedure that maps each recurrence relation into a jagged array (array of arrays), where each element of a member array represents either the final results or some intermediate integrals that are stored in our developed data structure “coarse-grained circular buffer”. This step is the same for all different one- and two-electron operators so that the same algorithm and source codes can be used. In the second step, a bottom-up procedure is carried out that computes all the intermediate and the final molecular integrals by backtracking elements from the last member array of each jagged array. Different source codes should in principle be used for different electron operators in the second step, but which can be generated automatically by our developed recurrence-relation compiler. The currently proposed general recurrence-relation generation scheme provides a new, generic and automatic programming way for various one- and two-electron integrals needed in computational chemistry. Users can even introduce new electron operators and evaluate their integrals during runtime by combining the implementation of the proposed new scheme and the just-in-time compilation technique.},

In this work, we present an efficient procedure for constructing CI expansions from MPS employing the parallel object-orientedCharm++programming framework, upon which automatic load-balancing and object migrating facilities can be employed. This procedure was employed in the MPS-to-CI utility (Moritz et al.,J. Chem. Phys.2007,126, 224109), the sampling-reconstructed complete active-space algorithm (SR-CAS, Boguslawski et al.,J. Chem.

It enhances productivity and allows the sampling programs to evolve to their population-expansion versions, for example, EDGA with population expansion (PE-EDGA). Further, examples of 1,2-dioxetanone and firefly dioxetanone anion (FDO−) molecules demonstrated the following: (a) parallel efficiencies can be persistently improved by simply by increasing the proportions of the asynchronous executions and (b) a sampled CAS-type CI wave function of a bi-radical-state FDO−molecule utilizing the full valence (30e,26o) active space can be constructed within a few hours with using thousands of cores.},

In symmetric coordination complexes, the use of group theory and the symmetry-adapted linear combination (SALC) of fragment orbitals allows for a very accurate and informative interpretation of MOs, but the same procedure cannot be performed for asymmetric complexes, such as Schrock and Fischer carbenes. In this work, we present a straight-forward approach for classifying and quantifying MO contributions to a particular metal–ligand interaction. Our approach utilizes the topology of MO density contributions to a cross-section of an inter-nuclear region, and is computationally inexpensive and applicable to symmetric and asymmetric complexes alike. We also apply the same approach with similar decompositions using Natural Bond Orbitals (NBO) and the recently developed Fragment, Atomic, Localized, Delocalized and Interatomic (FALDI) density decomposition scheme. In particular, FALDI analysis provides additional insights regarding the multi-centric nature of metal-carbene bonds without resorting to expensive multi-reference calculations.},

  abstract     = {Transaminase is a key enzyme for amino acid metabolism, which reversibly catalyzes the transamination reaction with the help of PLP (pyridoxal5&#39;-phosphate) as its cofactor. Here we have investigated the mechanism and free energy landscape of the transamination reaction involving the aspartate transaminase (AspTase) enzyme and aspartate-PLP (Asp-PLP) complex using QM/MM simulation and metadynamics methods. The reaction is found to follow a stepwise mechanism where the active site residue Lys258 acts as a base to shuttle a proton fromα-carbon (CA) to imine carbon (C4A) of the PLP-Asp Schiff base. In the first step, the Lys258 abstracts the CA proton of the substrate leading to the formation of a carbanionic intermediate which is followed by the reprotonation of the Asp-PLP Schiff base at C4A atom by Lys258. It is found that the free energy barrier for the proton abstraction by Lys258 and that for the reprotonation are 17.85 and 3.57 kcal/mol, respectively. The carbanionic intermediate is 7.14 kcal/mol higher in energy than the reactant. Hence, the first step acts as the rate limiting step. The present calculations also show that the Lys258 residue undergoes a conformational change after the first step of transamination reaction and becomes proximal to C4A atom of the Asp-PLP Schiff base to favor the second step. The active site residues Tyr70* and Gly38 anchor the Lys258 in proper position and orientation during the first step of the reaction and stabilize the positive charge over Lys258 generated at the intermediate step.},

In this contribution, the effect of surface and interstitial Li on the electronic properties of pGe was studied using a first-principles density functional theory scheme. The porous structures were modeled by removing columns of atoms in the [001] direction and the surface dangling bonds were passivated with H atoms, and then replaced with Li atoms. Also, the effect of a single interstitial Li in the Ge was analyzed.

Current approaches are often based on a linear block-design of amphiphilic peptides where a hydrophilic peptide chain is terminated by a hydrophobic tail. Here, a new template for a self-assembling tetrapeptide (YXKX, Y = tyrosine, X = alkylated tyrosine, K = lysine) is proposed with two distinct sides relative to the peptide&#39;s backbone: alkylated hydrophobic residues on one side and hydrophilic residues on the other side. Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, the self-assembly pathway of the tetrapeptide is analyzed for two different concentrations. At both concentrations, tetrapeptides self-assembled into a nanosphere structure. The alkylated tyrosines initialize the self-assembly process via a strong hydrophobic effect and to reduce exposure to the aqueous solvent, they formed a hydrophobic core. The hydrophilic residues occupied the surface of the self-assembled nanosphere. Ordered arrangement of tetrapeptides within the nanosphere with the backbone hydrogen bonding led to a beta sheet formation. Alkyl chain length constrained the size and shape of the nanosphere. This study provides foundation for further exploration of self-assembling structures that are based on peptides with hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties located on the opposite sides of a peptide backbone.},

These compounds are also known as divalent NIcompounds and can be represented with the general formula L → N+← L, where L is an electron donating ligand. In the recent past, several divalent NIcompounds have been reported with L =N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC), remoteN-heterocyclic carbene (rNHC), carbocyclic carbene (CCC) and diaminocarbene. Recently, our group reported that a novel six-membered CCC (cyclohexa-2,5-diene-4-[diaminomethynyl]-1-ylidene) can stabilize N+center in nitreones. As an independent carbene, this species is very unstable. In this work, modulation of this CCC using (a) annulation, (b) heterocyclic ring modification, (c) substitutions adjacent to the carbenic carbon, (d) exocyclic double bond insertion and (e) ring contraction, has been reported. These modulations and quantum chemical analyses helped in the identification of five new six-membered CCCs which carry improved donation and stability properties. Further, these CCCs were employed in the design of new divalent NIcompounds (nitreones) which carry coordination bonds between ligands and N+center. The molecular and electronic structure properties, and the donor→acceptor coordination interactions present in the resultant low oxidation state divalent NIcompounds have been explored.},

  abstract     = {Two pressure-induced phase transitions have been theoretically studied in the layered iron phosphorus triselenide (FePSe3). Topological analysis of chemical bonding inFePSe3has been performed based on the results of first-principles calculations within the periodic linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) method with hybrid Hartree-Fock-DFT B3LYP functional. The first transition at about 6 GPa is accompanied by the symmetry change fromtoC2/m, whereas the semiconductor-to-metal transition (SMT) occurs at about 13 GPa leading to the symmetry change fromC2/mto. We found that the collapse of the band gap at about 13 GPa occurs due to changes in the electronic structure ofFePSe3induced by relative displacements of phosphorus or selenium atoms along thec-axis direction under pressure. The results of the topological analysis of the electron density and its Laplacian demonstrate that the pressure changes not only the interatomic distances but also the bond nature between the intralayer and interlayer phosphorus atoms. The interlayer P–P interactions are absent in two non-metallicFePSe3phases while after SMT the intralayer P–P interactions weaken and the interlayer P–P interactions appear.},

  abstract     = {Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) and PBE adapted for solids (PBEsol) are exchange-correlation (xc) functionals widely used in density functional theory simulations. Their differences are the exchange,μ, and correlation,β, coefficients, causing PBEsol to lose the Local Spin Density (LSD) response. Here, theμ/βtwo-dimensional (2D) accuracy landscape is analyzed between PBE and PBEsol xc functional limits for 27 transition metal (TM) bulks, as well as for 81 TM surfaces. Several properties are analyzed, including the shortest interatomic distances, cohesive energies, and bulk moduli for TM bulks, and surface relaxation degree, surface energies, and work functions for TM surfaces. The exploration, comparing the accuracy degree with respect experimental values, reveals that the found xc minimum, called VV, being a PBE variant, represents an improvement of 5\% in mean absolute percentage error terms, whereas this improvement reaches ~11\% for VVsol, a xc resulting from the restoration of LSD response in PBEsol, and so regarded as its variant.},

In this study polarization consistent scheme of deriving a charge distribution inside solute molecule is proposed. The environment effect is explicitly taken into account by distributing solvent molecules around the solute target. The performed analysis includes a few computational schemes (HF, MP2, B3LYP, and M026X), basis sets (cc-pvnz,n= 2, 3, …, 6), and electrostatically derived charge distributions (KS, CHELP, CHELPG, and HLY). It is demonstrated that the environment effect is very important and cannot be disregarded. The second solvation shell should be included to achieve the charge convergence. Huge corrections to charge distribution are due to induction and dispersion. The B3LYP/cc-pvqz level of theory is recommended for deriving the charges within self-consistent polarization scheme.},

  abstract     = {The structure and properties of ZnO quantum dots is a very popular and rapidly growing field of research for which accurate quantum calculations are challenging to perform. Since the dependence between system size and wall time scales nonlinearly, certain compromises have to be made. A particularly important limiting factor is the size of the basis used, this is especially the case if accurate large calculations are to be carried out. In our work, we discovered that an important O(2p)-&gt;Zn(4p) back donation, which greatly influences the strength of the ZnO bond, can be reproduced only if diffuse functions are added to the basis set. We further tested the basis dependence for the magic-sized wurtzite nanophase ZnO clusters which were previously shown to be able to accurately reproduce the magnetically doped II-IV Q-dots. In this work, we outline the minimal basis sets required to properly describe ZnO bonds in a nanocluster. It was demonstrated that the rock salt nanophase is incorrectly stabilized if a basis set does not contain sufficiently diffuse functions while the correct wurtzite phase is stabilized when diffuse functions are added. This tendency, similar to that in the ZnO dimer case, was shown to stem from the incorrect lack of Zn(4p) electron density in calculations when using the diffuse-free basis set.},

The Coulomb contribution to the Kohn–Sham matrix is calculated combining density fitting approximation and the continuous fast multipole method. Performance of the implementation is benchmarked for molecular systems with different sizes and dimensionalities. For linear alkane chains, the wall time for density matrix time propagation step is comparable to the Kohn-Sham (KS) matrix construction. However, for larger two- and three-dimensional molecules, with up to about 5,000 basis functions, the computational effort of RT-TDDFT calculations is dominated by the KS matrix evaluation. In addition, the maximum time step is evaluated using a set of small molecules of different polarities. The photoabsorption spectra of several molecular systems calculated using RT-TDDFT are compared to those obtained using linear response time-dependent density functional theory and coupled cluster methods.},

In this study, we present DFT-D4 damping parameters to build the DFT-D4 counterparts of these functionals and assess these in comparison. We extend our analysis beyond GMTKN55 and especially turn our attention to enzymatically catalyzed and metal–organic reactions. We find that B97M-D4 is now the second-best performing meta-generalized-gradient approximation functional for the GMTKN55 database and it can provide noticeably better organometallic reaction energies compared to B97M-D3(BJ). Moreover, the aforementioned DFT-D3(BJ)-based functionals have not been thoroughly assessed for geometries and herein we close this gap by analyzing geometries of noncovalently bound dimers and trimers, peptide conformers, water hexamers and transition-metal complexes. We find that several of the B97(M)-based methods—particularly the DFT-D4 versions—surpass the accuracy of previously studied methods for peptide conformer, water hexamer, and transition-metal complex geometries, making them safe-to-use, cost-efficient alternatives to the original methods. The DFT-D4 variants can be easily used with ORCA4.1 and above.},

Enlisting the interfacial residues important for protein–protein complex formation between BMPs (BMP-2 and BMP-7) and antagonists (Gremlin-1 and Noggin), we analyzed the structural basis of their interactions. We found possible key mutations that destabilize these complexes, which may prevent GBM development. It was also observed that when the interfacial residues were either mutated to histidine or tryptophan, it led to higher destabilization energy values. Besides, our study of the Noggin interactive model of BMP-2 suggested preferential binding at binding site II over binding site I. In the case of Gremlin-1 and BMPs, our research, along with few previous studies, indicates a close-ended cis-trans interactive model.},

We considered three active nuclear degrees of freedom in the dynamics, including the motions along the Fe–O distance, Fe–O–O angle, and Fe out-of-plane distance. Spin-free potential energy surfaces for the singlet, triplet, quintet, and septet states were developed using density functional theory calculations, and spin–orbit coupling elements were obtained from CASSCF-level electronic structure calculations. The spin-inversion mainly occurred between the singlet state and one of the triplet states due to large spin–orbit couplings and the contributions of other states were extremely small. The present quantum dynamics calculations suggested that the narrow crossing region model plays a dominant role in the O2binding dynamics. In addition, the one-dimensional Landau–Zener model underestimated the nonadiabatic transition probability.},

High-level B2PLYPD3-BJ/aug-cc-pV5Z reference values are provided for 116 functional groups and the property sensitivity with respect to these values are evaluated based on absolute deviations and by assessing linear relationships. Functional group properties, including charges, dipoles, quadrupoles and volumes, were found to be mostly insensitive to choice of computational model chemistry. However, due to structural and topological inconsistencies, the 6-31G(d) basis set is not recommended for use. Bond critical point properties varied with choice of model chemistry, but models incorporating hybrid functionals and triple-ζbasis sets provided values suitable for use in regression studies.},

The entire workflow of performing the shock wave simulations, including obtaining the crucial simulation parameters, is described in seven steps. Two exemplary analyses are provided for a case study simulation serving to: (a) quantify the shock wave propagation and (b) describe the dynamics of formation of DNA breaks. The article concludes by discussing the computational cost of the simulations and revealing the possible maximal computational time for different simulation set-ups.},

For crystallographic waters (CWs) close to the ligand,gO(r)reveals that several CWs are stabilized by interaction networks formed between the ligand, CW, and protein. Based on thegO(r)for the crystallographic binding pose of the ligand, hydrogen bond interactions are dominant in the highly hydrated regions while weak interactions such as CH-O are dominant in the moderately hydrated regions. The polar heteroatoms of the ligand occupy the highly hydrated and moderately hydrated regions in the crystallographic (correct) and wrongly docked (incorrect) poses, respectively. Thus, thegO(r)of polar heteroatoms may be used to distinguish the correct binding poses.},

We then consider the photoionization of atomic hydrogen, and ionization by electron impact in the first Born approximation, for which the closed form cross sections serve as a solid benchmark. Using the proposed complex Gaussian representation of the continuum combined with a real Gaussian expansion for the initial bound state, all necessary matrix elements within a partial wave approach become analytical. The successful numerical comparison illustrates that the proposed all-Gaussian approach works efficiently for ionization processes of one-center targets.},

The most important factor in choosing appropriate working reaction is the same number of species on both sides of the equation. Among these reactions, the reactions with small enthalpy change usually provide a better cancellation of errors.

Overall, the parameters we derived give good description of the equilibrium structure, torsional properties, and non-bonded interactions for the photo-switchable lipid in itstransandcisintermediate states, and crystal lattice parameters fortrans-FAAzo-4.

  abstract     = {Computer simulations of model systems are widely used to explore striking phenomena in promising applications spanning from physics, chemistry, biology, to materials science and engineering. The long range electrostatic interactions between charged particles constitute a prominent factor in determining structures and states of model systems. How to efficiently calculate electrostatic interactions in simulation systems subjected to partial or full periodic boundary conditions has been a grand challenging task. In the past decades, a large variety of computational schemes has been proposed, among which the Ewald summation method is the most reliable route to accurately deal with electrostatic interactions between charged particles in simulation systems. In addition, extensive efforts have been done to improve computational efficiencies of the Ewald summation based methods. Representative examples are approaches based on cutoffs, reaction fields, multi-poles, multi-grids, and particle-mesh schemes. We sketched an ENUF method, an abbreviation for the Ewald summation method based on the nonuniform fast Fourier transform technique, and have implemented this method in particle-based simulation packages to calculate electrostatic energies and forces at micro- and mesoscopic levels. Extensive computational studies of conformational properties of polyelectrolytes, dendrimer-membrane complexes, and ionic fluids demonstrated that the ENUF method and its derivatives conserve both energy and momentum to floating point accuracy, and exhibit a computational complexity ofwith optimal physical parameters. These ENUF based methods are attractive alternatives in molecular simulations where high accuracy and efficiency of simulation methods are needed to accelerate calculations of electrostatic interactions at extended spatiotemporal scales.},

Putative O2pathways within rhodopsins are identified by using molecular dynamics simulations, Voronoi-diagram analysis, and implicit ligand sampling while retinal energetic properties are investigated through density functional theory, and quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical methods.

  abstract     = {Hydrogen bonds (HB) are arguably the most important noncovalent interactions in chemistry. We study herein how differences in connectivity alter the strength of HBs within water clusters of different sizes. We used for this purpose the interacting quantum atoms energy partition, which allows for the quantification of HB formation energies within a molecular cluster. We could expand our previously reported hierarchy of HB strength in these systems (Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2016,18, 19557) to include tetracoordinated monomers. Surprisingly, the HBs between tetracoordinated water molecules are not the strongest HBs despite the widespread occurrence of these motifs (e.g., in iceIh). The strongest HBs within H2O clusters involve tricoordinated monomers. Nonetheless, HB tetracoordination is preferred in large water clusters because (a) it reduces HB anticooperativity associated with double HB donors and acceptors and (b) it results in a larger number of favorable interactions in the system. Finally, we also discuss (a) the importance of exchange-correlation to discriminate among the different examined types of HBs within H2O clusters, (b) the use of the above-mentioned scale to quickly assess the relative stability of different isomers of a given water cluster, and (c) how the findings of this research can be exploited to indagate about the formation of polymorphs in crystallography. Overall, we expect that this investigation will provide valuable insights into the subtle interplay of tri- and tetracoordination in HB donors and acceptors as well as the ensuing interaction energies within H2O clusters.},

  abstract     = {Ab initio nuclear magnetic resonance chemical shift prediction provides an important tool for interpreting and assigning experimental spectra, but it becomes computationally prohibitive in large systems. The computational costs can be reduced considerably by fragmentation of the large system into a series of contributions from many smaller subsystems. However, the presence of charged functional groups and the need to partition the system across covalent bonds create complications in biomolecules that typically require the use of large fragments and careful descriptions of the electrostatic environment. The present work shows how a model that combines chemical shielding contributions from non-overlapping monomer and dimer fragments embedded in a polarizable continuum model provides a simple, easy-to-implement, and computationally inexpensive approach for predicting chemical shifts in complex systems. The model&#39;s performance proves rather insensitive to the continuum dielectric constant, making the selection of the optimal embedding dielectric less critical. The PCM-embedded fragment model is demonstrated to perform well across systems ranging from molecular crystals to proteins.},

Using a combination of density functional theory and efficient algorithms for exploration of potential energy hypersurface (PES), a total of 197 local minima and 186 transition states are identified, and a new mechanism for water splitting and H2evolution via hydroxycarbonyl intermediates is presented. Furthermore, a global feature of the reaction PES, so-called potential energy landscape, is discussed on analyzing the obtained structures. As a result, the landscape is characterized by hierarchical structure, namely, PES consists of many “superbasins (SBs)” that are separated by relatively high energy barriers corresponding to bond breaking around Ru(II) center. Each SB involves a set of conformational isomers that can be interchanged with each other through relatively small barriers. To the best of our best knowledge, this is the first report on the quantum chemical computation of the hierarchical structure of PES for a realistic, catalytic reaction system.},

  abstract     = {Solute–solvent interactions are proxies for understanding how the electronic density of a chromophore interacts with the environment in a more exhaustive way. The subtle balance between polarization, electrostatic, and non-bonded interactions need to be accurately described to obtain good agreement between simulations and experiments. First principles approaches providing accurate configurational sampling through molecular dynamics may be a suitable choice to describe solvent effects on solute chemical–physical properties and spectroscopic features, such as optical absorption of dyes. In this context, accurate energy potentials, obtained by hybrid implicit/explicit solvation methods along with employing nonperiodic boundary conditions, are required to represent bulk solvent around a large solute–solvent cluster. In this work, a novel strategy to simulate methanol solutions is proposed combining ab initio molecular dynamics, a hybrid implicit/explicit flexible solvent model, nonperiodic boundary conditions, and time dependent density functional theory. As case study, the robustness of the proposed protocol has been gauged by investigating the microsolvation and electronic absorption of the anionic green fluorescent protein chromophore in methanol and aqueous solution. Satisfactory results are obtained, reproducing the microsolvation layout of the chromophore and, as a consequence, the experimental trends shown by the optical absorption in different solvents.},

The quantum chemical computations of 38 equilibrium diatomic systems at different levels of theory (HF, MP2, MP4SDQ, and CCSD) are invoked to support abstract considerations. Parameters of excellent correlations between IAS integrals and interatomic exchange-correlation energy are found by the optimization. The performance of these trends depends on the accuracy of the electronic correlation treatment. The resulting trends are a unique feature of equilibrium states, whereas more complicated dependencies are explored for several systems at non-equilibrium conditions. The relations of established trends with other IAS-based estimations of strength of bonding interactions between topological atoms and issues explored for multiatomic systems are briefly discussed.},

The obtained CSA models were tested on two model systems. Test calculations show that the electrostatic embedding provides several times of decrease in the difference of energies of testing and reference calculations in comparison with the conventional elongation approach (ELG). The mechanical embedding is implemented in a combination of the conventional elongation method and the ONIOM approach.

Basically, the mechanism consists of two steps: lactide coordination and ring opening through O-Acyl bond cleavage. Additionally, the effect of cation size and substituent on carboxylate moiety have been evaluated. The calculations indicate that the larger cation leads to faster reactions. Moreover, the stronger electron-donating group on carboxylate moiety accelerates the reaction rates. To obtain further insights, an orbital analysis has been also carried out.

  abstract     = {The correct balance between attractive, repulsive and peptide hydrogen bonding interactions must be attained for proteins to fold correctly. To investigate these important contributors, we sought a comparison of the folding between two 25-residues peptides, the influenza A M2 protein transmembrane domain (M2TM) and the 25-Ala (Ala25). M2TM forms a stable α-helix as is shown by circular dichroism (CD) experiments. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with adaptive tempering show that M2TM monomer is more dynamic in nature and quickly interconverts between an ensemble of various α-helical structures, and less frequently turns and coils, compared to one α-helix for Ala25. DFT calculations suggest that folding from the extended structure to the α-helical structure is favored for M2TM compared with Ala25. This is due to CH⋯O attractive interactions which favor folding to the M2TM α-helix, and cannot be described accurately with a force field. Using natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis and quantum theory atoms in molecules (QTAIM) calculations, 26 CH⋯O interactions and 22 NH⋯O hydrogen bonds are calculated for M2TM. The calculations show that CH⋯O hydrogen bonds, although individually weaker, have a cumulative effect that cannot be ignored and may contribute as much as half of the total hydrogen bonding energy, when compared to NH⋯O, to the stabilization of the α-helix in M2TM. Further, a strengthening of NH⋯O hydrogen bonding interactions is calculated for M2TM compared to Ala25. Additionally, these weak CH⋯O interactions can dissociate and associate easily leading to the ensemble of folded structures for M2TM observed in folding MD simulations.},

In all cases, a stable octahedral[Cu(NH3)6]2+complex subject to dynamic Jahn-Teller distortions without the occurrence of ligand exchange was observed. TheCu2+− NH3distance in the first shell agrees well with the experimental and other theoretical data. In all three cases, the structural data shows that the rigid-body ammonia model in conjunction with the HF level of theory provides accurate data for the first solvation shell, while at the same time, the computational demand and thus the achievable simulation time are much more beneficial. The vibrational analysis of theCu2+− NH3interaction yields similar force constants in the three investigated systems indicating that there is no distinct difference on the dynamical properties of the first solvation shell. In addition to the QMCF MD simulations, a number of natural bond orbital (NBO) analyses were carried out, confirming the strong electrostatic character of theCu2+− NH3interaction.},

Furthermore, in the wild type, only one of the three sgp chains has optimal communication route between residue 614 and the receptor-binding domain (RBD); whereas, two of the three chains communicated directly in G614 mutant.

  abstract     = {Ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (RuBisCO) is the main enzyme involved in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) fixation in the biosphere. This enzyme catalyzes a set of five chemical steps that take place in the same active-site within magnesium (II) coordination sphere. Here, a set of electronic structure benchmark calculations have been carried out on a reaction path proposed by Gready et al. by means of the projector-based embedding approach. Activation and reaction energies for all main steps catalyzed by RuBisCO have been calculated at the MP2, SCS-MP2, CCSD, and CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ and cc-pVDZ levels of theory. The treatment of the magnesium cation with post-HF methods is explored to determine the nature of its involvement in the mechanism. With the high-level ab initio values as a reference, we tested the performance of a set of density functional theory (DFT) exchange-correlation (xc) functionals in reproducing the reaction energetics of RuBisCO carboxylase activity on a set of model fragments. Different DFT xc-functionals show large variation in activation and reaction energies. Activation and reaction energies computed at the B3LYP level are close to the reference SCS-MP2 results for carboxylation, hydration and protonation reactions. However, for the carbon–carbon bond dissociation reaction, B3LYP and other functionals give results that differ significantly from the ab initio reference values. The results show the applicability of the projector-based embedding approach to metalloenzymes. This technique removes the uncertainty associated with the selection of different DFT xc-functionals and so can overcome some of inherent limitations of DFT calculations, complementing, and potentially adding to modeling of enzyme reaction mechanisms with DFT methods.},

In this work, density functional theory (DFT) is used to screen Diels–Alder reactions for use in aqueous thermal fluids. From an initial set of 52 reactions, four are identified with moderate aqueous solubility and predicted turning temperature near the liquid region of water. These reactions are selectively modified through 60 total functional group substitutions to produce novel reactions with improved solubility and thermal properties. Among the reactions generated by functional group substitution, seven have promising predicted thermal properties, significantly improving specific heat (by as much as 30.5\%) and energy storage density (by as much as 4.9\%) compared to pure water.},

To this aim, molecular and atomic descriptors rooted in conceptual density functional theory and in the quantum theory of atoms-in-molecules as well as topological features defined within graph theory were evaluated for a large set of molecules widely used in organic chemistry. State-of-the-art regression tools belonging to the support vector machines family and decision tree models were in particular considered and implemented. They afforded a promising predictive model, validating the use of such methodologies for the study of chemical reactivity.},

  abstract     = {Kinetic Monte Carlo method can provide valuable mechanistic insights for catalytic systems. Nonetheless, it suffers from the notorious problem of timescale disparity due to the existence of the complex catalytic network that consists of fast events and slow events. Previously, we have proposed the extended phenomenological kinetics (XPK) method that effectively deals with the timescale disparity problem between diffusion and reaction. However, it remains a great challenge to simulate systems with timescale disparity among different reaction pathways, which is important when selectivity is the major concern. In this study, we implement the enhanced XPK method to address this problem. The new algorithm works by identifying states connected through fast transitions and compressing them into a “superstate” when the chosen states satisfy a local steadystate condition. This state compression algorithm simplifies the reaction network by concealing the fast transitions. The accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm are demonstrated by two model systems: selective catalytic hydrogenation and selective catalytic decomposition. The enhanced XPK method is expected to be beneficial to the kinetic simulations of catalytic systems, especially those with complex reaction networks.},

Traditionally, converting the structures of polymers (e.g., proteins) from internal to Cartesian coordinates has been performed serially, due to an inherent linear dependency along the polymer chain. We show this dependency can be removed using a tree-based concatenation of coordinate transforms between segments, and then parallelized efficiently on graphics processing units (GPUs). The conversion algorithm is applicable to protein engineering and fitting protein structures to experimental data, and we observe an order of magnitude speedup using parallel processing on a GPU compared to serial execution on a CPU.},

  abstract     = {The interactions between carbon dioxide and cluster models of coordinatively unsaturated metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) were studied using a variety of ab initio methods. Three metal species and three organic linkers in four structures were considered in these models as a representation of the tunable nature of MOFs and the potential multireference character of such systems. Common single-reference methods, such as MP2 and CCSD(T), were compared with multireference methods based on complete active space self-consistent field theory, going as far as multireference configuration interaction with single and double excitations (MRCISD). Special consideration is taken to avoid issues of size inconsistency in the CI results, where an alternate reference is used in the interaction energy definition. The benchmark values are used to judge the adequacy of a selection of density functionals for the current systems. Symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) decomposition was performed to elucidate the important effects that comprise the binding interactions. The systems proved to have very limited multireference character, and MP2 values were closer to the CCSD(T) benchmark than the more difficult MRCISD results. Though the SAPT total energies prove to be relatively poor approximations to the benchmark interaction energies, they reveal (in most cases) the correct trends with respect to the choice of the metal. The SAPT energy decompositions indicate that theCO2binding is primarily driven by electrostatics, but induction and dispersion also provide sizable, and quite similar, attractive contributions. Importantly, the small diformate model provides a faithful representation of complexes with large aromatic linkers, both in terms of the total interaction energy and the SAPT decomposition.},

The inactivation of thiol-based enzymes, promoted by the strong affinity binding of electrophilic mercuric ions to thiol and selenol groups of proteins, is likely an important factor explaining its toxicity. A key role is played by the chemistry and reactivity of the mercury–chalcogens bond, particularly HgS and HgSe, which is the focus of this computational work (level of theory: (COSMO)-ZORA-BLYP-D3(BJ)/TZ2P). We analyze nine ligand-exchange model reactions (the so-called Rabenstein&#39;s reactions) involving an entering ligand (methylchalcogenolate) and a substrate (methylchalcogenolatemethylmercury). Trends in reaction and activation energies are discussed and a change in mechanism is reported for all cases when going from gas phase to water, that is, from a single-well potential energy surface (PES) to a canonical SN2-like mechanism. The reasons accounting for the biochemically challenging and desired displacement of methylmercury from a seleno/thiol protein can be found already in these model reactions, as can be seen from the similarities of the ligand exchange reactions in solution in thermodynamics and kinetics.},

Hence, the dynamical description of chemical reactivity in polaritonic systems needs to explicitly take into account the photon degrees of freedom and nonadiabatic events.

  abstract     = {Quantum chemical calculations were used to study the mechanism of Diels-Alder reactions involving chiral anthracenes as dienes and a series of dienophiles. The reaction force analysis was employed to obtain a detailed scrutiny of the reaction mechanisms, it has been found that thermodynamics and kinetics of the reactions are quite consistent: the lower the activation energy, the lower the reaction energy, thus following the Bell-Evans-Polanyi principle. It has been found that activation energies are mostly due to structural rearrangements that in most cases represented more than 70\% of the activation energy. Electronic activity mostly due to changes in σ and π bonding were revealed by the reaction electronic flux (REF), this property helps identify whether changes on σ or π bonding drive the reaction. Additionally, new global indexes describing the behavior of the electronic activity were introduced and then used to classify the reactions in terms of the spontaneity of their electronic activity. Local natural bond order electronic population analysis was used to check consistency with global REF through the characterization of specific changes in the electronic density that might be responsible for the activity already detected by the REF. Results show that reactions involving acetoxy lactones are driven by spontaneous electronic activity coming from bond forming/strengthening processes; in the case of maleic anhydrides and maleimides it appears that both spontaneous and non-spontaneous electronic activity are quite active in driving the reactions.},

Both classical (6–12 LJ) and modified LJ (mLJ) models were developed. In the mLJ approach, the exponents 6 and 12 are replaced by different integer numbernand 2n, respectively, and an additional parameter (α) is introduced to describe intermolecular distance shift arising within the geometric centers&#39; approach (instead of the shortest interatomic distance between particles). A general LJ approach reexamination reveals that in the case of nanoatoms, the attractive term decays with distance as the inverse fourth power, and the dominating at short distances repulsive term decays as the inverse eighth power. The modification of the LJ equation is even more prominent for interaction profiles, where intermolecular distance corresponds to separation between geometric centers of particles. In this approach, the attractive term decays with distance as the inverse 12th power, while the repulsive term decays rapidly (as the inverse 24th power). Thus, the mLJ models (e.g., 4–8 LJ) rather than the 6–12 classical ones seem to be a better choice for the description of binary interactions of nanoatoms. The developed mLJ models and electronic structure characteristics give an insight into the explanation of the unique physicochemical properties of superatomic-based solid-state materials.},

For all the systems, the “inverse-hydration” where the metal center acts as an acceptor of hydrogen bond has been observed. This has motivated to consider the inversely bonded solvent molecule in the definition of the reaction coordinate required to initiate the constrained DFT-MD trajectories. We found that there exists little difference in free enthalpies of activation, such that these platinum-based anticancer drugs are likely to behave the same way in aqueous media. Detailed analysis of the microsolvation structure of the square-planar complexes, along with the key steps of the aquation mechanism, is discussed.},

In addition, the catalytic reactions of the ZGB model are governed by the parametery, the adsorption rate of carbon monoxide molecules on the catalytic surface. So, to study the phase diagrams of the model on both random networks, we carried out extensive steady-state Monte Carlo simulations in the space parameters (y,α) and (y,p) and showed that the continuous phase transition is greatly affected by the topological features of the networks while the discontinuous one remains present in the diagram throughout the interval of study.},

  abstract     = {A theoretical procedure, via quantum chemical computations, to elucidate the detection principle of the turn-off luminescence mechanism of an Eu-based Metal-Organic Framework sensor (Eu-MOF) selective to aniline, is accomplished. The energy transfer channels that take place in the Eu-MOF, as well as understanding the luminescence quenching by aniline, were investigated using the well-known and accurate multiconfigurational ab initio methods along with sTD-DFT. Based on multireference calculations, the sensitization pathway from the ligand (antenna) to the lanthanide was assessed in detail, that is, intersystem crossing (ISC) from the S1to the T1state of the ligand, with subsequent energy transfer to the5D0state of Eu3+. Finally, emission from the5D0state to the7FJstate is clearly evidenced. Otherwise, the interaction of Eu-MOF with aniline produces a mixture of the electronic states of both systems, where molecular orbitals on aniline now appear in the active space. Consequently, a stabilization of the T1state of the antenna is observed, blocking the energy transfer to the5D0state of Eu3+, leading to a non-emissive deactivation. Finally, in this paper, it was demonstrated that the host-guest interactions, which are not taken frequently into account by previous reports, and the employment of high-level theoretical approaches are imperative to raise new concepts that explain the sensing mechanism associated to chemical sensors.},

We also benchmark the accuracy of three different exchange-correlation density functionals for both minimum-energy geometries and electronic structure. The best compromise between computational cost and qualitative accuracy is achieved with the HSE06 density functional on top of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof minima, including dispersion with Grimme&#39;s D3 scheme. This computational approach predicts the presence of mid-gap states for defective monolayers, in accordance with the present literature. For the heterojunction, we find unexpected vacancy-position dependent electronic features: the location of the defects leads either to mid-gap trap states, detrimental for photocatalyst or to a modification of characteristic type II band alignment behavior, responsible for interlayer charge separation and low recombination rates.},

Over the recent years, the functionalities have also been continually expanded, including accurate projected densities of states (DOSs), crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) analysis, atomic and orbital charges, gross populations, and the recently introducedk-dependent COHP.

The cluster adsorption is found to be dominated by van der Waals forces. The electronic structure and in particular the excitation energies of the bare clusters and the TiO2/graphene composites are found to vary largely in dependence on the size of the respective constituents. This holds in particular for the energy and the spatial localization of the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals. In addition to a substantial gap narrowing, a pronounced separation of photoexcited electrons and holes is predicted in some instances. This is expected to prolong the lifetime of photoexcited carriers. Altogether, TiO2/graphene composites are predicted to be promising photocatalysts with improved electronic and photocatalytic properties compared to bulk TiO2.},

  abstract     = {The recently proposed systems of various anions (A) confined insideC60,A−@ C60, which in turn behave as large and stable anions,(A @ C60)−, can find potential applications in various fields. On the other hand, it has earlier been shown that from the dihalogens (X2) encapsulatedC60,X2@ C60, onlyF2@ C60can be introduced as a system in which the cage acts as a cationC60+and interacts with an endohedral anion,F2−, forming theF2−@ C60+as a single-molecule crystal compound. In this work, two density functional theory energy decomposition analysis (EDA) schemes, where in one of them the noninteracting kinetic, electrostatic, and exchange-correlation energies come into play while another scheme, called as EDA-SBL, includes the steric, electrostatic, and quantum effects as essential ingredients (S. Liu,J.Chem.Phys.2007,126, 244103), are utilized to find out what energetic components govern the unique characteristics of the(A @ C60)−andX2@ C60confinements. It is shown that the noninteracting kinetic energy and steric energies have important contributions to the total interaction energies for the considered systems. However, there are other confinements for which the electrostatic and exchange-correlation contributions play also imperative roles. Furthermore, we find reasonable correlations between interaction energies and their components as well as the energetic components themselves, leading to an alternative EDA scheme including the noninteracting kinetic, steric, and electrostatic energies for investigations on other endohedral fullerenes. Extending our analyses to large size confinements,Cl−@ Cnwithnup to 90 as illustrative examples, the quantitative cooperativity concept is also explored, where the positive and negative cooperativity profiles unveil a specific size of the anionic confinements to form the most stable large anion.},

A detailed study of the molecular interactions that stabilize and destabilize the different molecular complexes was carried out using two techniques: Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules computations and nuclear magnetic shielding constants calculations. A comparative study of the behavior of DA in the gas phase, aqueous solution, and in the active site of D2DR has allowed us to evaluate the degree of deformation suffered by the ligand and, therefore, analyze how rustic are the lock-key model and the induced fit theory in this case. Our results allow us to propose one of the conformations obtained as the “biologically relevant” conformation of DA when it is interacting with the D2DR.},

The calculations of stability indicate that Be2Mg5Q=0, Be2Mg5Q=−1, and Be2Mg8Q=−1clusters are “magic” clusters with high stability. The NCP shows that the charges are transferred from Mg atoms to Be atoms. The s- and p-orbitals interactions of Mg and Be atoms are main responsible for their NEC. In particular, chemical bond analysis including molecular orbitals (MOs) and chemical bonding composition for magic clusters to further study their stability. The results confirmed that the high stability of these clusters is due to the interactions between the Be atom and the Mg5or Mg8host. Finally, theoretical calculations of infrared and Raman spectra of the ground state of Be2MgnQ(Q = 0, −1;n= 1–11) clusters were performed, which will be absolutely useful for future experiments to identify these clusters.},

In this work TDDFT (using B3LYP and CAM-B3LYP functionals) and SA-2-CASSCF calculations were carried out to obtain relaxed excited-state potential energy surfaces (PES) along twisting φ and wagging δ angles that describe mutual orientation of benzothiazole (BTZ) and dimethylaniline (DMA) fragments in ThT. For isolated ThT molecule both methods predict that during structural rearrangements of the initially excited Franck-Condon state, besides twisting along CC bond which connects BTZ and DMA fragments, a considerable wagging motion is expected to occur. Account for solvent effect using polarized continuum model showed qualitative differences in the excited state PES features calculated by SA-2-CASSCF and TDDFT methods. Single-reference TDDFT calculations failed to describe solvation of TICT state and predicted increase of its energy in more polar media.},

  abstract     = {Nitrate () and nitrite () ions are naturally occurring inorganic ions that are part of the nitrogen cycle. High doses of these ions in drinking water impose a potential risk to public health. In this work, molecular dynamics simulations are carried out to study the passage of nitrate and nitrite ions from water through graphene nanosheets (GNS) with hydrogen-functionalized narrow pores in presence of an external electric field. The passage of ions through the pores is investigated through calculations of ion flux, and the results are analyzed through calculations of various structural and thermodynamic properties such as the density of ions and water, ion–water radial distribution functions, two-dimensional density distribution functions, and the potentials of mean force of the ions. Current simulations show that the nitrite ions can pass more in numbers than the nitrate ions in a given time through GNS hydrogen-functionalized pore of different geometry. It is found that the nitrite ions can permeate faster than the nitrate ions despite the former having higher hydration energy in the bulk. This can be explained in terms of the competition between the number density of the ions along the pore axis and the free energy barrier calculated from the potential of mean force. Also, an externally applied electric field is found to be important for faster permeation of the nitrite over the nitrate ions. The current study suggests that graphene nanosheets with carefully created pores can be effective in achieving selective passage of ions from aqueous solutions.},

Concerted PCET reactions are classified according to the electronical adiabaticity degree of the process. To discriminate among different mechanisms, we propose a new analysis based on the use of electron density based indexes. We choose, as test case, the 3-Methylphenoxyl/phenol system in two different conformations to show how the proposed analysis is a suitable tool to discriminate between the different degree of adiabaticity of PCET processes. The very low computational cost of this procedure is extremely promising to analyze and provide evidences of PCET mechanisms ruling the reactivity of many biological and catalytic systems.},

In this study, we developed a classification structure–activity relationship (CSAR) model for identifying substructures giving rise to anti-HCV activities among a set of 578 non-redundant compounds. NS5B inhibitors were described by a set of 12 fingerprint descriptors and predictive models were constructed from 100 independent data splits using the random forest algorithm. The modelability (MODI index) of the data set was determined to be robust with a value of 0.88 exceeding established threshold of 0.65. The predictive performance was deduced by the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Matthews correlation coefficient, which was found to be statistically robust (i.e., the former three parameters afforded values in excess of 0.8 while the latter statistical parameter provided a value &gt;0.7). An in-depth analysis of the top 20 important descriptors revealed that aromatic ring and alkyl side chains are important for NS5B inhibition. Finally, the predictive model is deployed as a publicly accessible HCVpred web server (available athttp://codes.bio/hcvpred/) that would allow users to predict the biological activity as being active or inactive against HCV NS5B. Thus, the knowledge and web server presented herein can be used in the design of more potent and specific drugs against the HCV NS5B.},

  abstract     = {We propose a computational workflow for robust and accurate prediction of both binding poses and their affinities at early stage in designing drug candidates. Small, rigid ligands with few intramolecular degrees of freedom, for example, fragment-like molecules, have multiple binding poses, even at a single binding site, and their affinities are often close to each other. We explore various structures of ligand binding to a target through metadynamics using a small number of collective variables, followed by reweighting to obtain the atomic coordinates. After identifying each binding pose by cluster analysis, we perform alchemical free energy calculations on each structure to obtain the overall value. We applied this protocol in computing free energy of binding for the theophylline-RNA aptamer complex. Of the six (meta)stable structures found, the most favorable binding structure is consistent with the structure obtained by NMR. The overall free energy of binding reproduces the experimental values very well.},

  abstract     = {Ab initiomolecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations employing density functional theory (DFT) and plane waves are routinely carried out using density functionals at the level of generalized gradient approximation (GGA). AIMD simulations employing hybrid density functionals are of great interest as it offers a more accurate description of structural and dynamic properties than the GGA functionals. However, the computational cost for carrying out calculations using hybrid functionals and plane wave basis set is at least two orders of magnitude higher than that using GGA functionals. Recently, we proposed a strategy that combined the adaptively compressed exchange operator formulation and the multiple time step integration scheme to reduce the computational cost by an order of magnitude [J. Chem. Phys.151, 151102 (2019)]. In this work, we demonstrate the application of this method to study chemical reactions, in particular, formamide hydrolysis in an alkaline aqueous medium. By actuating our implementation with the well-sliced metadynamics scheme, we can compute the two-dimensional free energy surface of this reaction at the level of hybrid-DFT. This work also investigates the accuracy of the PBE0 (hybrid) and the PBE (GGA) functionals in predicting the free energetics of this chemical reaction.},

We present PSIXAS, a recent implementation for simulating NEXAFS and PP-NEXAFS spectra by means of the transition-potential and the Δ-Kohn–Sham method. The approach is implemented in form of a software plugin for the Psi4 code, which provides access to a wide selection of basis sets as well as density functionals. We briefly outline the theoretical foundation and the key aspects of the plugin. Then, we use the plugin to simulate PP-NEXAFS spectra of thymine, a system already investigated by others and us. It is found that larger, extended basis sets are needed to obtain more accurate absolute resonance positions. We further demonstrate that, in contrast to ordinary NEXAFS simulations, where the choice of the density functional plays a minor role for the shape of the spectrum, for PP-NEXAFS simulations the choice of the density functional is important. Especially hybrid functionals (which could not be used straightforwardly before to simulate PP-NEXAFS spectra) and their amount of “Hartree-Fock like” exact exchange affects relative resonance positions in the spectrum.},

Computed results show that the drug molecules tend to anchor on the gold cluster at the S atom with binding energies around −34 to −40 kcal/mol (in vacuum) and − 28 to −32 kcal/mol (in aqueous solution). As compared to Au8, Au6undergoes a shorter recovery time and a larger change of energy gap that could be converted to an electrical signal for selective detection of the drugs. Furthermore, interactions between the drugs and gold clusters are reversible processes and a drug release mechanism was also proposed.

The CBA ligand acts as a bifunctional linker to efficiently connect the perovskite and the oxide moieties, ensuring the stability of the interface through Ti–O and Pb–Cl interactions. The computed density of states reveals that the perovskite contributes to the top of the valence band while the oxide contributes to the bottom of the conduction band with a direct bandgap of 2.16 eV, indicating a possible electron transfer from MAPI to TiO2. Dipole moment analysis additionally reveals that the CBA ligand can induce a favorable effect to improve band alignment and thus electron transfer from MAPI to TiO2. This latter has been quantified by calculation of the spin density of the reduced MAPI/CBA/TiO2system and indicates an almost quantitative (99.94\%) electron transfer from MAPI to TiO2for the surface engineered system, together with an ultrafast electron injection time in the femtosecond timescale. Overall, the proposed DFT-based computational protocol therefore indicates that surface engineering and the use of a bifunctional linker can lead to a better stability, together with improved band alignment and electron injection in PSC systems.},

To this end, we consider 20 medium-sized aromatic organic compounds whose lowest singlet excited states are ideally suited for TD-DFT modeling and are very well described by the approximate coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CC2) method, and then use this method and six different density functionals (BP86, B3LYP, PBE0, M06-2X, CAM-B3LYP, and ωB97XD) to optimize the corresponding ground- and excited-state geometries. The results show that although each hybrid functional reproduces the CC2 excited-state bond lengths very satisfactorily, achieving an overall root mean square error of 0.011 Å for all 336 bonds in the 20 molecules, these errors are distinctly larger than those of only 0.004–0.006 Å with which the hybrid functionals reproduce the CC2 ground-state bond lengths. Furthermore, for each functional employed, the variation in the error relative to CC2 between different molecules is found to be much larger (by at least a factor of 3) for the excited-state geometries than for the ground-state geometries, despite the fact that the molecules/states under investigation have rather uniform chemical and spectroscopic character. Overall, the study finds that even in favorable circumstances, TD-DFT excited-state geometries appear intrinsically and comparatively less accurate than DFT ground-state ones.},

The Coulomb bath is incorporated into an effective Hamiltonian for each fragment, with which the electron density is optimized through an iterative double self-consistent field (DSCF) procedure to realize the mutual many-body polarization effects. In this work, the accuracy of interfragment interaction energies enumerated using the Coulomb bath is tested, showing a good agreement with the exact results from an energy decomposition analysis. The qualitative features of many-body polarization effects are visualized by electron density difference plots.

The deacylation step was predicted to be rate-limiting. Transition state and intermediate structures are found using density functional theory in this study, and thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the proposed mechanism are evaluated. The acyl-enzyme complex is found lying in a deep thermodynamic sink, and deacylation is indeed the severely rate-limiting step, leading to suicide inhibition of the peptidoglycan cross-linking.

All calculations are performed using a Slater type orbital (STO) basis set of triple-ζ(TZ) quality and the highly efficient pair atomic resolution of the identity approach for the exchange- and Coulomb-term of the KS matrix (PARI-Kand PARI-J, respectively) and for the evaluation of the MP2 energy correction (PARI-MP2). Employing the quadratic scaling SOS-AO-PARI-MP2 algorithm, DHs based on the spin-opposite-scaled (SOS) MP2 approximation are benchmarked against a database of large molecules. We evaluate the accuracy of STO/PARI calculations for B3LYP as well as for the DH B2GP-PLYP and show that the combined basis set and PARI-error is comparable to the one obtained using the well-known def2-TZVPP Gaussian-type basis set in conjunction with global density fitting. While quadruple-ζ(QZ) calculations are currently not feasible for PARI-MP2 due to numerical issues, we show that, on the TZ level, Jacob&#39;s ladder for classifying DFAs is reproduced. However, while the best DHs are more accurate than the best hybrids, the improvements are less pronounced than the ones commonly found on the QZ level. For conformers of organic molecules and noncovalent interactions where very high accuracy is required for qualitatively correct results, DHs provide only small improvements over hybrids, while they still excel in thermochemistry, kinetics, transition metal chemistry and the description of strained organic systems.},

  abstract     = {Density functional theory (DFT) based calculations have been carried out for the endohedral encapsulation of magnesium dimer inside fullerene, that is, Mg2@C60. It is observed that the minimum energy structure of the Mg2@C60system isC2hsymmetry. The MgMg bond distance in the Mg2@C60system is much shorter than that in the free Mg2and Mg22+ion. The formation of the endohedral Mg2@C60system is thermochemically spontaneous in nature. The natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis showed the presence of an Mg22+fragment with an MgMg bond inside the C60cage. The electron density descriptors have identified the covalency in the MgMg bond. A non-nuclear attractor (NNA) is present in the middle of the two Mg-atoms. The bonding interaction between the Mg2and C60fragments is ionic in nature and the [Mg22+] and [C602−] represent the bonding pattern in the Mg2@C60system.

  abstract     = {Here, we propose a new method to analyze various electronic properties of molecules based on natural perturbation orbitals (NPOs). We applied the proposed method to chemical enhancement of the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) intensity of M2–pyrazine–M2(M = Cu, Ag, Au) complexes. The SERS intensity can be effectively decomposed into the contributions of four NPO pairs (1σ–1σ*, 2σ–2σ*, 1π–1π*, and 2π–2π*), so NPO analysis makes the SERS intensity much easier to understand than by conventional canonical molecular orbitals. Moreover, we analyzed the dependence of the density functional theory functional on the SERS intensity. For the Ag2–pyrazine–Ag2complex, the BP86 functional overestimates the Raman intensity by about 23 times compared with coupled-cluster singles and doubles level of theory, while the CAM-B3LYP functional gives moderately accurate values. This overestimation arises from the inaccuracy of the energy derivative along the normal vibrational mode.},

The representative structure of the most stable cluster reproduced the experimental binding configuration, but an interesting conformational change in Hsp90 could be observed. The combined effects of solvation and ligand binding shift the equilibrium from a preferred loop-in conformation in the unbound state to an α-helical one in the bound state for the flexible lid region of Hsp90.

  abstract     = {Different computational methods are used to investigate the nature of interaction in theNCF⋯NH3model complex, in which the fluorine atom acts as a Lewis acid and forms a noncovalent bond with the ammonia (Lewis base). Symmetry-adapted perturbation theory based on density functional theory (SAPT(DFT)) indicates that the noncovalent interaction in theNCF⋯NH3complex is mainly electrostatics. However, dispersion and induction terms also play important roles. Although fluorine noncovalent interactions are typically classified as halogen bonds, they are somewhat different from the well-known halogen bonds of iodine, bromine, and chlorine. The halogen bonds ofNCCl⋯NH3andNCBr⋯NH3are directional and theCXN(X = Cl or Br)angle tends to be linear. In contrast, the fluorine interaction inNCF⋯NH3is not directional; the interaction energy shows no sensitivity to the angular (CFN) distortions, and the energy profile is flat over a wide angular range (from180°to about140°). However, for the angles less than130°, the energy curve shows a clear angular dependence and the interaction betweenNCFandNH3becomes stronger as theCFNangle decreases. It seems that at the tighter angles, a tetrel-bondedNCF⋯NH3complex is preferred. Moreover, interacting quantum atoms (IQA) analysis shows that the competition between different intra-atomic and interatomic interactions determines the geometry ofNCF⋯NH3complex.},

Up until now, support for this approach has in practice been limited to the standard 20 amino acids however, shrinking the applicability domain of virtual sites. MkVsites is a set of python tools which provides a convenient way to obtain all parameters necessary to use virtual sites for virtually any molecules in a simulation. Required as input to MkVsites is the molecular topology of the molecule(s) in question, along with a specification of where to find the parent force field.

Practical ways to determine the tunnel-initiating points and tunneling path are introduced. It is shown that the tunneling splitting decreases as the bath-mode energy increases.

RNA secondary structure prediction is more tractable than tertiary structure or protein structure. Yet insights into RNA structure–function relationships are complicated by coupling between RNA-folding and ligand-binding. Here, perturbations to equilibrium secondary structure conformational distributions for two riboswitches are calculated in the presence of bound cognate ligands. This work incorporates a key factor coupling ligand binding to RNA conformation but not considered in most previous calculations: the differential affinity of the ligand for a range of RNA-folding intermediates. Significant shifts in the free energy landscape (FEL) due to the ligand occur for transcripts of lengths corresponding to the “decision window,” following transcription of the so-called anti-terminator helix. The results suggest how ligand perturbation can stabilize the formation of an intermediate conformation, readily facilitating terminator hairpin formation in the full-length riboswitch.},

  abstract     = {The formation of the Hg–N3(T) bond between the 1-methylthymine (T) molecule and the hydrated Hg2+cation was explored with the combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) method including Free Energy Perturbation corrections. The thermodynamic properties were determined in the whole pH range, when these systems were explicitly investigated and considered as the QM part: (1) T + [Hg(H2O)6]2+, (2) T + [Hg(H2O)5(OH)]+, (3) T + Hg(H2O)4(OH)2, and (4) N3-deprotonated T + Hg(H2O)4(OH)2. The MM part contained only solvent molecules and counterions. As a result, the dependence of Gibbs-Alberty reaction free energy on pH was obtained along the reaction coordinate. We found that an endoergic reaction in acidic condition up to pH &lt; 4–5 becomes exoergic for a higher pH corresponding to neutral and basic solutions. The migration of the Hg2+cation between N3 and O4/2 positions in dependence on pH is discussed as well. For the verification, DFT calculations of stationary points were performed confirming the qualitative trends of QM/MM MD simulations and NMR parameters were determined for them.},

This comparison revealed that MTX–CPT prodrug tends to form spherical self-assembled nanoparticle (NP), while free MTX/CPT mixture forms rod-shape NP. These observations are attributed to a structural defect in the MTX–CPT prodrug and solvation free energies of MTX, CPT and MTX-CPT molecules. The results provided evidence that noncovalent interactions (NCIs) among the pharmaceutical drugs play a very important role in anticancer agents aggregation process, leading to enhanced stability of the self-assembled NPs. It is found that the stability of MTX–CPT self-assembled NP is greater than the MTX/CPT NP due to the synergistic effect of hydrogen bonding between monomers and solvent (water). Moreover, the noncatalyzed as well as catalyzed hydrolysis reactions of MTX–CPT prodrug are theoretically studied at the PCM(water)//M06-2X/6−31G(d,p) computational level to shed additional light on the role of acidic condition in tumor tissues. We found that the ester hydrolysis in mild acidic solutions is a concerted reaction. In an agreement between theory and experiment, we also confirmed that the activation energies of the catalyzed-hydrolysis steps are much lower than the activation energies of the corresponding steps in the noncatalyzed reaction. Thus, the MTX–CPT prodrug reveals very promising properties as a pH-controlled drug delivery system.},

These two key quantities are required to evaluate the nonelectrostatic contribution to the solvation energy and its nuclear gradients in implicit solvation models. We extend a previously proposed analytical approach for finite systems based on the stereographic projection technique to infinite periodic systems such as polymers, nanotubes, helices, or surfaces and detail its implementation in the Crystal code. We provide the full derivation of the SASA nuclear gradients, and introduce an iterative perturbation scheme of the atomic coordinates to stabilize the gradients calculation for certain difficult symmetric systems. An excellent agreement of computed SASA with reference analytical values is found for finite systems, while the SASA size-extensivity is verified for infinite periodic systems. In addition, correctness of the analytical gradients is confirmed by the excellent agreement obtained with numerical gradients and by the translational invariance achieved, both for finite and infinite periodic systems. Overall therefore, the stereographic projection approach appears as a general, simple, and efficient technique to compute the key quantities required for the calculation of the nonelectrostatic contribution to the solvation energy and its nuclear gradients in implicit solvation models applicable to both finite and infinite periodic systems.},

The computed excitation in case of GH PBE0 is most accurate while the trend is most systematic with RSH LCY-BLYP compared to λmax. We highlight the importance of including solvent effects for optimal agreement with the λmax. Increasing the basis set size from TZ2P to QZ4P has a negligible influence on the computed excitation energies. Notably, RSH CAMY-B3LYP gave the least error for charge-transfer excitation. The poorest agreement with λmaxis obtained with semi-local GGA functionals. Use of the optimally-tuned RSH LCY-BLYP* is not recommended because of the high computational cost and marginal improvement in results.},

  abstract     = {The realistic prediction of protein–protein complex structures is import to ultimately model the interaction of all proteins in a cell and for the design of new protein–protein interactions. In principle, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations allow one to follow the association process under realistic conditions including full partner flexibility and surrounding solvent. However, due to the many local binding energy minima at the surface of protein partners, MD simulations are frequently trapped for long times in transient association states. We have designed a replica-exchange based scheme employing different levels of a repulsive biasing between partners in each replica simulation. The bias acts only on intermolecular interactions based on an increase in effective pairwise van der Waals radii (repulsive scaling (RS)-REMD) without affecting interactions within each protein or with the solvent. For a set of five protein test cases (out of six) the RS-REMD technique allowed the sampling of near-native complex structures even when starting from the opposide site with respect to the native binding site for one partner. Using the same start structures and same computational demand regular MD simulations sampled near native complex structures only for one case. The method showed also improved results for the refinement of docked structures in the vicinity of the native binding geometry compared to regular MD refinement.},

The calculations show that the periodic change of the metal binding free energy has an excellent correlation with the ionic radii and such change of ionic radii also leads to the structural modulation of actinide–ligand complexes. The calculated structural and binding parameters agree well with the available experimental data. Atomic charges derived from quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) and natural bond order (NBO) analysis shows the major role of ligand-to-metal charge transfer in the stability of the complexes. Energy decomposition analysis, QTAIM, and electron localization function (ELF) predict that the actinide–ligand bond is dominantly ionic, but the contribution of orbital interaction is considerable and increases from Th4+to Pu4+. A decomposition of orbital contributions applying the extended transition state-natural orbital chemical valence method points out the significant π-donation from the oxygen donor centers to the electron-poor actinide ion. Molecular orbital analysis suggests an increasing trend of orbital mixing in the context of 5f orbital participation across the tetravalent An series (Th-Pu). However, the corresponding overlap integral is found to be smaller than in the case of 6d orbital participation. An analysis of the results from the aforementioned electronic structure methods indicates that such orbital participation possibly arises due to the energy matching of ligand and metal orbitals and carries the signature of near-degeneracy driven covalency.},

  abstract     = {In an earlier study of benzene, Small and Head-Gordon found that the spin-coupled generalized valence bond (SCGVB) wave function for the π system predicted a distorted (non-D6h) geometry, one with alternating CC bond lengths. However, the variations in the energy were very small and the predictions were made using a very small basis set (STO-3G). We re-examined this prediction using a much larger basis set (aug-cc-pVTZ) to determine the dependence of the energy of benzene on the distortion angle, ΔθCXC(ΔθCXC= 0° corresponds to the D6hstructure). We also found a distorted geometry with the optimum ΔθCXCbeing 0.31° with an energy 0.040 kcal mol−1lower than that for the D6hstructure. In the optimum geometry, adjacent CC bond lengths are 1.3861 Å and 1.4004 Å. Analysis of the SCGVB wave function led us to conclude that the cause of the unusual non-D6hgeometry predicted by the SCGVB calculations seems to be a result of the interaction between the Kekulé and Dewar components of the full SCGVB wave function. The addition of doubly ionic configurations to the SCGVB wave function leads to the prediction of a D6hgeometry for benzene and a dependence on ΔθCXCessentially the same as that predicted by the complete active space self-consistent field wave function.},

  abstract     = {Anionic species of aspartic acid, Asp−, having a zwitterionic backbone and a deprotonated side chain, appears to be a good example for analyzing dipole-ion and ion pair interactions. Density functional theory calculations were herein performed to investigate the low energy conformers of Asp−embedded in a dielectric continuum modeling an aqueous environment, through a scan of the potential energy as a function of the side chain (χ1,χ2) torsion angles. The most energetically favorable conformers having g+g−and g−g+side chain orientations are found to be stabilized by charge-enhanced intramolecular H-bonding involving the positively charged () and the two negatively charged (COO−) groups. These conformers were further used to analyze Asp−+ nW clusters (W: water,n= 1 or 3), and Asp−/Asp−pair formation. COO−groups were found to be the most attractive sites for hosting a water molecule (binding energy: −6.0 ± 1.5 kcal/mol), compared togroups (binding energy: −4.7 ± 1.1 kcal/mol). Energy separation between g+g−and g−g+conformers increases upon explicit hydration. Asp−/Asp−ion pairs, stabilized by the interaction between thegroup of a partner and the COO−group of the other, shows a quite constant binding energy (−8.1 ± 0.2 kcal/mol), whatever the pair type, and the relative orientation of the two interacting partners. This study suggests a first step to achieve a more realistic image of intermolecular interactions in aqueous environment, especially upon increasing concentration. It can also be considered as a preliminary attempt to assess the interactions of the Lys+…Asp−/Glu−ion pairs stabilizing intra- and interchain interactions in proteins.},

In addition to the catalyst structure, we studied reaction mechanisms using free energy diagrams that explain the product selectivity with respect to the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. Furthermore, we developed scaling relations between all the active C bound intermediate species with ΔG(CO*)and O bound species with ΔG(OH*)The limiting potential lines with ΔG(OH*)as the descriptor are much less negative compared toULlines with ΔG(CO*)as the descriptor indicating that catalyst materials following pathways via OH− bound intermediate species require more negative potentials than CO*→ HCO* and CO2→ COOH* steps to convert into products. We developed thermodynamic volcano plots with two descriptors; the CO* and OH* binding free energies and determined the best catalyst material among the initially investigated catalyst materials expecting this plot will provide guidance to the future work on improving the activity of transition metal-p block catalysts for this important reduction reaction.},

  abstract     = {A new simple and conceptual theoretical scheme is proposed for estimating one-electron excitation energies using Kohn–Sham (KS) solutions. One-electron transitions that are dominated by the promotion from one initially occupied orbital to one unoccupied orbital of a molecular system can be expressed in a two-step process, ionization, and electron attachment. KS with long-range corrected (LC) functionals satisfies Janak&#39;s theorem and LC total energy varies almost linearly as a function of its fractional occupation number between the integer electron points. Thus, LC reproduces ionization energies (IPs) and electron affinities (EAs) with high accuracy and one-electron excitation energies are expressed as the difference between the occupied orbital energy of a neutral molecule and the corresponding unoccupied orbital energy of its cation. Two such expressions can be used, with one employing the orbital energies for the neutral and cationic systems, while the other utilizes orbital energies of just the cation. Because the EA of a molecule is the IP of its anion, if we utilize this identity, the two expressions coincide and give the same excitation energies. Reasonable results are obtained for valence and core excitations using only orbital energies.},

The FMM is utilized for massively parallelized software for molecular dynamics (MD) calculations. However, an inconvenient limitation is imposed on the implementation of the FMM: In three-dimensional case, a cubic MD unit cell is hierarchically divided by the octree partitioning under isotropic periodic boundary conditions along three axes. Here, we extended the FMM algorithm adaptive to a rectangular MD unit cell with different periodicity along the axes by applying an anisotropic hierarchical partitioning. The algorithm was implemented into the parallelized general-purpose MD calculation software designed for a system with uniform distribution of point charges in the unit cell. The partition tree can be a mixture of binary and ternary branches, the branches being chosen arbitrarily with respect to the coordinate axes at any levels. Errors in the calculated electrostatic interactions are discussed in detail for a selected partition tree structure. The extension enables us to execute MD calculations under more general conditions for the shape of the unit cell, partition tree, and boundary conditions, keeping the accuracy of the calculated electrostatic interactions as high as that with the conventional FMM. An extension of the present FMM algorithm to other prime number branches, such as 5 and 7, is straightforward.},

We found from the detailed analysis of the projected density of states that the 3p states of phosphorus atoms contribute significantly at the bottom of the conduction band. As a result, the collapse of the band gap occurs due to changes in the electronic structure of FePS3induced by relative displacements of phosphorus or sulfur atoms along thec-axis direction under pressure.},

Molecular dynamics studies of hydrogen interactions with Fe─C steels provide fundamental information about the behavior of hydrogen at microstructural length scales, although such studies have not been performed due to the lack of an Fe─C─H ternary interatomic potential. In this work, the literature on interatomic potentials related to the Fe─C─H systems are reviewed with the aim of constructing an Fe─C─H potential from the published binary potentials. We found that Fe─C, Fe─H, and C─H bond order potentials exist and can be combined to construct an Fe─C─H ternary potential. Therefore, we constructed two such Fe─C─H potentials and demonstrate that these ternary potentials can reasonably capture hydrogen effects on deformation characteristics and deformation mechanisms for a variety of microstructural variations of the Fe─C steels, including martensite that results from γ to α phase transformation, and pearlite that results from the eutectic formation of the Fe3C cementite compound.},

To examine the reliability of M06-2X DFT functional, a few representative systems are also examined with complete basis set CBS-QB3 method and CCSD-aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory. The cyclopropane systems can bind to one Li+ion; however, the corresponding the methylated systems can bind with two Li+ions. The cyclopropane systems can adsorb six hydrogen molecules with an average binding energy of 3.8 kcal/mol.

The carbon dioxide showed ~3–4 kcal/mol better binding energy as compared to carbon monoxide and hence such designed systems can function as a potential candidate for the separation of these flue gas molecules.

All aromatic molecules were found to exhibit strong intermolecular binding energies with the inner surface of the CNT, rather than the outer surface. Hydrogen bonding between two aromatic molecules that include N and O atoms is shown to further stabilize the intermolecular adsorption process. Therefore, when benzophenone and diphenylamine were simultaneously allowed to interact with a CNT, the aromatic molecules were expected to preferably enter the CNT. Furthermore, additional calculations of the intermolecular adsorption energy for aniline adsorbed on a graphene surface showed that the concavity of graphene-like carbon sheet is in proportion to the intermolecular binding energy between the graphene-like carbon sheet and the aromatic molecule.},

  abstract     = {The popular method of calculating the noncovalent interaction energies at the coupled-cluster single-, double-, and perturbative triple-excitations [CCSD(T)] theory level in the complete basis set (CBS) limit was to add a CCSD(T) correction term to the CBS second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2). The CCSD(T) correction term is the difference between the CCSD(T) and MP2 interaction energies evaluated in a medium basis set. However, the CCSD(T) calculations with the medium basis sets are still very expensive for systems with more than 30 atoms. Comparatively, the domain-based local pair natural orbital coupled-cluster method [DLPNO-CCSD(T)] can be applied to large systems with over 1,000 atoms. Considering both the computational accuracy and efficiency, in this work, we propose a new scheme to calculate the CCSD(T)/CBS interaction energies. In this scheme, the MP2/CBS term keeps intact and the CCSD(T) correction term is replaced by a DLPNO-CCSD(T) correction term which is the difference between the DLPNO-CCSD(T) and DLPNO-MP2 interaction energies evaluated in a medium basis set. The interaction energies of the noncovalent systems in the S22, HSG, HBC6, NBC10, and S66 databases were recalculated employing this new scheme. The consistent and tight settings of the truncation parameters for DLPNO-CCSD(T) and DLPNO-MP2 in this noncanonical CCSD(T)/CBS calculations lead to the maximum absolute deviation and root-mean-square deviation from the canonical CCSD(T)/CBS interaction energies of less than or equal to 0.28 kcal/mol and 0.09 kcal/mol, respectively. The high accuracy and low cost of this new computational scheme make it an excellent candidate for the study of large noncovalent systems.},

Furthermore, the algorithm described and implemented is characterized by the same computational cost scaling as that of the ground state algorithm employed for MP2 and double hybrids.},

  abstract     = {Advances to the distributed, multi-core and fully cross-platform QuBiLS-MIDAS software v2.0 (http://tomocomd.com/qubils-midas) are reported in this article since the v1.0 release. The QuBiLS-MIDAS software is the only one that computes atom-pair and alignment-free geometrical MDs (3D-MDs) from several distance metrics other than the Euclidean distance, as well as alignment-free 3D-MDs that codify structural information regarding the relations among three and four atoms of a molecule. The most recent features added to the QuBiLS-MIDAS software v2.0 are related (a) to the calculation of atomic weightings from indices based on the vertex-degree invariant (e.g., Alikhanidi index); (b) to consider central chirality during the molecular encoding; (c) to use measures based on clustering methods and statistical functions to codify structural information among more than two atoms; (d) to the use of a novel method based on fuzzy membership functions to spherically truncate inter-atomic relations; and (e) to the use of weighted and fuzzy aggregation operators to compute global 3D-MDs according to the importance and/or interrelation of the atoms of a molecule during the molecular encoding. Moreover, a novel module to compute QuBiLS-MIDAS 3D-MDs from their headings was also developed. This module can be used either by the graphical user interface or by means of the software library. By using the library, both the predictive models built with the QuBiLS-MIDAS 3D-MDs and the QuBiLS-MIDAS 3D-MDs calculation can be embedded in other tools. A set of predefined QuBiLS-MIDAS 3D-MDs with high information content and low redundancy on a set comprised of 20,469 compounds is also provided to be employed in further cheminformatics tasks. This set of predefined 3D-MDs evidenced better performance than all the universe of Dragon (v5.5) and PaDEL 0D-to-3D MDs in variability studies, whereas a linear independence study proved that these QuBiLS-MIDAS 3D-MDs codify chemical information orthogonal to the Dragon 0D-to-3D MDs. This set of predefined 3D-MDs would be periodically updated as long as new results be achieved. In general, this report highlights our continued efforts to provide a better tool for a most suitable characterization of compounds, and in this way, to contribute to obtaining better outcomes in future applications.},

  abstract     = {We present a new assessment of the Fermi-Löwdin orbital self-interaction correction (FLO-SIC) approach with an emphasis on its performance for predicting energies as a function of fractional occupation numbers (FONs) for various multielectron systems. Our approach is implemented in the massively parallelized NWChem quantum chemistry software package and has been benchmarked on the prediction of total energies, atomization energies, and ionization potentials of small molecules and relatively large aromatic systems. Within our study, we also derive an alternate expression for the FLO-SIC energy gradient expressed in terms of gradients of the Fermi-orbital eigenvalues and revisit how the FLO-SIC methodology can be seen as a constrained unitary transformation of the canonical Kohn–Sham orbitals. Finally, we conclude with calculations of energies as a function of FONs using various SIC-scaling methods to test the limits of the FLO-SIC formalism on a variety of multielectron systems. We find that these relatively simple scaling methods do improve the prediction of total energies of atomic systems as well as enhance the accuracy of energies as a function of FONs for other multielectron chemical species.},

Indeed, there are many examples in which the halogen and hydrogen bond coexist in the same structure and, if a correct bond analysis is required, their separation is mandatory. Here, the advantages and limitations of coupling the charge displacement analysis with natural orbital for chemical valence method (NOCV-CD) to separately analyze orthogonal weak interactions are shown, for both symmetric and asymmetric adducts. The methodology gives optimal results with intermolecular adducts but, in the presence of an organometallic complex, also intramolecular interactions can be correctly analyzed. Beyond the methodological aspects, it is shown that correctly separate and quantify the interactions can give interesting chemical insights about the systems.},

Consequently, binding site models that include at least three adjacent nucleotides are required to consistently predict converged binding energies. The computationally inexpensive HF-3c method is shown to provide reliable interaction energies and can be routinely applied to such large models.},

Piskorz, and G. Liu,J. Chem. Phys.1997,107, 6,804], provides a straightforward way to calculate the ionization potentials (IPs) as an one electron quantity. However, such an EKT-MP2 method often suffers from the negative occupation problem, failing to provide the complete IP spectra for a system of interest. Here a small positive number scheme is proposed to cure this problem so as to remove the associated unphysical results. In order to obtain an in-depth physical interpretation of the EKT-MP2 method, we introduce a Koopmans-type quantity, named KT-MP2, based on which the respective contribution from the relaxation and the correlation parts in the EKT-MP2 results are recognized. Furthermore, the close relationship between the EKT-MP2 method and the derivative approach of the MP2 energy with respect to the orbital occupation numbers [N. Q. Su and X. Xu,J. Chem. Theory Comput.2015,11, 4,677] is revealed. When these MP2-based methods are applied to a set of atoms and molecules, new insights are gained on the role played by the relaxation and the correlation effects in the electron ionization processes.},

  abstract     = {Analyzing the behavior of potential energy surfaces (PESs) of diabatic excited states (ESs) becomes of crucial importance for a complete understanding of complex photochemical reactions. Since the definition of a compact representation for the transition density matrix, the use of the natural transition orbitals (NTOs) has become a routine practice in time-dependent density functional theory calculations. Their popularity has remarkably grown due to its simple orbital description of electronic excitations. Indeed, very recently, we have presented a new formalism used for the optimization of ESs by tracking the state of interest computing the NTO&#39;s overlap between consecutive steps of the procedure. In this new contribution, we generalize the use of this NTO&#39;s overlap-based state-tracking formalism for the analysis of all the desired diabatic states along any chemical reaction pathway. Determining the PES of the different diabatic states has been automatized by developing an extension of our recently presented algorithm, the so-called SDNTO: “Steepest Descent minimization using NTOs.” This automatized overlap-based procedure allows an agile and convenient analysis of the evolution of the ESs avoiding the intrinsic ambiguity of visualizing orbitals or comparing physical observables. The analysis of two photochemical reactions of the same nature with different PES landscapes perfectly illustrates the utility of this new tool.},

First, we applied the recently proposed mixed-spin Hamiltonian method to locate spin-inversion structures between different total spin multiplicities. Nine spin-inversion structures were successfully optimized for the singlet–triplet, singlet–quintet, triplet–quintet, and quintet–septet spin-inversion processes. We found that the singlet–triplet spin-inversion points are located around the potential energy surface region at short Fe–O distances, whereas the singlet–quintet and quintet–septet spin-inversion points are located at longer Fe–O distances. This suggests that both narrow and broad crossing models play roles in O2binding to the Fe-porphyrin complex. To further understand spin-inversion mechanisms, we performed on-the-fly Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics calculations. The reaction coordinates, which are correlated to the spin-inversion dynamics between different spin multiplicities, are also discussed.},

  abstract     = {The simulation of X-ray emission spectra of organic molecules using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is explored. TDDFT calculations using standard hybrid exchange-correlation functionals in conjunction with large basis sets can predict accurate X-ray emission spectra provided an energy shift is applied to align the spectra with experiment. The relaxation of the orbitals in the intermediate state is an important factor, and neglect of this relaxation leads to considerably poorer predicted spectra. A short-range corrected functional is found to give emission energies that required a relatively small energy shift to align with experiment. However, increasing the amount of Hartree–Fock exchange in this functional to remove the need for any energy shift led to a deterioration in the quality of the calculated spectral profile. To predict accurate spectra without reference to experimental measurements, we use the CAM-B3LYP functional with the energy scale determined with reference to a Δself-consistent field calculation for the highest energy emission transition.},

The presence of a conical intersection close to the Franck–Condon point is identified based on the critical examination of computed energetics and structural parameters of stationary points. We show that very minimal displacements of relevant atoms of intramolecular proton transfer geometry are adequate to drive the molecule toward the conical intersection nuclear configuration. The evolving wavepacket onS1(ππ*) bifurcates at the conical intersection: a part of the wavepacket moves toS2(nπ*) within a few femtoseconds while the other decays toS1minimum. Our findings indicate the possibility of forming the proton transfer tautomer product viaS2(nπ*), competing with the traditional pathway occurring onS1(ππ*).},

To improve the computational efficiency, we here develop two new nonpolarizable water models (with flexible bonds and fixed charges) that are compatible with AMOEBA solute: the 3-site AW3C and 5-site AW5C. To derive the force-field parameters for AW3C and AW5C, we fit to six experimental liquid thermodynamic properties: liquid density, enthalpy of vaporization, dielectric constant, isobaric heat capacity, isothermal compressibility and thermal expansion coefficient, at a broad range of temperatures from 261.15 to 353.15 K under 1.0 atm pressure. We further validate our AW3C and AW5C water models by showing that they can well reproduce the radial distribution functiong(r), self-diffusion constantD, and hydration free energy from the AMOEBA03 water model and the experimental observations. Furthermore, we show that our AW3C and AW5C water models can greatly accelerate (&gt;5 times) the bulk water as well as biomolecular simulations when compared to AMOEBA water. Specifically, we demonstrate that the applications of AW3C and AW5C water models to simulate a DNA duplex lead to a threefold acceleration, and in the meanwhile well maintain the structural properties as the fully polarizable AMOEBA water. We expect that our AW3C and AW5C water models hold great promise to be widely applied to simulate complex bio-molecules using the AMOEBA force field.},

The transformation manifests the formation of aπdelocalization along the disordered Cu-N network, thus resulting in a semiconductor–metal transition. The estimated heat of formation of the amorphous polymeric nitrogen system is comparable to conventional high-energy-density materials.

The obtained methods are denoted as dRPA75-NL and SOSEX75-NL, and the corresponding short-range attenuation parameters are fitted with the large aug-cc-pV5Z basis set against the S66 dataset. Therefore, the dRPA75-NL method overcomes the error cancellation problem of the dRPA75 method with the relatively small aug-cc-pVTZ basis set for noncovalent interactions. Based on our benchmark computations, the dRPA75-NL and SOSEX75-NL methods perform very well on evaluating noncovalent interaction energies. Compared with the double-hybrid density functionals (DHDFs) of DSD-PBEP86-NL and DOD-PBEP86-NL, the dRPA75-NL and SOSEX75-NL methods perform much better on charge transfer interactions. Furthermore, the SOSEX75-NL method also gives insight into the development of computational methods for both closed-shell and open-shell noncovalent interactions. In summary, our computations demonstrate that even the full dRPA and SOSEX correlations still need additional dispersion corrections for noncovalent interactions.},

As we showed recently (Borocci et al.,J. Comput. Chem., 2019, 40, 2318–2328), the DoP is a quantitative index that is generally informative about the role of polarization (induction plus charge transfer [CT]) and dispersion in noncovalent noble gas complexes. As further evidence in this regard, we presently ascertained quantitative correlations between the DoP(He) of the He(M) and indices based on the electron densityρ(r), including the molecular electrostatic potential at the HeM bond critical point, as well as the percentage contributions of induction and dispersion to the SAPT binding energies. Based also on the explicit evaluation of the CT, accomplished through the study of the charge-displacement function, we derived a quantitative scale that ranks the He(M) according to their dispersive, inductive, and CT bonding character. Our taken approach could be conceivably extended to other types of noncovalent complexes.},

  abstract     = {Alchemically derived free energies are artifacted when the perturbed moiety has a nonzero net charge. The source of the artifacts lies in the effective treatment of the electrostatic interactions within and between the perturbed atoms and remaining (partial) charges in the simulated system. To treat the electrostatic interactions effectively, lattice-summation (LS) methods or cutoff schemes in combination with a reaction-field contribution are usually employed. Both methods render the charging component of the calculated free energies sensitive to essential parameters of the system like the cutoff radius or the box side lengths. Here, we discuss the results of three previously published studies of ligand binding. These studies presented estimates of binding free energies that were artifacted due to the charged nature of the ligands. We show that the size of the artifacts can be efficiently calculated and raw simulation data can be corrected. We compare the corrected results with experimental estimates and nonartifacted estimates from path-sampling methods. Although the employed correction scheme involves computationally demanding continuum-electrostatics calculations, we show that the correction estimate can be deduced from a small sample of configurations rather than from the entire ensemble. This observation makes the calculations of correction terms feasible for complex biological systems. To show the general applicability of the proposed procedure, we also present results where the correction scheme was used to correct independent free energies obtained from simulations employing a cutoff scheme or LS electrostatics. In this work, we give practical guidelines on how to apply the appropriate corrections easily.},

Inspired by the selenization strategy can promote anisotropic charge carrier migration, and selenium-containing compounds have been proved to be promising materials as OSCs both for hole and electron transfer. Herein, we now explore the anisotropic transport properties of the series of selenium-containing compounds. For the compound containing SeSe bond, the SeSe bond will break when attaching an electron, thus those compounds cannot act as n-type OSCs. About the different isomer compounds with conjugated structure, the charge transfer will be affected by the stacking of the conjugated structures. The analysis of chemical structure and charge transfer property indicates that Se-containing materials are promising high-performance OSCs and might be used as p-type, n-type, or ambipolar OSCs. Furthermore, the symmetry of the selenium-containing OSCs will affect the type of OSCs. In addition, there is no direct relationship between the R groups with their performance, whether it or not as p-type OSCs or n-types. This work demonstrates the relationship between the optoelectronic function and structure of selenium-containing OSCs materials and hence paves the way to design and improve optoelectronic function of OSCs materials.},

  abstract     = {Accurate force-field (FF) parameters are key to reliable prediction of properties obtained from molecular modeling (MM) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. With ever-widening applicability of MD simulations, robust parameters need to be generated for a wider range of chemical species. The CHARMM General Force Field program (CGenFF,https://cgenff.umaryland.edu/) is a tool for obtaining initial parameters for a given small molecule based on analogy with the available CGenFF parameters. However, improvement of these parameters is often required and performing their optimization remains tedious and time consuming. In addition, tools for optimization of small molecule parameters in the context of the Drude polarizable FF are not yet available. To overcome these issues, the FFParam package has been designed to facilitate the parametrization process. The package includes a graphical user interface (GUI) created using Qt libraries. FFParam supports Gaussian and Psi4 for performing quantum mechanical calculations and CHARMM and OpenMM for MM calculations. A Monte Carlo simulated annealing (MCSA) algorithm has been implemented for automated fitting of partial atomic charge, atomic polarizabilities and Thole scale parameters. The LSFITPAR program is called for automated fitting of bonded parameters. Accordingly, FFParam provides all the features required for generation and analysis of CHARMM and Drude FF parameters for small molecules. FFParam-GUI includes a text editor, graph plotter, molecular visualization, and text to table converter to meet various requirements of the parametrization process. It is anticipated that FFParam will facilitate wider use of CGenFF as well as promote future use of the Drude polarizable FF.},

The results show that CC3-R has varied capacities to capture these halogens at ambient and high temperatures, so that the thermal release of fluorine is completed with increasing temperature up to around 70°C and chlorine molecules remain at the CC3-R surface up to 100°C and all bromine molecules are removed from the CC3-R surface at 200°C. We found that bromine self-diffusion was almost independent of temperature between 0 and 100°C in contrast to fluorine and chlorine.

  abstract     = {We derived a new expression for the electrostatic interaction of three-dimensional charge-neutral systems with two-dimensional periodic boundary conditions (slab geometry) using a fast multipole method (FMM). Contributions from all the image cells are expressed as a sum of real and reciprocal space terms, and a self-interaction term. The reciprocal space contribution consists of two parts: zero and nonzero terms of the absolute value of the reciprocal lattice vector. To test the new expressions, electrostatic interactions were calculated for a randomly placed charge distribution in a cubic box and liquid water produced by molecular dynamics calculation. The accuracy could be controlled by the degree of expansion of the FMM. In the present expression, the computational complexity of the electrostatic interaction ofN-particle systems is orderN, which is superior to that of the conventional two-dimensional periodic Ewald method for a slab geometry and the particle mesh Ewald method with a large empty space at an interface of the unit cell. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract     = {The treatment of the solvation charges using Gaussian functions in the polarizable continuum model results in a smooth potential energy surface. These charges are placed on top of the surface of the solute cavity. In this article, we study the effect of the solute cavity (van der Waals-type or solvent-excluded surface-type) using the Gaussian charge scheme within the framework of the conductor-like polarizable continuum model on (a) the accuracy and computational cost of the self-consistent field (SCF) energy and its gradient and on (b) the calculation of free energies of solvation. For that purpose, we have considered a large set of systems ranging from few atoms to more than 200 atoms in different solvents. Our results at the DFT level using the B3LYP functional and the def2-TZVP basis set show that the choice of the solute cavity does neither affect the accuracy nor the cost of calculations for small systems (&lt; 100 atoms). For larger systems, the use of a vdW-type cavity is recommended, as it prevents small oscillations in the gradient (present when using a SES-type cavity), which affect the convergence of the SCF energy gradient. Regarding the free energies of solvation, we consider a solvent-dependent probe sphere to construct the solvent-accessible surface area required to calculate the nonelectrostatic contribution to the free energy of solvation. For this part, our results for a large set of organic molecules in different solvents agree with available experimental data with an accuracy lower than 1 kcal/mol for both polar and nonpolar solvents.},

  abstract     = {The effect of a varying, directionalEx,Ey, andEzelectric field on the ethene molecule was investigated using next-generation quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM). Despite using lowE-field strengths that are within the realm of experiment and do not measurably alter the molecular geometry, significant changes to the QTAIM properties were observed. Using conventional QTAIM, the shifting of the C─C and C─H bond critical points (BCPs) demonstrates polarization through an interchange in the size of the atoms involved in a bond, since aBCPis located on the boundary between a pair of bonded atoms. Next-generation QTAIM, however, demonstrates the polarization effect more directly with a change in morphology of the 3-D envelope around theBCP. Modest increases of ≈ 2\% in the ellipticityεof theBCPwere uncovered when the C─C bond was aligned parallel or anti-parallel to the appliedEx-field. Significant asymmetries were found in the response of the next-generation QTAIM 3-D paths of the C─H bonds to the appliedE-field. When theE-field coincided with the C─C bond, theBCPmoved in response and was accompanied by the envelope constructed from 3-D next-generation paths. The response displayed a polarization effect that increased with increasing magnitude of theEx-field parallel and anti-parallel to the C─C bond. Our analysis demonstrates that next-generation QTAIM is a useful tool for understanding the response of molecules toE-fields, for example, for the screening of molecular wires for the design of molecular electronic devices. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract     = {We describe the first extensive energetic evaluation of GPCR dimerization on the atomistic level by means of potential of mean force (PMF) computations and implicit solvent/implicit membrane end-point free energy calculations (MM-PBSA approach). Free energies of association computed from the PMFs show that the formation of both the 1/8 and 4/5 interface is energetically favorable for TGR5, the first GPCR known to be activated by hydrophobic bile acids and neurosteroids. Furthermore, formation of the 1/8 interface is favored over that of the 4/5 interface. Both results are in line with our previous FRET experiments in live cells. Differences in lipid-protein interactions are identified to contribute to the observed differences in free energies of association. A per-residue decomposition of the MM-PBSA effective binding energy reveals hot spot residues specific for both interfaces that form clusters. This knowledge may be used to guide the design of dimerization inhibitors or perform mutational studies to explore physiological consequences of distorted TGR5 association. Finally, we characterized the role of Y111, located in the conserved (D/E)RY motif, as a facilitator of TGR5 interactions. The types of computations performed here should be transferable to other transmembrane proteins that form dimers or higher oligomers as long as good structural models of the dimeric or oligomeric states are available. Such computations may help to overcome current restrictions due to an imperfect energetic representation of protein association at the coarse-grained level. © 2019 The Authors.Journal of Computational Chemistrypublished by Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

  abstract     = {Obtaining reactivity information from the molecular electronic structure of a chemical system is a computationally intensive process. As a way of probing reactivity information around that, there exist electron density response variables, such as the Fukui functions (FFs), which are well-established descriptors that summarize the local susceptibility to react. These properties only require few single-point quantum chemical calculations, but even then, the intrinsic high cost and unfavorable computational complexity with respect to the number of atoms in the system makes this approach available only to small fragments and systems. In this study, we explore the computation of FFs, showing that semiempirical quantum chemical methods can be used to obtain the reactivity information equivalent to that of a Density Functional Theory (DFT) functional, for the eight entire polypeptide chains. The combination of semiempirical methods with the frozen orbital approximation allows for the obtention of these reactivity descriptors for biological systems with reasonable accuracy and speed, unlocking the utilization of these methods for such systems. These results for the frozen orbital approximation can be additionally improved when other molecular orbitals from the frontier band are employed in the computation. We also show the potential of this computational protocol in the ligand–protein complexes of HIV-1 protease, predicting which of those ligands are active inhibitors.},

  abstract     = {We calibrate and validate the parameters necessary to represent the dianionic phosphate group (DPG) in molecular mechanics. DPG is an essential fragment of signaling biological molecules and protein-binding ligands. It is a constitutive fragment of biosensors, which bind to the dimer interface of phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI), an intracellular enzyme involved in sugar metabolism, as well as an extracellular protein known as autocrine motility factor (AMF) closely related to metastasis formation. Our long-term objective is to design DPG-based biosensors with enhanced affinities for AMF/PGI cancer biomarker in blood. Molecular dynamics with polarizable potentials could be used toward this aim. This requires to first evaluate the accuracy of such potentials upon representing the interactions of DPG with its PGI ligands and tightly bound water molecules. Such evaluations are done by comparisons with high-level ab initio quantum chemistry (QC) calculations. We focus on the Sum of Interactions Between Fragments Ab initio computed (SIBFA) polarizable molecular mechanics procedure. We present first the results of the DPG calibration. This is followed by comparisons between ΔE(SIBFA) and ΔE(QC) regarding bi-molecular complexes of DPG with the main-chain and side-chain PGI residues, which bind to it in the recognition site. We then consider DPG complexes with an increasing number of PGI residues. The largest QC complexes encompass the entirety of the recognition site, with six structural water molecules totaling up to 211 atoms. A persistent and satisfactory agreement could be shown between ΔE(SIBFA) and ΔE(QC). These validations constitute an essential first step toward large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of DPG-based biosensors bound at the PGI dimer interface. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

This CG FF has a delicate balance between efficiency, accuracy, and transferability and well reproduced the correct structural and thermodynamics properties of pure water and alkane liquids. More importantly, optimized Morse potential was also successfully applied to describe the interactions between water and n-alkanes.

However, machine learning models that have been reported so far require the atomic positions obtained from geometry optimizations using high-level QM/DFT methods as input in order to predict the energies and do not allow for geometry optimization. In this study, a transferable and molecule size-independent machine learning model bonds (B), angles (A), nonbonded (N) interactions, and dihedrals (D) neural network (BAND NN) based on a chemically intuitive representation inspired by molecular mechanics force fields is presented. The model predicts the atomization energies of equilibrium and nonequilibrium structures as sum of energy contributions from bonds (B), angles (A), nonbonds (N), and dihedrals (D) at remarkable accuracy. The robustness of the proposed model is further validated by calculations that span over the conformational, configurational, and reaction space. The transferability of this model on systems larger than the ones in the data set is demonstrated by performing calculations on selected large molecules.

The binding energies for uracil, thymine, cytosine, 5-methylcytosine, adenine, and guanine interacting with the defect-containing nanotube models were compared to the values previously obtained with the same calculation technique for the case of defect-free SWNTs, both in the gas phase (vacuum) and in aqueous medium. For most models, the interaction strength tends to be higher for purine than for pyrimidine complexes, with a clear exception of the systems including ZNT-p, both in vacuum and in aqueous medium. As it could be expected, the binding strength in the latter case is lower as compared to that in vacuum, roughly by 2–4 kcal/mol, due to the implicit inclusion of a medium (i.e., water) via the conductor-like screening model model. The closest contacts between NBs and SWNT models, frontier orbital distribution, and highest-occupied molecular orbital–lowest-unoccupied molecular orbital gap energies are analyzed as well. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract     = {Using the analytic derivatives approach, dipole moments of high-level density-fitted coupled-cluster (CC) methods, such as coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD), and coupled-cluster singles and doubles with perturbative triples [CCSD(T)], are presented. To obtain the high accuracy results, the computed dipole moments are extrapolated to the complete basis set (CBS) limits applying focal-point approximations. Dipole moments of the CC methods considered are compared with the experimental gas-phase values, as well as with the common DFT functionals, such as B3LYP, BP86, M06-2X, and BLYP. For all test sets considered, the CCSD(T) method provides substantial improvements over Hartree–Fock (HF), by 0.076–0.213 D, and its mean absolute errors are lower than 0.06 D. Furthermore, our results indicate that even though the performances of the common DFT functionals considered are significantly better than that of HF, their results are not comparable with the CC methods. Our results demonstrate that the CCSD(T)/CBS level of theory provides highly-accurate dipole moments, and its quality approaching the experimental results. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The first-principles calculations of HfS2-based nanotubes are made for the first time. The symmetry analysis of infrared and Raman active vibrational modes in ZrS2and HfS2nanotubes is made using the induced representations of the isogonal point groups of line groups. It is shown that the number of infrared and Raman active modes is constant for NTs with the same chirality type. The correlation of the phonon modes of the nanotubes of relatively large diameters with those of monolayer is analyzed. The thermodynamic functions of monolayers and nanotubes with various chirality and diameters are calculated on the basis of the obtained phonon frequencies. It is established that the phonon contribution to the nanotube strain energy is small, but may be important for an accurate estimate of the stability of the nanotubes of small diameters. The calculated results show that the thermal contributions to Helmholtz free energy are positive; thereby they slightly reduce the stability of ZrS2and HfS2nanotubes at elevated temperatures. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

In this study, the matrix effects on a single CO2molecule in an argon matrix were investigated with dispersion-corrected density functional theory calculations. Three different guest–host structures were described by bulk models employing periodic boundary conditions as well as cluster models. The calculations were analyzed with respect to structural features of the CO2molecule and its immediate surroundings. Also, the molecule&#39;s harmonic frequencies were determined. The calculated frequencies were in qualitative agreement with experimental observations. The cluster models produced comparable results given that the clusters were large enough to reproduce the structural features of the bulk model. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The running performance on a single processor reached 15.1\% of its theoretical peak at highest. The longitudinal dimension of the simulated system is far beyond the range with scale-dependent properties, while the lateral dimension significantly exceeds the experimentally measurable range.

Multiple BPMFs can be used to rigorously compute binding affinities between flexible partners. AlGDock uses replica exchange between thermodynamic states at different temperatures and receptor–ligand interaction strengths. Receptor–ligand interaction energies are represented by interpolating precomputed grids. Thermodynamic states are adaptively initialized and adjusted on-the-fly to maintain adequate replica exchange rates. In demonstrative calculations, when the bound ligand is treated as fully solvated, AlGDock estimates BPMFs with a precision within 4 kT in 65\% and within 8 kT for 91\% of systems. It correctly identifies the native binding pose in 83\% of simulations. Performance is sometimes limited by subtle differences in the important configuration space of sampled and targeted thermodynamic states. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The performance of broken symmetry (BS) single-determinant ab initio (Hartree–Fock, Møller–Plesset perturbation theory to the second and third orders, coupled clusters singles and doubles) and density functional theory (BLYP, B3LYP, B3LYP-D3, B2PLYP, MPW2PLYP) methods is compared to multideterminant ab initio (CASSCF, NEVPT2) methods as well as to the multipole model of charge density from a single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiment (Herich et al., Acta Cryst. 2018, B74, 681–692). In vacuo DFT geometry optimizations (improper axial water ligand orientation) are compared against the periodic ones. The singlet state is found to be energetically preferred.Jcoupling of (I) becomes underestimated for all ab initio methods used, when compared to experiment. It is concluded that the strength of the direct M─M interactions correlates closely with theJcoupling magnitude at a given level of theory.

Although all the combinations show artificial double-cone structure of conical intersection between ground and first excited states, simulated quantum yields and lifetimes are in good agreement with one another; 0.6 (±5\%) and 40.5 fs (±10\%) by TD-B3LYP, 0.5 (±10\%) and 35.5 fs (±4\%) by TD-BHandHLYP, and 0.44 (±9\%) and 35.2 fs (±10\%) by TD-CAM-B3LYP.

We study this important method from a theoretical point of view. The understanding of the proposers does not use the barrier breakdown point of the AFIR parameter, which usually is half of the reaction path between the minimum and the transition state which is searched for. Based on a comparison with the theory of Newton trajectories, we could better understand the method. It allows us to follow along some reaction pathways from minimum to saddle point, or vice versa. We discuss some well-known two-dimensional test surfaces where we calculate full AFIR pathways. If one has special AFIR curves at hand, one can also study the behavior of the ansatz. © 2019 The Authors.Journal of Computational Chemistrypublished by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract     = {Key to progress in molecular simulation is the development of advanced models that go beyond the limitations of traditional force fields that employ a fixed, point charge-based description of electrostatics. Taking water as an example system, the FFLUX framework is shown capable of producing models that are flexible, polarizable and have a multipolar description of the electrostatics. The kriging machine-learning methods used in FFLUX are able to reproduce the intramolecular potential energy surface and multipole moments of a single water molecule with chemical accuracy using as few as 50 training configurations. Molecular dynamics simulations of water clusters (25–216 molecules) using the new FFLUX model reveal that incorporating charge-quadrupole, dipole–dipole, and quadrupole–charge interactions into the description of the electrostatics results in significant changes to the intermolecular structuring of the water molecules. © 2019 The Authors.Journal of Computational Chemistrypublished by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract     = {Determination of the ligand-binding affinity is an extremely interesting problem. Normally, the free energy perturbation (FEP) method provides an appropriate result. However, it is of great interest to improve the accuracy and precision of this method. In this context, temperature replica exchange molecular dynamics implementation of the FEP computational approach, which we call replica exchange free energy perturbation (REP) was proposed. In particular, during REP simulations, the system can easily escape from being trapped in local minima by exchanging configurations with high temperatures, resulting in significant improvement in the accuracy and precision of protein–ligand binding affinity calculations. The distribution of the decoupling free energy was enlarged, and its mean values were decreased. This results in changes in the magnitude of the calculated binding free energies as well as in alteration in the binding mechanism. Moreover, the REP correlation coefficient with respect to experiment (RREP= 0.85 ± 0.15) is significantly boosted in comparison with the FEP one (RFEP= 0.64 ± 0.30). Furthermore, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of REP is also smaller than FEP,RMSEREP= 4.28 ± 0.69versusRMSEFEP= 5.80 ± 1.11kcal/mol, respectively. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract     = {Bioluminescence in marine systems is dominated by the use of coelenterazine for light production. The bioluminescent reaction of coelenterazine is an enzyme catalyzed oxidative decarboxylation: coelenterazine reacts with molecular oxygen to form carbon dioxide, coelenteramide, and light. One such class is the Ca2+-regulated photoproteins. These proteins bind coelenterazine and oxygen, and trap 2-hydroperoxycoelenterazine, an intermediate along the reaction pathway. The reaction is halted until Ca2+binding triggers the completion of the reaction. There are currently no reported experimental, atomistic descriptions of this ternary Michaelis complex. This study utilized computational techniques to develop an atomistic model of the Michaelis complex. Extensive molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to study the interactions between four tautomeric/protonation states of coelenterazine and wide-type and mutant obelin. Only minor differences in binding modes were observed across all systems. Interestingly, no basic residues were identified in the vicinity of the N7-nitrogen of coelenterazine. This observation was surprising considering that deprotonation at this position is a key mechanistic step in the proposed bioluminescent reaction. This work suggests that coelenterazine binds either as the O10H tautomer, or in the deprotonated form. Implicit ligand sampling simulations were used to identify potential O2binding and migration pathways within obelin. A key oxygen binding site was identified close to the coelenterazine imidazopyrazinone core. The O2binding free energy was observed to be dependent on the protonation state of coelenterazine. Taken together, the description of the obelin–coelenterazine-O2complexes established in this study provides the basis for future computational studies of the bioluminescent mechanism. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Here we seek to expand the current-flow scheme to study allosteric regulations involving protein–protein binding. Specifically, we investigated three gain-of-function mutations located at the binding interface of ALK2 (also known as ACVR1) kinase and its inhibitory protein FKBP12. We first searched for the optimal smoothing function for contact network construction and then calculated the subnetwork between FKBP12 protein and the kinase ATP binding site using current-flow betweenness. By comparing the networks between the wild-type and three mutants, we have identified statistically significant changes in the protein–protein networks that are common among all three mutants that allosterically shift the kinase toward a catalytically competent configuration. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

This is highlighted in the review of recent findings from our collaborative investigations of molecular mechanisms of TMEM16 scramblases that emerged from iterative functional, structural, and computational experimentation. In the context of this review, we present new MD simulations and trajectory analyses motivated by the fact that new structural information about the TMEM16 scramblases is emerging from cryo-EM determinations in lipid nanodiscs. Because the functional environment of these proteins inin vivoand inin vitrois closer to flat membranes, we studied comparatively the responses of the membrane to the TMEM16 proteins in flat membranes and nanodiscs. We find that bilayer shapes in the nanodiscs are very different from those observed in the flat membrane systems, but the function-related slanting of the membrane observed at the nhTMEM16 boundary with the protein is similar in the nanodiscs and in the flat bilayers. This changes, however, in the bilayer composed of longer-tail lipids, which is thicker near the phospholipid translocation pathway, which may reflect an enhanced tendency of the long tails to penetrate the pathway and create, as shown previously, a nonconductive environment. These findings support the correspondence between the mechanistic involvement of the lipid environment in the flat membranes, and the nanodiscs. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract     = {Themeroperon in bacteria encodes a set of proteins and enzymes that impart resistance to environmental mercury toxicity by importing Hg2+and reducing it to volatile Hg(0). Because the reduction occurs in the cytoplasm, mercuric ions must first be transported across the cytoplasmic membrane by one of a few known transporters. MerF is the smallest of these, containing only two transmembrane helices and two pairs of vicinal cysteines that coordinate mercuric ions. In this work, we use molecular dynamics simulations to characterize the dynamics of MerF in its apo and Hg2+-bound states. We find that the apo state positions one of the cysteine pairs closer to the periplasmic side of the membrane, while in the bound state the same pair approaches the cytoplasmic side. This finding is consistent with the functional requirement of accepting Hg2+from the periplasmic space, sequestering it on acceptance, and transferring it to the cytoplasm. Conformational changes in the TM helices facilitate the functional interaction of the two cysteine pairs. Free-energy calculations provide a barrier of 16 kcal/mol for the association of the periplasmic Hg2+-bound protein MerP with MerF and 7 kcal/mol for the subsequent association of MerF&#39;s two cysteine pairs. Despite the significant conformational changes required to move the binding site across the membrane, coarse-grained simulations of multiple copies of MerF support the expectation that it functions as a monomer. Our results demonstrate how conformational changes and binding thermodynamics could lead to such a small membrane protein acting as an ion transporter. Published 2019.

  abstract     = {Hedgehog (Hh) proteins are important components of signal transduction pathways involved in animal development, and their defects are implicated in carcinogenesis. Their N-terminal domain (HhN) acts as a signaling ligand, and their C-terminal domain (HhC) performs an autocatalytic function of cleaving itself away, while adding a cholesterol moiety to HhN. HhC has two sub-domains: a hedgehog/intein (hint) domain that primarily performs the autocatalytic activity, and a sterol-recognition region (SRR) that binds to cholesterol and properly positions it with respect to HhN. The three-dimensional details of this autocatalytic mechanism remain unknown, as does the structure of the precursor Hh protein. In this study, a complete cholesterol-bound precursor form of the drosophila Hh precursor is modeled using known crystal structures of HhN and the hint domain, and a hypothesized similarity of SRR to an unrelated but similar-sized cholesterol binding protein. The restrained geometries and topology switching (RGATS) strategy is then used to predict atomic-detail pathways for the full autocatalytic reaction starting from the precursor and ending in a cholesterol-linked HhN domain and a cleaved HhC domain. The RGATS explicit solvent simulations indicate the roles of individual HhC residues in facilitating the reaction, which can be confirmed through mutational experiments. These simulations also provide plausible structural models for the N/S acyl transfer intermediate and the product states of this reaction. This study thus provides a good framework for future computational and experimental studies to develop a full structural and dynamic understanding of Hh autoprocessing. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract     = {Lipases are essential and widely used biocatalysts. Hence, the production of lipases requires a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanism of its folding and secretion. Lipase A fromPseudomonas aeruginosa,PaLipA, constitutes a prominent example that has additional relevance because of its role as a virulence factor in many diseases.PaLipA requires the assistance of a membrane-integrated steric chaperone, the lipase-specific foldase Lif, to achieve its enzymatically active state. However, the molecular mechanism of how Lif activates its cognate lipase has remained elusive. Here, we show by molecular dynamics simulations at the atomistic level and potential of mean force computations that Lif catalyzes the activation process ofPaLipA by structurally stabilizing an intermediatePaLipA conformation, particularly a β-sheet in the region of residues 17–30, such that the opening ofPaLipA&#39;s lid domain is facilitated. This opening allows substrate access toPaLipA&#39;s catalytic site. A surprising and so far not fully understood aspect of our study is that the open state ofPaLipA is unstable compared to the closed one according to our computational andin vitrobiochemical results. We thus speculate that further interactions ofPaLipA with the Xcp secretion machinery and/or components of the extracellular matrix contribute to the remaining activity of secretedPaLipA. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract     = {The pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of general receptor for phosphoionositides 1 (GRP1-PHD) binds specifically to phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PIP3), and acts as a second messenger. Using an extensive array of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations employing highly mobile membrane mimetic (HMMM) model as well as complementary full membrane simulations, we capture differentiable binding and dynamics of GRP1-PHD in the presence of membranes containing PC, PS, and PIP3lipids in varying compositions. While GRP1-PHD forms only transient interactions with pure PC membranes, incorporation of anionic lipids resulted in stable membrane-bound configurations. We report the first observation of two distinct PIP3binding modes on GRP1-PHD, involving PIP3interactions at a “canonical” and at an “alternate” site, suggesting the possibility of simultaneous binding of multiple anionic lipids. The full membrane simulations confirmed the stability of the membrane bound pose of GRP1-PHD as captured from our HMMM membrane binding simulations. By performing additional steered membrane unbinding simulations and calculating nonequilibrium work associated with the process, as well as metadynamics simulations, on the protein bound to full membranes, allowing for more quantitative examination of the binding strength of the GRP1-PHD to the membrane, we demonstrate that along with the bound PIP3, surrounding anionic PS lipids increase the energetic cost of unbinding of GRP1-PHD from the canonical mode, causing them to dissociate more slowly than the alternate mode. Our results demonstrate that concurrent binding of multiple anionic lipids by GRP1-PHD contributes to its membrane affinity, which in turn control its signaling activity. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract     = {Cation–π interactions play important roles in molecular recognition and in the stability and function of proteins. However, accurate description of the structure and energetics of cation–π interactions presents a challenge to both additive and polarizable force fields, which are rarely designed to account for the complexation of charged groups with aromatic moieties. We calibrate the Drude polarizable force field for complexes of alkali metal ions (Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, Cs+), ammonium (NH4+), tetramethylammonium (TMA+), and tetraethylammonium (TEA+) with aromatic amino acid side chain model compounds (benzene, toluene, 4-methylphenol, 3-methylindole) using high-level ab initio quantum chemical properties of these complexes. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that cation–π complexes of the hard and tightly coordinated Li+and Na+ions are not stable in water but that larger ions form stable complexes, with binding free energies ranging between −0.8 and −2.9 kcal/mol. Like in gas phase, all complexes at equilibrium adopt an “en-face” complexation mode in water. The optimized Drude polarizable model provides an accurate description of the cation–π interactions involving small ions and proteins. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract     = {G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family of human membrane proteins and serve as primary targets of approximately one-third of currently marketed drugs. In particular, adenosine A1receptor (A1AR) is an important therapeutic target for treating cardiac ischemia–reperfusion injuries, neuropathic pain, and renal diseases. As a prototypical GPCR, the A1AR is located within a phospholipid membrane bilayer and transmits cellular signals by changing between different conformational states. It is important to elucidate the lipid–protein interactions in order to understand the functional mechanism of GPCRs. Here, all-atom simulations using a robust Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD) method were performed on both the inactive (antagonist bound) and active (agonist and G-protein bound) A1AR, which was embedded in a 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) lipid bilayer. In the GaMD simulations, the membrane lipids played a key role in stabilizing different conformational states of the A1AR. Our simulations further identified important regions of the receptor that interacted distinctly with the lipids in highly correlated manner. Activation of the A1AR led to differential dynamics in the upper and lower leaflets of the lipid bilayer. In summary, GaMD enhanced simulations have revealed strongly coupled dynamics of the GPCR and lipids that depend on the receptor activation state. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract     = {We report a methodology to calculate the free energy of a shape transformation in a lipid membrane directly from a molecular dynamics simulation. The bilayer need not be homogeneous or symmetric and can be atomically detailed or coarse grained. The method is based on a collective variable that quantifies the similarity between the membrane and a set of predefined density distributions. Enhanced sampling of this “Multi-Map” variable re-shapes the bilayer and permits the derivation of the corresponding potential of mean force. Calculated energies thus reflect the dynamic interplay of atoms and molecules, rather than postulated effects. Evaluation of deformations of different shape, amplitude, and range demonstrates that the macroscopic bending modulus assumed by the Helfrich–Canham model is increasingly unsuitable below the 100-Å scale. In this range of major biological significance, direct free-energy calculations reveal a much greater plasticity. We also quantify the stiffening effect of cholesterol on bilayers of different composition and compare with experiments. Lastly, we illustrate how this approach facilitates analysis of other solvent reorganization processes, such as hydrophobic hydration. Published 2019.

  abstract     = {Cation-π interactions are noncovalent interactions between a π-electron system and a positively charged ion that are regarded as a strong noncovalent interaction and are ubiquitous in biological systems. Similarly, though less studied, anion-ring interactions are present in proteins along with in-plane interactions of anions with aromatic rings. As these interactions are between a polarizing ion and a polarizable π system, the accuracy of the treatment of these interactions in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using additive force fields (FFs) may be limited. In the present work, to allow for a better description of ion-π interactions in proteins in the Drude-2013 protein polarizable FF, we systematically optimized the parameters for these interactions targeting model compound quantum mechanical (QM) interaction energies with atom pair-specific Lennard-Jones parameters along with virtual particles as selected ring centroids introduced to target the QM interaction energies and geometries. Subsequently, MD simulations were performed on a series of protein structures where ion-π pairs occur to evaluate the optimized parameters in the context of the Drude-2013 FF. The resulting FF leads to a significant improvement in reproducing the ion-π pair distances observed in experimental protein structures, as well as a smaller root-mean-square differences and fluctuations of the overall protein structures from experimental structures. Accordingly, the optimized Drude-2013 protein polarizable FF is suggested for use in MD simulations of proteins where cation-π and anion-ring interactions are critical. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract     = {Targeted covalent inhibitor drugs require computational methods that go beyond simple molecular-mechanical force fields in order to model the chemical reactions that occur when they bind to their targets. Here, several semiempirical and density-functional theory (DFT) methods are assessed for their ability to describe the potential energy surface and reaction energies of the covalent modification of a thiol by an electrophile. Functionals such as PBE and B3LYP fail to predict a stable enolate intermediate. This is largely due to delocalization error, which spuriously stabilizes the prereaction complex, in which excess electron density is transferred from the thiolate to the electrophile. Functionals with a high-exact exchange component, range-separated DFT functionals, and variationally optimized exact exchange (i.e., the LC-B05minV functional) correct this issue to various degrees. The large gradient behavior of the exchange enhancement factor is also found to significantly affect the results, leading to the improved performance of PBE0. While ωB97X-D and M06-2X were reasonably accurate, no method provided quantitative accuracy for all three electrophiles, making this a very strenuous test of functional performance. Additionally, one drawback of M06-2X was that molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using this functional were only stable if a fine integration grid was used. The low-cost semiempirical methods, PM3, AM1, and PM7, provide a qualitatively correct description of the reaction mechanism, although the energetics is not quantitatively reliable. As a proof of concept, the potential of mean force for the addition of methylthiolate to methylvinyl ketone was calculated using quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical MD in an explicit polarizable aqueous solvent. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract     = {Promoting drug delivery across the biological membrane is a common strategy to improve bioavailability. Inspired by the observation that carbonated alcoholic beverages can increase the absorption rate of ethanol, we speculate that carbon dioxide (CO2) molecules could also enhance membrane permeability to drugs. In the present work, we have investigated the effect of CO2on the permeability of a model membrane formed by 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine lipids to three drug-like molecules, namely, ethanol, 2′,3′-dideoxyadenosine, and trimethoprim. The free-energy and fractional-diffusivity profiles underlying membrane translocation were obtained from μs-timescale simulations and combined in the framework of the fractional solubility-diffusion model. We find that addition of CO2in the lipid environment results in an increase of the membrane permeability to the three substrates. Further analysis of the permeation events reveals that CO2expands and loosens the membrane, which, in turn, facilitates permeation of the drug-like molecules. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Primary amino acid sequence analysis has identified Specificity determinant positions (SDPs) that drive diversified functions specific to the Ras, Rho, Rab, and Arf subfamilies (Rojaset al. 2012,J Cell Biol196:189–201). The inclusion of water molecules in structural and functional adaptation is likely to be a major response to the selection pressures that drive evolution, yet hydration patterns are not included in phylogenetic analysis. This article shows that conserved crystallographic water molecules coevolved with SDP residues in the differentiation of proteins within the Ras superfamily of small GTPases. The patterns of water conservation between protein subfamilies parallel those of sequence-based evolutionary trees. Thus, hydration patterns have the potential to help elucidate functional significance in the evolution of amino acid residues observed in phylogenetic analysis of homologous proteins. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract     = {Atomic-level studies of protein activity represent a significant challenge as a result of the complexity of conformational changes occurring on wide-ranging timescales, often greatly exceeding that of even the longest simulations. A prime example is the elucidation of protein allosteric mechanisms, where localized perturbations transmit throughout a large macromolecule to generate a response signal. For example, the conversion of chemical to electrical signals during synaptic neurotransmission in the brain is achieved by specialized membrane proteins called pentameric ligand-gated ion channels. Here, the binding of a neurotransmitter results in a global conformational change to open an ion-conducting pore across the nerve cell membrane. X-ray crystallography has produced static structures of the open and closed states of the proton-gated GLIC pentameric ligand-gated ion channel protein, allowing for atomistic simulations that can uncover changes related to activation. We discuss a range of enhanced sampling approaches that could be used to explore activation mechanisms. In particular, we describe recent application of an atomistic string method, based on Roux&#39;s “swarms of trajectories” approach, to elucidate the sequence and interdependence of conformational changes during activation. We illustrate how this can be combined with transition analysis and Brownian dynamics to extract thermodynamic and kinetic information, leading to understanding of what controls ion channel function. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

We parametrized CG Martini FF models for PEI in polarizable and nonpolarizable water by applying Boltzmann inversion techniques to all-atom (AA) probability distributions for distances, angles, and dihedrals of entire monomers. The fine-tuning of the FFs was achieved by fitting simulated CG gyration radii and end-to-end distances to their AA counterparts.

  abstract     = {Reactions involving Criegee intermediates (CIs, R1R2COO) are important in atmospheric ozonolysis models. In recent years, density functional theory (DFT) and CCSD(T)-based ab initio methods are increasingly being used for modeling reaction profiles involving CIs. We obtain highly accurate CCSDT(Q)/CBS reaction energies and barrier heights for ring-closing reactions involving atmospherically important CIs (R1/R2= H, Me, OH, OMe, F, CN, cyclopropene, ethylene, acetaldehyde, and acrolein). We use this benchmark data to evaluate the performance of DFT, double-hybrid DFT (DHDFT), and ab initio methods for the kinetics and thermodynamics of these reactions. We find that reaction energies are more challenging for approximate theoretical procedures than barrier heights. Overall, taking both reaction energies and barrier heights into account, only one of the 58 considered DFT methods (the meta-GGA MN12-L) attains near chemical accuracy, with root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) of 3.5 (barrier heights) and 4.7 (reaction energies) kJ mol−1. Therefore, MN12-L is recommended for investigations where CCSD(T)-based methods are not computationally feasible. For reaction barrier heights performance does not strictly follow Jacob&#39;s Ladder, for example, DHDFT methods do not perform better than conventional DFT methods. Of the ab initio methods, the cost-effective CCSD(T)/CBS(MP2) approach gives the best performance for both reaction energies and barrier heights, with RMSDs of 1.7 and 1.4 kJ mol−1, respectively. All the considered Gaussian-nmethods show good performance with RMSDs below the threshold of chemical accuracy for both reaction energies and barrier heights, where G4(MP2) shows the best overall performance with RMSDs of 2.9 and 1.5 kJ mol−1, respectively. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

It was found that free NADPH prefers a compact structure in gas phase and exists in more extended geometries in aqueous solution. Ultraviolet–visible absorption spectra in aqueous solution were calculated for NADPH with an explicit treatment of 100 surrounding water molecules in combination with the COSMO solvation model for bulk hydration effects. The obtained spectra using the B3LYP hybrid density functional agree quite well with experimental data.

The NADPH oxidation reaction in the cardiovascular system cannot proceed without activation since the obtained ΔGis positive.

Modification of various parameters of such functionals, according to the demand of the system, has brought their accuracy level to a new height. Recent reports highlight that Long-range Corrected (LC) functionals are not encouraging in reproducing orbital energies in solvent. Therefore, in this article, we have proposed a tuning scheme for the LC functional for improved orbital energies. In this scheme, the optimized long-range HF exchange and the dielectric constant of the medium are included to modify the form of functionals. The proposed tuning is tested over a set of 103 molecules from IP131 database and fifteen solvent dielectrics. The tuned range separated functionals reproduce orbital eigenvalues in solvent continuum with good accuracy. More importantly, there is a consistency in the error for the tuned functional across the solvent media. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

In order to overcome the timescale problem, characteristic of many chemical reactions, we enhanced the sampling of the free energy landscape using Metadynamics. To achieve such a goal, the selection of adequate collective variables is crucial for the application of the method. Recently, a new method called Multi-Class Harmonic Linear Discriminant Analysis (MC-HLDA) has been proposed as a tool for constructing collective variables (CVs) for complex chemical processes. The method reduces the dimensionality of the variable space by generating appropriate linear combinations of several relevant chemical descriptors. The aim of this work is to assess the ability and performance of this method in describing the fundamental features of complex chemical reactions such as the Asplatin reduction mechanism in a compact, simple, and physically transparent manner. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

After precatalyst activation to give the LNi(0) active species, the transformation proceeds via the following steps: (1) oxidative addition of H2O to the LNi(0) provides the intermediate LNi(II)H(OH); (2) ligand exchange of LNi(II)H(OH) with Zn(CN)2gives the intermediate LNi(II)H(CN); (3) alkyne insertion to the LNi(II)H(CN) forms the alkenyl nickel complex, followed by the reductive elimination step reaching the final product. This mechanism is kinetically and thermodynamically more favorable than that of the experimental proposed ones. On the basis of the experimental observations, more water molecules cannot further improve the reaction as it has also been rationalized. Furthermore, the origin of the high regioselectivity of the product, the variable effectiveness of the metal mediator as function of ligands, as well as the high yield of the alkyl-substituted alkynes substrates, is analyzed in detail. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Lett. 2018, 695, 28–33), we have studied structural, energetic, and electronic properties of two vanadium dioxide VO2polymorphs with modified global and range-separated hybrid functionals. Since hybrid methods are computationally demanding, we evaluate the computationally more efficient DFT + U method in the present study. We assessed the widely used Dudarev PBE + U approach with a literature value of the effective Hubbard parameterUeff= 3.4 eV. We compared the PBE + U results for the two VO2polymorphs with our previous results, a self-consistent hybrid functional sc-PBE0, and themeta-GGA functional SCAN. It was found that the PBE + U method yields a strongly distorted monoclinic phase and does not reproduce the metal-to-insulator transition of VO2correctly, even with modified values ofUeff. On the other hand, sc-PBE0 and SCAN describe the relative stability and the electronic structure of both polymorphs correctly and also provide reasonable lattice parameters. The functional SCAN yields the optimal balance between computational efficiency and accuracy. © 2019 The Authors.Journal of Computational Chemistrypublished by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The calculated pairwise free energy difference is either directly adopted or transformed to absolute binding free energy for molecule rank ordering. We investigated, through both analytic derivations and simulations, how the selection of pairs in the experiment could impact the overall prediction precision. Our studies showed that (1) the estimated absolute binding free energy () derived from calculated pairwise differences (ΔΔG) through weighted least squares fitting is more precise in prediction than the pairwise difference values when the number of pairs is more than the number of ligands and (2) prediction precision is influenced by both the total number of pairs and the specifically selected pairs, the latter being critically important when the number of calculated pairs is limited. Furthermore, we applied optimal experimental design in pair selection and found that the optimally selected pairs can outperform randomly selected pairs in prediction precision. In an illustrative example, we showed that, upon weighing ligand structure similarity into design optimization, the weighted optimal designs are more efficient than the literature reported designs.

In particular, the new SMPBIC model adopts a membrane surface charge density and a natural Neumann boundary condition to reflect the charge effect of the membrane on the electrostatics of VDAC. To avoid the singularity difficulties caused by the atomic charges of VDAC, the new SMPBIC model is split into three submodels such that the solution of one of the submodels is obtained analytically and contains all the singularity points of the SMPBIC model. The other two submodels are then solved numerically much more efficiently than the original SMPBIC model. As an application of this SMPBIC submodel partitioning scheme, we derive a new formula for computing the electrostatic solvation free energy. Numerical results for a human VDAC isoform 1 (hVDAC1) in three different salt solutions, each with up to five different ionic species, confirm the significant effects of membrane surface charges on both the electrostatics and ionic concentrations. The results also show that the new SMPBIC model can describe well the anion selectivity property of hVDAC1, and that the new electrostatic solvation free energy formula can significantly improve the accuracy of the currently used formula. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The fuzzy membership degree of each atom (or aminoacid) is computed from its distance with respect to the geometric center of the molecule, by using a fuzzy membership function. So, the smoothing value to be applied in the truncation of a relation (or interaction) is computed by averaging the fuzzy membership degrees of the atoms (or aminoacids) involved in the relation. This truncation method is rather different from the existing ones, at considering the geometric center for the whole molecule and not only for atom-groups, as well as for using fuzzy membership functions to compute the smoothing values. A variability study on a set comprised of 20,469 compounds (15,050 drug-like compounds, 2994 drugs approved, 880 natural products from African sources, and 1545 plant-derived natural compounds exhibiting anti-cancerous activity) demonstrated that the truncation method proposed allows to determine molecular encodings with better ability for discriminating among structurally different molecules than the encodings obtained without applying truncation or applying non-fuzzy truncation functions. Moreover, a principal component analysis revealed that orthogonal chemical information of the molecules is encoded by using the method proposed. Lastly, a modeling study proved that the truncation method improves the modeling ability of existing geometric molecular descriptors, at allowing to develop more robust models than the ones built only using non-truncated descriptors. In this sense, a comparison and statistical assessment were performed on eight chemical datasets. As a result, the models based on the truncated molecular encodings yielded statistically better results than 12 procedures considered from the literature. It can thus be stated that the proposed truncation method is a relevant strategy for obtaining better molecular encodings, which will be ultimately useful in enhancing the modeling ability of existing encodings both on small-to-medium size molecules and biomacromolecules. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract     = {Methane conversion by using transition metal catalysts plays in an important role in various usages of the industrial process. The mechanism of methane conversion on B, N-co-doped graphene supported Ir and Pt clusters, BNG-Ir4 and BNG-Pt4, have been investigated using density functional theory calculations. Methane was found to adsorb on BNG-Ir4 and BNG-Pt4 clusters via strong agostic interactions. The first step of methane dehydrogenation on BNG-Ir4 has a lower energy barrier, indicating a facile methane dissociation on BNG-Ir4. In addition, it shows that hydrogen molecule can form on the BNG-Ir4 and hydrogen can desorb from the surface. Besides, the C-C coupling reaction of CH3to form ethane is a more thermodynamically favorable process than CH3dehydrogenation on BNG-Ir4. Further, ethane is easier to desorb from the surface due to its low desorption energy. Therefore, the BNG-Ir4 cluster is a potential catalyst for activating methane to form ethane and to produce hydrogen. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract     = {Electronic structure calculations representing the molecular orbitals (MOs) with contracted planewave basis functions (CPWBFs) have been reported recently. CPWBFs are Fourier-series representations of atom-centered basis functions. The mathematical features of CPWBFs permit the construction of matrix–vector products,FCo, involving the application of the Fock matrix,F, to the set of occupied MOs,Co, without the explicit evaluation ofF. This approach offers a theoretical speed-up ofM/noverF-based methods, whereMandnare the number of basis functions and occupied MOs, respectively. The present study reports methodological advances that permitFCo-based optimization of wavefunction formed from CPWBFs. In particular, a technique is reported for optimizing wavefunctions by combining pseudodiagonalization techniques based on an exact representation ofFCo, approximate information regarding the virtual orbital energies, and direct inversion of the iterative subspace optimization schemes to guide the wavefunction to a converged solution. This method is found to speed-up wavefunction optimizations by factors of up to~6 − 8overF-based optimization methods while providing identical results. Further, the computational cost of this technique is relatively insensitive to basis set size, thus providing further benefits in calculations using large CPWBF basis sets. The results of density functional theory calculations show that this method permits the use of hybrid exchange-correlation (XC) functionals with a small increase in effort over analogous calculations using generalized gradient approximation XC functionals. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

To obtain the optimal combination of quantum methods for ONIOM calculations with implicit solvation models, the influence of factors, such as the choice of density functional and basis set, the atomic radii used to build a cavity in the solvent, and the size of the model system in an ONIOM scheme, was examined. Additionally, the impact of Grimme&#39;s empirical dispersion correction and exact exchange was also investigated. The results were calibrated by experimental data.

Generally, one has to prepare many complicated parameters and follow a lot of steps to obtain the final data. The whole process is too complicated to new users. In this article, we provide a convenient and user-friendly tool that is compatible to AMBER, called fast sampling and analysis tool (FSATOOL). FSATOOL has some useful features. First and the most important, the whole work is extremely simplified into two steps, one is the fast sampling procedure and the other is the trajectory analysis procedure. Second, it contains several powerful sampling methods for the simulation on graphics process unit, including our previous mixing replica exchange molecular dynamics method. The method combines the advantages of the biased and unbiased simulations. Finally, it extracts the dominant transition pathways automatically from the folding network by Markov state model. Users do not need to do the tedious intermediate steps by hand. To illustrate the usage of FSATOOL in practice, we perform one simulation for a RNA hairpin in explicit solvent.

Because their direct measurement is often infeasible, speciation modeling is widely adopted. Mercury (Hg) is a representative pollutant for which study of its speciation benefits from modeling. However, Hg speciation modeling is often hindered by a lack of reliable thermodynamic constants. Although computational chemistry (e.g., density functional theory [DFT]) can generate these constants, methods for directly coupling DFT and speciation modeling are not available. Here, we combine computational chemistry and continuum-scale modeling with curated online databases to ameliorate the problem of unreliable inputs to Hg speciation modeling. OurAQUA-MERdatabases and web server (https://aquamer.ornl.gov) provides direct speciation results by combining web-based interfaces to a speciation calculator, databases of thermodynamic constants, and a computational chemistry toolkit to estimate missing constants.

Mg2+is one of the most abundant divalent ions in the cell, and it plays a critical role in many biological processes. Coumarin-based sensors are widely used as desirable fluorophore and binding moieties showing a remarkable sensitivity and fluorometric enhancement for Mg2+. In this work, density functional theory/multireference configuration interaction (DFT/MRCI) calculations were performed in order to understand the sensing behavior of the organic fluorescent sensor 7-hydroxy-4-methyl-8-((2-(pyridin-2-yl)hydrazono)methyl)-2H-chromen-2-one (PyHC) in ethanol to solvated Mg2+ions. The computed optical properties reproduce well-reported experimental data. Our results suggest that after photoexcitation of the free PyHC, a photo-induced electron transfer (PET) mechanism may compete with the fluorescence decay to the ground state. In contrast, this PET channel is no longer available in the complex with Mg2+making the emissive decay more efficient. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Instead, X = Al/Ga globally favors an unusual ptC structure that has one long C─X distance yet with significant bond index value, and X = In/Tl prefers the planar tricoordinate carbon. The frustrated formation of thC in these clusters is ascribed to the CSi bonding that prefers a planar fashion. Inclusion of chloride ion would further stabilize the ptC of CAl2SiAl+and CAl2SiGa+.

Meanwhile, accurate computational prediction and mechanism research are two grand challenges in proteomics. In this article, ligand-binding residues of five ligands (ATP, ADP, GTP, GDP, and NAD) are predicted as a group, due to their similar chemical structures and close biological function relations. The data set of binding sites by five ligands (ATP, ADP, GTP, GDP, and NAD) are collated from Biolip database. Then, five features, containing increment of diversity value, matrix scoring value, auto-covariance, secondary structure information, and surface accessibility information are used in binding site predictions. The support vector machine (SVM) model is used with the five features to predict ligand-binding sites. Finally, prediction results are tested by fivefold cross validation. Accuracy (Acc) of five ligands (ATP, ADP, GTP, GDP, and NAD) achieves 77.4\%, 71.2\%, 82.1\%, 82.9\%, and 85.3\%, respectively; and Matthew correlation coefficient (MCC) of the above five ligands achieves 0.549, 0.424, 0.643, 0.659, and 0.702, respectively.

  abstract     = {The selective estrogen receptor downregulators (SERDs) are the new emerging class of drugs that are used for the treatment of endocrine resistance breast cancer. Elacestrant (ELA) is a new SERD, currently it is in phase II clinical trial. To understand the ELA–ERα interactions, the molecular docking analysis has been carried out. The ELA molecule binds with the helices H3, H5, H6, and H11 and forms important intermolecular interactions. In addition to this, the tetrahydronapthalene and phenyl rings of ELA are forming T-shaped π···π interactions with the Phe404 and Trp383 residues. Further to understand the stability and flexibility of ELA molecule in the active site of wild and mutated L536S ERα, 100ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed for both complexes. Interestingly, the MD analysis of wild complex revealed an interaction between ELA and the Asn532 of H11, which is an essential interaction for the downregulation/degradation of ERα, whereas this interaction is not observed in the mutated complex. The drug binding mechanism and H12 dynamics have been elucidated from the analysis of hydrogen bonding interactions and the secondary structure analysis. To explore the binding affinity of ELA molecule, the binding free energy and normal mode analyses were carried out. The per residue decomposition analysis also performed, which shows the contribution of individual amino acids. The principal component analysis and residue interaction network analysis were used to identify the modifications and the interaction between the residues. From the results of different analysis, the inhibition mechanism and downregulation of ERα–ELA complex has been investigated. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract     = {The comprehensive theoretical investigation of stability of functionalized corannulene cations [R-C20H10]+with respect to two alternative bond-breaking mechanisms, namely, homolytic or radical ([R-C20H10]+→ R•+ C20H10+•) and heterolytic or cationic ([R-C20H10]+→ R++ C20H10), was accomplished. The special focus was on the influence of the nature of R-group on the energetics of the bond cleavage. Detailed study of energetics of both mechanisms has revealed that the systems with small alkyl groups such as methyl tend to undergo bond breaking in accordance with homolytic mechanism. Subsequent elongation of the chain of the R-group resulted in shifting the paradigm, making heterolytic path more energetically favorable. Subsequent analysis of different components of the bonding between R-group and corannulene polyaromatic core helped to shed light on trends observed. In both mechanisms, the covalent contribution was found to be dominating, whereas ionic part contributes ~25–27\%. Two leading components of ΔEorb, C20H10→ R and R → C20H10, were identified with NOCV-EDA approach. While the homolytic pathway is best described as R → C20H10process, the heterolytic mechanism shows domination of the C20H10→ R term. Surprisingly, the preparation energy (ΔEprep) was identified as a key player in stability tendencies found. In other words, the relative stability of corresponding molecular fragments (here R-groups as the corannulene fragment remains the same for all systems) in their cationic or radical forms determine the preference given to a specific bond breaking path and, as consequence, the total stability of target functionalized cations. These conclusions were further confirmed by extending a set of R-groups to conjugated (allyl, phenyl), bulky (iPr,tBu), β-silyl (CH2SiH3, CH2SiMe3), and benzyl (CH2Ph) groups. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract     = {We present here a versatile computational code named “elecTric fIeld generaTion And maNipulation (TITAN),” capable of generating various types of external electric fields, as well as quantifying the local (or intrinsic) electric fields present in proteins and other biological systems according to Coulomb&#39;s Law. The generated electric fields can be coupled with quantum mechanics (QM), molecular mechanics (MM), QM/MM, and molecular dynamics calculations in most available software packages. The capabilities of the TITAN code are illustrated throughout the text with the help of examples. We end by presenting an application, in which the effects of the local electric field on the hydrogen transfer reaction in cytochrome P450 OleTJEenzyme and the modifications induced by the application of an oriented external electric field are examined. We find that the protein matrix in P450 OleTJEacts as a moderate catalyst and that orienting an external electric field along the Fe─O bond of compound I has the biggest impact on the reaction barrier. The induced catalysis/inhibition correlates with the calculated spin density on the O-atom. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract     = {Evaluation of ligand-binding affinity using the atomic coordinates of a protein-ligand complex is a challenge from the computational point of view. The availability of crystallographic structures of complexes with binding affinity data opens the possibility to create machine-learning models targeted to a specific protein system. Here, we describe a new methodology that combines a mass-spring system approach with supervised machine-learning techniques to predict the binding affinity of protein-ligand complexes. The combination of these techniques allows exploring the scoring function space, generating a model targeted to a protein system of interest. The new model shows superior predictive performance when compared with classical scoring functions implemented in the programs Molegro Virtual Docker, AutoDock4, and AutoDock Vina. We implemented this methodology in a new program named Taba.

  abstract     = {We propose a free energy calculation method for receptor–ligand binding, which have multiple binding poses that avoids exhaustive enumeration of the poses. For systems with multiple binding poses, the standard procedure is to enumerate orientations of the binding poses, restrain the ligand to each orientation, and then, calculate the binding free energies for each binding pose. In this study, we modify a part of the thermodynamic cycle in order to sample a broader conformational space of the ligand in the binding site. This modification leads to more accurate free energy calculation without performing separate free energy simulations for each binding pose. We applied our modification to simple model host–guest systems as a test, which have only two binding poses, by using a single decoupling method (SDM) in implicit solvent. The results showed that the binding free energies obtained from our method without knowing the two binding poses were in good agreement with the benchmark results obtained by explicit enumeration of the binding poses. Our method is applicable to other alchemical binding free energy calculation methods such as the double decoupling method (DDM) in explicit solvent. We performed a calculation for a protein–ligand system with explicit solvent using our modified thermodynamic path. The results of the free energy simulation along our modified path were in good agreement with the results of conventional DDM, which requires a separate binding free energy calculation for each of the binding poses of the example of phenol binding to T4 lysozyme in explicit solvent. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract     = {The second-order noniterative doubles-corrected random phase approximation (RPA) method has been extended to triplet excitation energies and the doubles-corrected higher RPA method as well as a shifted version for calculating singlet and triplet excitation energies are presented here for the first time. A benchmark set consisting of 20 molecules with a total of 117 singlet and 71 triplet excited states has been used to test the performance of the new methods by comparison with previous results obtained with the second-order polarization propagator approximation (SOPPA) and the third order approximate coupled cluster singles, doubles and triples model CC3. In general, the second-order doubles corrections to RPA and HRPA significantly reduce both the mean deviation as well as the standard deviation of the errors compared to the CC3 results. The accuracy of the new methods approaches the accuracy of the SOPPA method while using only 10–60\% of the calculation time. © 2019 The Authors.Journal of Computational Chemistrypublished by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract     = {A series of broadly neutralizing antibodies called PGT have been shown to be bound directly to human immunodeficiency virus type-1 via high mannose glycans on glycoprotein gp120. Despite the sequence similarities of amino acids of the antibodies, their affinities to the glycan differ. Glycan–antibody interactions among these antibodies are systematically compared with quantum chemical fragment molecular orbital calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. The differences among structural stability of the glycan in the active site of the complexes and total interaction energies as well as binding free energies between the glycan and antibodies agree well with the experimentally shown affinities of the glycan to the antibodies. The terminal saccharide, Man D3, is structurally stable and responsible for the glycan–antibody binding through electrostatic and dispersion interactions. The structural stability of nonterminal saccharides such as Man 4 or Man C plays substantial roles in the interaction via direct hydrogen bonds. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract     = {The absolute solvation energies (free energies and enthalpies) of the proton in ammonia are used to compute thepKaof species embedded in ammonia. They are also used to compute the solvation energies of other ions in ammonia. Despite their importance, it is not possible to determine experimentally the solvation energies of the proton in a given solvent. We propose in this work a direct approach to compute the solvation energies of the proton in ammonia from large-sized neutral and protonated ammonia clusters. To undertake this investigation, we performed a geometry optimization of neutral and protonated ammonia 30-mer, 40-mer, and 50 mer to locate stable structures. These structures have been fully optimized at both APFD/6-31++g(d,p) and M06-2X/6-31++g(d,p) levels of theory. An infrared spectroscopic study of these structures has been provided to assess the reliability of our investigation. Using these structures, we have computed the absolute solvation free energy and the absolute solvation enthalpy of the proton in ammonia. It comes out that the absolute solvation free energy of the proton in ammonia is calculated to be −1192 kJ mol–1, whereas the absolute solvation enthalpy is evaluated to be −1214 kJ mol–1. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

In this work, we propose to use the statistical internal cluster validation indexes to determine the optimal number of CG sites that are optimized based on the essential dynamics coarse-graining method. The calculated curves of Calinski-Harabasz and Silhouette Coefficient indexes exhibit the extrema corresponding to the similar CG numbers. The calculated ratios of the optimal CG numbers to the residue numbers of fine-grained models are in the range from 4 to 2. The comparison of the stability of index results indicates that Calinski-Harabasz index is the better choice to determine the optimal CG representation in coarse-graining. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract     = {The elementometalation process is a fundamental chemical step in several catalytic cycles. In this work, density functional theory computations have elucidated the detailed elementometalation mechanism of activated alkyne RCCR(RCO2Me) by Cp2TaH3and rationalized the selectivity in experimental findings. The calculated results show that in the formation process of (E)-olefin monohydride((E)-Pro), the Gibbs free energy barrier is low and the entire reaction is spontaneous and exothermic; thus, (E)-Pro can be formed easily. The formation of (Z)-η2-olefin monohydride complex ((Z)-Pro) is difficult due to its high Gibbs free energy barrier. The formation process (E)-Pro consists of the following five steps: hydride H1-shift, conformational isomerism 1, hydride H2-shift, conformational isomerism 2, and olefin coordination process. Topological analysis shows that there is a five-membered ring plane structure in the reaction pathway and that the final product (E)-Pro belongs to a typicalη2-olefin monohydride complex. Our calculated results provide an explanation for experimental observations and useful insights for further development of olefin functionalization. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},
