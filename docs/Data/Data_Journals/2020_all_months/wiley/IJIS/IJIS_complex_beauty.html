  abstract     = {The picture fuzzy set (PFS) has grown huge attention in the research area of uncertain information from the last few years. Information measures have been widely studied in various fuzzy environments. Therefore, in this paper, we study the entropy and divergence measures under the picture fuzzy environment. First, the paper introduced a new entropy measure to measure the fuzziness degree associated with a PFS. An example is established to show the capabilities of the proposed entropy measure. Second, the paper defines a new Jensen–Tsalli divergence measure for PFS to evaluate the information of discrimination between two PFS. We also discuss several properties of entropy and divergence measures in detail. Then we present a new method, based on proposed entropy and divergence measure, to determine the objective weights of experts for multicriteria group decision making with picture fuzzy information. The final criteria weights are obtained by combining subjective and objective weights for more reliable weightage of evaluation criteria. By using this comprehensive weight-determination technique, the proposed method can effectively reduce the unreasonable impact of the extreme evaluation data on the evaluation results. Further, a new multi-criteria decision-making approach is developed based on the combining concepts of the TODIM and VIKOR method under the picture fuzzy environment. We used TODIM to obtain the overall dominance degree which considers the bounded rationality of decision makers and VIKOR is used to obtain the compromise ranking of alternatives. Lastly, an application of the proposed integrated model is demonstrated to verify the feasibility and usefulness and the outcomes of the proposed model are compared with the outcomes of the existing approaches to indicate its validity. This integrated method can effectively reduce the distortion of decision information and provide extraordinary evaluation results. The proposed approach is used in detecting the major issues due to which a company is facing such breakdowns.},

Our approach is based on an information-theoretic perspective and aims at preserving the uncertainty, represented through an entropy measure, in the original IFS by minimizing the difference between the entropy in the input IFS and the output Shadowed Set. We propose three different efficient optimization algorithms that retain Fuzziness, Lack of Knowledge, or both, and illustrate their computation through an illustrative example. We also evaluate the application of the proposed approximation methods in the Machine Learning setting by showing that the approximation, through the proposed methods, of IFS -Nearest Neighbors is able to outperform, in terms of running time, the standard algorithm.},

One-shot-programming in 3D charge-trap based SSDs could deliver a maximized system input/output (I/O) throughput at the cost of degraded Quality-of-Service (QoS) performance. This paper proposes reinforcement-learning based one-shot-programming (RLOSP), a reinforcement learning based approach to improve the QoS performance for 3D charge-trap based SSDs. By learning the I/O patterns of the workload environments as well as the device internal status, the proposed approach could properly choose requests in the device queue, and allocate physical addresses for these requests during one-shot-programming. In this manner, the storage device could deliver an improved QoS performance. Experimental results reveal that the proposed approach could reduce the worst-case latency at the 99.9th percentile by 37.5\%–59.2\%, with an optimal system I/O throughput.},

  abstract     = {As we all know, video frame rate determines the quality of the video. The higher the frame rate, the smoother the movements in the picture, the clearer the information expressed, and the better the viewing experience for people. Video interpolation aims to increase the video frame rate by generating a new frame image using the relevant information between two consecutive frames, which is essential in the field of computer vision. The traditional motion compensation interpolation method will cause holes and overlaps in the reconstructed frame, and is easily affected by the quality of optical flow. Therefore, this paper proposes a video frame interpolation method via optical flow estimation with image inpainting. First, the optical flow between the input frames is estimated via combined local and global-total variation (CLG-TV) optical flow estimation model. Then, the intermediate frames are synthesized under the guidance of the optical flow. Finally, the nonlocal self-similarity between the video frames is used to solve the optimization problem, to fix the pixel loss area in the interpolated frame. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results show that this method can effectively improve the quality of optical flow estimation, generate realistic and smooth video frames, and effectively increase the video frame rate.},

How to overcome multicollinearity is a crucial link in the emergency decision modeling process. In this paper, we treat the attributes and DMs as IVPFL variables and construct the IVPFL principal component analysis (IVPFL-PCA) model to overcome the multicollinearity. Then, a novel TODIM (abbreviation for interactive and multicriterial decision-making in Portuguese) method is proposed to tackle the IVPFL information under several new variables that are independent of each other (i.e., the PCs) and the reasonable weights of PCs obtained based on the IVPFL-PCA model.

  abstract     = {The vulnerabilities in cryptographic currencies facilitate the adversarial attacks. Therefore, the attackers have incentives to increase their rewards by strategic behaviors. Block withholding attacks (BWH) are such behaviors that attackers withhold blocks in the target pools to subvert the blockchain ecosystem. Furthermore, BWH attacks may dwarf the countermeasures by combining with selfish mining attacks or other strategic behaviors, for example, fork after withholding (FAW) attacks and power adaptive withholding (PAW) attacks. That is, the attackers may be intelligent enough such that they can dynamically gear their behaviors to optimal attacking strategies. In this paper, we propose mixed-BWH attacks with respect to intelligent attackers, who leverage reinforcement learning to pin down optimal strategic behaviors to maximize their rewards. More specifically, the intelligent attackers strategically toggle among BWH, FAW, and PAW attacks. Their main target is to fine-tune the optimal behaviors, which incur maximal rewards. The attackers pinpoint the optimal attacking actions with reinforcement learning, which is formalized into a Markov decision process. The simulation results show that the rewards of the mixed strategy are much higher than that of honest strategy for the attackers. Therefore, the attackers have enough incentives to adopt the mixed strategy.},

  abstract     = {The evaluation and selection of cold chain logistics distribution centers are of vital importance for third-party logistics companies which want to build green cold chain logistics networks. To select distribution centers, the conflicts among multiple criteria should be considered. The combined compromise solutions (CoCoSo) method can help enterprises make a structural decision; however, in the original CoCoSo method, the evaluation information was expressed by crisp numbers. Nevertheless, in many cases, because of the imprecision and incompleteness of information, it may be more flexible for evaluators to provide imprecise and fuzzy values rather than crisp numbers. In addition, the judgment values are often expressed based on decision-makers&#39; psychological expectations. The evaluation criteria of alternatives have relevance to some extent, which would influence the evaluation results. Based on these concerns, this study presents a modified CoCoSo method in the Pythagorean fuzzy environment in which evaluators can express psychological expectations on alternatives. To achieve this goal, the cumulative prospect theory is introduced to obtain the Pythagorean fuzzy prospect weights. Then, an objective weight determination method of criteria under the Pythagorean fuzzy environment is proposed to eliminate the influence of homogeneity of criteria. Based on the Pythagorean fuzzy prospect weights and the combined weights, the original CoCoSo method is extended to the Pythagorean fuzzy environment. A case of selection logistics distribution center is investigated to demonstrate the practicality of the proposed method. The advantages of the proposed method are verified by comparative analysis.},

Organ delineation and dose plan design are the key steps in the treatment. Organ delineation controls the area of radiotherapy and dose planning controls its intensity. However, both tasks are time-consuming, exhausting, and subjective, and automated methods are desirable. Although automated methods have been studied, the previous studies either focus on organ segmentation or dose prediction, without considering them from a holistic perspective. In this paper, we treat organ segmentation and dose prediction as similar tasks, and propose an error correction framework to improve their performance based on the same mechanism. The proposed error correction framework consists of a prediction network and a calibration network. The biggest difference between our framework and previous studies is that the state-of-the-art networks can be used as a prediction network or calibration network, and then the performance can be improved by the error correction mechanism. To evaluate the framework, we conducted a series of experiments on dose prediction and organ segmentation. These experimental results show that the framework is superior to other state-of-the-art methods in both tasks.},

  abstract     = {The objectives of this study are to mitigate the risk and disturbances to the supply chain, to offer required models for resolving the complex issues that arise, and to maintain the stability of the support system. Also, the uncertain conditions in a supply chain force decision-makers and experts to adopt a fuzzy-based evaluation platform to ensure secure and reliable consequences. The current study proposed a fuzzy neutrosophic decision-making approach for supplier evaluation and selection. The model is composed of a new weight aggregator that uses pairwise comparison, which has not been reported to date. The model uses a Dombi aggregator that is more qualified than other aggregators. The Dombi -conorms and -norms have the same properties as those of the general t-conorm and -norm, which can enhance the flexibility of the information aggregation process via the adjustment of a parameter. A decision-making environment with uncertain conditions and multiple factors is supposed. We applied this approach in a construction company to analyse the suppliers in a resilient supply chain management (RSCM) system using a MABAC (multiattribute border approximation area comparison) tool. The accuracy of the proposed model was examined via sensitivity analysis tests. This study proposes a novel fuzzy-neutrosophic-based approach for resilient supplier selection. The main contributions of this study work are the design, implementation and analysis of a multiattribute evaluation system with respect to fuzzy neutrosophic values. In this evaluation system, a new pairwise comparison is conducted with trapezoidal neutrosophic linguistic variables to determine the importance weights of supplier criteria. Typically, the provision of opinions regarding the qualitative performances of suppliers is a difficult and confusing responsibility for experts and supplier evaluators. Therefore, the proposed approach overcomes this problem by utilizing a pairwise comparison by neutrosophic values and proposes original Dombi aggregation operators for dealing with fuzzy neutrosophic sets.},

Selecting an optimal university for benchmarking through UTAE to promote the quality of teaching can be regarded as a complex multicriteria decision making (MCDM) problem. Furthermore, in the process of UTAE, experts&#39; evaluations over the teaching quality of universities are often imprecise and fuzzy due to the subjective nature of human thinking. In this paper, we propose a new UTAE approach based on -rung orthopair fuzzy sets and the multiattribute border approximation area comparison (MABAC) method for evaluating and selecting the best university for benchmarking. The introduced method deals with the linguistic assessments given by experts by using -ROFSs, assigns the weights of audit elements based on the indifference threshold-based attribute ratio analysis method, and acquires the ranking of universities with an extended MABAC method. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed -rung orthopair fuzzy MABAC method is demonstrated through a realistic UTAE example. Results show that the UTAE method being proposed is valid and practical for UTAE.},

  abstract     = {Person re-identification (re-ID) has drawn attention significantly in the computer vision society due to its application and research significance. It aims to retrieve a person of interest across different camera views. However, there are still several factors that hinder the applications of person re-ID. In fact, most common data sets either assume that pedestrians do not change their clothing across different camera views or are taken under constrained environments. Those constraints simplify the person re-ID task and contribute to early development of person re-ID, yet a person has a great possibility to change clothes in real life. To facilitate the research toward conquering those issues, this paper mainly introduces a new benchmark data set for person re-identification. To the best of our knowledge, this data set is currently the most diverse for person re-identification. It contains 107 persons with 9,738 images, captured in 15 indoor/outdoor scenes from September 2019 to December 2019, varying according to viewpoints, lighting, resolutions, human pose, seasons, backgrounds, and clothes especially. We hope that this benchmark data set will encourage further research on person re-identification with clothes variation. Moreover, we also perform extensive analyses on this data set using several state-of-the-art methods. Our dataset is available at .},

  abstract     = {The controller design for the robotic manipulator faces different challenges such as the system&#39;s nonlinearities and the uncertainties of the parameters. Furthermore, the tracking of different linear and nonlinear trajectories represents a vital role by the manipulator. This paper suggests an optimal design for the nonlinear model predictive control (NLMPC) based on a new improved intelligent technique and it is named modified multitracker optimization algorithm (MMTOA). The proposed modification of the MTOA is carried out based on opposition-based learning (OBL) and quasi OBL approaches. This modification improves the exploration behavior of the MTOA to prevent it from becoming trapped in a local optimum. The proposed method is applied on the robotic manipulator to track different linear and nonlinear trajectories. The NLMPC parameters are tuned by the MMTOA rather than the trial and error method of the designer. The proposed NLMPC based on MMTOA is compared with the original MTOA, genetic algorithm, and cuckoo search algorithm in literature. The superiority and effectiveness of the proposed controller are confirmed to track different linear and nonlinear trajectories. Furthermore, the robustness of the proposed method is emphasized against the uncertainties of the parameters.},

  abstract     = {Natural selection has inspired researchers to develop and apply several intelligent optimization techniques in the past few decades. Generally, in artificial intelligence optimization, the particles follow a local or global best particle until finding an acceptable solution. In well- developed optimization techniques, such as swarm optimization (PSO) and the firefly algorithm (FA), getting around the initial optimal value of the group and randomly checking the effect of the surrounding points may lead to a better solution than the initial optimal value. The present work was inspired by the fascinating movement of Garra Rufa fish between two immersed legs during a regular “fish massage session.” A new optimization approach is proposed and modeled based on the movements of Garra Rufa fish, in which the particles are separated into groups, and the best optimal value leads each group for the group. Also, some of these particles are allowed to change groups depending on the fitness of the leaders of the groups. The suggested strategy is then compared with PSO and FA using multiple test optimization functions, such as the Ackley, Hartmann, Michalewicz, Shubert, Easom, Bohachevsky, and Rastrigin functions. Also, a multiobjective real issue in power system is tested using the proposed methods where the objectives were cumulative voltage deviation and power losses of three weight sets during the selection allocation of distribution generators. The results show that the proposed method provides good data and greater convergence to the optimal point compared with the classical methods for most of the functions tested.},

  abstract     = {k Nearest neighbor (kNN) classification algorithm is a prediction model which is widely used for real-life applications, such as healthcare, finance, computer vision, personalization recommendation and precision marketing. The arrival of data explosion era results in the significant increase of feature dimension, which also makes for the increase of privacy concern over the available samples and unlabeled data in the applications of machine learning. In this paper, we present a secure low communication overhead kNN classification protocol that is able to deal with high-dimensional features given in real numbers. First, to deal with feature values given in real numbers, we develop a specific data conversion algorithm, which is used in the chosen fully homomorphic scheme. This conversion algorithm is generic and applicable to other algorithms that need to handle real numbers using the fully homomorphic scheme. Second, we present a privacy-preserving euclidean distance protocol (PPEDP), which works with the Euclidean distance computation between two points given in real numbers in a high-dimensional space. Then, based on the novelty PPEDP and oblivious transfer, we propose a new classification approach, efficient secure kNN classification protocol, (ESkNN) with low communication overhead, which is appropriate for a sample set with high-dimensional features and real number feature values. Moreover, we implement ESkNN in C++. Experimental results show that ESkNN is several orders of magnitude faster in performance than existing works, and scales up to 18 000 feature dimension in a memory limited environment.},

  abstract     = {Blockchain is a “decentralized” system, where the security heavily depends on that of the consensus protocols. For instance, attackers gain illegal revenues by leveraging the vulnerabilities of the consensus protocols. Such attacks consist of selfish mining (SM1), optimal selfish mining (-optimal), bribery selfish mining (BSM), and so forth. In existing works, the attacks only consider the circumstances, where part of miners are rational. However, miners are hardly nonrational in the blockchain system since they hope to maximize their revenues. Furthermore, attackers prefer intelligent tools to increase their power for more additional revenues. Therefore, new models are urgently needed to formulate the scenarios, where attackers are purely rational and intelligent. In this paper, we propose a new BSM model, where all miners are rational. Moreover, rational attackers are intelligent such that they optimize their strategies by utilizing reinforcement learning to boost their revenues. More specifically, we propose a new selfish mining algorithm: intelligent bribery selfish mining (IPBSM), where attackers choose optimal strategies resorting to reinforcement learning when they interact with the external environment. The external environment can be further modeled as a Markov decision process to facilitate the construction of reinforcement learning. The simulation results manifest that IPBSM, compared with SM1 and -optimal, has lower power thresholds and higher revenues. Therefore, IPBSM is a threat no to be neglected to the blockchain system.},

  abstract     = {Data mining is a method for extracting useful information that is necessary for a system from a database. As the types of data processed by the system are diversified, the transformed pattern mining techniques for processing these type of data have been proposed. Unlike the traditional pattern mining methods, erasable pattern mining is a technique for finding the patterns that can be removed by coming with a small profit. Erasable pattern mining should be able to process data by considering both the environment that the data are generated from and the characteristics of the data. An uncertain database is a database that is composed of uncertain data. Since erasable patterns discovered from uncertain data contain significant information, these patterns need to be extracted. In addition, databases gradually increase, because the data from various fields is generated and accumulated over data streams. Data streams should be processed as intelligently as possible to provide the useful data to the system in real time. In this paper, we propose an efficient erasable pattern mining algorithm that processes uncertain data that is generated over data streams. The uncertain erasable patterns discovered through the suggested technique are more meaningful information by considering the probability of the item and the profit. Moreover, the proposed method can perform efficient mining operations by using both tree and list structures. The performance of the suggested algorithm is verified through the performance tests compared with state-of-the-art algorithms using real data sets and synthetic data sets.},

Although many approaches are being investigated to address this issue, nowaday there are no vaccines available and there is little evidence supporting the efficiency of potential therapeutic agents. Moreover, the high mutation rate of this virus heavily affects the understanding of its evolution and diffusion mechanisms, and, in turn, the development of effective solutions. In this study, two novel algorithms are provided for finding out recurrent patterns of nucleotide subsequences of different SARS-CoV-2 genomes as a unique signature capable of identifying the most peculiar features of the pathogen. In particular, we provide several subsequence patterns related to the Spike glycoprotein, which is believed to be the main target for developing effective drugs and vaccines against the COVID-19 disease because of its role in the entrance of coronaviruses into host cells. The experimental results, obtained by analyzing 5000 genomes of SARS-CoV-2, have shown that the extracted patterns are able to recognize the Spyke protein in the 99.35\% of the considered genomes. In addition, such patterns have proven to be highly discriminating with respect to other pathogenic genomes, such as SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome, Nipah, and the streptococcus bacteria. We hope that the findings presented in this study can help specialists in speeding up the design of more accurate drugs or vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.},

Respect to each kind of uncertainty, a number of formulae are derived to permit flexible selection of PHFE entropy measures. Moreover, based on the proposed PHFE entropy measures, we introduce some entropy-based distance measures which are used in the portion of comparative analysis. Eventually, the proposed PHFE entropy measures and PHFE entropy-based distance measures are applied to decision making in the strategy initiatives where their reliability and effectiveness are verified.},

  abstract     = {Significant emergency measures should be taken until an emergency event occurs. It is understood that the emergency is characterized by limited time and information, harmfulness and uncertainty, and decision-makers are always critically bound by uncertainty and risk. This paper introduces many novel approaches to addressing the emergency situation of COVID-19 under spherical fuzzy environment. Fundamentally, the paper includes six main sections to achieve appropriate and accurate measures to address the situation of emergency decision-making. As the spherical fuzzy set (FS) is a generalized framework of fuzzy structure to handle more uncertainty and ambiguity in decision-making problems (DMPs). First, we discuss basic algebraic operational laws (AOLs) under spherical FS. In addition, elaborate on the deficiency of existing AOLs and present three cases to address the validity of the proposed novel AOLs under spherical fuzzy settings. Second, we present a list of Einstein aggregation operators (AgOp) based on the Einstein norm to aggregate uncertain information in DMPs. Thirdly, we are introducing two techniques to demonstrate the unknown weight of the criteria. Fourthly, we develop extended TOPSIS and Gray relational analysis approaches based on AgOp with unknown weight information of the criteria. In fifth, we design three algorithms to address the uncertainty and ambiguity information in emergency DMPs. Finally, the numerical case study of the novel carnivorous (COVID-19) situation is provided as an application for emergency decision-making based on the proposed three algorithms. Results explore the effectiveness of our proposed methodologies and provide accurate emergency measures to address the global uncertainty of COVID-19.},

Hence, they play an important role in the productivity of servicing or manufacturing systems. Since each crane has distinguished properties than the others with respect to criteria and decision-makers (DMs) may express the different standpoints regarding them, the crane selection problem (CSP) can be considered as a group multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. In this paper, interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FSs) are first used to evaluate cranes with respect to criteria. The synthetic value method of IT2FSs is then handled to integrate the ratings expressed as IT2FSs of each crane with respect to criteria into the single fuzzy rating. Finally, the multiobjective criteria importance through inter-criteria correlation (CRITIC)–technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) approach is applied to solve the CSP in which CRITIC and TOPSIS are used to determine the objective weights and score of cranes, respectively. In addition, the limit distance mean () is introduced for ranking interval type-2 fuzzy ratings in the above two techniques. In contrast, to demonstrate the potential application, the proposed methodology is implemented in a real case study and the ranking results are compared with those published in the literature.},

The proposed method comprises of a popular grey wolf optimization (GWO) in an enhanced and hybrid form. It embraces the well-balanced exploration and exploitation using the cuckoo search (CS) algorithm and enhanced search capability through the sine cosine algorithm (SCA) to elude the stuck to the local optima. The proposed technique is validated with the 23 benchmark functions and compared with state-of-the-art methods. The benchmark functions consist of unimodal, multimodal function from which the best suitability of the proposed technique can be identified. The robustness analysis also presented with the proposed method through boxplot, and a detailed statistical analysis is performed for a set of 30 individual runs. From the inferences gathered from the benchmark functions, the proposed technique is applied to the stability problem of a power system, which is heavily stressed with the nonlinear variation of the load and thereby operating conditions. The dynamics of power system components have been considered for the mathematical model of a multimachine system, and multiobjective function has been framed in tuning the optimal controller parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm has been assessed by considering two case studies, namely, (i) the optimal controller parameter tuning, and (ii) the coordination of oscillation damping devices in the power system stability enhancement. In the first case study, the power system stabilizer (PSS) is considered as a controller, and a self-clearing three-phase fault is considered as the system uncertainty. In contrast, static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) and PSS are considered as controllers to be coordinated, and perturbation in the system states as uncertainty in the second case study.},

  abstract     = {In answer aggregation of crowdsourced data management, rank aggregation aims to combine different agents&#39; answers or preferences over the given alternatives into an aggregate ranking which agrees the most with the preferences. However, since the aggregation procedure relies on a data curator, the privacy within the agents&#39; preference data could be compromised when the curator is untrusted. Existing works that guarantee differential privacy in rank aggregation all assume that the data curator is trusted. In this paper, we formulate and address the problem of , in which the agents have no trust in the data curator. By leveraging the approximate rank aggregation algorithm , the mechanism, and the mechanism, we propose an effective and efficient protocol . Theoretical and empirical results show that the solution can achieve the acceptable trade-off between the utility of aggregate ranking and the privacy protection of agents&#39; pairwise preferences.},

Arc consistency (AC) is a well-studied consistency level, with many implementations. Bounds consistency (BC), a looser consistency level, is known to have equal time complexity to AC. To solve a CSP, we have to implement an algorithm of our own or employ an existing solver. In any case, at some point, we have to decide between enforcing either AC or BC. As the choice between AC or BC is more or less predefined and currently made without considering the individualities of each CSP, this study attempts to make this decision deterministic and efficient, without the need of trial and error. We find that BC fits better while solving a CSP with its maximum domains&#39; size being greater than its constrained variables number. We study the behavior of arc or bounds consistency during search, and we show how the search methods complexity is affected by the employed consistency level.},

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which can fool classifiers by maliciously adding imperceptible perturbations to the original input. Currently, a large number of research on defending adversarial examples pay little attention to the real-world applications, either with high computational complexity or poor defensive effects. Motivated by this observation, we develop an efficient preprocessing module to defend adversarial attacks. Specifically, before an adversarial example is fed into the model, we perform two low-level image transformations, WebP compression and flip operation, on the picture. Then we can get a de-perturbed sample that can be correctly classified by DNNs. WebP compression is utilized to remove the small adversarial noises. Due to the introduction of loop filtering, there will be no square effect like JPEG compression, so the visual quality of the denoised image is higher. And flip operation, which flips the image once along one side of the image, destroys the specific structure of adversarial perturbations. By taking class activation mapping to localize the discriminative image regions, we show that flipping image may mitigate adversarial effects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art defense methods. It can effectively defend adversarial attacks while ensuring only slight accuracy drops on normal images.},

  abstract     = {Recent studies show that deep neural networks (DNNs) suffer adversarial examples. That is, attackers can mislead the output of a DNN by adding subtle perturbation to a benign input image. In addition, researchers propose new generation of technologies to produce robust adversarial examples. Robust adversarial examples can consistently fool DNN models under predefined hyperparameter space, which can break through some defenses against adversarial examples or even generate physical adversarial examples against real-world applications. Behind these achievements, expectation over transformation (EOT) algorithm plays as the backbone framework for generating robust adversarial examples. Though EOT framework is powerful, we know little about why such a framework can generate robust adversarial examples. To address this issue, we do the first work to explain the principle behind robust adversarial examples. Then, based on the findings, we point out that traditional EOT framework has a performance problem and propose an adaptive sampling algorithm to overcome such a problem. By modeling the sampling process as classic Coupon Collector Problem, we prove that our new framework reduces the cost from to , where denotes the number of sampling points. Under the view of computational complexity, the algorithm is optimal for this problem. The experimental results show that our algorithm can save up to 23\% overhead in average. This is significant for black-box attack, where the cost is charged by the amount of queries.},

However, the performance of the system (such as response time, network throughput, and resource utilization) may be greatly affected while the intelligent agents are engaged in cooperative work. Therefore, it is concerned to accomplish the distributed cooperation while ensuring the optimal performance of the intelligent system. In this paper, we investigated the optimal control problem of distributed multiagent systems (MASs) with finite-time group flocking movement. Specifically, we propose two optimal group flocking algorithms of MASs with single-integrator model and double-integrator model. Then, we study the group consensus of distributed MASs by using modern control theory and finite-time convergence theory, where the proposed optimal control algorithms can drive MASs to achieve the group convergence in finite-time while minimizing the performance index of the intelligence system. Finally, experimental simulation shows that MASs can keep the minimum energy function under the effect of optimal control algorithm, while the intelligent agents can follow the optimal trajectory to achieve group flocking in finite time.},

On the one hand, adversarial examples shed light on the decision-making process of these opaque models to interrogate the interpretability. On the other hand, interpretability can be used as a powerful tool to assist in the generation of adversarial examples by affording transparency on the relative contribution of each input feature to the final prediction. Recently, a post-hoc explanatory method, (LRP), shows significant value in instance-wise explanations. In this paper, we attempt to optimize the recently proposed (EAAs) on text classification models with LRP. We empirically show that LRP provides good explanations and benefits existing EAAs notably. Apart from that, we propose a LRP-based simple but effective EAA, . LRPTricker uses LRP to identify important words and subsequently performs typo-based perturbations on these words to generate the adversarial texts. The extensive experiments show that LRPTricker is able to reduce the performance of text classification models significantly with infinitesimal perturbations as well as lead to high scalability.},

  abstract     = {Exploiting label dependence is a widely used approach to boost classification performance for multilabel classification problems. However, most of the traditional label dependence methods have high time complexity, especially when combined with deep neural networks (DNNs). Thus they usually can not be efficiently applied in large-scale data sets. Recent advances in large-scale multilabel classification widely developed pair-wise ranking and structure-driven methods, but label dependence was little exploited. In most of the structure-driven methods, binary relevance (BR) with multiple binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss functions, a simple but effective method, is still the prior solution incorporation with DNNs in large-scale data sets. In this paper, we propose a novel loss function called label dependent cross-entropy (LDCE), which directly introduces label dependence to BCE loss function by data-driven conditional probability. Combined with deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), LDCE introduces no extra parameters and induces very little extra computational complexity. Moreover, we develop its tiny variant with sparse label dependence and its learnable version for automatic learning pair-wise label dependence. Within the BR scheme, LDCE outperforms BCE on seven widely used benchmark datasets. We also perform two large-scale multilabel image classification tasks (VOC 2007 and ChestX-ray14) with DCNNs, and LDCE outperforms BCE and achieves comparable results to the state-of-the-art.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, many versions of fuzzy sets are introduced in the literature. Spherical fuzzy sets (SFSs) concept is one of these latest developments. An SFS is a synthesis of Pythagorean fuzzy set (PFS) and neutrosophic set for providing a larger preference domain for experts and allowing them to express their hesitancy more comprehensively. The distinctive feature of SFSs is that the squared sum of membership, nonmembership, and hesitancy degrees is between 0 and 1 while each degree should be independently defined in [0,1]. The application of SFS on decision-making field may be about describing expert evaluations more informatively and explicitly. In this study, spherical fuzzy version of DEMATEL, one of the most cited multiple criteria decision-making approach, is introduced for considering the hesitancy degrees of experts when they evaluate the potential influences among the criteria. Another contribution made is the fuzzification of all the steps in DEMATEL until the last ones since the existing propositions in literature perform early defuzzification operations. The defuzzification is here applied as close to the end as possible for keeping the whole process fuzzy. The applicability of the proposition is shown in an illustrative example of a building contractor evaluation problem, and its robustness is shown by comparing the results with PFS-based and neutrosophic DEMATEL versions.},

To overcome this difficulty, a food production model with preservation technology and credit-linked demand under default risk of capital in uncertain environment is developed with the help of parametric approach and interval mathematics. In this proposed model, all the inventory parameters, including demand rate, production rate and deterioration rate are considered as interval-valued. Because of the consideration of demand rate, production rate as well as deterioration rate as interval-valued, to represent the proposed model mathematically, the interval differential equations have been used. Solving these differential equations by using parametric approach, all the cost components and the corresponding average profit are obtained in the form of intervals. Therefore, the optimization problem of this model becomes interval-optimization problem. Then, to solve the interval-optimization problem, the center-radius optimization technique is established with the help of interval order relations. With the help of this technique, the interval-optimization problem is converted into crisp problem and then it is solved numerically by using different variants (Gaussian Quantum-behaved Particle Swarm Optimization, Weighted Quantum-behaved Particle Swarm Optimization, and Adaptive Quantum-behaved Particle Swarm Optimization) of Quantum-behaved Particle Swarm Optimization technique. Some real-life problems are considered and solved to justify the validity of the proposed model. The same model is also analyzed in crisp environment to verify the result of interval environment. Finally, the sensitivity analyses of both crisp and interval environments are performed separately with respect to the different system parameters.},

  abstract     = {Large-scale data training is vital to the generalization performance of deep learning (DL) models. However, collecting data directly is associated with increased risk of privacy disclosure, particularly in special fields such as healthcare, finance, and genomics. To protect training data privacy, collaborative deep learning (CDL) has been proposed to enable joint training from multiple data owners while providing reliable privacy guarantee. However, recent studies have shown that CDL is vulnerable to several attacks that could reveal sensitive information about the original training data. One of the most powerful attacks benefits from the leakage from gradient sharing during collaborative training process. In this study, we present a new CDL framework, to effectively protect private training data against leakage from gradient sharing. Unlike conventional training process that trains on private data directly, allows effective transfer of relational knowledge from sensitive data to public data in a privacy-preserving way, and enables participants to jointly learn local models based on the public data with noise-preserving labels. This way, establishes a privacy gap between the local models and the private datasets, thereby ensuring privacy against the attacks launched to the local models through gradient sharing. Moreover, we propose a new algorithm called Distributed Aggregation Stochastic Gradient Descent, which is designed to improve the efficiency and accuracy of CDL, especially in the asynchronous training mode. Experimental results demonstrate that preserves data privacy with reasonable performance overhead.},

  abstract     = {Recently, many researchers have studied some types of sets which are extension of fuzzy sets widely. Some of them are interval-valued fuzzy set, intuitionistic fuzzy sets, type-2 fuzzy sets, type- fuzzy sets, hesitant fuzzy sets (HFSs), dual fuzzy sets, and neutrosophic sets. In solving decision-making problems, these sets have more advantages than classical sets. In this paper, we introduce a new concept called dual type-2 hesitant fuzzy sets (DT2HFSs) by combining concepts of the dual HFS and the type-2 fuzzy set. Then we give correlation coefficient formulas and weighted correlation coefficient formulas between two DT2HFSs and obtain some results related to the proposed correlation coefficient formulas. On the basis of the proposed correlation coefficient formulas, we develop the clustering method under DT2HF environment. Finally, we present an application of the proposed method for a problem to illustrate the process and validate the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {In the process of decision making (DM), to have more freedom in expressing DM experts&#39; belief about membership and nonmembership grade, Yager presented the q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets (q-ROFSs) as an extension of fuzzy sets. Recently, for aggregating discrete and continuous q-ROF information, many scholars provided various aggregation operators. However, there are still some kinds of continuous q-ROF information cannot be aggregated through existing aggregation operators. In this paper, we present two novel kinds of line integrals under the q-rung orthopair fuzzy environment (q-ROFE), which supply a wider range on method choice for multiple attribute decision making (MADM) concerning discrete or continuous q-ROF information. We first construct the first form of line integral under the q-ROFE and study their properties, we prove the specific condition mean valued theorem but negate the general condition for it. Besides, several inequalities with regard to it are also provided. After that, we give two characterization forms of the second form of line integral under the q-ROFE, we study the relationship between two kinds of line integrals. What is more important, we show the Green formula under q-ROFE, which connect the existing q-rung orthopair fuzzy integration theory. Afterward, we provide two kinds of aggregation operators on the basis of two line integrals, respectively. As their applications, we give two novel MADM methods based on two kinds of line integral aggregation operators. And some examples are shown to demonstrate the aggregation process of line integral operators. We not only stress their availabilities and superiorities on aggregating continuous q-ROF information, but also comparing with other existing aggregation methods for emphasizing the novel methods&#39; abilities when deal with abnormal q-ROF information.},

  abstract     = {In group decision making (GDM), the quality of the solution relies primarily on the quality and the expertize of decision makers. At that point, deriving the weights, which reflects their importance or perceived reliability of decision makers, presents as a new challenge. In addition to that, the uncertainty is also a common problem for GDM. These problems are also faced in the sensor fusion problem where information from multiple sources must be aggregated. Therefore, in this study, a large scale GDM approach for sensor fusion is proposed. Since the proposed method is a clustering-based method, it provides acceptable results in the sensor networks consisting of multiple sensors. It can work under uncertainty as a result of converting the raw data obtained from sensors to the basic probability assignments. It also considers the reliability of the sensors clusters by assigning three objective weights. In addition to these objective weights, the proposed method enables to assign subjective weights to integrate supervisors/intelligence analyst experiences and knowledge in the problem field. The applicability and the validity of the proposed method are checked through two real classification data sets: ionosphere and forest type mapping data set. Experiments show that the classification rate is increased significantly when the proposed method is applied to two data sets. Finally, effect of extension parameter, objective weights, reliability threshold, number of clusters and clustering method on the classification rate and the detection probability are examined, and future studies are provided in conclusion.},

The most crucial issue in decision making based on IFSSs is how to derive the ranking of alternatives from the information quantified in terms of intuitionistic fuzzy values. In this study, we propose a new extension of the preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation (PROMETHEE), by taking advantage of IFSSs. In addition to presenting a myriad of new notions, such as intuitionistic fuzzy membership (or nonmembership) deviation matrices, intuitionistic fuzzy membership (or nonmembership) preference matrices, and aggregated intuitionistic fuzzy preference matrices, we put more emphasis on the construction of three distinct preference structures and related utility functions on the corresponding weakly ordered sets by considering the positive, negative, and net flows of the alternatives based on the aggregated intuitionistic fuzzy preference matrix. We present a new algorithm for solving multiple attribute decision-making problems with the extended PROMETHEE method based on IFSSs. Moreover, a benchmark problem concerning risk investment is investigated to give a comparative analysis and show the feasibility of our approach.},

Because of innovative progressions and regularly expanding human progress, there is a diligent requirement of power. Close by the ordinary energy sources, renewable energy sources have likewise lead significantly to the rising power requirement. All over the world in the past, a number of small hydropower plants (SHPPs) have been developed, as a renewable energy source. Generally, these SHPPs are being manufactured and worked by the private designers consenting to the administration rules. So as to help a designer in choosing the most productive and doable SHPP for development and consequent activity, the concept of the intuitionistic cubic fuzzy set (ICFS) theory is established and a few important operations for ICFSs are characterized, and also a strategy dependent on intuitionistic cubic fuzzy Hamacher hybrid averaging (ICFHHA) operator, intuitionistic cubic fuzzy Hamacher order weighted averaging (ICFHOWA) operator, and intuitionistic cubic fuzzy Hamacher weighted averaging (ICFHWA) operators is utilized in the present paper. The financial criteria and technobusiness, as assumed for examining the practicality of the candidate SHPPs, are presented qualitatively utilizing intuitionistic cubic fuzzy numbers (ICFNs). Further study their fundamental properties and the relationship among these aggregation operators. Developed group decision-making (DM) algorithm under intuitionistic cubic fuzzy (ICF) environment. An interpretative case for the analysis of SHPP for construction is given to demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of the mentioned new techniques. Further validate its effectiveness and benefits via a comparative analysis with pre-existing aggregation operators, and the outcomes demonstrate that the proposed SHPP determination model has some special favorable circumstances, which is progressively practical and adaptable for SHPP choice under a complex and uncertain environment.},

This representation treats a BPA as a point in the -dimensional space. A new vector and geometry interpretation of BPA is proposed in this paper. The BPA on a -dimension FOD is represented as -dimension vector with parameters in this method. Then BPA is expressed as subset of -dimension Cartesian space rather than a point. The proposed method is a new way to represent BPA with vector and geometry. The essence of this method is to convert BPA to probability distribution with parameters. The applications of this representation method in D-S theory have been studied. Based on this method, problems in D-S theory can be solved, which include the fusion of BPAs, the distance between BPAs, the correspondence between BPA and probability, and the entropy of BPAs.},

In many problems, however, the data are highly imbalanced in regard to different classes or does not have good coverage of the feasible data space which, in turn, creates problems in validation and usage phase. In this paper, we propose a technique for synthesizing feasible and likely data to help balance the classes as well as to boost the performance in terms of confusion matrix as well as overall. The idea, in a nutshell, is to synthesize data samples in close vicinity to the actual data samples specifically for the less represented (minority) classes. This has also implications to the so-called fairness of machine learning. In this paper, we propose a specific method for synthesizing data in a way to balance the classes and boost the performance, especially of the minority classes. It is generic and can be applied to different base algorithms, for example, support vector machines, -nearest neighbour classifiers deep neural, rule-based classifiers, decision trees, and so forth. The results demonstrated that (a) a significantly more balanced (and fair) classification results can be achieved and (b) that the overall performance as well as the performance per class measured by confusion matrix can be boosted. In addition, this approach can be very valuable for the cases when the number of actual available labelled data is small which itself is one of the problems of the contemporary machine learning.},

  abstract     = {The partitioned Bonferroni mean (PBM) operator, which was oriented as an elementary attempt to outstretch the Bonferroni mean (BM) operator, has enlarged the class of BM-type aggregation operators for information accumulation by modeling interrelationship among pairwise disjoint partition sets with the presupposition that the criteria of intra-partition are homogeneously related to each other, while no relationship exists among criteria of inter-partition. Although PBM has encountered a lot of attraction from the researchers due to its versatility in information aggregation technique, the principal disadvantage of the existing PBM definitions evolution is that they do not provide any specification regarding the relationship among criteria of partition structure during design, development, and applications of PBM over unalike situations of information fusion. This consideration propels us to focus on the systematic investigation of different variations of PBM operators based on various mandatory requisites to be imposed on information retrieved from the partition sets. In this regard, we propose the construction of novel generalized partitioned Bonferroni mean (GPBM) operator by befitting its suitable components to provide a descriptive configuration, which is quite interpretable, understandable and thus facilitates the ability to model specific mandatory prerequisites in a single operator. To enrich the capacity for modeling real-life decision situations, the PBM operator is customized to propose optional partitioned Bonferroni mean (OPBM) operator that captures partition-wise interrelationship among attributes while taking into consideration optional conditions jumbled in each partition set. Furthermore, we demonstrate the construction methodology of generalized OPBM operator that amalgamate the concept of GPBM and OPBM operator to enhance and model-specific requirements along with optional requirements as per the desires of decision makers.},

Recently, Song et al proposed a new soft-likelihood function based on the power ordered weighted average (POWA) operator. However, through analysis, we find Song et al&#39;s method has the following two shortcomings: (a) The weight of POWA cannot comprehensively reflect the relation between probability and OWA operator. (b) The soft-likelihood function does not reflect the preferences of decision makers. To overcome the above problem, we propose a modified soft-likelihood function.

Moreover, it allows decision makers to offer effectively handle uncertain information more flexible than intuitionistic linguistic sets (ILSs) when one compares two alternatives in the process of decision making. Some of the fundamental operational laws, score, accuracy, and aggregation operators are defined, and their properties are investigated. Preference relation (PR) is a useful and efficient tool for decision making that only requires the decision makers to compare two alternatives at one time. Taking the advantages of PLSs and PRs, this paper also introduces Pythagorean linguistic preference relations (PLPRs) and studies their application. We propose an approach for group decision making using group recommendations based on consistency matrices and feedback mechanism. First, the proposed method constructs the collective consistency matrix, the weight collective PRs, and the group collective PRs. Then, it constructs a consensus relation for each expert and determines the group consensus degree (GCD) for all experts. If the GCD is smaller than a predefined threshold value, then a feedback mechanism is activated to update the PLPRs. Finally, after the GCD is greater than or equal to the predefined threshold value, we calculate the arithmetic mathematical average values of the updated group collective PR to select the most appropriate alternative.},

  abstract     = {In the process of online shopping, consumers usually compare the review information of the same product in different e-commerce platforms. The sentiment orientation of online reviews from different platforms interactively influences on consumers’ purchase decision. However, due to the limitation of the ability to process information manually, it is difficult for a consumer to accurately identify the sentiment orientation of all reviews one by one and describe the process of their interactive influence. To this end, we proposed an online shopping support model using deep-learning–based opinion mining and -rung orthopair fuzzy interaction weighted Heronian mean (-ROFIWHM) operators. First, in the proposed method, the deep-learning model is used to automatically extract different product attribute words and opinion words from online reviews, and match the corresponding attribute-opinion pairs; meanwhile, the sentiment dictionary is used to calculate sentiment orientation, including positive, negative, and neutral sentiments. Second, the proportions of the three kinds of sentiments about each attribute of the same product are calculated. According to the proportion value of attribute sentiment from different platforms, the sentiment information is converted into multiple cross-decision matrices, which are represented by the -rung orthopair fuzzy set. Third, considering the interactive characteristics of decision matrix, the ROFIWHM operators are proposed to aggregate this cross-decision information, and then the ranking result was determined by score function to support consumers&#39; purchase decisions. Finally, an actual example of mobile phone purchase is given to verify the rationality of the proposed method, and the sensitivity and the comparison analysis are used to show its effectiveness and superiority.},

In the present communication, we study the divergence and entropy measures under the -rung orthopair fuzzy environment. First, the work defines two new order-α divergence measures for ROPFSs to quantify the information of discrimination between two ROPFSs. We also examine several mathematical properties associated with order-α ROPF divergence measures in detail. Second, the paper introduces two new parametric entropy functions called “order-α ROPF entropy measures” to measure the degree of fuzziness associated with a ROPFS. We show that the proposed order-α divergence and entropy measures include several existing divergence and entropy measures as their particular cases. Further, the paper develops a new decision-making approach to solve multiple attribute group decision-making problems under the ROPF environment where the information about the attribute weights is completely unknown or partially known. Finally, an example of selecting the best enterprise resource planning system is provided to illustrate the decision-making steps and effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

First, the operational laws of adjusted PLq-ROFSs based on linguistic scale function (LSF) for semantics of linguistic terms are introduced, where the PLq-ROFSs have same probability space. In addition, we define the score function and accuracy function of PLq-ROFS based on the proposed operational laws to compare the PLq-ROFSs. Furthermore, we propose the probabilistic linguistic q-rung orthopair fuzzy weighted averaging (PLq-ROFWA) operator and the probabilistic linguistic q-rung orthopair fuzzy order weighted averaging (PLq-ROFOWA) operator to aggregate the linguistic decision information. Considering the inconsistency between the individual information and aggregated information in decision-making process and the demiddle of given linguistic sets tocision makers&#39; behavioral factors, we define a new correlation measure based on LSF to develop a consensus reaching process for fuzzy behavioral TOPSIS method with PLq-ROFSs. Finally, a numerical example concerning the selection of optimal green enterprise is given to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed method and some comparative analyses with the existing methods are given to show its effectiveness. The sensitivity analysis and stability analysis of the proposed method on the ranking results are also discussed.},

  abstract     = {The social network group decision-making is popular due to the advantages of social relationships in the consensus reaching process, especially the trust relationships. To explore the effects of trust on consensus, some minimum cost consensus models are proposed based on implicit trust between individuals and the moderator. The implicit trust is computed based on the similarity of opinions and it is implied into the traditional minimum cost consensus model to obtain a new quadratic programming problem and the related dual problem. The weights of individuals can be determined based on implicit trust and can be used to modify the possible deviations among individuals’ adjustment costs. A numerical example and the comparative analysis are given to analyze the effectiveness of the proposed models, which suggests that individuals are willing to give up some benefit to reach consensus due to their implicit trust to the moderator and make minor revisions to their adjustment costs due to their implicit trust to each other.},

Considering the fact that much valuable information related to the cognitive behavior of DMs is hidden in the original evaluation information, this paper studies how to comprehensively mine uncertain information from original hesitant fuzzy linguistic evaluation information given by DMs. To address this objective, we present a new representation tool, normal wiggly hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (NWHFLTS), which not only retains the original evaluation information, but also delivers and quantifies potential uncertain information, and can also help DMs express their evaluation information in a more complete manner. First, we develop the basic operations, score function, and comparison rule of NWHFLTS based on linguistic scale functions (LSFs), and propose the projection measure, the normal projection measure, and the normalized projection-based distance measure to describe the degree of deviation between two NWHFLTSs. Furthermore, for the case when the attribute weight is completely unknown, we combine the multiattributive border approximation area comparison (MABAC) method and develop a new method called as normal wiggly hesitant fuzzy linguistic projection-based MABAC to solve the multiattribute decision-making problems where attribute values are expressed in the form of NWHFLTS. Finally, through a practical example of marine ecological security situation, the specific calculation steps of this method are exemplified, the feasibility and advancement of the proposed method are demonstrated via a comprehensive comparative study.},

  abstract     = {The qualitative flexible multiple criteria method (QUALIFLEX) is a convenient outranking technique to handle multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) problems due to its less complexity and high applicability, while the multiple criteria hierarchy process (MCHP) allows decision makers to deal with the hierarchical structure of criteria set where decision makers can even estimate results for a particular subcriterion at some intermediate level of the hierarchy. The main focus of our study is the amalgamation of the MCHP and QUALIFLEX methodology with special emphasis on modeling interaction among the criteria using the concept of bipolar Choquet integral. To give the decision makers more freedom for expressing their cognition about membership and nonmembership grades, the q-rung orthopair fuzzy (q-ROF) environment is adopted to expresses the criteria measurement. To facilitate this, it is first proposed a revised closeness index for q-ROF to identify the appropriate ordering. Further, it is aimed to establish a new framework by implementing stochastic multiobjective acceptability analysis in our proposed extended QUALIFLEX method to take into account a variety of parameters compatible with the descriptive information regarding the relative importance and interaction of different criteria provided by the decision maker. Finally, a numerical example based on the supplier selection problem is presented to illustrate the proposed methodology in the decision problem.},

Monotonicity is a basic property of capacity, which means that the marginal contribution of any single criterion to any subset of criteria is always nonnegative. In this paper, we present the capacity-based decision making theory in terms of marginal contributions, which provides an alternative perspective to this widely used decision making strategy. We construct the marginal contribution representations of the equivalent transformations of capacities, some particular capacities, three types of nonlinear integrals, and discuss the capacity identification methods. We also introduce some new concepts and representations, such as nonadditivity and nonmodularity indices, 0 to 1 variables-based linear constraints of k-maxitive capacity, a special representation of the Choquet integral and pan integral. We discuss constraints on marginal contributions which ensure supermodularity of capacities. Finally, an illustrative example is given to show the use of marginal contribution presentation in capacity-based decision making methods.},

The main advantages of these aggregation operators are that they can capture the interrelationships of multiple attributes among any number of attributes by a parameter vector and make the information aggregation process more flexible by the parameter vector . In addition, some of the properties of these new aggregation operators are proved and some special cases are discussed where the parameter vector takes some different values. Moreover, we present two new methods to solve MADM problems with Pythagorean fuzzy linguistic information. Finally, an illustrative example is provided to show the feasibility and validity of the new methods, to investigate the influences of parameter vector on decision-making results, and also to analyze the advantages of the proposed methods by comparing them with the other existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Understanding consumer behaviors and how consumers react to marketing campaigns and viral word-of-mouth processes is crucial for marketers. Classical approaches try to infer this information from a global top-down perspective. However, a more suitable and natural approach is to model consumer behaviors in a heterogeneous and decentralized bottom-up approach. In this case, each virtual consumer has her own mental state and decision-making strategies to simulate her purchase decisions. The system of virtual consumers generates the global sales and a marketer can understand the rules that govern the market. A well-known paradigm to model these systems is agent-based modeling (ABM). In this manuscript we present an ABM where the brand preferences of the consumer agents are modeled using 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic variables. These variables represent the perceptions these consumers have on the different aspects or drivers every product available in the market has (e.g., price or quality). The product selection process of the agents is based on those perceptions and a utility maximization rule. This rule requires a fuzzy aggregation of the fuzzy linguistic perceptions about the products. Our proposal employs an ordered weighted average (OWA) to aggregate them. Our experiments show this approach does not suffer any loss of information when applied on data from real markets. Hence it is a suitable representation of the products preferences, normally represented by qualitative values in marketing surveys. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work integrating a marketing ABM with fuzzy linguistic modeling.},

  abstract     = {The linguistic intuitionistic fuzzy sets (LIFSs) and linguistic Pythagorean fuzzy sets (LPFSs) are two linguistic orthopair fuzzy sets whose membership grades are pairs of linguistic terms from the predefined linguistic term sets (LTSs). One linguistic term indicates the membership degree (MD), while the other one gives the nonmembership degree (NMD). In each LIFS, the sum of the subscripts of MD and NMD is less than the cardinality of LTS. In the LPFSs, the sum of the squares of the subscripts of MD and NMD is less than the square of the cardinality of LTS. In this paper, we propose a general form of these two linguistic orthopair fuzzy sets, which can be named linguistic rung orthopair fuzzy sets. We devise the operational laws, based on which, the linguistic rung orthopair fuzzy weighted averaging (LqROFWA) operator and linguistic rung orthopair fuzzy weighted geometric (LqROFWG) operator are developed to aggregate the linguistic rung orthopair fuzzy numbers (LqROFNs). Then, the novel interactional operational laws that consider the interactions between the MD and NMD from different LqROFNs are given. The partitioned geometric Heronian mean (PGHM) operator can effectively solve the decision-making problems in which the attributes grouped into the same clusters have interrelationships and the attributes belonging to different clusters have no interrelationship. Based on these novel operational laws and PGHM operator, the linguistic rung orthopair fuzzy interactional PGHM (LqROFIPGHM) operator and linguistic rung orthopair fuzzy interactional weighted PGHM (LqROFIWPGHM) operator are proposed and their properties are discussed. Based on the LqROFIWPGHM operator, an efficient multiattribute group decision-making model is given to deal with the linguistic rung orthopair fuzzy information. Finally, the superiorities of the interactional operational laws and LqROFIWPGHM operator are tested using some illustrative examples.},

  abstract     = {The power Bonferroni mean (PBM) operator can relieve the influence of unreasonable aggregation values and also capture the interrelationship among the input arguments, which is an important generalization of power average operator and Bonferroni mean operator, and Pythagorean fuzzy set is an effective mathematical method to handle imprecise and uncertain information. In this paper, we extend PBM operator to integrate Pythagorean fuzzy numbers (PFNs) based on the interaction operational laws of PFNs, and propose Pythagorean fuzzy interaction PBM operator and weighted Pythagorean fuzzy interaction PBM operator. These new Pythagorean fuzzy interaction PBM operators can capture the interactions between the membership and nonmembership function of PFNs and retain the main merits of the PBM operator. Then, we analyze some desirable properties and particular cases of the presented operators. Further, a new multiple attribute decision making method based on the proposed method has been presented. Finally, a numerical example concerning the evaluation of online payment service providers is provided to illustrate the validity and merits of the new method by comparing it with the existing methods.},

  abstract     = {The concept of -rung orthopair fuzzy set (-ROFS) is the extension of intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) in which the sum of the th power of the support for and the th power of the support against is bounded by one. Therefore, the -ROFSs are an important way to express uncertain information in broader space, and they are superior to the IFSs and the Pythagorean fuzzy sets. In this paper, the familiarity degree of the experts with the evaluated objects is incorporated to the initial assessments under -rung orthopair fuzzy environment. For this, some aggregation operators are proposed to combine these two types of information. Their some important properties are also well proved. Furthermore, these developed operators are utilized in a multicriteria decision-making approach and demonstrated with a real life problem of customers&#39; choice. Then, the experimental results are compared with other existing methods to show its superiority over recent research works.},

As an initial idea, the set operations on are put forward, the properties of such operations are also discussed. With traditional soft set based decision procedure and fuzzy soft set based decision procedure, a novel linguistic Z-number fuzzy soft set based group decision procedure is developed to solve multiattribute group decision making with linguistic Z-numbers. Wherein an extended technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution is also developed.

The association coefficient as the opposite of the conflict coefficient is also used to measure the conflict. The larger the association coefficient, the smaller the conflict degree, and the higher the similarity between the evidence bodies, and vice versa. In this paper, the degree of association is defined by Deng Entropy, and a new association coefficient is proposed based on the basic inequality. The nature of the new association coefficient and conflict coefficients is explored using examples. Finally, the association coefficient combined with the D-S combination rule is applied to the target recognition system, and accurate results are obtained.},

Inspired by Yager&#39;s negation of probability distribution, an extension model to measure the negation of a probability distribution is proposed using the idea of a nonextensive statistic based on Tsallis entropy. Proofs show that the proposed extension of negation of probability distribution converges to the maximum Tsallis entropy. The proposed model may extend Yager&#39;s method to consider the influences of the correlations in a system, which gives the different convergent routes. Some numerical simulation results are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.},

  abstract     = {The q-rung orthopair fuzzy set is characterized by membership and nonmembership functions, and the sum of the th power of them is less than or equal to one. Since it releases the constraints existed in both intuitionistic fuzzy set and Pythagorean fuzzy set, it has wide applications in real cases. However, so far, there is little research on the multiplicative consistency of q-rung orthopair fuzzy preference relation (q-ROFPR). To fill this vacancy, this paper provides a detailed analysis on the multiplicative consistency of q-ROFPR. First, we investigate the concept of multiplicative consistent q-ROFPR and its properties. Subsequently, two goal programming models are proposed to derive the priorities from individual and group q-ROFPRs, respectively. After that, a novel consistency-improving algorithm for q-ROFPR and a weight-generating method for decision-makers are discussed in detail, based on which, a novel group decision-making method is proposed. Finally, a case study concerning the evaluation of rehabilitation program selection is given to illustrate the applicability of the proposed method. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method are verified by comparing it with some existing methods.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a new tool, called -rung orthopair uncertain linguistic numbers (-ROULNs), is developed and a new multiattribute group decision making (MAGDM) method for -ROULNs is proposed. First, the concept of -rung orthopair uncertain linguistic sets (-ROULSs) is introduced, and some operational laws, expected function, accuracy function, and distance measure of -ROULSs are defined. Further, to effectively aggregate -ROULNs, we take advantage of partitioned Heronian mean operator and power average operator and propose the -rung orthopair uncertain linguistic power partitioned Heronian mean operator and its weighted form. The proposed operators not only deal with this situations where attributes are divided into several parts and attributes in the same part are interrelated each other, whereas attributes in different parts have no relationship, but also reduce the negative influence of unreasonable attribute values provided by decision makers on final results. Some desirable properties and special cases of the proposed operators are also investigated. Finally, a MAGDM method based on the proposed operators is developed and a numerical instance as well as comparative analysis is conducted to illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method.},
