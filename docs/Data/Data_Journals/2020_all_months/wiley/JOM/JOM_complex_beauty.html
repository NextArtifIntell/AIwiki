  abstract     = {While opportunism has been a focus of transaction cost economics, perceived opportunism, where one party is perceived to be acting opportunistically when there is no opportunistic intent, can also lead to increased transaction costs in an exchange. In this study, consistent with forms of opportunism observed in our context of manufacturing outsourcing, we examine two different forms of perceived opportunism—perceived poaching and shirking. As narratives of the hidden costs of outsourcing discuss concerns of suppliers in emerging economies engaging in poaching and shirking, we examine if the level of economic development where a supplier operates affects perceptions of supplier poaching and shirking and also examine if the supplier&#39;s competitive priorities moderate those perceptions. To empirically test these relationships, we combine archival data of location characteristics with a dyadic primary dataset that captures perceived supplier opportunism, self-reported supplier opportunism, and other relationship characteristics. Our findings illustrate that perceived opportunism and opportunism are distinct constructs and that more observable forms of opportunism (i.e., shirking) affect perceived opportunism more than less observable forms of opportunism (i.e., poaching). We also find that, in existing relationships, manufacturers in advanced economies perceive poaching to be more strongly related to the level of economic development where a supplier operates than shirking. Finally, we find that while a cost focus can mitigate perceptions of poaching, an innovation focus exacerbates them. Overall, our study illustrates the challenges that innovation-focused suppliers in emerging economies face in regards to competing with suppliers in advanced economies.},

  abstract     = {The last decade has witnessed a sharp rising trend in environmental awareness and protection in China. Green supply chain management (GSCM) has been regarded as an effective tool in China for mitigating the negative effects that firms have on the environment. However, the extent to which GSCM pressures influence GSCM practices, and whether and how GSCM practices affect GSCM performance are topics that remain under-explored. Combining Institutional Theory, Resource-Based View (RBV) Theory, and the literature on GSCM, our study sheds light on the relationship among GSCM pressures, practices, and performance under the moderating effect of quick response (QR) technology. Using statistical analysis of the collected data and case studies from companies in China, we establish several results. First, among different GSCM pressures, market and export pressures have significant impacts on GSCM practices, whereas cost pressure does not influence GSCM practices significantly. Second, internal improvement practice exerts a significant impact on GSCM practices, while external improvement practice negatively affects positive economic performance. In addition, ecology practice has significantly influenced environmental, positive economic, and operational performance. Third, QR technology suppresses the positive effect between internal improvement practice and negative economic performance. Two real cases from Huawei (telecommunications technologies) and Beijing Benz Automotive (automobile manufacturing) are conducted to verify the findings and generate additional insights. Our findings contribute to the literature and provide guidance to help governments and companies establish effective and innovative GSCM policies.},

We use signaling theory to explain how supplier ties affect a purchasing manager&#39;s perception of suppliers. Three types of supplier ties are considered: ties with external innovation partners, with customers outside the buying firm&#39;s industry, and with the buying firm&#39;s competitors. We posit that managers use supplier ties as signals to indicate a supplier&#39;s potential in contributing to innovation novelty or information protection. Results from two scenario-based experiments with practicing managers support most of our hypotheses. When innovation novelty is the goal, managers perceive other-industry customer ties and external innovation ties as positive signals, while competitor ties as a negative signal. When information protection is the goal, all three types of ties are perceived negatively. When both goals are considered, information protection has a greater influence than innovation novelty on the final supplier selection likelihood.},

  abstract     = {This study contributes to a theoretical and empirical understanding of whether and how administrative environmental innovations (AEIs)—implemented to help track and manage a firm&#39;s environmental impacts—are related to environmental disclosure. Drawing on the Belief–Action–Outcome framework, we posit that the motivation of individuals (employees, managers, and the leadership) within the firm to access, use, and act on the environmental information available to them would be enhanced by the firm&#39;s implementation of AEIs, resulting in more extensive environmental disclosure by the firm. Additionally, building on the literature on supply chain networks, we posit that the structural position of the firm vis-à-vis its supply network—reflecting information flows, network learning, and status—moderates the AEI implementation–environmental disclosure relationship. To test our hypotheses, we build a multi-industry dataset of 3,106 firm-year observations based on 67,809 dyadic cost-of-goods-sold-based relationships obtained from Bloomberg&#39;s supply chain relationships database to construct the supply networks of focal firms. We also draw on Bloomberg&#39;s environmental, social, and governance (ESG) data for our AEI implementation and environmental disclosure measures. We find significant evidence to support our hypothesis that AEI implementation is positively associated with the extent of environmental disclosure. However, the implementation of both internal and external forms of AEIs has a more pronounced positive relationship with the extent of environmental disclosure, compared to the implementation of either form alone. With regard to supply network structure , we identify three principal variables— accessibility , control , and interconnectedness —that influence network learning and status of the focal firm and find that they moderate the AEI implementation–environmental disclosure relationship. We provide insights for theory and practice based on our findings.},

Addressing this gap, we investigate how two key components of a firm&#39;s network position—network centrality and structural holes—affect both product and confidentiality performance. To do this, we assemble a panel of 1,468 electronic video games designed and developed by 591 developers over an 11-year period. We find that higher network centrality relates to better product performance but worse confidentiality performance. Meanwhile, firms spanning more structural holes enjoy better performance across both dimensions. In an exploratory analysis, we find that product novelty strengthens the positive relationship between network centrality and product performance but mutes the positive relationship between structural holes and product performance.

Although the relationship between the supply network structure and innovation has been investigated, the link between supply network complexity and a firm&#39;s innovation remains unexplored. By employing transaction cost economics and the concept of a recombinatory search, we propose that the complexity dimensions (horizontal, vertical, and spatial complexity) of a supply network impact the innovation performance of a firm and that such relationships are moderated by a strategic emphasis on value creation and the influence of the firm over the supply network. With a large-scale network data of 201 firms across six industries and 20 countries, we take a robust empirical approach that accounts for endogeneity, unobserved heterogeneity and intrafirm error correlation to test our theory. We find strong support for a nonlinear relationship (with diminishing growth) between both horizontal and vertical complexity with respect to innovation performance. We find that spatial complexity is negatively related to innovation performance. Additionally, we find that a firm&#39;s strategic emphasis and its influence indeed moderates the link between the complexity dimensions and innovation performance. Based on our findings, we offer specific managerial guidance for the effective implementation of sourcing practices.},

However, not all innovative suppliers are equally valuable for an OEM. When transforming novel inventions into products, OEMs could find it challenging to work with the suppliers with whom they lack trust or have limited shared understanding. In this study, we adopt a social capital perspective to understand how three types of social capital (i.e., structural, relational, and cognitive) influence a supplier&#39;s innovation value to the OEM. Hypotheses are tested using a unique data set combining the supply network structure and automotive supplier innovation award. Our results suggest that it is more difficult to obtain innovation value from a new or culturally distant foreign supplier. However, we also found that suppliers whose networks overlap more with the OEM&#39;s network are more likely to provide valuable innovations to the OEM, an effect that is stronger for culturally distant suppliers. This study contributes to the supply network and innovation literature by highlighting the importance of understanding the dyadic social capital between the buyer and supplier when evaluating innovation value of a supplier to a buying firm.},

Specifically, we investigate how supplier degree centrality influences the generation of supplier–supplier innovations, and the extent to which this relationship is moderated by the structural embeddedness of firms in the supply network. Using data from the Toyota supply network, the results reveal that a firm&#39;s ability to co-develop supplier–supplier innovations with other network members depends on its number of ties and their direction within the supply network. Although betweenness centrality has no significant moderating effect, closeness centrality, and embeddedness in small world clusters negatively moderate the relationship between supplier degree centrality and supplier–supplier innovations. Additionally, the number of manufacturing plants a firm operates in Japan strengthens the positive effect supplier degree centrality has on the development of supplier–supplier innovations.},

In this research, we focus on a firm&#39;s supply base, defined as the first tier of a supply network, and investigate the relationship between the intensity of R&amp;D within the supply base and the financial performance of the focal firm. We also examine the moderating role of three aspects of supply base complexity—Number of suppliers, differentiation, and inter-relationships among suppliers. Utilizing secondary data from Bloomberg and Compustat, we find that the R&amp;D intensity of a firm&#39;s supply base is positively associated with the firm&#39;s financial performance. Further, all three aspects of supply base complexity negatively moderate this relationship. These findings make important contributions to the literature by establishing a direct, positive relationship between supply base R&amp;D and firm financial performance, which is attenuated by complexities within the supply base.},

To address this disconnect, we introduce a new approach to strategic sourcing, “total value contribution” (TVC). The TVC name by itself promotes attention to value. TVC&#39;s structured approach begins with the question: “what do our customers, current and future, value about our products?” The TVC approach builds on insights from the literature on individual and group decision-making to offset human biases and organizational incentives that emphasize cost reduction. TVC builds on gains already achieved by “total cost of ownership” (TCO) sourcing methods, which broadened the list of factors considered in sourcing. We provide examples of TVC-like thinking in real organizations and argue that such thinking would be more common with the dissemination of TVC. We also provide access to a version of this JOM Forum piece suitable to assign to students, and discuss a new teaching note which describes how to implement TVC in a popular strategic sourcing teaching case. We believe widespread implementation of TVC would improve both organizational and social outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Carbon transparency, once a niche practice, is increasingly becoming institutionalized. Firms are now required to report not only their operations&#39; carbon emissions but also their suppliers&#39;. This research explores the institutional pressures emanating from buyers and industry peers driving supplier firms to disclose high-quality carbon emission publicly—our concept of carbon transparency. Many firms are increasingly adopting incentives to engage their employees in corporate climate change programs. Thus, we study the impact of three institutional pressures— coercive , mimetic , and normative —and examine when these pressures are more (or less) effective for driving supplier carbon transparency depending on the presence of climate change incentives. We used Carbon Disclosure Project&#39;s supply chain program (CDP-SCP) as our research context. To gain deeper insight into the CDP-SCP as well as the drivers and challenges of suppliers&#39; carbon transparency, we conducted interviews with three CDP officials, three CDP-SCP members (i.e., buyers), and six CDP-SCP participants (i.e., suppliers). To test our hypotheses, we used a unique dataset from CDP-SCP and complemented it with four other archival datasets for a sample of 835 suppliers operating in 41 countries during the 2013–2015 period. The results show that suppliers without climate change incentives are more vulnerable to coercive and mimetic pressures, whereas suppliers with climate change incentives are more receptive to normative pressure in terms of how much carbon transparency they exhibit. Thus, our study proposes an extensive concept of supplier carbon transparency, provides a comprehensive analysis of its external/internal drivers, and reveals when institutional pressures are more/less effective in eliciting supplier carbon transparency. This research also provides strategies for how buyers, suppliers, and CDP can foster more carbon transparency in supply chains.},

Social network theory suggests that buyer–supplier relationships are influenced by networks of ties in which they are embedded. While prior research has concentrated on networks of trade interactions, we instead examine the influences of networks through common investors. Utilizing a large sample of buyer–supplier relationships, we find that the presence of CIIs improves suppliers&#39; operating and market performance, especially for suppliers with greater dependence on buyers. In addition, supplier performance increases with the common ownership stakes held by CIIs, but decreases with the asymmetric ownership stakes of CIIs across supply chain partners. We find that better financial collaboration between the partners appears to be a mechanism through which CIIs enhance supplier performance. Lastly, we find that the role of CIIs in strengthening supplier performance is distinct from that of direct equity links. Collectively, our findings highlight a novel role of indirect cross-ownership in fostering supply chain collaboration and coordinating vertical relationships and, in turn, improving supplier performance.},

  abstract     = {We build upon supply chain management and social media research by exploring the Twitter response to supply chain glitches and how this response may moderate the relationship between supply chain glitches and stock market returns. We analyze data on 213 supply chain glitches for 150 firms across 5 years and over 2 billion tweets on publicly traded firms. Leveraging event study methodology, we find support for our hypotheses. Using both volume and sentiment of tweets, we observe significant reactions on Twitter after supply chain glitches; tweet volume increases and tweets become more negative. We also find that Twitter reactions after a glitch accentuate the relationship between supply chain glitches and stock market returns, demonstrating how social media may elevate the prominence of supply chain problems. To address concerns associated with simultaneity bias, we demonstrate that pre-stock-market-open Twitter activity preempts post-stock-market-open returns. Finally, we conduct post hoc analyses that explore how firms can leverage Twitter to counteract the negative stock market consequences of Twitter, and how firm proximity to the end customer may influence how tweets moderate the stock market reaction to glitches.},

  abstract     = {Retailers often provide lenient, consumer-friendly return policies to reduce customers&#39; perceived shopping risk and increase demand. As an unfortunate side effect for retailers, empirical findings demonstrate that lenient return policies lead some customers to abuse those return policies through opportunistic and even fraudulent behaviors. Customers can abuse return policies by making purchases with the full intention of returning the products or by returning a product long after extracting most of the product&#39;s market value. In doing so, abusive customers extract utility—physical, experiential, or financial—from these purchases, at little or no cost to themselves. However, retailers incur significant costs from such return abuse, with estimates topping $5.6 billion annually in the United States alone. Identifying customers who perpetrate return abuse remains a critical topic. Yet, as a construct, return abuse is difficult to define and to quantify. In contrast, legitimate returner and nonreturner customers exhibit different return behaviors with distinctly different transactional behaviors and profitability outcomes. To investigate these diverse returner behaviors, this study empirically analyzes a transactional secondary data set of over 1 million customers with over 75 million transactions from a national U.S.-based retailer. The analysis generates empirical insights that characterize observable customer actions related to abusive returners, legitimate returners, and nonreturners. This study introduces a set of predictive models that enable actionable managerial intervention and presents the opportunity to recapture significant returns costs that might otherwise be lost to avoidable return abuse. The analysis also highlights the need for a more holistic perspective toward predicting, managing, and preventing returns.},

  abstract     = {In business markets, firms increasingly participate in new product development (NPD) activities that they outsource to suppliers. Such buyer participation can be complicated by relationship multiplexity—that is, the buyer may simultaneously be a competitor, supplier, and/or partner of the supplier firm. Drawing on role theory, we theorize how relationship multiplexity moderates the effect of buyer participation on project success. We analyze 140 NPD projects that were executed by a contract R&amp;D organization in the aerospace industry and find that buyer participation lowers the buyer&#39;s and the supplier&#39;s perceptions of project success for buyer-as-supplier multiplexity. Buyer participation increases the perceptions of project success in the case of buyer-as-partner multiplexity, but only when these partnerships are emergent, as opposed to engineered. Buyer participation decreases the buyer&#39;s perception of project success for relationships featuring buyer-as-competitor multiplexity but does not affect the supplier&#39;s perception in the case of buyer-as-competitor multiplexity. Our results provide tactical insights as to when buyer participation helps or hurts.},

Through additional analyses, we explore the generalizability of the automated design for creating solutions for different types of communication channels. Our work has implications for managing customer relations under emerging communication technologies (e.g., live-chat, e-mail, and social media) and more broadly for demonstrating the use of text analytics and machine learning to improve Operations Management practice.},

  abstract     = {To influence demand, some online retailers post messages (e.g., “5 units or less left in stock”) on their product pages to signal impending stockouts. These “scarcity” messages provide consumers “partial” inventory information, revealing only an upper bound on the number of units available for sale. To examine the impact of these messages, we obtained price and sales data from an online-retailer website across a sample of durable goods before and after the retailer posted the messages over multiple inventory-replenishment cycles. We then used these data to assess empirically the effect of these messages on these products&#39; daily sales. We find that disclosing these messages can decrease daily sales by an average of 17.60\%. This finding suggests that scarcity messages such as these can have a negative influence on the sales prospects of durable goods. We also observe, on the other hand, that price discounts are quite effective in increasing sales and offsetting the losses induced by scarcity messages. On average, a reduction of 1\% in stock keeping unit price increases daily sales by approximately 3\%. Therefore, relative to disclosing scarcity messages, price discounts are a much more effective tool at increasing inventory turns.},

  abstract     = {Promotional displays, such as end-of-aisle displays, provide a stimulus for discretionary and incremental sales at grocery stores, offering a powerful yet affordable tool to boost profit. In this study, we examine a store manager&#39;s choice of which stock-keeping units (SKUs) from a given category to assign to a promotional display space. While the academic literature and retail software solution providers offer a variety of optimization solutions for the assortment optimization problem, there is very little guidance for retailers on how to optimally determine when and what products to place on their promotional display space. Consequently, retailers often default to simple heuristics, which are typically suboptimal from a profit maximization standpoint, when making this decision. Thus, there is a need for a decision support tool to facilitate the product selection for promotional display space. Using a grocery store sales transaction data set, we demonstrate how to measure the incremental lift in sales of placing a particular SKU on promotional display space. Our optimization model includes the incremental lifts (from the estimation method) combined with the estimated base-sales rates and profit margins of each SKU so that the profit-maximizing SKU can be chosen for a promotional display space for each week of the year. Placing a SKU on promotional display can result in a significant lift in sales. For example, the estimated average display effect (i.e., sales lift) for the beer category across all SKUs and all weeks is 27\%, which makes promotional display a very effective tool for stimulating incremental product sales. Overall, our methodology results in at least 1.6 times improvement in incremental profit when compared to a common industry benchmark. We also test our methodology on two additional product categories and demonstrate that it performs equally well across product categories. Our work provides an easy-to-implement, promotional display SKU-selection methodology that includes both an estimation and an optimization model. Our estimation model can handle an extensive and complex product assortment and accounts for important aspects of promotional activities such as the cannibalization of the inner aisle sales and halo effects. Our optimization model is flexible enough to consider practical aspects such as common business rules that restrict the selection of the same SKU over a consecutive set of weeks, display-related changeover costs, and slotting fees offered by the manufacturers. Overall, our study underscores the importance of making effective promotional display decisions.},

Although there is a vast literature on sustainable practices and their relationships with various measures of firm performance, little is known about the nature of the empirical link between CSE appointments and financial performance. We add to the understanding of this link by estimating the stock market reactions to a sample of 115 announcements of CSE appointments made by firms during the period 2000–2018. Our findings using event study methodology, followed by regression analyses, suggest that although the stock market reaction to CSE appointments is not significantly different from zero, the stock market reacts more, or less positively under certain firm- and industry-specific conditions. We find that the stock market reaction is more positive in instances where the announcing firms faced a prior adverse sustainability-related incident, and less positive for announcing firms that operate in industries that face relatively higher levels of regulatory sanctions. Also, we find that the stock market reaction is more positive when firms announce CSE appointments with focused as compared to broad responsibilities. Additionally, we find that CSE appointments are associated with subsequent improvements in operating performance—partly driven by a decrease in total costs and partly by an increase in sales. Overall, our findings support the strategy of appointing CSEs to top management teams and enable executives and stakeholders to more deeply understand the shareholder value and operating performance effects of appointing CSEs.},

Concentrating on highly critical cardiac surgery operations, we investigate how failure affects subsequent performance over time. In addressing our research questions, we draw on the sensemaking perspective and incorporate behavioral aspects of failure that are often overlooked. We develop three hypotheses on the effects of failure (i.e., in-hospital mortality of a patient) and test them with a unique data set of 4,306 cardiac surgery operations from a large European hospital, spanning five years. Our findings show that while failure promotes learning over time and improves task execution quality (as measured by patients&#39; reduced length of stay) in the long term, its effect is the opposite in the short term. Our work also unravels how relational dynamics (i.e., familiarity) may reduce the short-term effects of failure. We find evidence that team familiarity mitigates the detrimental effects of recent failures. This implies that certain team assignment strategies after failure (e.g., putting individuals into familiar teams) may be preferable than others. We explore and illustrate this by conducting a policy simulation based on our data. This article provides new insights into how operations managers can support their employees in moving forward after failure.},

  abstract     = {The implementation of digital channels as avenues for economic transactions (e.g., online and mobile banking/FinTech) has shifted the paradigm of customer–bank interactions, providing unprecedented opportunities for both parties. The prevailing belief is that digital banking has several advantages, such as lower costs and higher information transferability for customers. These benefits can also promote competition between banks given customers&#39; predilection for “multi-homing,” or engagement with multiple banks. This study investigated the impact of customers&#39; digital banking adoption on hidden defection, in which customers purchase financial products from competing banks instead of their primary banks. To this end, we developed an analytical model to provide insights into the effects of digital banking adoption while taking customers&#39; multi-homing behaviors into consideration. We then conducted a series of empirical analyses using comprehensive individual-level transaction data to provide evidence of hidden defection. Our findings indicate that customers with higher loyalty exhibit greater hidden defection after digital banking adoption. Customers who engage primarily with personal-service channels (e.g., branches) show stronger hidden defection than do self-service channel (e.g., ATMs) users, and this effect is more prevalent among loyal customers. Our results provide valuable implications for omni-channel services in a market characterized by multi-homing behavior of customers.},

One remedy to close this gap is to increase the effectiveness of fundraising activities for IHOs. This remedy means spending as little as possible in fundraising activities but, at the same time, still receiving sufficient donations to implement disaster response programs in response to the needs that arise when disasters occur. We contribute to the literature by theoretically developing and estimating a conceptual framework that links donation behavior to the operations that IHOs aim to pursue; the framework incorporates operational costs communicated in appeals, fundraising efforts, and media attention. We argue that effects are not homogenous across disasters but that IHOs can leverage public attention and disaster and appeal characteristics, such as operational costs, to increase donations. We test the framework on a unique data set for disaster response programs operated by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), covering 174 disasters to which the IFRC responded between 2010 and 2017.},

  abstract     = {We focus here on questions regarding the craft of producing operations management (OM) research manuscripts. Are the journals we publish in too siloed, with regard to participating authors and institutions? Likewise, are the OM departments we work in too intellectually siloed by virtue of journal choice—are there too many like minds? In light of who publishes in our journals and who we coauthor with, is our field “global enough” or is North America weighing too heavily? We also strive to answer a question faced by many OM departments: should highly published faculty be hired from other schools? How do such highly published authors influence those around them? We arrive at partial answers to these questions by exploring an extensive history of publication data from four journals: Journal of Operations Management , Production and Operations Management , Manufacturing and Service Operations Management , and Management Science .},

  abstract     = {Although generous return policies have been shown to have marketing benefits, such as a higher willingness to pay and a higher purchase frequency, counterbalancing these benefits is an increased volume of consumer returns, which presents significant operational challenges for both retailers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Since accurate return forecasts are inputs into strategic and tactic decision support tools for operations managers, advancements in better forecast accuracy can yield significant savings from the returns management practice. We propose a forecasting approach that incorporates transaction-level data, such as purchase and return timestamps, and predicts future return quantities using a two-step “predict-aggregate” process. To enhance the generalizability of our framework, we test it on two distinct datasets provided by a bricks-and-mortar electronics retailer and an online jewelry retailer. We find that our approach demonstrates significant forecasting error reduction, in the range of 10–20\%, over benchmark models constructed from common industry practices and the existing literature. As our approach leverages the same data inputs as existing models, it can be easily adapted by practitioners. We also consider a number of extensions to generalize our approach into contexts such as restricted return time windows, new product returns, and inflated same-day returns. Last, we discuss broad implications of return forecast accuracy improvements in the areas such as inventory management, staffing level, reverse logistics, and return recovery decisions.},

Overall, we find that decarbonization leads to an average drop in sales of 1.8\% per worker. This evidence therefore suggests that climate change goals impacting industrial firms might be difficult to accomplish if managers expect to achieve decarbonization for free with current organizational best practices.},

  abstract     = {In the pursuit of low-wage labor and access to technical talent, information technology (IT) projects today are often executed with sourcing structures that span the boundaries of a firm, a country, or both. Although the strategic implications of sourcing structures have received considerable attention in theory and practice, their implications from a project execution standpoint—specifically, in terms of execution efficiency—remain under-researched. Based on a large primary dataset on IT projects with distributed sourcing structures, this paper documents the findings of a theoretically grounded, empirical investigation using stochastic frontier analysis that evaluates whether and to what extent does the execution efficiency of projects vary across various types of sourcing structures (namely, Domestic-Insourcing , Domestic-Outsourcing , Offshore-Insourcing , and Offshore-Outsourcing ). The results provide support for differential effects of crossing a firm or country boundary, or both boundaries, on the execution efficiency of IT projects. Specifically, we find that the execution efficiency of IT projects is significantly lower when their sourcing structures cross a country boundary ( Offshore-Insourcing and Offshore-Outsourcing ) relative to when their sourcing structures do not cross a country boundary ( Domestic-Insourcing and Domestic-Outsourcing ). Notwithstanding these trends across sourcing structures, a split-sample analysis of execution efficiency levels reveals that each structure presents a viable alternative for managers to realize high levels of execution efficiency. Finally, additional analysis highlights the benefits of sourcing structure capabilities—as represented by the extent of risk management planning and agile project management— in improving execution efficiency in IT projects that cross a country boundary.},

A deeper understanding of task-related uncertainty can help the firm optimize effort allocation across tasks by implementing well-designed task closure policies that facilitate superior capacity utilization and capacity planning. In this article, we characterize the empirical distribution of task uncertainty and demonstrate how the resolution process affects task outcomes in project environments. Using a combination of empirical estimation, and analytical and simulation modeling, we develop insights into task-related decision-making and engineer effort allocation. Using real-world task resolution data from a software maintenance setting, we first model and estimate a beta-geometric survival distribution which indicates that the likelihood of successful task resolution substantially reduces with the time a task remains in the system. Using analytical and simulation modeling, we then examine the implications of imposing task closure policies to improve engineer effort allocation and increase system productivity. We demonstrate that adopting well-designed task closure policies can significantly improve engineer resource utilization in capacity-constrained settings without a substantial negative impact on project outcomes. We discuss the implications of our research for theory and practice.},

  abstract     = {Robot-assisted surgery is a major advancement in minimally invasive surgical care delivery. It allows surgeons to gain additional dexterity, improved precision in surgical tasks, enhanced three-dimensional vision of the surgical field, and superior accessibility to the surgical field. Notwithstanding the clinical outcome benefits (such as reduced blood loss and surgical duration, and shorter length-of-stay at a hospital), the cost of performing robot-assisted surgery is significantly high, due to the investments needed for robot acquisition, maintenance, and procurement of surgical accessories. In this study, we address the twin objectives of a hospital where robot-assisted surgery is performed: maximize the clinical outcome benefits and minimize the total cost of robot-assisted surgery. The surgical robot that is the focus of the study is a da Vinci surgical system. The surgical procedure that serves as the context of this study is hysterectomy. We demonstrate the application of an integrated methodological approach—combining empirical analysis involving an on-site, prospective investigation at a hospital and retrospective analysis of archival data from the hospital for robustness checks, analytical modeling, and discrete event simulation—to identify and analyze actionable policies that a hospital can implement. The specific policies we analyze are related to: (a) patient triaging for robot-assisted surgery based on the criticality of disease condition of a patient; (b) the optimal size of surgeon pool to facilitate the development of surgeon experience and learning; and (c) the minimum experience level of a surgeon with a robot needed to be included in the surgeon pool for robot-assisted surgery. The key contributions of this article are in demonstrating the following: First, hospital-level policies can help to realize both the clinical outcome and cost benefits of a surgical robot. Second, the criticality of patient condition is a significant determinant of surgeon learning in robot-assisted surgery. Third, application of the proposed integrated methodological approach can yield nuanced and actionable insights into an operational setting where data availability is limited and generalizability of study insights is a concern, as is the case in this study.},

It utilizes secondary data for a comprehensive set of hospitals in the United States over a 21-year period (1996–2016). Analysis confirms that hospitals with a greater emphasis on physician contracting have higher operating margins but also tend to have longer patient length of stay—indicating lower patient care effectiveness. Lower patient care effectiveness, in turn, is observed to attenuate some of the financial gains from physician contracting. Further, post hoc analysis with other measures of patient care, including experiential quality, conformance quality, readmissions, and mortality provide additional insights into the effect of physician contracting on patient care. Theory and results also highlight teaching intensity and capacity utilization of hospitals as key boundary conditions in these relationships, revealing a complex set of findings related to these variables.

We hypothesize that as the level of a hospital&#39;s specialization increases, hospital cost efficiency should improve at a decreasing rate. We also hypothesize that differentiation helps improve cost efficiency in competitive markets. Lastly, we examine whether acute care general hospitals can use service mix as an operational lever to improve cost efficiency when specialty hospitals are present in the same local markets.

Before VBP&#39;s launch, some practitioners claimed VBP would have little impact, while others feared well-off hospitals would be unfairly rewarded at the expense of previously poor-performing hospitals. We examine whether and how the VBP penalties affect aggregate operating outcomes of healthcare providers in hospitals. Using secondary data, we find empirical evidence that hospitals with prior-year VBP penalties exhibit positive associations between the penalty magnitude and certain current-year care process improvements. Over the prior year, penalized hospitals also tend to exhibit increased patient case mix metrics, which should enhance revenue as a spillover effect. In a post hoc analysis, we observe that bonus-receiving hospitals are less apt to exhibit subsequent performance improvements for these same metrics. Our contributions result from theoretically framing differences in hospital operating activities when facing the VBP Program&#39;s penalties as well as empirically demonstrating consequences of the penalty&#39;s magnitude.},

One key policy has been to reduce a patient&#39;s length of stay, which is commonly perceived as an effective means of improving patient outcome, as well as reducing the cost per procedure. We put this notion to the empirical test by using a database of 183,712,784 medical records of patients in the English NHS between 1998 and 2012, studying the effects of the NHS&#39;s policy of decreasing length of stay for hernia patients. While we found it to be an effective way of reducing the cost per procedure, on aggregate, we also found that it increases the risk of readmission and of death for vulnerable and elderly patients, unduly increasing the long-term failure costs of the operation for these patient groups. Based on our findings, we propose a differentiated policy to selectively decrease length of stay, which we estimate could save up to US$565 per nonemergency hernia procedure (19.97\% reduction in the cost per procedure). We outline the implications of our findings for medical practice and discuss the wider theoretical contributions to the wider standardization-customization debate in health care operations management.},

We operationalize planning instances in terms of the number of changes to the physician preference card (PPC), the key document that is used to plan items needed for surgery. Communication patterns among members of the surgery team are captured by measuring the density of communication among the OR team members during an episode of care. The unplanned costs during an episode of care are used as a measure of OR supply waste. Hundreds of hours were spent observing episodes of care and tracking supplies. A combination of participant-observation, survey, and secondary data were analyzed to extract theoretical and practical insights. The results show that planning instances have a curvilinear relationship with unplanned costs. In particular, as the number of changes to the PPC increases, unplanned costs first increase and then decrease. Higher density of the OR team&#39;s communication network is associated with lower unplanned costs.

Workarounds in response to operational failures enable care to continue and therefore may be indicative of workers&#39; commitment. On the other hand, workarounds in the absence of operational failures may signal an ineffective approach associated with lower quality of care and worse patient outcomes. Working closely with healthcare providers, we developed a survey to measure workaround behaviors and operational failures on medical/surgical units. The lead author surveyed over 4,000 nurses from 63 hospitals throughout the United States. We matched this data with audit data on the incidence of pressure injuries among over 21,000 patients on 262 nursing units in 56 survey hospitals. Hospital-acquired pressure injuries are a significant risk to patient health and hospital costs. We do not find support for our hypothesis that workarounds are associated with a higher rate of hospital-acquired pressure injuries. However, when we take into account the moderating role of operational failures on the relationship between workarounds and pressure injuries, we find significant results. When nursing units have lower levels of operational failures, workarounds are associated with higher rates of hospital-acquired pressure injuries. Our results provide evidence that workarounds may be associated with negative patient outcomes, if they stem from a process-avoiding approach. The best results can be achieved by reducing both operational failures and workarounds via instilling a process-focused approach.},

  abstract     = {Overcrowding poses a serious challenge to the operations of health care facilities, especially those with a mandate to provide emergency care. A better understanding of emergency department (ED) performance during disaster-level overcrowding is a key to increasing a facility&#39;s resilience, optimizing patient outcomes, and more effectively allocating resources. With this in mind, this study quantitatively examines the extent to which different factors contribute to the resilience of hospital EDs during disaster-level overcrowding events. A modeling framework was developed in collaboration with the Carilion Clinic ED, a level one trauma center in Virginia. The testing and analysis of the approach is based on data from actual disaster-level overcrowding events that occurred in the Spring of 2016. Results indicate that by considering not only the capacity for resisting such events but also the capacity for recovering from them more quickly, hospital decision makers can improve both their operational effectiveness and the patient experience. Furthermore, by using our framework to identify precipitating factors and predict severe overcrowding, hospital decision makers can implement changes to improve the future resilience of their ED to such overcrowding events.},

  abstract     = {Improving patient flow in hospitals is a contemporary challenge in the UK National Health Service (NHS). When patients remain in a hospital bed for longer than clinically necessary, hospital performance is dramatically impacted, quality of care is reduced, and elective surgeries are cancelled at great cost to both hospital and patient. This research explains how one UK hospital employed design science research to improve patient flow after other process improvement techniques had failed. The work focused on improving patient flow through the creation of a set of interconnected, temporally paced routines that successfully engaged doctors and nurses in new, outcome-specific ways of working. These routines were both independent and interdependent, were relationally coordinated through time, and systematically and unambiguously engaged all levels of staff at specific temporal junctures. We discover that the successful adoption of these routines was cumulative rather than iterative and was aligned with ongoing efforts supporting the social aspects of change. Through this work, our case hospital saw performance improvements that moved them from being below average to the best in the country, combining improvements in patient care with savings of over £3 million in the first 12 months. The contribution of this research is twofold; first, we explain how the development of outcome-specific routines can facilitate process improvement, and second, we illustrate how design science research can successfully bridge theory and practice to promote swift and even flow in healthcare.},

  abstract     = {We study the role of process friction in increasing efficiency of service provisions. We examine one potential lever for reducing the provision of discretionary services: “justification”—an otherwise non-value-added process step that introduces process friction by forcing workers to explain the rationale for requesting an optional service. We exploit the presence—and absence—of a justification step in the ultrasound (US) ordering process at two emergency departments (EDs). We find that patients with abdominal pain are less than half as likely to receive an US when there is a justification step compared to when there is not. Additionally, we find a spillover effect: other diagnostic tests are also ordered less frequently. The decrease in testing reduces the average length of stay of the patients, and reduces testing costs by more than $200,000, with no decrease in quality. We show that two mechanisms underlie these results: (a) justification reduces clinicians&#39; available time , and (b) justification forces clinicians to reflect on a patient&#39;s need for service. Our paper contributes to recent theory on friction and reflection as drivers of efficiency in services. We show that justification can serve as an effective lever for reducing medical tests—and costs—without negatively impacting quality.},
