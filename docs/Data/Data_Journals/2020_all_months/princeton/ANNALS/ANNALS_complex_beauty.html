We prove it is ample on any proper subspace parametrizing reduced uniformly $\mathrm {K}$-stable Fano varieties that conjecturally should be the entire moduli space. As a corollary, we prove that the moduli space parametrizing smoothable $\mathrm {K}$-polystable Fano varieties is projective. During the course of proof, we develop a new invariant for filtrations that can be used to test various $\mathrm {K}$-stability notions of Fano varieties.},

  abstract     = {We study the class of Lorentzian polynomials. The class contains homogeneous stable polynomials as well as volume polynomials of convex bodies and projective varieties. We prove that the Hessian of a nonzero Lorentzian polynomial has exactly one positive eigenvalue at any point on the positive orthant. This property can be seen as an analog of the Hodge–Riemann relations for Lorentzian polynomials. Lorentzian polynomials are intimately connected to matroid theory and negative dependence properties. We show that matroids, and more generally $\mathrm {M}$-convex sets, are characterized by the Lorentzian property, and develop a theory around Lorentzian polynomials. In particular, we provide a large class of linear operators that preserve the Lorentzian property and prove that Lorentzian measures enjoy several negative dependence properties. We also prove that the class of tropicalized Lorentzian polynomials coincides with the class of $\mathrm {M}$-convex functions in the sense of discrete convex analysis. The tropical connection is used to produce Lorentzian polynomials from $\mathrm {M}$-convex functions. We give two applications of the general theory. First, we prove that\nonbreakingspace the homogenized multivariate Tutte polynomial of a matroid is Lorentzian whenever the parameter $q$ satisfies $0\lt q \leq 1$. Consequences are proofs of the strongest Mason’s conjecture from 1972 and negative dependence properties of the random cluster model in statistical physics. Second, we prove that the multivariate characteristic polynomial of an $\mathrm {M}$-matrix is Lorentzian. This refines a result of Holtz who proved that the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of an $\mathrm {M}$-matrix form an ultra log-concave sequence.},

Our techniques allow for certain generalizations of the Ax-Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem that have interesting consequences. In particular, we apply our results to give a complete proof of an assertion of Painlevé (1895).

In 1994, Hartley and Turull established a degree-divisibility property for characters related by that correspondence, subject to a congruence condition which should hold for the Green functions of finite groups of Lie type, as defined by Deligne and Lusztig. Here, we present a general argument for completing the proof of that congruence condition. Consequently, the degree-divisibility property holds in complete generality.},

Using an approach of Mozgovoy and Schiffmann the problem is reduced to counting pairs of a parabolic vector bundle and a nilpotent endomorphism of prescribed generic type. The generating function counting these pairs is shown to be a product of Macdonald polynomials and the function counting pairs without parabolic structure. The modified Macdonald polynomial $\tilde H_\lambda [X;q,t]$ is interpreted as a weighted count of points of the affine Springer fiber over the constant nilpotent matrix of type $\lambda $.},

Applying our techniques to a family of klt singularities, we show that the volume of klt singularities is a constructible function. As a corollary, we prove that in a family of klt log Fano pairs, the K-semistable ones form a Zariski open set. Together with previous works by many people, we conclude that all K-semistable klt Fano varieties with a fixed dimension and volume are parametrized by an Artin stack of finite type, which then admits a separated good moduli space, whose geometric points parametrize K-polystable klt Fano varieties.},

In this paper, we formulate a general construction of concrete modules, using Bessel periods, for cuspidal automorphic representations of classical groups with generic global Arthur parameters. Then we establish the theory for orthogonal and unitary groups, based on certain well expected conjectures. Among the consequences of the theory in this paper is that the global Gan-Gross-Prasad conjecture for those classical groups is proved in full generality in one direction and with a global assumption in the other direction.},

  abstract     = {The Allen–Cahn equation is a semilinear PDE which is deeply linked to the theory of minimal hypersurfaces via a singular limit. We prove curvature estimates and strong sheet separation estimates for stable solutions (building on recent work of Wang–Wei) of the Allen–Cahn equation on a $3$-manifold. Using these, we are able to show that for generic metrics on a $3$-manifold, minimal surfaces arising from Allen–Cahn solutions with bounded energy and bounded Morse index are two-sided and occur with multiplicity one and the expected Morse index. This confirms, in the Allen–Cahn setting, a strong form of the multiplicity one-conjecture and the index lower bound conjecture of Marques–Neves in $3$-dimensions regarding min-max constructions of minimal surfaces. Allen–Cahn min-max constructions were recently carried out by Guaraco and Gaspar–Guaraco. Our resolution of the multiplicity-one and the index lower bound conjectures shows that these constructions can be applied to give a new proof of Yau’s conjecture on infinitely many minimal surfaces in a $3$-manifold with a generic metric (recently proven by Irie–Marques–Neves) with new geometric conclusions. Namely, we prove that a $3$-manifold with a generic metric contains, for every $p = 1, 2, 3, \ldots $, a two-sided embedded minimal surface with Morse index $p$ and area $\sim p^{\frac 13}$, as conjectured by Marques–Neves.},

Using this we deduce that (1) the extremal values of $u$ are only achieved at a vertex of the triangle, and (2) a generic acute triangle has exactly one (non-vertex) critical point and that each obtuse triangle has no (non-vertex) critical points. This settles the “hot spots” conjecture for triangles in the plane.},

  abstract     = {Dorn and Otto (1994) and independently Zamolodchikov and Zamolodchikov (1996) proposed a remarkable explicit expression, the so-called DOZZ formula, for the three point structure constants of Liouville Conformal Field Theory (LCFT), which is expected to describe the scaling limit of large planar maps properly embedded into the Riemann sphere. In this paper we give a proof of the DOZZ formula based on a rigorous probabilistic construction of LCFT in terms of Gaussian Multiplicative Chaos given earlier by F. David and the authors. This result is a fundamental step in the path to prove integrability of LCFT, i.e., to mathematically justify the methods of Conformal Bootstrap used by physicists. From the purely probabilistic point of view, our proof constitutes the first nontrivial rigorous integrability result on Gaussian Multiplicative Chaos measures.},
