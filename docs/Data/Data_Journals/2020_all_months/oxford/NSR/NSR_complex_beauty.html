  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has developed quickly in recent years, with applications expanding from automatic driving and smart manufacturing to personal healthcare and algorithm-based social media utilization. During the COVID-19 pandemic, AI has played an essential role in identifying suspected infections, ensuring epidemic surveillance and quickening drug screening. However, many questions accompanied AI’s development. How to protect citizens’ privacy and national information security? What measures can help AI learn and practice good human behaviors and avoid unethical use of AI technologies? To answer these questions, Nation Science Review (NSR) interviewed Yi Zeng, Professor and Deputy Director at the Research Center for Brain-inspired Artificial Intelligence at the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). He is a board member for the National Governance Committee of Next-Generation Artificial Intelligence affiliated to the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (MOST). Zeng is also in AI ethics expert groups at the World Health Organization and the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). He jointly led the drafting of Beijing AI Principles (2019) and the National Governance Principles of New Generation AI of China (GPNGAI, 2019).},

Their unique amphiphilic structures enable the self-assembly and the conveyance of information with high fidelity. In particular, LONs present remarkable potential in measuring cellular mechanical forces and monitoring cell behaviors. LONs are also essential sensing tools for intracellular imaging and have been employed in developing cell-surface-anchored DNA nanostructures for biomimetic-engineering studies. When incorporating therapeutic oligonucleotides or small-molecule drugs, LONs hold promise for targeted therapy. Moreover, LONs mediate the controllable assembly and fusion of vesicles based on DNA-strand displacements, contributing to nanoreactor construction and macromolecule delivery. In this review, we will summarize the general synthesis strategies of LONs, provide some characterization analysis and emphasize recent advances in bioanalytical and biomedical applications. We will also consider the relevant challenges and suggest future directions for building better functional LONs in nanotechnology and materials-science applications.},

Among the various halogen-bonding donors, we take notice of the ability of 1,4-diiodotetrafluorobenzene (1,4-DITFB) to co-crystallize with diverse halogen-bonding acceptors in the range from neutral Lewis bases (nitrogen-containing compounds, N-oxides, chalcogenides, aromatic hydrocarbons and organometallic complexes) to anions (halide ions, thio/selenocyanate ions and tetrahedral oxyanions), leading to a great variety of supramolecular architectures such as discrete assemblies, 1D infinite chains and 2D/3D networks. Some of them act as promising functional materials (e.g. fluorescence, phosphorescence, optical waveguide, laser, non-linear optics, dielectric and magnetism) and soft materials (e.g. liquid crystal and supramolecular gel). Here we focus on the supramolecular structures of multicomponent complexes and their related physicochemical properties, highlight representative examples and show clearly the main directions that remain to be developed and improved in this area. From the point of view of crystal engineering and supramolecular chemistry, the complexes summarized here should give helpful information for further design and investigation of the elusive category of halogen-bonding supramolecular functional materials.},

  abstract     = {One puzzling phenomenon in glass physics is the so-called ‘shadow glass transition’ which is an anomalous heat-absorbing process below the real glass transition and influences glass properties. However, it has yet to be entirely characterized, let alone fundamentally understood. Conventional calorimetry detects it in limited heating rates. Here, with the chip-based fast scanning calorimetry, we study the dynamics of the shadow glass transition over four orders of magnitude in heating rates for 24 different hyper-quenched metallic glasses. We present evidence that the shadow glass transition correlates with the secondary (β) relaxation: (i) The shadow glass transition and the β relaxation follow the same temperature–time dependence, and both merge with the primary relaxation at high temperature. (ii) The shadow glass transition is more obvious in glasses with pronounced β relaxation, and vice versa ; their magnitudes are proportional to each other. Our findings suggest that the shadow glass transition signals the thermodynamics of β relaxation in hyper-quenched metallic glasses.},

  abstract     = {Nonfullerene acceptors are being investigated for use in polymer solar cells (PSCs), with their advantages of extending the absorption range, reducing the energy loss and therefore enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, to further boost the PCE, mobilities of these nonfullerene acceptors should be improved. For nonfullerene acceptors, the π–π stacking distance between cofacially stacked molecules significantly affects their mobility. Here, we demonstrate a strategy to increase the mobility of heteroheptacene-based nonfullerene acceptors by reducing their π–π stacking distances via control over the bulkiness of lateral side chains. Incorporation of 2-butyloctyl substituents into the nonfullerene acceptor (M36) leads to an increased mobility with a reduced π–π stacking distance of 3.45 Å. Consequently, M36 affords an enhanced PCE of 16%, which is the highest among all acceptor-donor-acceptor-type nonfullerene acceptors to date. This strategy of control over the bulkiness of side chains on nonfullerene acceptors should aid the development of more efficient PSCs.},

In this paper, we report the finding of novel nonzero Hall effect in topological material ZrTe 5 flakes when the in-plane magnetic field is parallel and perpendicular to the current. Surprisingly, both symmetric and antisymmetric components with respect to magnetic field are detected in the in-plane Hall resistivity. Further theoretical analysis suggests that the magnetotransport properties originate from the anomalous velocity induced by Berry curvature in a tilted Weyl semimetal. Our work not only enriches the Hall family but also provides new insights into the Berry phase effect in topological materials.},

Here we show that the major pulmonary alterations included diffuse alveolar damage, interstitial fibrosis and exudative inflammation featured with extensive serous and fibrin exudates, macrophage infiltration and abundant production of inflammatory factors (IL-6, IP-10, TNFα and IL-1β). The spleen and hilar lymph nodes contained lesions with tissue structure disruption and immune cell dysregulation, including lymphopenia and macrophage accumulation. These findings provide pathological evidence that links injuries of the lungs and lymphatic organs with the fatal systematic respiratory and immune malfunction in critically ill COVID-19 patients.},

The conference adopted Resolution A on ‘Revision of the International System of Units (SI).’ According to Resolution A: four of the SI basic units, namely kilograms, amps, kelvin and mole, are defined by the Planck constant h, the basic charge constant e, the Boltzmann constant k and the Avogadro constant N A , respectively. This establishes the basic quantities and units in SI on a series of constants. The new SI was officially launched on 20 May 2019. This is the most significant change and a milestone in the history of metrology since the Metre Convention was signed in 20 May 1875. Professor Tianchu Li, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, has been working on time and frequency standards for 37 years. In this interview, Prof. Li reviews the quantization and constant evolutions of the second and meter, and introduces the redefinitions of ampere, kelvin, kilogram and mole, and their significance for precision measurements.},

We developed a space cold atom clock (SCAC), which was launched into orbit with the Space Lab TG-2 in 2016. Before it deorbited with TG-2 in 2019, the SCAC had been working continuously for almost 3 years. During the period in orbit, many scientific experiments and engineering tests were performed. In this article, we summarize the principle, development and in-orbit results. These works provide the basis for construction of a space-borne time-frequency system in deep space.},

The fine-structure splitting in the 2 3 P state of helium is considered to be the most suitable for determining the fine-structure constant α in atoms. After more than 50 years of efforts by many theorists and experimentalists, we are now working toward a determination of α with an accuracy of a few parts per billion, which can be compared to the results obtained by entirely different methods to verify the self-consistency of quantum electrodynamics. Moreover, the precision spectroscopy of helium allows determination of the nuclear charge radius, and it is expected to help resolve the ‘proton radius puzzle’. In this review, we introduce the latest developments in the precision spectroscopy of the helium atom, especially the discrepancies among theoretical and experimental results, and give an outlook on future progress.},

  abstract     = {The Newtonian gravitational constant G , which is one of the most important fundamental physical constants in nature, plays a significant role in the fields of theoretical physics, geophysics, astrophysics and astronomy. Although G was the first physical constant to be introduced in the history of science, it is considered to be one of the most difficult to measure accurately so far. Over the past two decades, eleven precision measurements of the gravitational constant have been performed, and the latest recommended value for G published by the Committee on Data for Science and Technology (CODATA) is (6.674 08 ± 0.000 31) × 10 −11 m 3 kg −1 s −2 with a relative uncertainty of 47 parts per million. This uncertainty is the smallest compared with previous CODATA recommended values of G ; however, it remains a relatively large uncertainty among other fundamental physical constants. In this paper we briefly review the history of the G measurement, and introduce eleven values of G adopted in CODATA 2014 after 2000 and our latest two values published in 2018 using two independent methods.},

  abstract     = {Soybean accounts for more than half of the global production of oilseed and more than a quarter of the protein used globally for human food and animal feed. Soybean domestication involved parallel increases in seed size and oil content, and a concomitant decrease in protein content. However, science has not yet discovered whether these effects were due to selective pressure on a single gene or multiple genes. Here, re-sequencing data from &gt;800 genotypes revealed a strong selection during soybean domestication on GmSWEET10a . The selection of GmSWEET10a conferred simultaneous increases in soybean-seed size and oil content as well as a reduction in the protein content. The result was validated using both near-isogenic lines carrying substitution of haplotype chromosomal segments and transgenic soybeans. Moreover, GmSWEET10b was found to be functionally redundant with its homologue GmSWEET10a and to be undergoing selection in current breeding, leading the the elite allele GmSWEET10b , a potential target for present-day soybean breeding. Both GmSWEET10a and GmSWEET10b were shown to transport sucrose and hexose, contributing to sugar allocation from seed coat to embryo, which consequently determines oil and protein contents and seed size in soybean. We conclude that past selection of optimal GmSWEET10a alleles drove the initial domestication of multiple soybean-seed traits and that targeted selection of the elite allele GmSWEET10b may further improve the yield and seed quality of modern soybean cultivars.},

  abstract     = {Many examples of hierarchies are present in nature, such as water transport in leaf vein systems, the respiratory system, the blood circulatory system, etc. Hierarchically structuring a material over different length scales by mimicking natural systems can provide an opportunity to render the material suitable for a variety of functions. Tremendous research over the past decade has focused on the synthesis and applications of hierarchically structured porous materials. This rapidly evolving field has attracted great interest from both academia and industry. China is at the forefront of this field, and a scientific leader of this research is Professor Ming-Yuan He of East China Normal University. Professor He was elected to the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1995, and he received the Prize for Scientific and Technological Progress from the Ho Leung Ho Li Foundation in 2001. He also won the National Catalysis Achievement Award of China in 2012 and the National Zeolite Lifetime Achievement Award of China in 2019. Professor He&#39;s research interests focus on new catalytic materials and oil-refining catalysts and processes. He is a pioneer in the area of green chemistry in China and actively promotes the development of green chemistry and chemical engineering. NSR recently interviewed Professor He about the current achievements and future prospects of hierarchically structured porous materials. This interview is dedicated to Professor He on the occasion of his 80th birthday, in recognition of his distinguished contributions to many aspects in the field of catalytic science and technology.},

  abstract     = {Despite numerous advantages, applications of conventional microporous metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are hampered by their limited pore sizes, such as in heterogeneous catalysis and guest delivery, which usually involve large molecules. Construction of hierarchically porous MOFs (HP-MOFs) is vital to achieve the controllable augmentation of MOF pore size to mesopores or even macropores, which can enhance the diffusion kinetics of guests and improve the storage capacity. This review article focuses on recent advances in the methodology of HP-MOF synthesis, covering preparation of HP-MOFs with intrinsic hierarchical pores, and modulated, templated and template-free synthetic strategies for HP-MOFs. The key factors which affect the formation of HP-MOF architectures are summarized and discussed, followed by a brief review of their applications in heterogeneous catalysis and guest encapsulation. Overall, this review presents a roadmap that will guide the future design and development of HP-MOF materials with molecular precision and mesoscopic complexity.},

This review will focus on the diffusion and catalyst efficiency of hierarchical zeolites and industrial catalysts. The benefits of diffusion and catalyst efficiency at two levels of hierarchies (zeolitic component level and industrial catalyst level) from a chemical reaction engineering point of view will be analysed. At zeolitic component level, three types of mesopores based on the strategies applied toward enhancing the catalyst effectiveness factor are presented: (i) ‘functional mesopores’ (raising effective diffusivity); (ii) ‘auxiliary mesopores’ (decreasing diffusion length); and (iii) ‘integrated mesopores’ (a combination thereof). At industrial catalyst level, location and interconnectivity among the constitutive components are revealed. The hierarchical pore interconnectivity in multi-component zeolite based industrial catalysts is exemplified by fluid catalytic cracking and bi-functional hydroisomerization catalysts. The rational design of industrial zeolite catalysts at both hierarchical zeolitic component and catalyst body levels can be fully comprehended using the advanced in situ and/or operando spectroscopic, microscopic and diffraction techniques.},

  abstract     = {Because of their low cost, natural abundance, environmental benignity, plentiful polymorphs, good chemical stability and excellent optical properties, TiO 2 materials are of great importance in the areas of physics, chemistry and material science. Much effort has been devoted to the synthesis of TiO 2 nanomaterials for various applications. Among them, mesoporous TiO 2 materials, especially with hierarchically porous structures, show great potential owing to their extraordinarily high surface areas, large pore volumes, tunable pore structures and morphologies, and nanoscale effects. This review aims to provide an overview of the synthesis and applications of hierarchically mesoporous TiO 2 materials. In the first section, the general synthetic strategies for hierarchically mesoporous TiO 2 materials are reviewed. After that, we summarize the architectures of hierarchically mesoporous TiO 2 materials, including nanofibers, nanosheets, microparticles, films, spheres, core-shell and multi-level structures. At the same time, the corresponding mechanisms and the key factors for the controllable synthesis are highlighted. Following this, the applications of hierarchically mesoporous TiO 2 materials in terms of energy storage and environmental protection, including photocatalytic degradation of pollutants, photocatalytic fuel generation, photoelectrochemical water splitting, catalyst support, lithium-ion batteries and sodium-ion batteries, are discussed. Finally, we outline the challenges and future directions of research and development in this area.},

  abstract     = {To address the growing energy demands of sustainable development, it is crucial to develop new materials that can improve the efficiency of energy storage systems. Hierarchically structured porous materials have shown their great potential for energy storage applications owing to their large accessible space, high surface area, low density, excellent accommodation capability with volume and thermal variation, variable chemical compositions and well controlled and interconnected hierarchical porosity at different length scales. Porous hierarchy benefits electron and ion transport, and mass diffusion and exchange. The electrochemical behavior of hierarchically structured porous materials varies with different pore parameters. Understanding their relationship can lead to the defined and accurate design of highly efficient hierarchically structured porous materials to enhance further their energy storage performance. In this review, we take the characteristic parameters of the hierarchical pores as the survey object to summarize the recent progress on hierarchically structured porous materials for energy storage. This is the first of this kind exclusively to survey the performance of hierarchically structured porous materials from different porous characteristics. For those who are not familiar with hierarchically structured porous materials, a series of very significant synthesis strategies of hierarchically structured porous materials are firstly and briefly reviewed. This will be beneficial for those who want to quickly obtain useful reference information about the synthesis strategies of new hierarchically structured porous materials to improve their performance in energy storage. The effect of different organizational, structural and geometric parameters of porous hierarchy on their electrochemical behavior is then deeply discussed. We outline the existing problems and development challenges of hierarchically structured porous materials that need to be addressed in renewable energy applications. We hope that this review can stimulate strong intuition into the design and application of new hierarchically structured porous materials in energy storage and other fields.},

The difficulty of gelation for low-valence metal cation was overcome by introducing a highly electronegative Br atom near to the metal atom to control the rates of hydrolysis and polycondensation. The 3D interconnected macropores were obtained using appropriate polymers to induce phase separation. The domain sizes of macropores and skeletons can be controlled by reaction parameters such as concentration and/or average molecular weight of polymers, and the amount of hydrochloric acid. The crystalline metal oxide monoliths with their 3D interconnected macroporous structure preserved were obtained after heat treatment in air.},

Herein, we report the construction of hollow-structured submicrometer-photoreactors with bimetallic catalysts loaded within mesoporous silicas. The synthesis parameters are optimized to study the evolution of hollow structure through hydrothermal treatment and an ‘adhesive-contraction’ formation mechanism is proposed. AuPt@HMZS catalysts exhibited a broader absorbance region under visible light and the adsorption edge displayed a red-shift, indicating the strong metal–metal interactions at the alloy interface. The reaction performance of the coupled Au-Pt catalysts can be tuned to achieve excellent catalytic activity in cinnamyl alcohol oxidation to cinnamic acid for 3.1 mmol g −1 with 99% selectivity. The proposed strategy to build hollow structures as multifunctional micro/nanoreactors is promising for the design of high-performance and sustainable catalysts for chemical synthesis.},

  abstract     = {In nature, sequential harvesting of light widely exists in the old life entity, i.e. cyanobacteria, to maximize the light absorption and enhance the photosynthesis efficiency. Inspired by nature, we propose a brand new concept of temporally-spatially sequential harvesting of light in one single particle, which has purpose-designed heterogeneous hollow multi-shelled structures (HoMSs) with porous shells composed of nanoparticle subunits. Structurally, HoMSs consist of different band-gap materials outside-in, thus realizing the efficient harvesting of light with different wavelengths. Moreover, introducing oxygen vacancies into each nanoparticle subunit can also enhance the light absorption. With the benefit of sequential harvesting of light in HoMSs, the quantum efficiency at wavelength of 400 nm is enhanced by six times compared with the corresponding nanoparticles. Impressively, using these aforementioned materials as photocatalysts, highly efficient photocatalytic water splitting is realized, which cannot be achieved by using the nanoparticle counterparts. This new concept of temporally-spatially sequential harvesting of solar light paves the way for solving the ever-growing energy demand.},

  abstract     = {The most fantastic optical phenomena in the Earth&#39;s upper atmosphere are the auroras. They are highly informative indicators of solar activity, geomagnetic activity, upper atmospheric structures and dynamics, and magnetospheric energetic particles. An area where the geomagnetic field differs significantly from the expected symmetric dipole, such as at the South Atlantic Anomaly, where the magnetic field intensity is low, gives rise to stronger precipitation of energetic particles into the upper atmosphere. Impact excitation and the subsequent airglow emissions exhibit aurora-like dynamic signatures. Nomenclatures of nonpolar aurora or equatorial auroras are similar to those used with the polar auroras owing to their similar excitation mechanisms. This paper provides an overview of the knowledge and the challenges concerning auroral activity at the South Atlantic Anomaly, or more generally, at the negative magnetic anomaly. We emphasize systematic investigation of the equatorial auroras to reveal the temporal and spatial evolution of the magnetic anomaly and the behaviour of energetic particles in near-Earth space.},

Ocean remote-sensing data archives reach several tens of petabytes and massive satellite data are acquired worldwide daily. To precisely, efficiently and intelligently mine the useful information submerged in such ocean remote-sensing data sets is a big challenge. Deep learning—a powerful technology recently emerging in the machine-learning field—has demonstrated its more significant superiority over traditional physical- or statistical-based algorithms for image-information extraction in many industrial-field applications and starts to draw interest in ocean remote-sensing applications. In this review paper, we first systematically reviewed two deep-learning frameworks that carry out ocean remote-sensing-image classifications and then presented eight typical applications in ocean internal-wave/eddy/oil-spill/coastal-inundation/sea-ice/green-algae/ship/coral-reef mapping from different types of ocean remote-sensing imagery to show how effective these deep-learning frameworks are. Researchers can also readily modify these existing frameworks for information mining of other kinds of remote-sensing imagery.},

  abstract     = {N -containing organic compounds are of vital importance to lives. Practical synthesis of valuable N -containing organic compounds directly from dinitrogen (N 2 ), not through ammonia (NH 3 ), is a holy-grail in chemistry and chemical industry. An essential step for this transformation is the functionalization of the activated N 2 units/ligands to generate N−C bonds. Pioneering works of transition metal-mediated direct conversion of N 2 into organic compounds via N−C bond formation at metal-dinitrogen [N 2 -M] complexes have generated diversified coordination modes and laid the foundation of understanding for the N−C bond formation mechanism. This review summarizes those major achievements and is organized by the coordination modes of the [N 2 -M] complexes (end-on, side-on, end-on-side-on, etc.) that are involved in the N−C bond formation steps, and each part is arranged in terms of reaction types ( N -alkylation, N -acylation, cycloaddition, insertion, etc.) between [N 2 -M] complexes and carbon-based substrates. Additionally, earlier works on one-pot synthesis of organic compounds from N 2 via ill-defined intermediates are also briefed. Although almost all of the syntheses of N -containing organic compounds via direct transformation of N 2 so far in the literature are realized in homogeneous stoichiometric thermochemical reaction systems and are discussed here in detail, the sporadically reported syntheses involving photochemical, electrochemical, heterogeneous thermo-catalytic reactions, if any, are also mentioned. This review aims to provide readers with an in-depth understanding of the state-of-the-art and perspectives of future research particularly in direct catalytic and efficient conversion of N 2 into N -containing organic compounds under mild conditions, and to stimulate more research efforts to tackle this long-standing and grand scientific challenge.},

For these systems to achieve individual spin addressability and high energy efficiency, we exploited the electric field as a tool to manipulate the quantum behaviours of the rare-earth ion which has strong spin-orbit coupling. A Ce:YAG single crystal was employed with considerations to the dynamics and the symmetry requirements. The Stark effect of the Ce 3+ ion was observed and measured. When demonstrated as a quantum phase gate, the electric field manipulation exhibited high efficiency which allowed up to 57 π/2 operations before decoherence with optimized field direction. It was also utilized to carry out quantum bang-bang control, as a method of dynamic decoupling, and the refined Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm. Our experiments highlighted rare-earth ions as potentially applicable qubits because they offer enhanced spin-electric coupling which enables high-efficiency quantum manipulation.},

The interlocked structures are all based on bithiophenyl groups. The bithiophenyl groups effectively enhance the strength of the inter-ring interactions and play a crucial role in the formation of these interlocked structures. By taking advantage of the strong interaction between π-donor ( D ) and π-acceptor ( A ) groups, the electron-deficient methylviologen cation was introduced into a cationic metallarectangle based on bithiophenyl groups. Taking inspiration from these results, a cationic metallarectangle based on A units was threaded into a metallarectangle based on D units, leading to a heterogeneous D – A ring-in-ring structure.},

  abstract     = {Helium and methane are major components of giant icy planets and are abundant in the universe. However, helium is the most inert element in the periodic table and methane is one of the most hydrophobic molecules, thus whether they can react with each other is of fundamental importance. Here, our crystal structure searches and first-principles calculations predict that a He 3 CH 4 compound is stable over a wide range of pressures from 55 to 155 GPa and a HeCH 4 compound becomes stable around 105 GPa. As nice examples of pure van der Waals crystals, the insertion of helium atoms changes the original packing of pure methane molecules and also largely hinders the polymerization of methane at higher pressures. After analyzing the diffusive properties during the melting of He 3 CH 4 at high pressure and high temperature, in addition to a plastic methane phase, we have discovered an unusual phase which exhibits coexistence of diffusive helium and plastic methane. In addition, the range of the diffusive behavior within the helium-methane phase diagram is found to be much narrower compared to that of previously predicted helium-water compounds. This may be due to the weaker van der Waals interactions between methane molecules compared to those in helium-water compounds, and that the helium-methane compound melts more easily.},

  abstract     = {As an emerging and promising treatment method, gas therapy has attracted more and more attention for treatment of inflammation-related diseases, especially cancer. However, therapeutic/therapy-assisted gases (NO, CO, H 2 S, H 2 , O 2 , SO 2 and CO 2 ) and most of their prodrugs lack the abilities of active intratumoral accumulation and controlled gas release, resulting in limited cancer therapy efficacy and potential side effects. Therefore, development of nanomedicines to realize tumor-targeted and controlled release of therapeutic/therapy-assisted gases is greatly desired, and also the combination of other therapeutic modes with gas therapy by multifunctional nanocarrier platforms can augment cancer therapy efficacy and also reduce their side effects. The design of nanomedicines with these functions is vitally important, but challenging. In this review, we summarize a series of engineering strategies for construction of advanced gas-releasing nanomedicines from four aspects: (1) stimuli-responsive strategies for controlled gas release; (2) catalytic strategies for controlled gas release; (3) tumor-targeted gas delivery strategies; (4) multi-model combination strategies based on gas therapy. Moreover, we highlight current issues and gaps in knowledge, and envisage current trends and future prospects of advanced nanomedicines for gas therapy of cancer.

  abstract     = {Though it is still a big challenge to unify general relativity and quantum mechanics in modern physics, the theory of quantum field related with the gravitational effect has been well developed and some striking phenomena are predicted, such as Hawking radiation. However, the direct measurement of these quantum effects under general relativity is far beyond present experiment techniques. Fortunately, the emulation of general relativity phenomena in the laboratory has become accessible in recent years. However, up to now, these simulations are limited either in classical regime or in flat space whereas quantum simulation related with general relativity is rarely involved. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate a quantum evolution of fermions in close proximity to an artificial black hole on a photonic chip. We successfully observe the acceleration behavior, quantum creation, and evolution of a fermion pair near the event horizon: a single-photon wave packet with positive energy escapes from the black hole while negative energy is captured. Our extensible platform not only provides a route to access quantum effects related with general relativity, but also has the potentiality to investigate quantum gravity in future.},

  abstract     = {WTe 2 , as a type-II Weyl semimetal, has 2D Fermi arcs on the (001) surface in the bulk and 1D helical edge states in its monolayer. These features have recently attracted wide attention in condensed matter physics. However, in the intermediate regime between the bulk and monolayer, the edge states have not been resolved owing to its closed band gap which makes the bulk states dominant. Here, we report the signatures of the edge superconductivity by superconducting quantum interference measurements in multilayer WTe 2 Josephson junctions and we directly map the localized supercurrent. In thick WTe 2 ( ⁠ ∼ 60 n m ) ⁠ , the supercurrent is uniformly distributed by bulk states with symmetric Josephson effect ( ⁠ | I c + ( B ) | = | I c − ( B ) | ⁠ ). In thin WTe 2 (10 nm), however, the supercurrent becomes confined to the edge and its width reaches up to 1.4 μ m and exhibits non-symmetric behavior | I c + ( B ) | ≠ | I c − ( B ) | ⁠ . The ability to tune the edge domination by changing thickness and the edge superconductivity establishes WTe 2 as a promising topological system with exotic quantum phases and a rich physics.},

  abstract     = {Inspired by nature, improving photosensitization represents a vital direction for the development of artificial photosynthesis. The sensitization ability of photosensitizers (PSs) reflects in their electron-transfer ability, which highly depends on their excited-state lifetime and redox potential. Herein, for the first time, we put forward a facile strategy to improve sensitizing ability via finely tuning the excited state of Ru(II)-PSs ( Ru-1 – Ru-4 ) for efficient CO 2 reduction. Remarkably, [Ru(Phen) 2 (3-pyrenylPhen)] 2+ ( Ru-3 ) exhibits the best sensitizing ability among Ru-1 – Ru-4 , over 17 times higher than that of typical Ru(Phen) 3 2+ . It can efficiently sensitize a dinuclear cobalt catalyst for CO 2 -to-CO conversion with a maximum turnover number of 66 480. Systematic investigations demonstrate that its long-lived excited state and suitable redox driving force greatly contributed to this superior sensitizing ability. This work provides a new insight into dramatically boosting photocatalytic CO 2 reduction via improving photosensitization.},

  abstract     = {Hydropower development is the key strategy in many developing countries for energy supply, climate-change mitigation and economic development. However, it is commonly assumed that river dams retain nutrients and therefore reduce downstream primary productivity and fishery catches, compromising food security and causing trans-boundary disputes. Contrary to expectation, here we found that a cascade of reservoirs along the upper Mekong River increased downstream bioavailability of nitrogen and phosphorus. The dams caused phytoplankton density to increase with hydraulic residence time and stratification of the stagnant reservoirs caused hypoxia at depth. This allowed the release of bioavailable phosphorus from the sediment and an increase in dissolved inorganic nitrogen as well as a shift in nitrogen species from nitrate to ammonium, which were transported downstream by the discharge of water from the base of the dam. Our findings provide a new perspective on the environmental impacts of river dams on nutrient cycling and ecosystem functioning, with potential implications for sustainable development of hydropower worldwide.},

Here, we show unequivocally that preimplantation mouse embryos can develop in space, but the rate of blastocyst formation and blastocyst quality are compromised. Additionally, the cells in the embryo contain severe DNA damage, while the genome of the blastocysts developed in space is globally hypomethylated with a unique set of differentially methylated regions. The developmental defects, DNA damage and epigenetic abnormalities can be largely mimicked by the treatment with ground-based low-dose radiation. However, the exposure to simulated microgravity alone does not cause major disruptions of embryonic development, indicating that radiation is the main cause for the developmental defects. This work advances the understanding of embryonic development in space and reveals long-term extreme low-dose radiation as a hazardous factor for mammalian reproduction.},

  abstract     = {Effective therapies are urgently needed for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Chloroquine has been proved to have antiviral effect against coronavirus in vitro . In this study, we aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of chloroquine with different doses in COVID-19. In this multicenter prospective observational study, we enrolled patients older than 18 years old with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection excluding critical cases from 12 hospitals in Guangdong and Hubei Provinces. Eligible patients received chloroquine phosphate 500 mg, orally, once (half dose) or twice (full dose) daily. Patients treated with non-chloroquine therapy were included as historical controls. The primary endpoint is the time to undetectable viral RNA. Secondary outcomes include the proportion of patients with undetectable viral RNA by day 10 and 14, hospitalization time, duration of fever, and adverse events. A total of 197 patients completed chloroquine treatment, and 176 patients were included as historical controls. The median time to achieve an undetectable viral RNA was shorter in chloroquine than in non-chloroquine (absolute difference in medians −6.0 days; 95% CI −6.0 to −4.0). The duration of fever is shorter in chloroquine (geometric mean ratio 0.6; 95% CI 0.5 to 0.8). No serious adverse events were observed in the chloroquine group. Patients treated with half dose experienced lower rate of adverse events than with full dose. Although randomized trials are needed for further evaluation, this study provides evidence for safety and efficacy of chloroquine in COVID-19 and suggests that chloroquine can be a cost-effective therapy for combating the COVID-19 pandemic.},

  abstract     = {The biological species concept (BSC) is the cornerstone of neo-Darwinian thinking. In BSC, species do not exchange genes either during or after speciation. However, as gene flow during speciation is increasingly being reported in a substantial literature, it seems time to reassess the revered, but often doubted, BSC. Contrary to the common perception, BSC should expect substantial gene flow at the onset of speciation, not least because geographical isolation develops gradually. Although BSC does not stipulate how speciation begins, it does require a sustained period of isolation for speciation to complete its course. Evidence against BSC must demonstrate that the observed gene flow does not merely occur at the onset of speciation but continues until its completion. Importantly, recent genomic analyses cannot reject this more realistic version of BSC, although future analyses may still prove it wrong. The ultimate acceptance or rejection of BSC is not merely about a historical debate; rather, it is about the fundamental nature of species – are species (and, hence, divergent adaptations) driven by a relatively small number of genes, or by thousands of them? Many levels of biology, ranging from taxonomy to biodiversity, depend on this resolution.},

Therefore, this review discusses the basic theories and application bottlenecks of multi-electron mechanisms from the view of thermodynamic and dynamic principles. In future, high-energy batteries, metal anodes and multi-electron cathodes are promising electrode materials with high theoretical capacity and high output voltage. While the primary issue for the multi-electron transfer process is sluggish kinetics, which may be caused by multiple ionic migration, large ionic radius, high reaction energy barrier, low electron conductivity, poor structural stability, etc., it is urgent that feasible and versatile modification methods are summarized and new inspiration proposed in order to break through kinetic constraints. Finally, the remaining challenges and future research directions are revealed in detail, involving the search for high-energy systems, compatibility of full cells, cost control, etc.},

Its practical viability, however, hinges on the development of advanced electrocatalysts, preferably composed of non-precious elements, to selectively expedite this reaction, particularly in acidic medium. Our study here introduces 2H-MoTe 2 for the first time as the efficient non-precious-metal-based electrocatalyst for the electrochemical production of hydrogen peroxide in acids. We show that exfoliated 2H-MoTe 2 nanoflakes have high activity (onset overpotential ∼140 mV and large mass activity of 27 A g −1 at 0.4 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode), great selectivity (H 2 O 2 percentage up to 93%) and decent stability in 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 . Theoretical simulations evidence that the high activity and selectivity of 2H-MoTe 2 arise from the proper binding energies of HOO * and O * at its zigzag edges that jointly favor the two-electron reduction instead of the four-electron reduction of molecular oxygen.},

Here, we construct a sulfonated poly (ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) nanochannel membrane with numerous nanochannels for a membrane-based osmotic power generator. The parallel nanochannels with high space charges show excellent cation-selectivity, which could further be improved by adjusting the length and charge density of nanochannels. Based on numerical simulation, the system with space charge shows better conductivity and selectivity than those of a surface-charged nanochannel. The output power density of our proposed membrane-based device reaches up to 5.8 W/m 2 by mixing artificial seawater and river water. Additionally, the SPEEK membranes exhibit good mechanical properties, endowing the possibility of creating a high-endurance scale-up membrane-based generator system.

Here, for the first time, we report use of a wet-chemical method to synthesize partially hydroxylated ultrathin Ir nanosheets (Ir-NSs) of only five to six atomic layers’ thickness. Detailed analysis indicates that the growth confinement effect of carbon monoxide and the partially hydroxylated surface play a critical role in formation of the ultrathin structure. The ultrathin Ir-NSs exhibit excellent performance for both the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction in a wide pH range, outperforming the state-of-the-art Pt/C and IrO 2 , respectively. Density-functional theory calculations reveal that the partial hydroxylation not only enhances the surface electron transfer between Ir-sites and intermediate O-species, but also guarantees efficient initial activation of bond cleavage of H-O-H for first-step H 2 O splitting. This, ultimately, breaks through barriers to full water splitting, with efficient electron transfer essentially maintained.},

  abstract     = {Although much attention has been paid to investigating and controlling air pollution in China, the trends of air-pollutant concentrations on a national scale have remained unclear. Here, we quantitatively investigated the variation of air pollutants in China using long-term comprehensive data sets from 2013 to 2017, during which Chinese government made major efforts to reduce anthropogenic emission in polluted regions. Our results show a significant decreasing trend in the PM 2.5 concentration in heavily polluted regions of eastern China, with an annual decrease of ∼7% compared with measurements in 2013. The measured decreased concentrations of SO 2 , NO 2 and CO (a proxy for anthropogenic volatile organic compounds) could explain a large fraction of the decreased PM 2.5 concentrations in different regions. As a consequence, the heavily polluted days decreased significantly in corresponding regions. Concentrations of organic aerosol, nitrate, sulfate, ammonium and chloride measured in urban Beijing revealed a remarkable reduction from 2013 to 2017, connecting the decreases in aerosol precursors with corresponding chemical components closely. However, surface-ozone concentrations showed increasing trends in most urban stations from 2013 to 2017, which indicates stronger photochemical pollution. The boundary-layer height in capital cities of eastern China showed no significant trends over the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei, Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta regions from 2013 to 2017, which confirmed the reduction in anthropogenic emissions. Our results demonstrated that the Chinese government was successful in the reduction of particulate matter in urban areas from 2013 to 2017, although the ozone concentration has increased significantly, suggesting a more complex mechanism of improving Chinese air quality in the future.},

  abstract     = {Hydrothermal fluid is essential for transporting metals in the crust and mantle. To explore the potential of Cu isotopes as a tracer of hydrothermal-fluid activity, Cu-isotope fractionation factors between Cl-bearing aqueous fluids and silicate magmas (andesite, dacite, rhyolite dacite, rhyolite and haplogranite) were experimentally calibrated. Fluids containing 1.75–14 wt.% Cl were mixed together with rock powders in Au 95 Cu 5 alloy capsules, which were equilibrated in cold-seal pressure vessels for 5–13 days at 800–850°C and 2 kbar. The elemental and Cu-isotopic compositions of the recovered aqueous fluid and solid phases were analyzed by (LA-) ICP–MS and multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, respectively. Our experimental results show that the fluid phases are consistently enriched in heavy Cu isotope ( 65 Cu) relative to the coexisting silicates. The Cu-isotope fractionation factor (Δ 65 Cu FLUID-MELT ) ranges from 0.08 ± 0.01‰ to 0.69 ± 0.02‰. The experimental results show that the Cu-isotopic fractionation factors between aqueous fluids and silicates strongly depend on the Cu speciation in the fluids (e.g. CuCl(H 2 O), CuCl 2 – and CuCl 3 2− ) and silicate melts (CuO 1/2 ), suggesting that the exsolved fluids may have higher δ 65 Cu than the residual magmas. Our results suggest the elevated δ 65 Cu values in Cu-enriched rocks could be produced by addition of aqueous fluids exsolved from magmas. Together with previous studies on Cu isotopes in the brine and vapor phases of porphyry deposits, our results are helpful for better understanding Cu-mineralization processes.},

After classifying individual cells, we generated a spatial and temporal landscape of glioma that revealed the patterns of invasion between the different sub-regions of gliomas. We also used single-cell inferred copy number variations and pseudotime trajectories to inform on the crucial branches that dominate tumor progression. The dynamic cell components of the multi-region biopsy analysis allowed us to spatially deconvolute with unprecedented accuracy the transcriptomic features of the core and those of the periphery of glioma at single-cell level. Through this rich and geographically detailed dataset, we were also able to characterize and construct the chemokine and chemokine receptor interactions that exist among different tumor and non-tumor cells. This study provides the first spatial-level analysis of the cellular states that characterize human gliomas.

Here we propose a unified framework to study the origins of the discontinuous transitions of the percolation process on interacting networks. The model evolves in generations with the result of the present percolation depending on the previous state, and thus is history-dependent. Both theoretical analysis and Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the nature of the transition remains the same at finite generations but exhibits an abrupt change for the infinite generation. We use brain functional correlation and morphological similarity data to show that our model also provides a general method to explore the network structure and can contribute to many practical applications, such as detecting the abnormal structures of human brain networks.},

While these topological states are not accessible in condensed matter systems, recent works have shown that synthetic systems, such as photonic crystals or electric circuits, can realize higher-dimensional band structures. Here, we argue that, because of its symmetry properties, the 4D spinless topological insulator is particularly well suited for implementation in these synthetic systems. We explicitly construct a 2D electric circuit lattice, whose resonance frequency spectrum simulates the 4D spinless topological insulator. We perform detailed numerical calculations of the circuit lattice and show that the resonance frequency spectrum exhibits pairs of 3D Weyl boundary states, a hallmark of the nontrivial topology. These pairs of 3D Weyl states with the same chirality are protected by classical time-reversal symmetry that squares to +1, which is inherent in the proposed circuit lattice. We also discuss how the simulated 4D topological band structure can be observed in experiments.},

In this work, we propose a novel light-controlled strategy for surface wrinkles, which can dynamically and precisely regulate all basic characteristics of wrinkles, including wavelength, amplitude, direction and location ( λ , A , θ and L c ), and arbitrarily tune wrinkle topographies in two dimensions (2D). By considering the bidirectional Poisson&#39;s effect and soft boundary conditions, a modified theoretical model depicting the relation between stress distributions and the basic characteristics was developed to reveal the mechanical mechanism of the regulation strategy. Furthermore, the resulting 2D ordered wrinkles can be used as a dynamic optical grating and a smart template to reversibly regulate the morphology of various functional materials. This study will pave the way for wrinkle regulation and guide fabrication technology for functional wrinkled surfaces.},

Although the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the top-performance OPV cells have surpassed 16%, the devices are usually fabricated via a spin-coating method and are not suitable for large-area production. Here, we demonstrate that the fine-modification of the flexible side chains of NFAs can yield 17% PCE for OPV cells. More crucially, as the optimal NFA has a suitable solubility and thus a desirable morphology, the high efficiencies of spin-coated devices can be maintained when using scalable blade-coating processing technology. Our results suggest that optimization of the chemical structures of the OPV materials can improve device performance. This has great significance in larger-area production technologies that provide important scientific insights for the commercialization of OPV cells.},

The interactions between molecular vibrations and plasmons lead to not only the enhancement of spectral intensity, but also the distortion of spectral Lorentzian lineshapes into asymmetric Fano-type or more complicated lineshapes in the SEIRA spectra; this effect hampers the correct readout of vibrational frequencies and intensities for an accurate interpretation of the measured spectra and quantitative analysis. In this work, we investigate the Fano interference between molecular vibrations and plasmons based on exact electrodynamic simulations and theoretical models. We report that, even if the molecular vibrational energy is equal to the plasmon resonant energy, the molecule–nanostructure distance-dependent dipole–dipole interactions, the plasmon-mediated coherent intermolecular interactions and the decay rates of plasmons have a significant impact on the SEIRA lineshapes. This study paves the way for controllable Fano interference at the nanoscale and more studies on plasmon-dressed molecular electronic or vibrational excited states.},

Whereas synchrotron-based X-ray microscopy (XRM) represents a unique approach for imaging a whole cell with nanoscale resolution due to its intrinsic nanoscale resolution and great penetration ability, existing approaches to label biomolecules rely on the use of exogenous tags that are multi-step and error-prone. Here, we repurpose engineered peroxidases as genetically encoded X-ray-sensitive tags (GXET) for site-specific labeling of protein-of-interest in mammalian cells. We find that 3,3 ′ -diaminobenzidine (DAB) polymers that are in-situ catalytically formed by fusion-expressed peroxidases are visible under XRM. Using this new tag, we imaged the protein location associated with the alteration of a DNA-methylation pathway with an ultra-high resolution of 30 nanometers. Importantly, the excellent energy resolution of XRM enables multicolor imaging using different peroxidase tags. The development of GXET enlightens the way to nanoscopic imaging for biological studies.},

However, it is generally accepted that Li metal wets graphite poorly, causing its spreading and infiltration difficult. Here we show that graphite can either appear superlithiophilic or lithiophobic, depending on the local redox potential. By comparing the wetting performance of highly ordered pyrolytic graphite, porous carbon paper (PCP), lithiated PCP and graphite powder, we demonstrate that the surface contaminants that pin the contact-line motion and cause contact-angle hysteresis have their own electrochemical-stability windows. The surface contaminants can be either removed or reinforced in a time-dependent manner, depending on whether the reducing agents (C 6 →LiC 6 ) or the oxidizing agents (air, moisture) dominate in the ambient environment, leading to bifurcating dynamics of either superfast or superslow wetting. Our findings enable new fabrication technology for Li–graphite composite with a controllable Li-metal/graphite ratio and present great promise for the mass production of Li-based anodes for use in high-energy-density batteries.},

  abstract     = {Observational analysis shows that there is a predominant global-scale multidecadal variability (GMV) of sea-surface temperature (SST). Its horizontal pattern resembles that of the interdecadal Pacific oscillation (IPO) in the Pacific and the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) in the Atlantic Ocean, which could affect global precipitation and temperature over the globe. Here, we demonstrate that the GMV could be driven by the AMO through atmospheric teleconnections and atmosphere–ocean coupling processes. Observations reveal a strong negative correlation when AMO leads GMV by approximately 4–8 years. Pacemaker experiments using a climate model driven by observed AMO signals reveal that the tropical Atlantic warm SST anomalies of AMO initiate anomalous cooling in the equatorial central-eastern Pacific through atmospheric teleconnections. Anticyclonic anomalies in the North and South Pacific induce equatorward winds along the coasts of North and South America, contributing to further cooling. The upper-ocean dynamics plays a minor role in GMV formation but contributes to a delayed response of the IPO to the AMO forcing. The possible impact of the GMV on AMO was also tested by prescribing only Pacific SST in the model; however, the model could not reproduce the observed phase relationship between the AMO and the GMV. These results support the hypothesis that the Atlantic Ocean plays a key role in the multidecadal variability of global SST.},

Here we show that Ultrabithorax ( Ubx) is a key regulator for switching between the long- and short-wing forms of rice planthoppers. Ubx is expressed in both forewing and hindwing pads, which is different from the canonical model of Ubx expression. In brown planthoppers, expression of Ubx ( NlUbx ) is regulated by nutritional status of the rice host. High-quality young plants induce NlUbx expression leading to the short-wing form; low-quality ripe plants reduce NlUbx expression resulting in long-wing form. We also showed that NlUbx is regulated by the insulin receptors NlInR1 and NlInR2. The default expression of NlInR1 inhibits NlUbx resulting in long-wings, while high-quality hosts induce NlInR2 expression, which represses NlInR1 thus promoting NlUbx expression to produce short-wings.},

  abstract     = {Genic functions have long been confounded by pleiotropic mutational effects. To understand such genetic effects, we examine HAP4, a well-studied transcription factor in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that functions by forming a tetramer with HAP2, HAP3 and HAP5. Deletion of HAP4 results in highly pleiotropic gene expression responses, some of which are clustered in related cellular processes (clustered effects) while most are distributed randomly across diverse cellular processes (distributed effects). Strikingly, the distributed effects that account for much of HAP4 pleiotropy tend to be non-heritable in a population, suggesting they have few evolutionary consequences. Indeed, these effects are poorly conserved in closely related yeasts. We further show substantial overlaps of clustered effects, but not distributed effects, among the four genes encoding the HAP2/3/4/5 tetramer. This pattern holds for other biochemically characterized yeast protein complexes or metabolic pathways. Examination of a set of cell morphological traits of the deletion lines yields consistent results. Hence, only some deletion effects of a gene support related biochemical understandings with the rest being often pleiotropic and evolutionarily decoupled from the gene&#39;s normal functions. This study suggests a new framework for reverse genetic analysis.},

  abstract     = {The pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global public health crisis. The symptoms of COVID-19 range from mild to severe, but the physiological changes associated with COVID-19 are barely understood. In this study, we performed targeted metabolomic and lipidomic analyses of plasma from a cohort of patients with COVID-19 who had experienced different symptoms. We found that metabolite and lipid alterations exhibit apparent correlation with the course of disease in these patients, indicating that the development of COVID-19 affected their whole-body metabolism. In particular, malic acid of the TCA cycle and carbamoyl phosphate of the urea cycle result in altered energy metabolism and hepatic dysfunction, respectively. It should be noted that carbamoyl phosphate is profoundly down-regulated in patients who died compared with patients with mild symptoms. And, more importantly, guanosine monophosphate (GMP), which is mediated not only by GMP synthase but also by CD39 and CD73, is significantly changed between healthy subjects and patients with COVID-19, as well as between the mild and fatal cases. In addition, dyslipidemia was observed in patients with COVID-19. Overall, the disturbed metabolic patterns have been found to align with the progress and severity of COVID-19. This work provides valuable knowledge about plasma biomarkers associated with COVID-19 and potential therapeutic targets, as well as an important resource for further studies of the pathogenesis of COVID-19.},

  abstract     = {Modern control systems are featured by their hierarchical structure composed of cyber, physical and human layers. The intricate dependencies among multiple layers and units of modern control systems require an integrated framework to address cross-layer design issues related to security and resilience challenges. To this end, game theory provides a bottom-up modeling paradigm to capture the strategic interactions among multiple components of the complex system and enables a holistic view to understand and design cyber-physical-human control systems. In this review, we first provide a multi-layer perspective toward increasingly complex and integrated control systems and then introduce several variants of dynamic games for modeling different layers of control systems. We present game-theoretic methods for understanding the fundamental tradeoffs of robustness, security and resilience and developing a cross-layer approach to enhance the system performance in various adversarial environments. This review also includes three quintessential research problems that represent three research directions where dynamic game approaches can bridge between multiple research areas and make significant contributions to the design of modern control systems. The paper is concluded with a discussion on emerging areas of research that crosscut dynamic games and control systems.},

In 2016, Surrey was named as ‘University of the Year’ in the UK and, in February 2018, Surrey won the Queen&#39;s Anniversary Prize for Higher and Further Education (Surrey&#39;s fourth award)—the highest national award for the UK universities, in recognition of the outstanding contribution of Surrey to nutrition and health. The president and vice chancellor of Surrey, Professor Max Lu, took this position in 2016 and is also the first scholar of Chinese origin to be the leader of a British university. Before he joined Surrey, he was the provost and senior vice president at the University of Queensland in Australia. Professor Lu is not only a talented leader in education field, but also a distinguished scientist in materials chemistry and nanotechnology area. He has been honored with numerous awards, including the Orica Award, RK Murphy Medal, China International Science and Technology Award and Medal of the Order of Australia, etc. He has been also appointed to the Prime Minister&#39;s Council for Science and Technology and the Board of UK Research and Innovation, etc. The rich experience and open-mindedness lead to his profound insights into higher education around the world.

Here, we propose an Anticipated Learning Machine (ALM) to achieve precise future-state predictions based on short-term but high-dimensional data. From non-linear dynamical systems theory, we show that ALM can transform recent correlation/spatial information of high-dimensional variables into future dynamical/temporal information of any target variable, thereby overcoming the small-sample problem and achieving multistep-ahead predictions. Since the training samples generated from high-dimensional data also include information of the unknown future values of the target variable, it is called anticipated learning. Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate significantly superior performances of ALM over all of the existing 12 methods. In contrast to traditional statistics-based machine learning, ALM is based on non-linear dynamics, thus opening a new way for dynamics-based machine learning.},

  abstract     = {Living birds are unique among vertebrates in the formation of a female-specific bone tissue called medullary bone (MB) that is strictly associated with reproductive activity. MB is a rapidly mobilized source of calcium and phosphorus for the production of eggshell. Among living taxa, its skeletal distribution can be highly extensive such that it even exists in the ribs of some species. Due to its ephemeral nature, MB is rarely fossilized and so little is understood with regard to the origin of MB and its skeletal distribution in early taxa. Here we describe a new Early Cretaceous enantiornithine bird, Mirusavis parvus , gen. et. sp. nov., indicating that skeleton-wide distribution of MB appeared early in avian evolution. We suggest that this represents the plesiomorphic condition for the Aves and that the distribution of MB observed among extant neornithines is a product of increased pneumatization in this lineage and natural selection for more efficient distribution of MB.},

  abstract     = {Although β-Fe 2 O 3 has a high theoretical solar-to-hydrogen efficiency because of its narrow band gap, the study of β-Fe 2 O 3 photoanodes for water splitting is elusive as a result of their metastable nature. Raman identification of β-Fe 2 O 3 is theoretically and experimentally investigated in this study for the first time, thus clarifying the debate about its Raman spectrum in the literature. Phase transformation of β-Fe 2 O 3 to α-Fe 2 O 3 was found to potentially take place under laser and electron irradiation as well as annealing. Herein, phase transformation of β-Fe 2 O 3 to α-Fe 2 O 3 was inhibited by introduction of Zr doping, and β-Fe 2 O 3 was found to withstand a higher annealing temperature without any phase transformation. The solar water splitting photocurrent of the Zr-doped β-Fe 2 O 3 photoanode was increased by 500% compared to that of the pure β-Fe 2 O 3 photoanode. Additionally, Zr-doped β-Fe 2 O 3 exhibited very good stability during the process of solar water splitting. These results indicate that by improving its thermal stability, metastable β-Fe 2 O 3 film is a promising photoanode for solar water splitting.},

  abstract     = {Active crystal facets can generate special properties for various applications. Herein, we report a (001) faceted nanosheet-constructed hierarchically porous TiO 2 /rGO hybrid architecture with unprecedented and highly stable lithium storage performance. Density functional theory calculations show that the (001) faceted TiO 2 nanosheets enable enhanced reaction kinetics by reinforcing their contact with the electrolyte and shortening the path length of Li + diffusion and insertion-extraction. The reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets in this TiO 2 /rGO hybrid largely improve charge transport, while the porous hierarchy at different length scales favors continuous electrolyte permeation and accommodates volume change. This hierarchically porous TiO 2 /rGO hybrid anode material demonstrates an excellent reversible capacity of 250 mAh g –1 at 1 C (1 C = 335 mA g –1 ) at a voltage window of 1.0–3.0 V. Even after 1000 cycles at 5 C and 500 cycles at 10 C, the anode retains exceptional and stable capacities of 176 and 160 mAh g –1 , respectively. Moreover, the formed Li 2 Ti 2 O 4 nanodots facilitate reversed Li + insertion-extraction during the cycling process. The above results indicate the best performance of TiO 2 -based materials as anodes for lithium-ion batteries reported in the literature.},

To guide the screen and design for artificial hosts, catalysts and drug delivery, understanding the physical nature of ion–π complexes via descriptors is indispensable. However, even with multiple descriptors that contain the leading term of electrostatic and polarized interactions, the quantitative description for the binding energies (BEs) of ion–π complexes is still lacking because of the intrinsic shortcomings of the commonly used descriptors. Here, we have shown that the impartment of orbital details into the electrostatic energy (coined as OEE) makes an excellent single descriptor for BEs of not only spherical, but also multiply-shaped, ion–π systems, highlighting the importance of an accurate description of the electrostatic interactions. Our results have further demonstrated that OEEs from a low-level method could be calibrated to BEs from a high-level method, offering a powerful practical strategy for an accurate prediction of a set of ion–π interactions.},

  abstract     = {Understanding unidirectional and topological wave phenomena requires the unveiling of intrinsic geometry and symmetry for wave dynamics. This is essential yet challenging for the flexible control of near-field evanescent waves, highly desirable in broad practical scenarios ranging from information communication to energy radiation. However, exploitations of near-field waves are limited by a lack of fundamental understanding about inherent near-field symmetry and directional coupling at sub-wavelengths, especially for longitudinal waves. Here, based on the acoustic wave platform, we show the efficient selective couplings enabled by near-field symmetry properties. Based on the inherent symmetry properties of three geometrically orthogonal vectors in near-field acoustics, we successfully realize acoustic Janus, Huygens, spin sources and quadrupole hybrid sources, respectively. Moreover, we experimentally demonstrate fertile symmetry selective directionality of those evanescent modes, supported by two opposite meta-surfaces. The symmetry properties of the near-field acoustic spin angular momenta are revealed by directly measuring local vectorial fields. Our findings advance the understanding of symmetries in near-field physics, supply feasible approaches for directional couplings, and pave the way for promising acoustic devices in the future.},

  abstract     = {The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic started in late December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since impacted a large portion of China and raised major global concern. Herein, we investigated the extent of molecular divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and other related coronaviruses. Although we found only 4% variability in genomic nucleotides between SARS-CoV-2 and a bat SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV; RaTG13), the difference at neutral sites was 17%, suggesting the divergence between the two viruses is much larger than previously estimated. Our results suggest that the development of new variations in functional sites in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike seen in SARS-CoV-2 and viruses from pangolin SARSr-CoVs are likely caused by natural selection besides recombination. Population genetic analyses of 103 SARS-CoV-2 genomes indicated that these viruses had two major lineages (designated L and S), that are well defined by two different SNPs that show nearly complete linkage across the viral strains sequenced to date. We found that L lineage was more prevalent than the S lineage within the limited patient samples we examined. The implication of these evolutionary changes on disease etiology remains unclear. These findings strongly underscores the urgent need for further comprehensive studies that combine viral genomic data, with epidemiological studies of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).},

  abstract     = {A recent outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, China was found to be caused by a 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2 or HCoV-19). We previously reported the clinical features of 12 patients with 2019-nCoV infections in Shenzhen, China. To further understand the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and find better ways to monitor and treat the disease caused by 2019-nCoV, we measured the levels of 48 cytokines in the blood plasma of those 12 COVID-19 patients. Thirty-eight out of the 48 measured cytokines in the plasma of 2019-nCoV-infected patients were significantly elevated compared to healthy individuals. Seventeen cytokines were linked to 2019-nCoV loads. Fifteen cytokines, namely M-CSF, IL-10, IFN-α2, IL-17, IL-4, IP-10, IL-7, IL-1ra, G-CSF, IL-12, IFN-γ, IL-1α, IL-2, HGF and PDGF-BB, were strongly associated with the lung-injury Murray score and could be used to predict the disease severity of 2019-nCoV infections by calculating the area under the curve of the receiver-operating characteristics. Our results suggest that 2019-nCoV infections trigger extensive changes in a wide array of cytokines, some of which could be potential biomarkers of disease severity of 2019-nCoV infections. These findings will likely improve our understanding of the immunopathologic mechanisms of this emerging disease. Our results also suggest that modulators of cytokine responses may play a therapeutic role in combating the disease once the functions of these elevated cytokines have been characterized.},

  abstract     = {Sequencing multiple species that share the same ecological niche may be a new frontier for genomic studies. While such studies should shed light on molecular convergence, genomic-level analyses have been unsuccessful, due mainly to the absence of empirical controls. Woody plant species that colonized the global tropical coasts, collectively referred to as mangroves, are ideal for convergence studies. Here, we sequenced the genomes/transcriptomes of 16 species belonging in three major mangrove clades. To detect convergence in a large phylogeny, a CCS+ model is implemented, extending the more limited CCS method (convergence at conservative sites). Using the empirical control for reference, the CCS+ model reduces the noises drastically, thus permitting the identification of 73 convergent genes with P true (probability of true convergence) &gt; 0.9. Products of the convergent genes tend to be on the plasma membrane associated with salinity tolerance. Importantly, convergence is more often manifested at a higher level than at amino-acid (AA) sites. Relative to &gt;50 plant species, mangroves strongly prefer 4 AAs and avoid 5 others across the genome. AA substitutions between mangrove species strongly reflect these tendencies. In conclusion, the selection of taxa, the number of species and, in particular, the empirical control are all crucial for detecting genome-wide convergence. We believe this large study of mangroves is the first successful attempt at detecting genome-wide site convergence.},

In this study, we have sequenced the genome of a Nerophinae member, the Manado pipefish ( Microphis manadensis ), which has a semi-enclosed brood pouch. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that the molecular evolutionary rate of the four syngnathids is higher than that of other teleosts. The loss of all but one P/Q-rich SCPP gene in the syngnathids suggests a role for the lost genes in dentin and enameloid formation in teleosts. Genome-wide comparison identified a set of 118 genes with parallel identical amino acid substitutions in syngnathids and placental mammals. Association of some of these genes with placental and embryonic development in mammals suggests a role for them in syngnathid pregnancy.},

  abstract     = {Links in most real networks often change over time. Such temporality of links encodes the ordering and causality of interactions between nodes and has a profound effect on network dynamics and function. Empirical evidence has shown that the temporal nature of links in many real-world networks is not random. Nonetheless, it is challenging to predict temporal link patterns while considering the entanglement between topological and temporal link patterns. Here, we propose an entropy-rate-based framework, based on combined topological–temporal regularities, for quantifying the predictability of any temporal network. We apply our framework on various model networks, demonstrating that it indeed captures the intrinsic topological–temporal regularities whereas previous methods considered only temporal aspects. We also apply our framework on 18 real networks of different types and determine their predictability. Interestingly, we find that, for most real temporal networks, despite the greater complexity of predictability brought by the increase in dimension, the combined topological–temporal predictability is higher than the temporal predictability. Our results demonstrate the necessity for incorporating both temporal and topological aspects of networks in order to improve predictions of dynamical processes.},

  abstract     = {Satellites have shown free-space quantum-communication ability; however, they are orbit-limited from full-time all-location coverage. Meanwhile, practical quantum networks require satellite constellations, which are complicated and expensive, whereas the airborne mobile quantum communication may be a practical alternative to offering full-time all-location multi-weather coverage in a cost-effective way. Here, we demonstrate the first mobile entanglement distribution based on drones, realizing multi-weather operation including daytime and rainy nights, with a Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt S-parameter measured to be 2.41 ± 0.14 and 2.49 ± 0.06, respectively. Such a system shows unparalleled mobility, flexibility and reconfigurability compared to the existing satellite and fiber-based quantum communication, and reveals its potential to establish a multinode quantum network, with a scalable design using symmetrical lens diameter and single-mode-fiber coupling. All key technologies have been developed to pack quantum nodes into lightweight mobile platforms for local-area coverage, and arouse further technical improvements to establish wide-area quantum networks with high-altitude mobile communication.},

  abstract     = {Chang’E-4 landed in the South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin, providing a unique chance to probe the composition of the lunar interior. Its landing site is located on ejecta strips in Von Kármán crater that possibly originate from the neighboring Finsen crater. A surface rock and the lunar regolith at 10 sites along the rover Yutu-2 track were measured by the onboard Visible and Near-Infrared Imaging Spectrometer in the first three lunar days of mission operations. In situ spectra of the regolith have peak band positions at 1 and 2 μm, similar to the spectral data of Finsen ejecta from the Moon Mineralogy Mapper, which confirms that the regolith&#39;s composition of the landing area is mostly similar to that of Finsen ejecta. The rock spectrum shows similar band peak positions, but stronger absorptions, suggesting relatively fresh exposure. The rock may consist of 38.1 ± 5.4% low-Ca pyroxene, 13.9 ± 5.1% olivine and 48.0 ± 3.1% plagioclase, referred to as olivine-norite. The plagioclase-abundant and olivine-poor modal composition of the rock is inconsistent with the origin of the mantle, but representative of the lunar lower crust. Alternatively, the rock crystallized from the impact-derived melt pool formed by the SPA-impact event via mixing the lunar crust and mantle materials. This scenario is consistent with fast-cooling thermal conditions of a shallow melt pool, indicated by the fine to medium-sized texture (&lt;3 mm) of the rock and the SPA-impact melting model [ Icarus 2012; 220 : 730–43].},

  abstract     = {Afforestation in China provides carbon sequestration and prevents soil erosion, but its remote impacts on climate in other regions via the coupling of forest energy fluxes with atmospheric circulation are largely unknown. Here, we prescribe inventory-based forest cover change and satellite-observed leaf area index from 1982 to 2011 in a coupled land-atmosphere model to simulate their biophysical climate effects. Both local and global surface air temperatures show a seasonal contrast in response to past vegetation cover expansion over China: a phenomenon we primarily attribute to a variation of seasonality of vegetation greening. A large cooling in spring results in concurrent decreases in geopotential height over China and zonal wind over Mongolia, causing a dipole structure in the upper troposphere over the Arctic. This accounts for ∼58% of simulated spring warming over the Russian Arctic and ∼61% of simulated spring cooling over the Canadian Artic. Our results imply that spring vegetation dynamics in China may affect climate in northern high latitudes.},

  abstract     = {The aorta, with ascending, arch, thoracic and abdominal segments, responds to the heartbeat, senses metabolites and distributes blood to all parts of the body. However, the heterogeneity across aortic segments and how metabolic pathologies change it are not known. Here, a total of 216 612 individual cells from the ascending aorta, aortic arch, and thoracic and abdominal segments of mouse aortas under normal conditions or with high blood glucose levels, high dietary salt, or high fat intake were profiled using single-cell RNA sequencing. We generated a compendium of 10 distinct cell types, mainly endothelial (EC), smooth muscle (SMC), stromal and immune cells. The distributions of the different cells and their intercommunication were influenced by the hemodynamic microenvironment across anatomical segments, and the spatial heterogeneity of ECs and SMCs may contribute to differential vascular dilation and constriction that were measured by wire myography. Importantly, the composition of aortic cells, their gene expression profiles and their regulatory intercellular networks broadly changed in response to high fat/salt/glucose conditions. Notably, the abdominal aorta showed the most dramatic changes in cellular composition, particularly involving ECs, fibroblasts and myeloid cells with cardiovascular risk factor-related regulons and gene expression networks. Our study elucidates the nature and range of aortic cell diversity, with implications for the treatment of metabolic pathologies.},

Super-hierarchical electrode architectures of Li 2 SiO 3 /TiO 2 @nano-carbon anode (LSO.TO@nano-C) and high-voltage olivine LiMnPO 4 @nano-carbon cathode (LMPO@nano-C) are designed for half- and full-system LIB-CR2032 coin cell models. On the basis of primary architecture-power-driven LIB geometrics, the structure keys including three-dimensional (3D) modeling superhierarchy, multiscale micro/nano architectures and anisotropic surface heterogeneity affect the buildup design of anode/cathode LIB electrodes. Such hierarchical electrode surface topologies enable continuous in-/out-flow rates and fast transport pathways of Li + -ions during charge/discharge cycles. The stacked layer configurations of pouch LIB-types lead to excellent charge/discharge rate, and energy density of 237.6 Wh kg −1 . As the most promising LIB-configurations, the high specific energy density of hierarchical pouch battery systems may improve energy storage for long-driving range of electric vehicles. Indeed, the anisotropic alignments of hierarchical electrode architectures in the large-scale LIBs provide proof of excellent capacity storage and outstanding durability and cyclability. The full-system LIB-CR2032 coin cell models maintain high specific capacity of ∼89.8% within a long-term life period of 2000 cycles, and average Coulombic efficiency of 99.8% at 1C rate for future configuration of LIB manufacturing and commercialization challenges.},

  abstract     = {According to the statistics of the World Health Organization, an estimated 17.9 million people die from cardiovascular diseases each year, representing 31% of all global deaths. Continuous non-invasive arterial pressure (CNAP) is essential for the management of cardiovascular diseases. However, it is difficult to achieve long-term CNAP monitoring with the daily use of current devices due to irritation of the skin as well as the lack of motion artifacts suppression. Here, we report a high-performance skin-like optoelectronic system integrated with ultra-thin flexible circuits to monitor CNAP. We introduce a theoretical model via the virtual work principle for predicting the precise blood pressure and suppressing motion artifacts, and propose optical difference in the frequency domain for stable optical measurements in terms of skin-like devices. We compare the results with the blood pressure acquired by invasive (intra-arterial) blood pressure monitoring for &gt;1500 min in total on 44 subjects in an intensive care unit. The maximum absolute errors of diastolic and systolic blood pressure were ±7/±10 mm Hg, respectively, in immobilized, and ±10/±14 mm Hg, respectively, in walking scenarios. These strategies provide advanced blood pressure monitoring techniques, which would directly address an unmet clinical need or daily use for a highly vulnerable population.},

  abstract     = {A histological ground-section from a duck-billed dinosaur nestling ( Hypacrosaurus stebingeri ) revealed microstructures morphologically consistent with nuclei and chromosomes in cells within calcified cartilage. We hypothesized that this exceptional cellular preservation extended to the molecular level and had molecular features in common with extant avian cartilage. Histochemical and immunological evidence supports in situ preservation of extracellular matrix components found in extant cartilage, including glycosaminoglycans and collagen type II. Furthermore, isolated Hypacrosaurus chondrocytes react positively with two DNA intercalating stains. Specific DNA staining is only observed inside the isolated cells, suggesting endogenous nuclear material survived fossilization. Our data support the hypothesis that calcified cartilage is preserved at the molecular level in this Mesozoic material, and suggest that remnants of once-living chondrocytes, including their DNA, may preserve for millions of years.},

However, their demographic histories and the genomic consequences of their recent population declines remain unknown. We generated high-quality de novo reference genomes for critically endangered Malayan ( Manis javanica , MJ) and Chinese ( M. pentadactyla , MP) pangolins and re-sequencing population genomic data from 74 MJs and 23 MPs. We recovered the population identities of illegally traded pangolins and previously unrecognized genetic populations that should be protected as evolutionarily distinct conservation units. Demographic reconstruction suggested environmental changes have resulted in a population size fluctuation of pangolins. Additionally, recent population size declines due to human activities have resulted in an increase in inbreeding and genetic load. Deleterious mutations were enriched in genes related to cancer/diseases and cholesterol homeostasis, which may have increased their susceptibility to diseases and decreased their survival potential to adapt to environmental changes and high-cholesterol diets. This comprehensive study provides not only high-quality pangolin reference genomes, but also valuable information concerning the driving factors of long-term population size fluctuations and the genomic impact of recent population size declines due to human activities, which is essential for pangolin conservation management and global action planning.},

  abstract     = {Global coastal oceans as a whole represent an important carbon sink but, due to high spatial–temporal variability, a mechanistic conceptualization of the coastal carbon cycle is still under development, hindering the modelling and inclusion of coastal carbon in Earth System Models. Although temperature is considered an important control of sea surface p CO 2 , we show that the latitudinal distribution of global coastal surface p CO 2 does not match that of temperature, and its inter-seasonal changes are substantially regulated by non-thermal factors such as water mass mixing and net primary production. These processes operate in both ocean-dominated and river-dominated margins, with carbon and nutrients sourced from the open ocean and land, respectively. These can be conceptualized by a semi-analytical framework that assesses the consumption of dissolved inorganic carbon relative to nutrients, to determine how a coastal system is a CO 2 source or sink. The framework also finds utility in accounting for additional nutrients in organic forms and testing hypotheses such as using Redfield stoichiometry, and is therefore an essential step toward comprehensively understanding and modelling the role of the coastal ocean in the global carbon cycle.},

Here, inspired from the collective coupling and coordination of living cells, we fabricated a moisture-responsive graphene actuator swarm that has programmable shape-changing capability by programming the SU-8 patterns underneath. To get better control over the deformation, we fabricated SU-8 micropattern arrays with specific geometries and orientations on a continuous graphene oxide film, forming a swarm of bimorph actuators. In this way, predictable and complex deformations, including bending, twisting, coiling, asymmetric bending, 3D folding, and combinations of these, have been achieved due to the collective coupling and coordination of the actuator swarm. This work proposes a new way to program the deformation of bilayer actuators, expanding the capabilities of existing bimorph actuators for applications in various smart devices.},

Previous studies have reported inhibition of Aβ fibrillation or disassembly of exogenous Aβ fibrils in vitro . However, soluble Aβ oligomers have been reported with increased cytotoxicity; this might partly explain why current clinical trials targeting disassembly of Aβ fibrils by anti-Aβ antibodies have failed so far. Here we show that Au 23 (CR) 14 (a new Au nanocluster modified by Cys-Arg (CR) dipeptide) is able to completely dissolve exogenous mature Aβ fibrils into monomers and restore the natural unfolded state of Aβ peptides from misfolded β-sheets. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity of Aβ 40 fibrils when dissolved by Au 23 (CR) 14 is fully abolished. More importantly, Au 23 (CR) 14 is able to completely dissolve endogenous Aβ plaques in brain slices from transgenic AD model mice. In addition, Au 23 (CR) 14 has good biocompatibility and infiltration ability across the blood–brain barrier. Taken together, this work presents a promising therapeutics candidate for AD treatment, and manifests the potential of nanotechnological approaches in the development of nanomedicines.},

Hence, their presence can have significant impacts on the properties of devices. Although it is well accepted that the properties of defects are determined by their unique atomic environments, the precise knowledge of such relationships is far from clear for most oxides because of the complexity of defects and difficulties in characterization. Here, we fabricate a 36.8° SrRuO 3 grain boundary of which the transport measurements show a spin-valve magnetoresistance. We identify its atomic arrangement, including oxygen, using scanning transmission electron microscopy and spectroscopy. Based on the as-obtained atomic structure, the density functional theory calculations suggest that the spin-valve magnetoresistance occurs because of dramatically reduced magnetic moments at the boundary. The ability to manipulate magnetic properties at the nanometer scale via defect control allows new strategies to design magnetic/electronic devices with low-dimensional magnetic order.},

  abstract     = {Mechanically exfoliated two-dimensional ferromagnetic materials (2D FMs) possess long-range ferromagnetic order and topologically nontrivial skyrmions in few layers. However, because of the dimensionality effect, such few-layer systems usually exhibit much lower Curie temperature ( T C ) compared to their bulk counterparts. It is therefore of great interest to explore effective approaches to enhance their T C , particularly in wafer-scale for practical applications. Here, we report an interfacial proximity-induced high- T C 2D FM Fe 3 GeTe 2 (FGT) via A-type antiferromagnetic material CrSb (CS) which strongly couples to FGT. A superlattice structure of (FGT/CS) n , where n stands for the period of FGT/CS heterostructure, has been successfully produced with sharp interfaces by molecular-beam epitaxy on 2-inch wafers. By performing elemental specific X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) measurements, we have unequivocally discovered that T C of 4-layer Fe 3 GeTe 2 can be significantly enhanced from 140 K to 230 K because of the interfacial ferromagnetic coupling. Meanwhile, an inverse proximity effect occurs in the FGT/CS interface, driving the interfacial antiferromagnetic CrSb into a ferrimagnetic state as evidenced by double-switching behavior in hysteresis loops and the XMCD spectra. Density functional theory calculations show that the Fe-Te/Cr-Sb interface is strongly FM coupled and doping of the spin-polarized electrons by the interfacial Cr layer gives rise to the T C enhancement of the Fe 3 GeTe 2 films, in accordance with our XMCD measurements. Strikingly, by introducing rich Fe in a 4-layer FGT/CS superlattice, T C can be further enhanced to near room temperature. Our results provide a feasible approach for enhancing the magnetic order of few-layer 2D FMs in wafer-scale and render opportunities for realizing realistic ultra-thin spintronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted considerable attention as atomically thin semiconductors for the ultimate transistor scaling. For practical applications in integrated electronics, large monolayer single crystals are essential for ensuring consistent electronic properties and high device yield. The TMDs available today are generally obtained by mechanical exfoliation or chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth, but are often of mixed layer thickness, limited single crystal domain size or have very slow growth rate. Scalable and rapid growth of large single crystals of monolayer TMDs requires maximization of lateral growth rate while completely suppressing the vertical growth, which represents a fundamental synthetic challenge and has motivated considerable efforts. Herein we report a modified CVD approach with controllable reverse flow for rapid growth of large domain single crystals of monolayer TMDs. With the use of reverse flow to precisely control the chemical vapor supply in the thermal CVD process, we can effectively prevent undesired nucleation before reaching optimum growth temperature and enable rapid nucleation and growth of monolayer TMD single crystals at a high temperature that is difficult to attain with use of a typical thermal CVD process. We show that monolayer single crystals of 450 μm lateral size can be prepared in 10 s, with the highest lateral growth rate up to 45 μm/s. Electronic characterization shows that the resulting monolayer WSe 2 material exhibits excellent electronic properties with carrier mobility up to 90 cm 2 V −1 s −1 , comparable to that of the best exfoliated monolayers. Our study provides a robust pathway for rapid growth of high-quality TMD single crystals.},

However, the poor heating conversion efficiency and lack of stimulus–response obstruct the clinical application of magnetofluid-mediated MHT. Here, we develop a ferrimagnetic polyethylene glycol-poly(2-hexoxy-2-oxo-1,3,2-dioxaphospholane) (mPEG- b -PHEP) copolymer micelle loaded with hydrophobic iron oxide nanocubes and emodin (denoted as EMM). Besides an enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) contrast ability ( r 2 = 271 mM −1 s −1 ) due to the high magnetization, the specific absorption rate (2518 W/g at 35 kA/m) and intrinsic loss power (6.5 nHm 2 /kg) of EMM are dozens of times higher than the clinically available iron oxide nanoagents (Feridex and Resovist), indicating the high heating conversion efficiency. Furthermore, this composite micelle with a flowable core exhibits a rapid response to magnetic hyperthermia, leading to an AMF-activated supersensitive drug release. With the high magnetic response, thermal sensitivity and magnetic targeting, this supersensitive ferrimagnetic nanocomposite realizes an above 70% tumor cell killing effect at an extremely low dosage (10 μg Fe/mL), and the tumors on mice are completely eliminated after the combined MHT–chemotherapy.},

We focus on the rise and fall of nucleus accumbens ablation for addiction in China. Subsequently, we review recent studies that have explored the efficacy and safety of deep-brain-stimulation treatment for addiction. We conclude that neurosurgical procedures, particularly deep-brain stimulation, have a potentially valuable role in the management of otherwise intractable addictive disorders. Larger well-controlled clinical trials, however, are needed to assess clinical efficacy and safety.

Here, we sequenced and assembled reference genomes for both swamp and river buffaloes and we re-sequenced 230 individuals (132 swamp buffaloes and 98 river buffaloes) sampled from across Asia and Europe. Beyond the many actionable insights that our study revealed about the domestication, basic physiology and breeding of buffalo, we made the striking discovery that the divergent domestication traits between swamp and river buffaloes can be explained with recent selections of genes on social behavior, digestion metabolism, strengths and milk production.},

  abstract     = {Central precocious puberty (CPP) refers to a human syndrome of early puberty initiation with characteristic increase in hypothalamic production and release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Previously, loss-of-function mutations in human MKRN3 , encoding a putative E3 ubiquitin ligase, were found to contribute to about 30% of cases of familial CPP. MKRN3 was thereby suggested to serve as a ‘brake’ of mammalian puberty onset, but the underlying mechanisms remain as yet unknown. Here, we report that genetic ablation of Mkrn3 did accelerate mouse puberty onset with increased production of hypothalamic GnRH1. MKRN3 interacts with and ubiquitinates MBD3, which epigenetically silences GNRH1 through disrupting the MBD3 binding to the GNRH1 promoter and recruitment of DNA demethylase TET2. Our findings have thus delineated a molecular mechanism through which the MKRN3–MBD3 axis controls the epigenetic switch in the onset of mammalian puberty.},

The cathodic acupuncture electrodes working under an applied voltage of ∼3 V (with minimal damage to the living body) undergo effective electrochemical reactions in the acidic tumor area that produce sufficient H 2 locally to cause cancer cells to burst and die. Due to puncture positioning, the acidic tumor microenvironment and gas diffusion effect, the developed H 2 generation electrochemotherapy (H 2 -ECT) strategy enables precise and large-scale tumor therapy, as demonstrated by in vivo treatment of diseased mice (glioma and breast cancers). Such green H 2 -ECT is simple, highly efficient and minimally invasive, requiring no expensive medical equipment or nano materials and medication, and is therefore very promising for potential clinical applications.},

Most remarkably, its strong oxidation ability also enables the simultaneous degradation and complete mineralization for phenol, and its excellent performance is about 23.0 and 2.9 times higher than CdS and P25-TiO 2 , respectively. Its high activity is ascribed to the giant internal electric field induced by its large crystal dipole, which accelerates the rapid separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Briefly, the discovery of wide-spectrum bismuth chromate and the mechanism of exponentially enhanced photocatalytic performance by increasing the crystal dipole throw light on improving solar energy conversion.},

We found that, by rapidly extracting solvent and assembling monodispersed nanoparticles in droplets, it could form stomatocyte colloidal crystal clusters, which not only showed striking structural colors and characteristic reflection peaks due to their ordered nanoparticles arrangement, but also provided effective cavities for the integration of functional elements. Thus, the micromotors with catalysts or magnetic elements in their cavities, as well as with the corresponding structural color coding, could be achieved by using the platinum and ferric oxide dispersed pre-gel to fill and duplicate the stomatocyte colloidal crystal clusters. We have demonstrated that the self-movement of these structural color-barcode micromotors could efficiently accelerate the mixing speed of the detection sample and greatly increase the probe–target interactions towards faster and more sensitive single or multiplex detection, and the magnetism of these barcode micromotors enables the flexible collection of the micromotors, which could facilitate the detection processes.

Here, we demonstrate a bilayer platform with near-infrared-triggered transformable topographies, which can alter the geometries and functions of human ECs by tunable topographical cues in a remote-controlled manner, yet cause no damage to the cell viability. The migration and the adhesion/spreading of human ECs are respectively promoted by the temporary anisotropic and permanent isotropic topographies of the platform in turn, which appropriately meet the requirements of stage-specific EC manipulation for endothelialization. In addition to the potential of promoting the development of a new generation of vascular grafts/stents enabling rapid endothelialization, this stage-specific cell-manipulation platform also holds promise in various biomedical fields, since the needs for stepwise control over different cell functions are common in wound healing and various tissue-regeneration processes.},

Here we introduce algorithm-improved confocal Raman microscopy (ai-CRM), which increases the Raman scanning rate by one to two orders of magnitude with respect to state-of-the-art works for a variety of 2D materials. Meanwhile, GO can be imaged at a laser dose that is two to three orders of magnitude lower than previously reported, such that laser-induced variations of the material properties can be avoided. ai-CRM also enables fast and spatially resolved quantitative analysis, and is readily extended to 3D mapping of composite materials. Since ai-CRM is based on general mathematical principles, it is cost-effective, facile to implement and universally applicable to other hyperspectral imaging methods.},

The ZIF@HMCS-25% hybrid material obtained exhibits a highly efficient oxygen reduction reaction activity with 0.823 V ( vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) half-wave potential and an even higher kinetic current density ( J K = 13.8 mA cm −2 ) than commercial Pt/C. ZIF@HMCS-25% also displays excellent oxygen evolution reaction performance and the overpotential of ZIF@HMCS-25% at 10 mA cm −2 is 407 mV. In addition, ZIF@HMCS-25% is further employed as an air electrode for a rechargeable Zn–air battery, exhibiting a high power density (120.2 mW cm −2 at 171.4 mA cm −2 ) and long-term charge/discharge stability (80 h at 5 mA cm −2 ).

In this work, we designed and synthesized CuO catalysts with atomically dispersed co-promoters of Sn and Zn. When used as the catalyst in the Rochow reaction for the synthesis of dimethyldichlorosilane, this catalyst exhibited much-enhanced activity, selectivity and stability compared with the conventional CuO catalysts with promoters in the form of nanoparticles. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that single-atomic Sn substitution in the CuO surface can enrich surface Cu vacancies and promote dispersion of Zn to its atomic levels. Sn and Zn single sites as the co-promoters cooperatively generate electronic interaction with the CuO support, which further facilitates the adsorption of the reactant molecules on the surface, thereby leading to the superior catalytic performance.},

The layered material TaIrTe 4 is a newly predicted time-reversal invariant type II Weyl semimetal with the minimum number of Weyl points. Here, we report the discovery of surface superconductivity in Weyl semimetal TaIrTe 4 . Our scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) visualizes Fermi arc surface states of TaIrTe 4 that are consistent with the previous angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy results. By a systematic study based on STS at ultralow temperature, we observe uniform superconducting gaps on the sample surface. The superconductivity is further confirmed by electrical transport measurements at ultralow temperature, with an onset transition temperature ( T c ) up to 1.54 K being observed. The normalized upper critical field h *( T/T c ) behavior and the stability of the superconductivity against the ferromagnet indicate that the discovered superconductivity is unconventional with the p -wave pairing. The systematic STS, and thickness- and angular-dependent transport measurements reveal that the detected superconductivity is quasi-1D and occurs in the surface states. The discovery of the surface superconductivity in TaIrTe 4 provides a new novel platform to explore topological superconductivity and Majorana modes.},

We investigate these properties through the Jackiw-Rebbi zero-modes in quantum spin Hall insulators. Though charge fractionalization is not manifested, Jackiw-Rebbi zero-mode&#39;s zero-energy nature leads to a double-frequency Aharonov-Bohm effect, implying that it can be viewed as a special case of Majorana zero-mode without particle-hole symmetry. Such relation is strengthened for Jackiw-Rebbi zero-modes also exhibiting non-Abelian properties in the absence of superconductivity. Furthermore, in the condition that the degeneracy of Jackiw-Rebbi zero-modes is lifted, we demonstrate a novel non-Abelian braiding with continuously tunable fusion rule, which is a generalization of Majorana zero-modes’ braiding properties.},

  abstract     = {We propose a theory to characterize the information and information processing abilities of metasurfaces, and demonstrate the relation between the information of the metasurface and its radiation pattern in the far-field region. By incorporating a general aperture model with uncertainty relation in L 2 -space, we propose a theory to predict the upper bound of information contained in the radiation pattern of a metasurface, and reveal the theoretical upper limit of orthogonal radiation states. The proposed theory also provides guidance for inverse design of the metasurface with respect to given functionalities. Through investigation of the information of disordered-phase modulated metasurfaces, we find the information invariance (1−γ, where γ is Euler&#39;s constant) of chaotic radiation patterns. That is to say, the information of the disordered-phase modulated radiation patterns is always equal to 1− γ , regardless of variations in size, the number of elements and the phase pattern of metasurface. This value might be the lower bound of radiation-pattern information of the metasurface, which can provide a theoretical limit for information modulation applications, including computational imaging, stealth technologies and wireless communications.},

Thermal forcing over the TP interacts strongly with that over the Iranian Plateau, forming a coupled heating system that elevates the tropopause, generates a monsoonal meridional circulation over South Asia and creates conditions of large-scale ascent favorable for Asian summer monsoon development. TP heating leads to intensification and westward extension (northward movement) of the South Asian High (Atlantic Intertropical Convergence Zone), and exerts strong impacts on upstream climate variations from North Atlantic to West Asia. It also affects oceanic circulation and buoyancy fields via atmospheric stationary wave trains and air–sea interaction processes, contributing to formation of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. The TP thermal state and atmospheric–oceanic conditions are highly interactive and Asian summer monsoon variability is controlled synergistically by internal TP variability and external forcing factors.},

This article reviews major recent advances in research regarding troposphere–stratosphere transport from the region of the Tibetan Plateau. Since the discovery of the total ozone valley over the Tibetan Plateau in summer from satellite observations in the early 1990s, new satellite-borne instruments have become operational and have provided significant new information on atmospheric composition. In addition, in situ measurements and model simulations are used to investigate deep convection and the ASM anticyclone, surface sources and pathways, atmospheric chemical transformations and the impact on global climate. Also challenges are discussed for further understanding critical questions on microphysics and microchemistry in clouds during the pathway to the global stratosphere over the Tibetan Plateau.},

  abstract     = {Correct understanding of the land-surface processes and cloud-precipitation processes in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) is an important prerequisite for the study and forecast of the downstream activities of weather systems and one of the key points for understanding the global atmospheric movement. In order to show the achievements that have been made, this paper reviews the progress on the observations for the atmospheric boundary layer, land-surface heat fluxes, cloud-precipitation distributions and vertical structures by using ground- and space-based multiplatform, multisensor instruments and the effect of the cloud system in the TP on the downstream weather. The results show that the form drag related to the topography, land–atmosphere momentum and scalar fluxes is an important part of the parameterization process. The sensible heat flux decreased especially in the central and northern TP caused by the decrease in wind speeds and the differences in the ground-air temperatures. Observations show that the cloud and precipitation over the TP have a strong diurnal variation. Studies also show the compressed-air column in the troposphere by the higher-altitude terrain of the TP makes particles inside clouds vary at a shorter distance in the vertical direction than those in the non-plateau area so that precipitation intensity over the TP is usually small with short duration, and the vertical structure of the convective precipitation over the TP is obviously different from that in other regions. In addition, the influence of the TP on severe weather downstream is preliminarily understood from the mechanism. It is necessary to use model simulations and observation techniques to reveal the difference between cloud precipitation in the TP and non-plateau areas in order to understand the cloud microphysical parameters over the TP and the processes of the land boundary layer affecting cloud, precipitation and weather in the downstream regions.},

Both invasive and non-invasive BCI try to connect human brains to machines. In the past several decades, BCI technology has continued to develop, making science fiction into reality and laboratory inventions into indispensable gadgets. In July 2019, Neuralink, a company founded by Elon Musk, proposed a sewing machine-like device that can dig holes in the skull and implant 3072 electrodes onto the cortex, promising more accurate reading of what you are thinking, although many serious scientists consider the claim misleading to the public . Recently, National Science Review (NSR) interviewed Professor Bin He, the department head of Biomedical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, and a leading scientist in the non-invasive-BCI field. His team developed new methods for non-invasive BCI to control drones by thoughts. In 2019, Bin’s team demonstrated the control of a robotic arm to follow a continuously randomly moving target on the screen.

Although our knowledge of the physiological mechanisms of magnetoreception has increased substantially over recent decades, the origin of this behavior remains a fundamental question in evolutionary biology. Despite this, there is growing evidence that magnetic iron mineral biosynthesis by prokaryotes may represent the earliest form of biogenic magnetic sensors on Earth. Here, we integrate new data from microbiology, geology and nanotechnology, and propose that initial biomineralization of intracellular iron nanoparticles in early life evolved as a mechanism for mitigating the toxicity of reactive oxygen species (ROS), as ultraviolet radiation and free-iron-generated ROS would have been a major environmental challenge for life on early Earth. This iron-based system could have later been co-opted as a magnetic sensor for magnetoreception in microorganisms, suggesting an origin of microbial magnetoreception as the result of the evolutionary process of exaptation.},

Here, we describe the first soft parts associated with the feeding apparatus of an orthothecid hyolith, Triplicatella opimus from the Chengjiang biota of South China. The tuft-like arrangement of the tentacles of T. opimus differs from that of hyolithids, suggesting they collected food directly from the substrate. A reassessment of the feeding organ in hyolithids indicates that it does not represent a lophophore and our analysis of the apical structures associated with some orthothecids show that these represent crushed portions of the shell and are not comparable to the brachiopod pedicle. The new information suggests that hyoliths are more likely to be basal members of the lophotrochozoans rather than lophophorates closely linked with the Phylum Brachiopoda.},

  abstract     = {Croplands are the single largest anthropogenic source of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) globally, yet their estimates remain difficult to verify when using Tier 1 and 3 methods of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Here, we re-evaluate global cropland-N 2 O emissions in 1961–2014, using N-rate-dependent emission factors (EFs) upscaled from 1206 field observations in 180 global distributed sites and high-resolution N inputs disaggregated from sub-national surveys covering 15593 administrative units. Our results confirm IPCC Tier 1 default EFs for upland crops in 1990–2014, but give a ∼15% lower EF in 1961–1989 and a ∼67% larger EF for paddy rice over the full period. Associated emissions (0.82 ± 0.34 Tg N yr –1 ) are probably one-quarter lower than IPCC Tier 1 global inventories but close to Tier 3 estimates. The use of survey-based gridded N-input data contributes 58% of this emission reduction, the rest being explained by the use of observation-based non-linear EFs. We conclude that upscaling N 2 O emissions from site-level observations to global croplands provides a new benchmark for constraining IPCC Tier 1 and 3 methods. The detailed spatial distribution of emission data is expected to inform advancement towards more realistic and effective mitigation pathways.},

  abstract     = {In the past three decades, China has built more than 87 000 dams with a storage capacity of ≈6560 km 3 and the total surface area of inland water has increased by 6672 km 2 . Leaching of N from fertilized soils to rivers is the main source of N pollution in China, but the exposure of a growing inland water area to direct atmospheric N deposition and N leaching caused by N deposition on the terrestrial ecosystem, together with increased N deposition and decreased N flow, also tends to raise N concentrations in most inland waters. The contribution of this previously ignored source of  N deposition to freshwaters is estimated in this study, as well as mitigation strategies. The results show that the annual amounts of N depositions ranged from 4.9 to 16.6 kg · ha −1 · yr −1 in the 1990s to exceeding 20 kg · ha −1 · yr −1 in the 2010s over most of regions in China, so the total mass of ΔN (the net contribution of N deposition to the increase in N concentration) for lakes, rivers and reservoirs change from 122.26 Gg N · yr −1 in the 1990s to 237.75 Gg N · yr −1 in the 2010s. It is suggested that reducing the N deposition from various sources, shortening the water-retention time in dams and decreasing the degree of regulation for rivers are three main measures for preventing a continuous increase in the N-deposition pollution to inland water in China.},

A central challenge in the manufacturing sector lies in the requirement of a general framework to ensure satisfied diagnosis and monitoring performances in different manufacturing applications. Here, we propose a general data-driven, end-to-end framework for the monitoring of manufacturing systems. This framework, derived from deep-learning techniques, evaluates fused sensory measurements to detect and even predict faults and wearing conditions. This work exploits the predictive power of deep learning to automatically extract hidden degradation features from noisy, time-course data. We have experimented the proposed framework on 10 representative data sets drawn from a wide variety of manufacturing applications. Results reveal that the framework performs well in examined benchmark applications and can be applied in diverse contexts, indicating its potential use as a critical cornerstone in smart manufacturing.},

  abstract     = {The discovery of ProtoRAG in amphioxus indicated that vertebrate RAG recombinases originated from an ancient transposon. However, the sequences of ProtoRAG terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) were obviously dissimilar to the consensus sequence of mouse 12/23RSS and recombination mediated by ProtoRAG or RAG made them incompatible with each other. Thus, it is difficult to determine whether or how 12/23RSS persisted in the vertebrate RAG system that evolved from the TIRs of ancient RAG transposons. Here, we found that the activity of ProtoRAG is highly dependent on its asymmetric 5′TIR and 3′TIR, which are composed of conserved TR1 and TR5 elements and a partially conserved TRsp element of 27/31 bp to separate them. Similar to the requirements for the recombination signal sequences (RSSs) of RAG recombinase, the first CAC in TR1, the three dinucleotides in TR5 and the specific length of the partially conserved TRsp are important for the efficient recombination activity of ProtoRAG . In addition, the homologous sequences flanking the signal sequences facilitate ProtoRAG- but not RAG-mediated recombination. In addition to the diverged TIRs, two differentiated functional domains in BbRAG1L were defined to coordinate with the divergence between TIRs and RSSs. One of these is the CTT* domain, which facilitates the specific TIR recognition of the BbRAGL complex, and the other is NBD*, which is responsible for DNA binding and the protein stabilization of the BbRAGL complex. Thus, our findings reveal that the functional requirement for ProtoRAG TIRs is similar to that for RSS in RAG-mediated recombination, which not only supports the common origin of ProtoRAG TIRs and RSSs from the asymmetric TIRs of ancient RAG transposons, but also reveals the development of RAG and RAG-like machineries during chordate evolution.},

  abstract     = {Structural variants (SVs) may play important roles in human adaptation to extreme environments such as high altitude but have been under-investigated. Here, combining long-read sequencing with multiple scaffolding techniques, we assembled a high-quality Tibetan genome (ZF1), with a contig N50 length of 24.57 mega-base pairs (Mb) and a scaffold N50 length of 58.80 Mb. The ZF1 assembly filled 80 remaining N-gaps (0.25 Mb in total length) in the reference human genome (GRCh38). Markedly, we detected 17 900 SVs, among which the ZF1-specific SVs are enriched in GTPase activity that is required for activation of the hypoxic pathway. Further population analysis uncovered a 163-bp intronic deletion in the MKL1 gene showing large divergence between highland Tibetans and lowland Han Chinese. This deletion is significantly associated with lower systolic pulmonary arterial pressure, one of the key adaptive physiological traits in Tibetans. Moreover, with the use of the high-quality de novo assembly, we observed a much higher rate of genome-wide archaic hominid (Altai Neanderthal and Denisovan) shared non-reference sequences in ZF1 (1.32%–1.53%) compared to other East Asian genomes (0.70%–0.98%), reflecting a unique genomic composition of Tibetans. One such archaic hominid shared sequence—a 662-bp intronic insertion in the SCUBE2 gene—is enriched and associated with better lung function (the FEV1/FVC ratio) in Tibetans. Collectively, we generated the first high-resolution Tibetan reference genome, and the identified SVs may serve as valuable resources for future evolutionary and medical studies.},

Unfortunately, all the reported Cretaceous termites are individually preserved, which does not cover the behaviours of the cooperative brood care and multiple generations of adults in the nests of the Cretaceous termites. Herein, we report three eusocial aggregations from colonies of the oldest known Stolotermitidae, Cosmotermes gen. nov. , in 100 Ma mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber. One large aggregation, comprising 8 soldiers, 56 workers/pseudergates and 25 immatures of different instars, additionally presents the behaviours of cooperative brood care and overlapping generations.

The simultaneous coexistence of robust magnetism/ferroelectricity and strong magnetoelectric coupling in single multiferroics is hitherto unreported, which may also be attributed to their potential conflictions. In this paper, we show the first-principles evidence of such desired coexistence in ultrathin-layer CuCrS 2 and CuCrSe 2 . The vertical ferroelectricity is neither induced by an empty d shell nor spin-driven, giving rise to an alternative possibility of resolving those intrinsic exclusions and contradictions. Compared with their bulk phases, the ferromagnetism in the thin-layer structures (two–six layers) can be greatly stabilized due to the enhanced carrier density and orbital shifting by vertical polarization, and the Curie temperatures of both ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity can be above room temperature. Moreover, a considerable net magnetization can be reversed upon ferroelectric switching, where the change in spin-resolved band structure also renders efficient ‘magnetic reading + electrical writing’. The thickness-different layers may even exhibit diversified types of magnetoelectric coupling, which both enriches the physics of multiferroics and facilitates their practical applications.},

The liquid metal penetration effects are demonstrated in various porous materials such as tissue paper, thick and fine sponges, fabrics, and meshes. The underlying mechanism is that the high surface tension of liquid metal can be significantly reduced to near-zero due to the voltage-induced oxidation of the liquid metal surface in a solution. It is the extremely low surface tension and gravity that cause the liquid metal to superwet the solid surface, leading to the penetration phenomena. These findings offer new opportunities for novel microfluidic applications and could promote further discovery of more exotic fluid states of liquid metals.},

This study provides new insight into these topics. A new KNN-based lead-free ceramic material is presented, which features a large piezoelectric coefficient ( d 33 ) exceeding 500 pC/N and a high Curie temperature ( T c ) of  ∼200°C. The superior piezoelectric response strongly relies on the increased composition-induced structural flexibility due to lattice softening and decreased unit cell distortion. In contrast to piezoelectricity anomalies induced via polymorphic transition, this piezoelectricity enhancement is effective within a broad temperature range rather than a specific small range. In particular, a hierarchical domain architecture composed of nano-sized domains along the submicron domains was detected in this material system, which further contributes to the high piezoelectricity.},

Currently, only graphene and graphene oxide can be produced on a ton scale, and the inability to produce other 2D materials on such a large scale hinders their technological applications. Here we report a grinding exfoliation method that uses micro-particles as force intermediates to resolve applied compressive forces into a multitude of small shear forces, inducing the highly efficient exfoliation of layer materials. The method, referred to as intermediate-assisted grinding exfoliation (iMAGE), can be used for the large-scale production of many 2D materials. As an example, we have exfoliated bulk h-BN into 2D h-BN with large flake sizes, high quality and structural integrity, with a high exfoliation yield of 67%, a high production rate of 0.3 g h −1 and a low energy consumption of 3.01 × 10 6 J g −1 . The production rate and energy consumption are one to two orders of magnitude better than previous results. Besides h-BN, this iMAGE technology has been used to exfoliate various layer materials such as graphite, black phosphorus, transition metal dichalcogenides, and metal oxides, proving its universality. Molybdenite concentrate, a natural low-cost and abundant mineral, was used as a demo for the large-scale exfoliation production of 2D MoS 2 flakes. Our work indicates the huge potential of the iMAGE method to produce large amounts of various 2D materials, which paves the way for their commercial application.},

  abstract     = {Lithium–sulfur batteries have great potential for high-performance energy-storage devices, yet the severe diffusion of soluble polysulfide to electrolyte greatly limits their practical applications. To address the above issues, herein we design and synthesize a novel polymer binder with single lithium-ion channels allowing fast lithium-ion transport while blocking the shuttle of unnecessary polysulfide anions. In situ UV–vis spectroscopy measurements reveal that the prepared polymer binder has effective immobilization to polysulfide intermediates. As expected, the resultant sulfur cathode achieves an excellent specific capacity of 1310 mAh g −1 at 0.2 C, high Coulombic efficiency of 99.5% at 0.5 C after 100 cycles and stable cycling performance for 300 cycles at 1 C (1 C = 1675 mA g −1 ). This study reports a new avenue to assemble a polymer binder with a single lithium-ion channel for solving the serious problem of energy attenuation of lithium–sulfur batteries.},

  abstract     = {Transfer printing, as an important assembly technique, has attracted much attention due to its valuable merits to develop novel forms of electronics such as stretchable inorganic electronics requiring the heterogeneous integration of inorganic materials with soft elastomers. Here, we report on a laser-driven programmable non-contact transfer printing technique via a simple yet robust design of active elastomeric microstructured stamp that features cavities filled with air and embedded under the contacting surface, a micro-patterned surface membrane that encapsulates the air cavities and a metal layer on the inner-cavity surfaces serving as the laser-absorbing layer. The micro-patterned surface membrane can be inflated dynamically to control the interfacial adhesion, which can be switched from strong state to weak state by more than three orders of magnitude by local laser heating of the air in the cavity with a temperature increase below 100°C. Theoretical and experimental studies reveal the fundamental aspects of the design and fabrication of the active elastomeric microstructured stamp and the operation of non-contact transfer printing. Demonstrations in the programmable transfer printing of micro-scale silicon platelets and micro-scale LED chips onto various challenging receivers illustrate the extraordinary capabilities for deterministic assembly that are difficult to address by existing printing schemes, thereby creating engineering opportunities in areas requiring the heterogeneous integration of diverse materials such as curvilinear electronics and MicroLED displays.},

  abstract     = {Azoxy-, azo- and amino-aromatics are among the most widely used building blocks in materials science pharmaceuticals and synthetic chemistry, but their controllable and green synthesis has not yet been well established. Herein, a facile potential-tuned electrosynthesis of azoxy-, azo- and amino-aromatics via aqueous selective reduction of nitroarene feedstocks over a CoP nanosheet cathode is developed. A series of azoxy-, azo- and amino-compounds with excellent selectivity, good functional group tolerance and high yields are produced by applying different bias input. The synthetically significant and challenging asymmetric azoxy-aromatics can be controllably synthesized in moderate to good yields. The use of water as the hydrogen source makes this strategy remarkably fascinating and promising. In addition, deuterated aromatic amines with a high deuterium content can be readily obtained by using D 2 O. By pairing with anodic oxidation of aliphatic amines to nitriles, synthetically useful building blocks can be simultaneously produced in a CoP||Ni 2 P two-electrode electrolyzer. Only 1.25 V is required to achieve a current density of 20 mA cm −2 , which is much lower than that of overall water splitting (1.70 V). The paired oxidation and reduction reactions can also be driven using a 1.5 V battery to synthesize nitrile and azoxybenzene with good yields and selectivity, further emphasizing the flexibility and controllability of our method. This work paves the way for a promising approach to the green synthesis of valuable chemicals through potential-controlled electrosynthesis.},

Although domain walls provide a degree of freedom to regulate the physical properties at the nanoscale, the relatively lower controllability prevents their practical applications in nano-devices. In this work, with the advantages of 3D domain configuration detection based on piezoresponse force microscopy, we find that the mobility of three types of domain walls (tail-to-tail, head-to-tail, head-to-head) in (001) BiFeO 3 films varies with the applied electrical field. Under low voltages, head-to-tail domain walls are more mobile than other domain walls, while, under high voltages, tail-to-tail domain walls become rather active and possess relatively long average lengths. This is due to the high nucleation energy and relatively low growth energy for charged domain walls. Finally, we demonstrate the manipulation of domain walls through successive electric writings, resulting in well-aligned conduction paths as designed, paving the way for their application in advanced spintronic, memory and communication nano-devices.},

However, very little attention has been paid to the heat conduction in complex networks. In this work, we study (both thermal and electric) energy transport in physical networks rewired from 2D regular lattices. It is found that the network can be transferred from a good conductor to a poor conductor, depending on the rewired network structure and coupling scheme. Two interesting phenomena were discovered: (i) the thermal-siphon effect—namely the heat flux can go from a low-temperature node to a higher-temperature node and (ii) there exits an optimal network structure that displays small thermal conductance and large electrical conductance. These discoveries reveal that network-structured materials have great potential in applications in thermal-energy management and thermal-electric-energy conversion.},

The combination of digital technology with metamaterials provides a powerful scheme for spatial and temporal controls of electromagnetic waves. Such a technique, however, has thus far been limited to the control of free-space light. Its application to plasmonics to shape subwavelength fields still remains elusive. Here, we report the design and experimental realization of a tunable conformal plasmonic metasurface, which is capable of digitally coding and modulating designer surface plasmons at the deep-subwavelength scale. Based on dynamical switching between two discrete dispersion states in a controlled manner, we achieve digital modulations of both amplitude and phase of surface waves with nearly 100% modulation depth on a single device. Our study not only introduces a new approach for active dispersion engineering, but also constitutes an important step towards the realization of subwavelength integrated plasmonic circuits.},

In quantum mechanics, the geometry of quantum states is fully captured by the quantum geometric tensor. Using a qubit formed by an NV center in diamond, we perform the first experimental measurement of the complete quantum geometric tensor. Our approach builds on a strong connection between coherent Rabi oscillations upon parametric modulations and the quantum geometry of the underlying states. We then apply our method to a system of two interacting qubits, by exploiting the coupling between the NV center spin and a neighboring 13 C nuclear spin. Our results establish coherent dynamical responses as a versatile probe for quantum geometry, and they pave the way for the detection of novel topological phenomena in solid state.},

Drawing an analogy between electrons and photons, artificially designed optical lattices indicate the possibility of a similar band modulation effect in graphene systems. Yet due to the fermionic nature of electrons, modulated electronic systems promise far richer categories of behaviors than those found in optical lattices. Here, we uncovered a strong modulation of electronic states in bilayer graphene subject to periodic potentials. We observed for the first time the hybridization of electron and hole sub-bands, resulting in local band gaps at both primary and secondary charge neutrality points. Such hybridization leads to the formation of flat bands, enabling the study of correlated effects in graphene systems. This work may provide a novel way to manipulate electronic states in layered systems, which is important to both fundamental research and application.},

The anomalous Q and shear wave regions locating at the uppermost part of the lower mantle could be caused by the existence of fluid or wet magmas in this region because of the water-solubility contrast between the minerals in the transition zone and those in the lower mantle. δ-H solid solution AlO 2 H–MgSiO 4 H 2 carries water into the lower mantle. Hydrogen-bond symmetrization exists in high-pressure hydrous phases and thus they are stable at the high pressures of the lower mantle. Thus, the δ-H solid solution in subducting slabs carries water farther into the bottom of the lower mantle. Pyrite FeO 2 H x is formed due to a reaction between the core and hydrated slabs.

  abstract     = {In atmospheric and oceanic studies, it is important to investigate the uncertainty of model solutions. The conditional non-linear optimal perturbation (CNOP) method is useful for addressing the uncertainty. This paper reviews the development of the CNOP method and its computational aspects in recent years. Specifically, the CNOP method was first proposed to investigate the effects of the optimal initial perturbation on atmosphere and ocean model results. Then, it was extended to explore the influences of the optimal parameter perturbation, model tendency perturbation and boundary condition perturbation. To obtain solutions to these optimal perturbations, four kinds of optimization approaches were developed: the adjoint-based method, the adjoint-free method, the intelligent optimization method and the unconstrained optimization method. We illustrate the calculation process of each method and its advantages and disadvantages. Then, taking the Zebiak–Cane model as an example, we compare the CNOPs related to initial conditions (CNOP-Is) calculated by the above four methods. It was found that the dominant structures of the CNOP-Is for different methods are similar, although some differences in details exist. Finally, we discuss the necessity and possible direction for designing a more effective optimization approach related to the CNOP in the future.},

Despite the importance of vitality forms in social life, only recently have neurophysiological studies been devoted to this issue. The first part of this review describes fMRI experiments, showing that the dorso-central insula is activated during the execution, the perception and the imagination of arm actions endowed with different vitality forms as well as during the hearing and the production of speech conveying vitality forms. In the second part, we address the means by which the dorso-central insula modulates the networks for controlling action execution and how the sensory and interoceptive information is conveyed to this insular sector. Finally, we present behavioral data showing the importance of vitality forms in social interactions.},

With predictable structural compositions and controllable functionalities, the structures and properties of COFs could be controlled to achieve targeted materials. On the other hand, the predesigned structure of COFs allows fruitful postsynthetic modifications to introduce new properties and functions. In this review, the postsynthetic functionalizations of COFs are discussed and their impacts towards structural qualities and performances are comparatively elaborated on. The functionalization involves the formation of specific interactions (covalent or coordination/ionic bonds) and chemical reactions (oxidation/reduction reaction) with pendant groups, skeleton and reactive linkages of COFs. The chemical stability and performance of COFs including catalytic activity, storage, sorption and opto-electronic properties might be enhanced by specific postsynthetic functionalization. The generality of these strategies in terms of chemical reactions and the range of suitable COFs places them as a pivotal role for the development of COF-based smart materials.},

  abstract     = {The general availability of third generation synchrotron sources has ushered in a new era of high pressure research. The crystal structure of materials under compression can now be determined by X-ray diffraction using powder samples and, more recently, from multi-nano single crystal diffraction. Concurrently, these experimental advancements are accompanied by a rapid increase in computational capacity and capability, enabling the application of sophisticated quantum calculations to explore a variety of material properties. One of the early surprises is the finding that simple metallic elements do not conform to the general expectation of adopting 3D close-pack structures at high pressure. Instead, many novel open structures have been identified with no known analogues at ambient pressure. The occurrence of these structural types appears to be random with no rules governing their formation. The adoption of an open structure at high pressure suggested the presence of directional bonds. Therefore, a localized atomic hybrid orbital description of the chemical bonding may be appropriate. Here, the theoretical foundation and experimental evidence supporting this approach to the elucidation of the high pressure crystal structures of group I and II elements and polyhydrides are reviewed. It is desirable and advantageous to extend and apply established chemical principles to the study of the chemistry and chemical bonding of materials at high pressure.},

As one major terrestrial energy source, solar-wind energy flux into Earth&#39;s magnetosphere (E in ) exhibits dramatic interannual variation, the effect of which on Earth&#39;s climate, however, has not drawn much attention. Based on the E in estimated by 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we demonstrate a novelty that the annual mean E in can explain up to 25% total interannual variance of the northern-hemispheric temperature in the subsequent boreal winter. The concurrent anomalous atmospheric circulation resembles the positive phase of Arctic Oscillation/North Atlantic Oscillation. The warm anomalies in the tropic stratopause and tropopause induced by increased solar-wind–magnetosphere energy persist into the subsequent winter. Due to the dominant change in the polar vortex and mid-latitude westerly in boreal winter, a ‘top-down’ propagation of the stationary planetary wave emerges in the Northern Hemisphere and further influences the atmospheric circulation and climate.},

  abstract     = {Lakes have played a critical role in providing water and ecosystem services for people and other organisms in China for millennia. However, accelerating climate change and economic boom have resulted in unprecedented changes in these valuable lakes. Using Landsat images covering the entity of the country, we explored the changes in China’s lakes and the associated driving forces over the last 30 years (i.e. mid-1980s to 2015). We discovered that China’s lakes have changed with divergent regional trends: in the sparsely populated Tibetan Plateau, lakes are abundant and the lake area has increased dramatically from 38 596 to 46 831 km 2 (i.e. increased by 8235 km 2 , or 21.3%), whereas, in the densely populated northern and eastern regions, lakes are relatively scarce and the lake area has decreased from 36 659 to 33 657 km 2 (i.e. decreased by 3002 km 2 , or 8.2%). In particular, severe lake decreases occurred in the Mongolia-Xinjiang Plateau and the Eastern Plain (−2151 km 2 ). Statistical analyses indicated that climate was the most important factor controlling lake changes in the Tibetan Plateau, the Yun-Gui Plateau and the Northeast Plain. However, the strength of climatic control on lake changes was low in the Eastern Plain and the Mongolia-Xinjiang Plateau, where human activities, e.g. impoldering, irrigation and mining, have caused serious impacts on lakes. Further lake changes will exacerbate regional imbalances between lake resources and population distribution, and thus may increase the risk of water-resource crises in China.},

Previous studies of birds, animals and humans have focused on well-differentiated populations in later stages of phenotypic divergence. The adaptive processes during the initial phase of highland adaptation remain poorly understood. We studied a human commensal, the Eurasian Tree Sparrow, which has followed human agriculture to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Despite strong phenotypic differentiation at multiple levels, in particular in muscle-related phenotypes, highland and lowland populations show shallow genomic divergence and the colonization event occurred within the past few thousand years. In a one-month acclimation experiment investigating phenotypic plasticity, we exposed adult lowland tree sparrows to a hypoxic environment and did not observe muscle changes. Through population genetic analyses, we identified a signature of polygenic adaptation, whereby shifts in allele frequencies are spread across multiple loci, many of which are associated with muscle-related processes. Our results reveal a case of positive selection in which polygenic adaptation appears to drive rapid phenotypic evolution, shedding light on early stages of adaptive evolution to a novel environment.},

Overexpressing the miR396 targets OsGRF4 and OsGRF6 improves rice yield via increased grain size and panicle branching, respectively. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to assess the function of miR396 genes in rice. Knockout of MIR396ef ( MIR396e and MIR396f ), but not other isoforms, enhanced both grain size and panicle branching, resulting in increased grain yield. Importantly, under nitrogen-deficient conditions, mir396ef mutants showed an even higher relative increase in grain yield as well as elevated above-ground biomass. Furthermore, we identified OsGRF8 as a new target of miR396, in addition to the known targets OsGRF4 and OsGRF6 . Disruption of the miR396-targeting site in OsGRF8 was sufficient to both enlarge grain size and elongate panicles. Our results suggest that rice-seed and panicle development are regulated by miR396ef-GRF4/6/8-GIF1/2/3 modules and that miR396ef are promising targets of genome editing for breeding environmentally friendly rice varieties that require less nitrogen fertilization.},

Survival of splicing-corrected iPSC-derived motor neurons was rescued with SMN restoration. Furthermore, co-injection of Cas9 mRNA from Streptococcus pyogenes (SpCas9) or Cas9 from Staphylococcus aureus (SaCas9) alongside their corresponding sgRNAs targeting ISS-N1 into zygotes rescued 56% and 100% of severe SMA transgenic mice ( Smn −/− , SMN2 tg/− ).

  abstract     = {Complex oxides with tunable structures have many fascinating properties, though high-quality complex oxide epitaxy with precisely controlled composition is still out of reach. Here we have successfully developed solution-based single-crystalline epitaxy for multiferroic (1- x )BiTi (1- y )/2 Fe y Mg (1- y )/2 O 3 –( x )CaTiO 3 (BTFM–CTO) solid solution in large area, confirming its ferroelectricity at the atomic scale with strong spontaneous polarization. Careful compositional tuning leads to a bulk magnetization of 0.07 ± 0.035 μ B /Fe at room temperature, enabling magnetically induced polarization switching exhibiting a large magnetoelectric coefficient of 2.7–3.0 × 10 −7 s/m. This work demonstrates the great potential of solution processing in large-scale complex oxide epitaxy and establishes novel room-temperature magnetoelectric coupling in epitaxial BTFM–CTO film, making it possible to explore a much wider space of composition, phase, and structure that can be easily scaled up for industrial applications.},

  abstract     = {Bio-sourced nanocellulosic materials are promising candidates for spinning high-performance sustainable macrofibers for advanced applications. Various strategies have been pursued to gain nanocellulose-based macrofibers with improved strength. However, nearly all of them have been achieved at the expense of their elongation and toughness. Inspired by the widely existed hierarchical helical and nanocomposite structural features in biosynthesized fibers exhibiting exceptional combinations of strength and toughness, we report a design strategy to make nanocellulose-based macrofibers with similar characteristics. By combining a facile wet-spinning process with a subsequent multiple wet-twisting procedure, we successfully obtain biomimetic hierarchical helical nanocomposite macrofibers based on bacterial cellulose nanofibers, realizing impressive improvement in their tensile strength, elongation and toughness simultaneously. The achievement certifies the validity of the bioinspired hierarchical helical and nanocomposite structural design proposed here. This bioinspired design strategy provides a potential platform for further optimizing or creating many more strong and tough nanocomposite fiber materials for diverse applications.},

Herein the first printed planar prototype of aqueous-based, high-safety Zn//MnO 2 MBs, with outstanding performance, aesthetic diversity, flexibility and modularization, is demonstrated, based on interdigital patterns of Zn ink as anode and MnO 2 ink as cathode, with high-conducting graphene ink as a metal-free current collector, fabricated by an industrially scalable screen-printing technique. The planar separator-free Zn//MnO 2 MBs, tested in neutral aqueous electrolyte, deliver a high volumetric capacity of 19.3 mAh/cm 3 (corresponding to 393 mAh/g) at 7.5 mA/cm 3 , and notable volumetric energy density of 17.3 mWh/cm 3 , outperforming lithium thin-film batteries (≤10 mWh/cm 3 ). Furthermore, our Zn//MnO 2 MBs present long-term cyclability having a high capacity retention of 83.9% after 1300 cycles at 5 C, which is superior to stacked Zn//MnO 2 batteries previously reported. Also, Zn//MnO 2 planar MBs exhibit exceptional flexibility without observable capacity decay under serious deformation, and remarkably serial and parallel integration of constructing bipolar cells with high voltage and capacity output. Therefore, low-cost, environmentally benign Zn//MnO 2 MBs with in-plane geometry possess huge potential as high-energy, safe, scalable and flexible microscale power sources for direction integration with printed electronics.},

However, the highly selective generation of desirable hydrocarbon fuel, such as methane (CH 4 ), from CO 2 remains extremely challenging. Herein, we present two stable polyoxometalate-grafted metalloporphyrin coordination frameworks (POMCFs), which are constructed with reductive Zn-ϵ-Keggin clusters and photosensitive tetrakis(4-carboxylphenyl)porphyrin (H 2 TCPP) linkers, exhibiting high selectivity (&gt;96%) for CH 4 formation in a photocatalytic CO 2 -reduction system. To our knowledge, the high CH 4 selectivity of POMCFs has surpassed all of the reported coordination-framework-based heterogeneous photocatalysts for CO 2 -to-CH 4 conversion. Significantly, the introduction of a Zn-ϵ-keggin cluster with strong reducing ability is the important origin for POMCFs to obtain high photocatalytic selectivity for CH 4 formation, considering that eight Mo V atoms can theoretically donate eight electrons to fulfill the multielectron reduction process of CO 2 -to-CH 4 transformation.},

While various porous hosts, such as polymers, carbons, silica, metal oxides and zeolites, have been used in an attempt to heterogenize homogeneous catalysts, realizing the integration of both functions at the expense of discounting their respective advantages, it remains a significant challenge to truly combine their intrinsic strengths in a single catalyst without compromise. Here, we describe a general template-assisted approach to incorporating soluble molecular catalysts into the hollow porous capsule, which prevents their leaching due to the absence of large intergranular space. In the resultant yolk (soluble)–shell (crystalline) capsules, the soluble yolks can perform their intrinsic activity in a mimetic homogeneous environment, and the crystalline porous shells endow the former with selective permeability, substrate enrichment, size-selective and heterogeneous cascade catalysis, beyond the integration of the respective advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts.},

  abstract     = {Alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), consisting of Volmer and Heyrovsky/Tafel steps, requires extra energy for water dissociation, leading to more sluggish kinetics than acidic HER. Despite the advances in electrocatalysts, how to combine active sites to synergistically promote both steps and understand the underlying mechanism remain largely unexplored. Here, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations predict that NiO accelerates the Volmer step while metallic Ni facilitates the Heyrovsky/Tafel step. A facile strategy is thus developed to control Ni/NiO heterosurfaces in uniform and well-dispersed Ni-based nanocrystals, targeting both reaction steps synergistically. By systematically modulating the surface composition, we find that steering the elementary steps through tuning the Ni/NiO ratio can significantly enhance alkaline HER activity, and Ni/NiO nanocrystals with a Ni/NiO ratio of 23.7% deliver the best activity, outperforming other state-of-the-art analogues. The results suggest that integrating bicomponent active sites for elementary steps is effective for promoting alkaline HER, but they have to be balanced.},

We report the discovery of bulk superconductivity at 5.25 K in chromium nitride in Pr 3 Cr 10-x N 11 with a cubic lattice structure. A relatively large upper critical field of H c2 (0) ∼ 12.6 T is determined, which is larger than the estimated Pauli-paramagnetic pair-breaking magnetic field. The material has a large electronic specific-heat coefficient of 170 mJ K −2 mol −1 —about 10 times larger than that estimated by the electronic structure calculation, which suggests that correlations between 3d electrons are very strong in Pr 3 Cr 10-x N 11 , and thus quantum fluctuations might be involved. Electronic structure calculations show that the density of states at the Fermi energy are contributed predominantly by Cr 3d electrons, implying that the superconductivity results mainly from the condensation of Cr 3d electrons. Pr 3 Cr 10-x N 11 represents a rare example of possible unconventional superconductivity emerging in a 3D system with strong electron correlations. Nevertheless, clarification of the specific pairing symmetry needs more investigation.},

  abstract     = {When quasiparticles move in condensed matters, the texture of their internal quantum structure as a function of position and momentum can give rise to Berry phases that have profound effects on the material’s properties. Seminal examples include the anomalous Hall and spin Hall effects from the momentum-space Berry phases in homogeneous crystals. Here, we explore a conjugate form of the electron Berry phase arising from the moiré pattern: the texture of atomic configurations in real space. In homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides, we show that the real-space Berry phase from moiré patterns manifests as a periodic magnetic field with magnitudes of up to hundreds of Tesla. This quantity distinguishes moiré patterns from different origins, which can have an identical potential landscape, but opposite quantized magnetic flux per supercell. For low-energy carriers, the homobilayer moirés realize topological flux lattices for the quantum-spin Hall effect. An interlayer bias can continuously tune the spatial profile of the moiré magnetic field, whereas the flux per supercell is a topological quantity that can only have a quantized jump observable at a moderate bias. We also reveal the important role of the non-Abelian Berry phase in shaping the energy landscape in small moiré patterns. Our work points to new possibilities to access ultra-high magnetic fields that can be tailored to the nanoscale by electrical and mechanical controls.},
