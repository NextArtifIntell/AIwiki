  abstract     = {The number of elderly is increasing in recent years. According to the United Nations (UN), in 2050 there will be 2.1 billion people above 60 years of age worldwide. In addition, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that more than 1 billion people live with some form of disability, the leading causes of which are chronic diseases and accidents. Thus, many opportunities for the application of smart environments to support ubiquitous healthcare are emerging, the benefits of which may be reflected in reduced medical costs and increased convenience of patients and families. This systematic mapping study aims to identify how smart environments have been applied to support ubiquitous healthcare, what techniques and technologies are being used, and what research gaps are still left unexplored. Eight scientific repositories were used to search for papers in the area of ubiquitous healthcare, and a filtering process was used to remove bias. Of an initial sample of 1706 studies, 49 were reviewed entirely, analyzed, and categorized. Among these, we highlight those oriented to monitoring, detection, notification, and action on situations that may cause illnesses or promote the improvement of people’s health and wellness. Technologies to support ubiquitous healthcare were categorized into three groups: ambient sensors, wearables, and social robotics. These technologies have been applied most frequently to support the elderly and disabled. The diseases most commonly cited were dementia, diabetes, Alzheimer’s, autism, obesity, mental stress, sleep disorders, asthma, epilepsy and chronic diseases. We found only three papers that used prediction models. Finally, we observed a trend of using social robotics to improve the intelligence of ambient, aggregating mobility, and acting.},

Considering the cost, ease of implementation, this paper proposes a low cost yet efficient IoT system called FireNot for warning and alerting fire incidents. FireNot is a cloud based system that uses sensors (hardware) to detect fire and alert the user through internet and is maintained and monitored using a simple Android app. The FireNot system uses Raspberry Pi programmed through Python language and utilises Google API for location detection. The FireNot system is also intended to provide an expandable platform for additional daily monitoring tasks and more importunately, resiliency against most cyber-attacks and hi-jacking that targets IoT-based system lacked in most of similar IoT-based designs.

  abstract     = {CasAware is an Ambient Assisted Living platform, developed within an Italian research project, with the aim to improve the level of comfort and well-being of inhabitants of a house, while optimizing the energy consumption. A key feature, for successful realization of such a platform, is its capability to interoperate with other IoT platforms, which can augment CasAware with additional services. Indeed, this capability facilitates smooth communication between CasAware devices and external devices connected to other IoT platforms, thus allowing efficient exchange of messages among them. However, such integration is hindered by the heterogeneity of data models used in different platforms, which is also related to lack of common standards. In order to realize integration needed for CasAware, this paper presents an approach which exploits results of the INTER-IoT project. Specifically, the INTER-IoT methodology and a set of software tools for achieving IoT interoperability are applied. In the presented study, it is shown how the INTER-IoT based approach can facilitate interoperability between CasAware and two other platforms, which use completely different data models.},

  abstract     = {Air quality is a critical matter of concern in terms of the impact on public health and well-being. Although the consequences of poor air quality are more severe in developing countries, they also have a critical impact in developed countries. Healthcare costs due to air pollution reach $150 billion in the USA, whereas particulate matter causes 412,000 premature deaths in Europe, every year. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), indoor air pollutant levels can be up to 100 times higher in comparison to outdoor air quality. Indoor air quality (IAQ) is in the top five environmental risks to global health and well-being. The research community explored the scope of artificial intelligence (AI) in the past years to deal with this problem. The IAQ prediction systems contribute to smart environments where advanced sensing technologies can create healthy living conditions for building occupants. This paper reviews the applications and potential of AI for the prediction of IAQ to enhance building environment and public health. The results show that most of the studies analyzed incorporate neural networks-based models and the preferred evaluation metrics are RMSE, R 2 score and error rate. Furthermore, 66.6% of the studies include CO 2 sensors for IAQ assessment. Temperature and humidity parameters are also included in 90.47% and 85.71% of the proposed methods, respectively. This study also presents some limitations of the current research activities associated with the evaluation of the impact of different pollutants based on different geographical conditions and living environments. Moreover, the use of reliable and calibrated sensor networks for real-time data collection is also a significant challenge.},

Specifically, crop sustainability is directly related to reducing costs for farmers and minimizing environmental impact. In this paper, an application to help in the decision making about the most convenient type of crop to plant in a certain zone is developed, taking into account the climate conditions of that zone, in order to make a sustainable crop. This application is integrated within the Internet of Things system, which can be adapted and parameterized for any kind of crop and zone. The Internet of Things system components are described in detail and a fuzzy clustering model is proposed for the system’s intelligent module. This fuzzy model focuses on making a zone grouping (management zones), taking into account the zone climate conditions. The model manages fuzzy data, which allows us more extensive information and a more natural data treatment. A real study case of the proposed application is presented using data from the Region of Murcia (Spain). In this study case, the entire deployed Internet of Things system has been described, the fuzzy model to group similar areas in terms of meteorology has been validated and evaluated and the recommendation module has been implemented, taking into account the actual production data and the needed resources for the crops in the Region of Murcia (Spain).},

For the presented study the dataset of hyperspectral measurements of two varieties of tomatoes was used. Measurements were split into two groups: one inoculated with the Alternaria solani pathogen and the other one was treated as the reference. Measurements were taken by the spectroradiometer in consecutive measurement series. The main part of the study was the evaluation of the decision trees and the popular ensemble learning algorithms to select the most accurate one. After subsequent iterations of the training process and adjustment of hyperparameters, satisfactory accuracy results, equal to 0.987 for random forest, were obtained. This paper also covers the examination of the spectral range required for Alternaria solani identification. From several variants, the accuracy of models based on VIS and NIR spectral range was the closest to the accuracy obtained with the whole spectrum of measured absolute reflectance.},

  abstract     = {The presence of pollutants in the air has a direct impact on our health and causes detrimental changes to our environment. Air quality monitoring is therefore of paramount importance. The high cost of the acquisition and maintenance of accurate air quality stations implies that only a small number of these stations can be deployed in a country. To improve the spatial resolution of the air monitoring process, an interesting idea is to develop data-driven models to predict air quality based on readily available data. In this paper, we investigate the correlations between air pollutants concentrations and meteorological and road traffic data. Using machine learning, regression models are developed to predict pollutants concentration. Both linear and non-linear models are investigated in this paper. It is shown that non-linear models, namely Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Regression (SVR), better describe the impact of traffic flows and meteorology on the concentrations of pollutants in the atmosphere. It is also shown that more accurate prediction models can be obtained when including some pollutants’ concentration as predictors. This may be used to infer the concentrations of some pollutants using those of other pollutants, thereby reducing the number of air pollution sensors.},

  abstract     = {This manuscript presents a new approach to the use of Internet of Things technologies in a practical and significant way in the system of smart data loggers. The subject of research is the observation and control of the microclimate using Internet of Things technology and smart sensor nodes. It is known that working environments take into account the ambient parameters that influence the concentration at work so that efficiency is at the highest level. For this reason, the primary goal is to create an inexpensive smart system for storing data obtained by measuring different ambient parameters and controlling them without any human involvement. The proposed smart data logger system is based on the following steps: directly monitoring the environment, measuring and storing data, and then allowing the user to adjust the parameters and provide a more comfortable working environment. This research will present the design and implementation of the practical smart data logger system, which can be further expanded where such a realized system can form part of a smart faculty. The system is based on: a group of built-in sensors, a microcontroller with a peripheral interface (PIC) as a core and a server system and a wireless Internet using the Global System of Mobile Telecommunications (GSM) module with General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) as a communication protocol. There is also a smartphone application that allows the user to monitor and control the ambient parameters. It is possible to implement a smart faculty service, in which the realized smart data logger system could be implemented, which enables automatic control of ambient parameters at the faculty.},

  abstract     = {People spend their leisure time on cultural and historical stories by visiting exhibitions and museums with family members and friends. This small gathering establishes a voluntary platform to engage in activities and share experiential knowledge. Since members of a small group tend to have diverse preferences, both individual and group preferences should be considered for a cohesive and harmonious guide. This paper proposes a mixed-initiative tour path planning system for multiple visitors that builds a group path supported by automatic path generation and users’ participation. In the proposed system, individual user profiles are merged into a group profile by favoring multiple users’ higher preferences with low deviation. Then the system constructs a tour path based on mixed-initiative interaction that consists of the system’s automatic decision and participation of members. When group members have similar preferences, a tour path is automatically decided by the system. If group members have different and divergent preferences, the system asks group members to intervene and confirm appropriate places to collaboratively construct a tour path. To show feasibility of our proposed system, we evaluate our approach in twofold consists of a synthesized group simulation and a user study. For the simulation, we collected user preferences of 12 real users to simulate groups of two, three, and four members and explored characteristics of similar and different preference scenarios. For the user study, we conducted a comparative study with 11 participants under 4 different exhibition scenarios using the implemented mixed-initiative path planning system. Evaluation results support that our system constructs a cohesive, satisfying and usable path for a small group tour.},

This leads to variety of founding applications that identifies interesting patterns in the smartphone data to learn human behavior. In this paper, we propose an approach that enhances the productivity of individual’s by unobtrusively learning their routine through smartphones. We design and develop a non-intrusive smartphone app – Prodmapp that periodically collects sensing data from user’s smartphone. We extract several potentially useful behavioral features from the data and perform correlation analysis among the features and user’s productivity score (ground truth). We collect 15 days sensing data from 10 users through Prodmapp. Ground truth is collected from the users in the form of questionnaires to quantify their productivity. The results showed that there exists a significant correlation among several behavioral features and user’s productivity score. Finally, we train and evaluate a prediction model using significantly correlated features that can predict the change in productivity of users by analyzing the variation in feature values. We train three classifiers i.e., logistic regression, SVM and KNN to compare their performance on the two benchmark datasets, one collected through Prodmapp and other from CASAS smart home project. Results shows that our proposed approach performs well and all three classifiers achieve good prediction accuracy on both datasets.},

This significantly challenges current approaches that require substantial setup investment and cannot account for frequent, unpredictable changes in human behaviours, health conditions, and sensor deployments. The state-of-the-art methodology in studying human activity recognition is cultivated from short-term lab or testbed experimentation, i.e., relying on well-annotated sensor data and assuming no change in activity models. This paper propose a technique, EMILEA , to evolve an activity model over time with new types of activities. This technique novelly integrates two recent advances in continual learning: Net2Net – expanding the architecture of a model while transferring the knowledge from the previous model to the new model and Gradient Episodic Memory – controlling the update on the model parameters to maintain the performance on recognising previously learnt activities. This technique has been evaluated on two real-world, third-party, datasets and demonstrated promising results on enhancing the learning capacity to accommodate new activities that are incrementally introduced to the model while not compromising the accuracy on old activities.},

  abstract     = {We are moving towards ‘smart’ world in which industries, such as healthcare, smart cities, transportation, and agriculture have started using IoT (Internet of Things). These applications involve huge number of sensors and devices that generate high volume of real time data. To perform useful analytics on this data, location and spatial awareness characteristics of devices need to be considered. Wide range of location-based services and sensors in GIS have to manage moving objects that change their position with respect to time. These applications generate voluminous amount of real time geospatial data that demands an effective query processing mechanism to minimize the response time of a query. Indexing is one of the traditional ways to minimize the response time of a query by pruning the search space. In this paper, we performed a detailed survey of the literature regarding the indexing of real time geospatial data generated by IoT enabled devices. Some major challenges relevant to indexing of moving objects are highlighted. Various important index design considerations are also discussed. The goal is to help researchers in understanding the principles, methods, and challenges in the indexing of real time geospatial data. This will also aid in identifying the future research opportunities.},

Few previous attempts have been made to address this problem in the context of big data analytics in smart cities. These works propose the use of social network check-ins as a proxy for business popularity, concentrating however only on singular business types. Adding to the existing literature, we mine a large dataset of high temporal granularity check-in data for two medium-sized cities in Southern and Northern Europe, with the aim to predict the evolution of check-ins of new businesses of any type, from the moment that they appear in a social network. We propose and analyze the performance of three algorithms for the dynamic identification of suitable neighbouring businesses, whose data can be used to predict the evolution of a new business. Our SmartGrid algorithm reaches a performance of being able to accurately predict the evolution of 86% of new businesses. In this paper, extended from our original contribution at IEEE InteEnv’19, we further investigate the influence of neighbourhood venues in prediction accuracy, depending on their exhibited weekly data patterns.},

  abstract     = {Currently, smartwatches are mainly used as an extension of smartphones. However, equipped with various motion sensors, they are also effective devices for human activity recognition, particularly for those involving hand and arm movements. In this paper, we investigate the smoking recognition problem with motion sensors on smartwatches using supervised learning algorithms. For this purpose, we collected a dataset from 11 participants including ten different activities. The dataset includes different smoking variations in four different postures, such as smoking while standing, as well as similar activities, such as eating, and other activities, such as walking. Instead of approaching the problem as a binary classification problem, such as smoking and other, we are interested in differentiating smoking in different postures. Our aim is to explore the parameter space that may affect the recognition process on a large and complex dataset, considering 4 different window sizes and overlaps, 63 different features extracted from each sensor, 4 different sensors, 2 different sensor combinations, 3 classifiers and 10 different activities. Additionally, we analyze the impact of participants’ height on the recognition performance. The results show that, simple time-domain features and the combination of accelerometer and gyroscope sensors perform the best. When we consider the impact of height on the recognition performance, the results show that it does not have a significant effect when all activities are considered, however, it does have an effect on smoking while standing, particularly for participants with a significant height difference than others.},

This research focuses on addressing the challenges of location-dependence, intermittent network connectivity and irregular network traffic flows in unplanned areas for VANETs to host and operate non-safety-critical VANETs services. We assume unplanned areas as the one that lack communication infrastructure and planning. Such areas observe irregular vehicular traffic on the roads as well as on the networks.

  abstract     = {Formal modeling and analysis of human behavior can properly advance disciplines ranging from psychology to economics. The ability to perform such modeling has been limited by a lack of ecologically-valid data collected regarding human daily activity. We propose a formal model of indoor routine behavior based on data from automatically-sensed and recognized activities. A mechanistic description of behavior patterns for identical activity is offered to both investigate behavioral norms with 99 smart homes and compare these norms between subgroups. We identify and model the patterns of human behaviors based on inter-arrival times, the time interval between two successive activities, for selected activity classes in the smart home dataset with diverse participants. We also explore the inter-arrival times of sequence of activities in one smart home. To demonstrate the impact such analysis can have on other disciplines, we use this same smart home data to examine the relationship between the formal model and resident health status. Our study reveals that human indoor activities can be described by non-Poisson processes and that the corresponding distribution of activity inter-arrival times follows a Pareto distribution. We further discover that the combination of activities in certain subgroups can be described by multivariate Pareto distributions. These findings will help researchers understand indoor activity routine patterns and develop more sophisticated models of predicting routine behaviors and their timings. Eventually, the findings may also be used to automate diagnoses and design customized behavioral interventions by providing activity-anticipatory services that will benefit both caregivers and patients.},

And (2) In which ways, could design enable the older adults to tell their stories? We designed a tangible device named Slots-Story, and conducted a preliminary evaluation to refine it. In the field study, eight pairs of participants (each pair consisted of an elderly adult and his/her child) were recruited to use the prototype for around ten days. Semi-structured interviews were conducted before and after the implementation. In total 344 stories were collected. Thematic, structural, and interaction analyses were conducted with the stories. In the discussion, we conclude the paper with design considerations for promoting older adults’ storytelling with their children.},

  abstract     = {Smart homes equipped with ambient wireless sensor networks provide new opportunities to help older adults age-in-place, improve their quality of life and help better manage their health and wellness. In this paper, we present a methodology that estimates occupants’ status as active, sedentary, in-bed, out-of-home and unobservable, their location in the house, and their daily activities related to overall health and wellness. The methodology is used to visualize and examine the daily patterns and activities of older adults living in their own homes and participating in a smart home research project. The proposed location and status estimation algorithm is highly accurate as validated by a mobile app that prompts participants with questions about the estimated time of their daily activities. A case study involving a significant health-related life event is presented where the participant’s account of changes in her patterns and activities through bi-weekly interviews are shown to confirm inferences based on the results of the proposed methodology.},

  abstract     = {Diabetes is among the most common medical issues which people are facing nowadays. It may cause physical incapacity or even death in some cases. It has two core types, namely type I and type II. Both types are chronic and influence the functions of the human body that regulate blood sugar. In the human body, glucose is the main element that boosts cells. However, insulin is a key that enters the cells to control blood sugar. People with diabetes type I do not have the ability to produce insulin. Whereas people with diabetes type II lack the ability to react to insulin and frequently do not make enough insulin. For adequate analysis of such a fatal disease, techniques with a minimum error rate must be utilized. In this regard, different models of artificial neural network (ANN) have been investigated in the literature to diagnose/predict the condition with a minimum error rate, however, there is a need for improvement. To further advance the accuracy, a deep extreme learning machine (DELM) based prediction model is proposed and investigated in this research. By using the DELM approach, a high level of reliability with a minimum error rate is achieved. The approach shows significant improvement in results compared to previous investigations. It is observed that during the investigation the proposed approach has the highest accuracy rate of 92.8% with 70% of training (9500 samples) and 30% of test and validation (4500 examples). Simulation results validate the prediction effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

Based on these observations, our work aims to predict the actions a human is likely to perform next. Predictions can enable a robot to proactively assist humans by autonomously executing an action on their behalf. In this paper, Action Graphs are introduced to model the order constraints between actions. Action Graphs are derived from a problem defined in Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). When an action is observed, the node values are updated and next actions predicted. Subsequently, a robot executes one of the predicted actions if it does not impact the flow of the human by obstructing or delaying them. Our Action Graph approach is applied to a kitchen domain.},

  abstract     = {Smartwatches have become increasingly popular due to their ability to track human activities. The tracked information can be shared with other devices, such as smartphones, and used for scheduling, time management, and health management. Although several studies have focused on developing techniques for natural language text, users intention-to-recommend smartwatches have never been investigated. Consequently, the manufacturers, as well as potential buyers cannot get a holistic view of users’ perception of the smart device of their interest. Also, the non-availability of publicly available benchmark corpus has thwarted the development of intention mining techniques. Retrospectively, this study has proposed an approach for mining users’ intention to recommend smartwatches. In particular, we have employed an innovative approach, involving a screening processing and annotation guidelines, to develop the first-ever manually annotated corpus for mining intention-to-recommend smartwatches. Furthermore, we have performed experiments using two deep-learning techniques and five types of word embeddings to evaluate their effectiveness for intention mining. Finally, the recommendation sentences are synthesized to develop a deeper understanding of the user feedback on the selected products.},

A camera captures the consumption value in the water meter, and the yielded image undergoes image processing until the digits are detected and isolated. Then the digits are passed into an SVM machine-learning model that carries out a high accuracy OCR. The software is executed over an ARM platform running Linux. The data resultant from the automated metering, such as the device identification number, event date and time in UTC, consumption value, volume and time variations, flow, and display image, are locally stored and transmitted to a cloud server through VPN in a Wi-Fi and cellular network connection, or by SMS, enabling a remote supervision. Thereby, the automatic metering method features a new way to perform predictive analysis and management of water and meters proactively and can be replicated for digital-display water meters, as well as extended to handle automatic metering on electricity and gas meters as well.},

Precision agriculture is one of these fields where the use of decision-making technologies provides better production with better costs and a greater benefit for farmers. This paper develops an intelligent framework based on a deep learning model for early prediction of crop frost to help farmers activate anti-frost techniques to save the crop. This model is based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) model and it is designed to predict low temperatures. The model is based on information from an IoT infrastructure deployed on two plots in Murcia (Southeast of Spain). Three experiments are performed; a cross validation to validate the model from the most pessimistic point of view, a validation of 24 consecutive hours of temperatures, in order to know 24 hours before the possible temperature drop and a comparison with two traditional time series prediction techniques, namely Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average and the Gaussian process. The results obtained are satisfactory, being better the results of the LSTM, obtaining an average quadratic error of less than a Celsius degree and a determination coefficient R 2 greater than 0.95.},

  abstract     = {Dengue fever (DENF) is considered as the world’s fastest-growing vector-borne disease. Its timely and proper treatment possesses great significance, as it affects vital body organs and causes morbidity and mortality. In this paper, a dew-cloud assisted DENF-based cyber physical system (CPS) is proposed. This system diagnoses DENF, and monitors the effects of DENF infection on vital body organs. This system uses Linear Discriminant Analysis-Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (LDA-ANFIS) classification at the dew space to diagnose the DENF, and monitor the coronary heart disease (CHD) risk of the DENF infected users in real-time. Based on the real-time diagnosis and monitoring, the system immediately alerts the concerned stakeholders and provides timely medical support in case of any dengue-related emergency. The proposed CPS also assesses the Temporal Network Analysis (TNA)-based DENF outbreak risk, at the cloud space to control and prevent the outbreak of DENF by identifying the critical areas and individuals, which contributes in spreading DENF infection. The experimental evaluation of the proposed system acknowledges performance efficiency and utilization through various experimental and statistical approaches.},
