  abstract     = {Rare event detections are performed using spatial domain and frequency domain-based procedures. Omnipresent surveillance camera footages are increasing exponentially due course the time. Monitoring all the events manually is an insignificant and more time-consuming process. Therefore, an automated rare event detection contrivance is required to make this process manageable. In this work, a Context-Free Grammar (CFG) is developed for detecting rare events from a video stream and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is used to train CFG. A set of dedicated algorithms are used to perform frame split process, edge detection, background subtraction and convert the processed data into CFG. The developed CFG is converted into nodes and edges to form a graph. The graph is given to the input layer of an ANN to classify normal and rare event classes. Graph derived from CFG using input video stream is used to train ANN Further the performance of developed Artificial Neural Network Based Context-Free Grammar – Rare Event Detection (ACFG-RED) is compared with other existing techniques and performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, sensitivity, recall, average processing time and average processing power are used for performance estimation and analyzed. Better performance metrics values have been observed for the ANN-CFG model compared with other techniques. The developed model will provide a better solution in detecting rare events using video streams.},

The multilevel inverter topologies are offers better performance compare conventional two level inverter like reduced to tal harmonic distortion, less electromagnetic interferences and voltage stresses across switches are low. The ANN based SVPWM generates the switching pulses for cascaded H-bridge inverter; it improves the accuracy in reference vectors tuning and identification, which leads to improve the inverter output voltage, better utilization of dc-link voltage and controlled output current. The ANN control makes the implementation of SVPWM becomes simple and minimizes the intricacy in tracking reference vector and calculation of switching time; it is suitable for any type of non-linear systems. This proposed system is energized using PV system and it is boosted using dc-dc boost converter, and the output of CHBI is synchronized with grid connected system using coupled inductor.

  abstract     = {Vitiligo is a problem due to the destruction of melanocytes which is present in 1% of people all over the world. The origin of this disease is unknown and difficult to cure. Absence of melanin in the body causes lesions which will ooze out all over the body. Phototherapy and surgical therapy are th e two types of treatment available in the existing world. The Cytotoxic CD8 + T lymphocytes act as a major factor for the abovesaid disease. The main objective of this work is to treat patients with different methods according to the severity of vitiligo, which can be identified with the help of out ranking based on hesitant fuzzy relation. Multi-criteria and multi-objective hesitant fuzzy are applied in this work to find out the ranking through which the severity of the disease is detected. This method helps in identifying the vitiligo lesions, which can be treated effectively in a short period of time. During the application of vitiligo treatment, FQA-TOPSIS (Fuzzy Quantified Attribute-TOPSIS) hesitant fuzzy relation methodology is deployed with three decision maker’s support using linguistic and intuitionistic values. The decision maker’s fuzzy values will be normalized and aggregated in this work with improved methodologies. The two objectives are deployed with their own fuzzy values and are implemented in the decision maker’s values. In the article fuzzy weightage has been calculated in two ways. One is every linguistic like low, medium, high and very high has got its significant intuitionistic values that all will be available with the scale of 1 to 10. The same has given as triplets. In our research work the above said has applied with the objective based weightage. So the accuracy has been increased through the work. The outcome of this methodology is to find out the coefficient closeness of the alternatives and to out rank the decision alternatives. The difference between the Final +ve Ideal Solution (FPIS) and Final -ve Ideal Solution (FNIS) is determined and FQA-TOPSIS Hesitant Fuzzy is ranked in the result.},

Even with cutting edge technologies, which range from packaging robots to AI for fault detection, there is still some ambiguity on the aim s of some new systems, namely, whether they are automated or autonomous. In this paper, we indicate the distinctions between automated and autonomous systems as well as review the current literature and identify the core challenges for creating learning mechanisms of autonomous agents. We discuss using different types of extended realities, such as digital twins, how to train reinforcement learning agents to learn specific tasks through generalisation. Once generalisation is achieved, we discuss how these can be used to develop self-learning agents. We then introduce self-play scenarios and how they can be used to teach self-learning agents through a supportive environment that focuses on how the agents can adapt to different environments. We introduce an initial prototype of our ideas by solving a multi-armed bandit problem using two ε-greedy algorithms. Further, we discuss future applications in the industrial management realm and propose a modular architecture for improving the decision-making process via autonomous agents.},

As a wide range of medical data is available in electronic form and with easy access to Machine Learning(ML) techniques disease progression risk evaluation has been made easier. These ML tools can aid in giving us complex insights from the massive amounts of available data. Some of the techniques used for developing predictive models for perfect decision making in cancer research are Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Bayesian Networks (BNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and Decision Trees (DTs). Although it is acceptable that ML is used to predict cancer progression, we need some level of validation. In this paper, we have come up with a review of several ML methods in modelling cancer progression. We discuss several predictive models based on supervised ML techniques and the inputs given by users, along with the data available. The results that were obtained from Logistic Regression show us that this method gave a significantly higher accuracy than most other classifiers.

Many studies have shown that it is almost difficult to create an ideal solution but it seems feasible to provide a sub-optimal solution utilizing heuristic algorithms. In this paper, compared to previously used particle swarm optimization (PSO), heuristic approaches, and improved PSO algorithm for efficient task scheduling, we propose “Modified Filtering Algorithm” for task scheduling on cloud setting. Comparing all these three algorithms, we strive to build an optimum schedule to reduce the completion period of execution of activities.},

The conventional embedding methods deteriorate the perceptual quality of medical images making them unsuitable for proper diagnosis. To preserve the perceptual quality of medical images reversible embedding is used. The reversible embedding schemes, however, have less embedding capacity. In this work, a reversible scheme based on histogram bin shifting and RGB plane concatenation has been proposed which offers high embedding capacity as well. We have exploited the fact that medical images, unlike general images, consist of a large number of peaks and zero points that can be employed for reversibly embedding the data. Reversibility ensures that original image restoration takes place after the extraction of embedded data, which is of great importance in medical images for proper diagnosis and treatment. We have used various subjective and objective image quality metrics for analyzing the scheme. The proposed scheme has been shown to provide a Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) value of above 56 dB for an embedding capacity of 0.58 bits per pixel (bpp). The results obtained show that the performance of scheme presented is far better in comparison to the state-of-the-art.},

  abstract     = {Traceability and food quality are significant challenges in realizing a reliable food supply chain. The reliability of data in supply chains is one of the critical factors. Ensuring transparency, integrity, and availability is the primary requirement for establishing a proper supply chain network. Blockchain is a distributed structure of immutable records that are chained together to form blocks. It provides a guarantee of storing the data correctly and reliably. Smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts containing the terms of the agreement between the entities involved, provide utility for automation of reputation calculation with the transactions. Reputation systems allow participants to rate each other, thus building trust through reputation. The present reputation systems have bounded scrutiny and lack granularity; hence they are not ideal for supply chains. In this work, we propose a reliable supply chain framework using blockchain and smart contracts. It uses a consortium blockchain network to trace communication between the participants and to calculate reputation scores dynamically. Rewards and penalties are assigned to the participants of the supply chain network based on the food product quality involved in the trade. The network participants have defined roles and the access permissions govern who can access the ledger. An immutable ledger stores all the transactions occurring in the network. Any change in one block will reflect in the consecutive blocks, which ensures the data is reliable and secure. The proposed system is implemented using Hyperledger Composer. The proposed framework is evaluated in terms of throughput and latency for varying asset size and batch size using the benchmarking tool Caliper. Results show that the security and reliability provided by the proposed framework justify the overheads in contrast to a trading model that does not include a blockchain network.},

  abstract     = {A robust disruption prediction system is mandatory in a Tokamak control system as the disruption can cause malfunctioning of the plasma-facing components and impair irrecoverable structural damage to the vessel. To mitigate the disruption, in this article, a data-driven based disruption predictor i s developed using an ensemble technique. The ensemble algorithm classifies disruptive and non-disruptive discharges in the GOLEM Tokamak system. Ensemble classifiers combine the predictive capacity of several weak learners to produce a single predictive model and are utilized both in supervised and unsupervised learning. The resulting final model reduces the bias, minimizes variance and is unlikely to over-fit when compared to the individual model from a single algorithm. In this paper, popular ensemble techniques such as Bagging, Boosting, Voting, and Stacking are employed on the time-series Tokamak dataset, which consists of 117 normal and 70 disruptive shots. Stacking ensemble with REPTree (Reduced Error Pruning Tree) as a base learner and Multi-response Linear Regression as meta learner produced better results in comparison to other ensembles. A comparison with the widely employed stand-alone machine learning algorithms and ensemble algorithms are illustrated. The results show the excellent performance of the Stacking model with an F1 score of 0.973. The developed predictive model would be capable of warning the human operator with feedback about the feature(s) causing the disruption.},

Wireless multi-hop forwarding in VANETs is challenging since the data has to b e relayed as soon as possible through the intermediate vehicles from the source to destination. This paper proposes a modified fuzzy-based greedy routing protocol (MFGR) which is an enhanced version of fuzzy logic-based greedy routing protocol (FLGR). Our proposed protocol applies fuzzy logic for the selection of the next greedy forwarder to forward the data reliably towards the destination. Five parameters, namely distance, direction, speed, position, and trust have been used to evaluate the node’s stability using fuzzy logic. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MFGR scheme can achieve the best performance in terms of the highest packet delivery ratio (PDR) and minimizes the average number of hops among all protocols.},

A negotiation system is designed in this work to collect the different sets of provider services. With their desired quality metrics, a common Fuzzy based SLA report is generated and compared against the existing consumer requirements. From the analysis of the common agreement report, consumers can easily evaluate the best service with the desired Impact service, cost and Quality. The main advantage of this approach is that it reduces the time consumption of a consumer. Moreover, the best service provider can be selected among multiple providers with the desired QoS parameters. At the same time, the bilateral negotiation is enhanced with the approach of multilateral negotiation to improve the searching time of consumers.},

  abstract     = {Due to the wide acceptance of White Blood Cells (WBCs) in disease diagnosis, detection and classification of WBC are hot topic. Existing methodologies have some drawbacks such as significant degree of error, higher accuracy, time bound and higher misclassification rate. A WBCs detection and classif ication called, Jenks Optimized Logistic Convolutional Neural Network (JO-LCNN) method has proposed. Initally, Eulers Principal Axis is used as a convolution model to obtain a rotation invariant form of image by differentiating the background and RBCs, then eliminating them which leaves only the WBCs. By eliminating the wanton features, inherent features are detected contributing to minimum misclassification rate. According to above, Jenks Optimization function is used as a pooling model to obtain feature map for lower resolution. Therefore JO-LCNN is used for removing tiny objects in image and complete nuclei. Finally, Multinomial Logistic classifier is used to classify five types of classes by means of loss function and updating weight according to the loss function, therefore classifying with higher accuracy rate. Using LISC database for WBCs with different parameters as classification accuracy, false positive rate and time complexity are performed. Result shows that JO-LCNN, efficiently improves accuracy with less time, misclassification rate than the state-of-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Detection of densely interconnected nodes also called modules or communities in static or dynamic networks has become a key approach to comprehend the topology, functions and organizations of the networks. Over the years, numerous methods have been proposed to detect the accurate community structur e in the networks. State-of-the-art approaches only focus on finding non-overlapping and overlapping communities in a network. However, many networks are known to possess a hidden or embedded structure, where communities are recursively grouped into a hierarchical structure. Here, we reinvent such sub-communities within a community, which can be redefined based on nodes similarity. We term those derived communities as hidden or hierarchical communities. In this work, we present a method called Hidden Community based on Neighborhood Similarity Computation (HCNC) to uncover undetected groups of communities that embedded within a community. HCNC can detect hidden communities irrespective of density variation within the community. We define a new similarity measure based on the degree of a node and it’s adjacent nodes degree. We evaluate the efficiency of HCNC by comparing it with several well-known community detectors through various real-world and synthetic networks. Results show that HCNC has better performance in comparison to the candidate community detectors concerning various statistical measures. The most intriguing findings of HCNC is that it became the first research work to report the presence of hidden communities in Les Miserables, Karate and Polbooks networks.},

  abstract     = {Ensemble pruning has been widely used for enhancing classification ability employing a smaller number of classifiers. Ensemble pruning extracts a part of classifiers with good overall performance to form the final ensemble. Diversity and accuracy of classifiers are of vital importance for a success ful ensemble. It is hard for the members in one ensemble to achieve both good diversity and high accuracy, simultaneously, because there is a tradeoff between them. Existing works usually search for the tradeoff in terms of diversity measures, or find it utilizing heuristic algorithms, which cannot gain the exact solution without exhaustive search. To address the above issue, a novel ensemble pruning method based on information exchange glowworm swarm optimization and complementarity measure, abbreviated EPIECM, is proposed using the combination of information exchange glowworm swarm optimization (IEGSO) and complementarity measure (COM). Firstly, multiple generated classifiers are utilized to construct a pool of learners who perform diversely. Secondly, COM is employed to pre-prune the classifiers with poor comprehensive performance, and the pre-pruned ensemble is formed utilizing the retaining classifiers. Finally, the optimal subset of classifiers is combined from the remaining constituents after pre-pruning with IEGSO. Empirical results on 27 UCI datasets indicate that EPIECM significantly outperforms other techniques.},

  abstract     = {Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC)’s rapid technological advancements facilitate various computational-intensive applications on smart mobile devices. However, such applications are constrained by limited processing power, energy consumption, and storage capacity of smart mobile devices. To mitigate thes e issues, computational offloading is found to be the one of the promising techniques as it offloads the execution of computation-intensive applications to cloud resources. In addition, various kinds of cloud services and resourceful servers are available to offload computationally intensive tasks. However, their processing speeds, access delays, computation capability, residual memory and service charges are different which retards their usage, as it becomes time-consuming and ambiguous for making decisions. To address the aforementioned issues, this paper presents a Fuzzy Simplified Swarm Optimization based cloud Computational Offloading (FSSOCO) algorithm to achieve optimum multisite offloading. Fuzzy logic and simplified swarm optimization are employed for the identification of high powerful nodes and task decomposition respectively. The overall performance of FSSOCO is validated using the Specjvm benchmark suite and compared with the state-of-the-art offloading techniques in terms of the weighted total cost, energy consumption, and processing time.},

The considered mathematical model comprises of a diesel generating model, wind turbine generator and a battery storage system. Fuzzy is an intelligent controller which is designed with trial and error rules or on the basis of past experience provided by experts or by optimization methods for optimized gains using computational algorithms. To give best solution for these kinds of problems with FLCs traditional controllers are integrated with fuzzy logic. The PSO algorithm is applied to tune the classical controller gains to decrease the frequency deviation of the island power system, during the different load and wind disturbances. The Fuzzy PID classical controller shows the best performance compared with the only fuzzy and Fuzzy-PI controller configurations by illustrating the under shoot, overshoot and settling time and the proposed method is robust for various loading conditions and different wind changes.},

The parallel implementations of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) with many vari ants have been developed using MapReduce and Spark frameworks in the recent years. However, these approaches have severe limitations in terms of Input-Output (I/O) cost, memory, etc. From the literature, it is known that the complexity of ELM is directly propositional to the computation of Moore-Penrose pseudo inverse of hidden layer matrix in ELM. Most of the ELM variants developed on Spark framework have employed Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to compute the Moore-Penrose pseudo inverse. But, SVD has severe memory limitations when experimenting with large datasets. In this paper, a method that uses Recursive Block LU Decomposition to compute the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse over the Spark cluster has been proposed to reduce the computational complexity. This method enhances the ELM algorithm to be efficient in handling the scalability and also having faster execution of the model.

So, the problem addressed in this paper is as follows: For a given geographic area and the given parameters describing the UAV’s coverage capacity, the problem is to find an optimal route that covers the given geographic area. In this paper, an optimal path planning algorithm for the area under observation, given as a closed curve, is proposed. The algorithm partitions the given area of interest into multiple non-uniform rectangles while considering other parameters such as the flying altitude of the UAV and obstacles that could be encountered during its flight. The problem is transformed into Traveling Salesman Problem by constructing a graph from the rectangular partitioning. Effective approximate solutions are provided to this problem, using the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) approximation algorithm and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). The experimental results show that ACO outperforms the MST based algorithm as it does not get stuck in local minima.},

  abstract     = {Dysarthria is a speech disorder caused by stroke, Parkinson’s disease, neurological injury, or tumors that damage the nervous system and weaken the speech quality. Developing a unique voice command system for Dysarthric speech helps to recognize impaired speech and convert them into text or input c ommands. Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is one of the widely used generative model-based classifiers for Dysarthric speech recognition. But due to insufficient training data, HMM doesn’t provide optimal results on overlapping classes. We propose an ensemble Gaussian mixture model to recognize impaired speech more accurately. Our model converts the sequence of feature vectors into a fixed dimensional representation of patterns with varying lengths. The performance efficiency of the proposed model is evaluated on the Dysarthric UA-speech benchmark dataset. The discriminatory information provided by the proposed approach yields better classification accuracy even for shallow intelligibility words compared to conventional HMM.},

The proposed method includes weight calculation stage and deinterlacing implementation stage. In weight calculation stage, I compute correct weight values on each edge direction, which are calculated using fuzzy concepts. In deinterlacing implementation stage, the computed weight values are used to obtain final deinterlacing pixels by multiplying them with candidate existent pixels.

  abstract     = {In underwater acoustic networks (UANs), an acoustic modem is one of the key elements that governs underwater communications. The major demerit of the existing surveys conducted on acoustic modems is that such surveys do not comprise of the novel and state-of-the-art modems. In addition, the describ ed characteristics do not specify the full potential and capabilities of the designed modems. This, in consequence, makes it difficult to identify the parameters for improvement in future investigation. Also, it does not provide the optimal choice of a modem for various underwater applications. To overcome these challenges, this paper considers the latest acoustic modems designed in the last five years. Further, the modems are classified in terms of their suitability for the various applications, which helps the selection of the appropriate modem for a particular application scenario. Furthermore, the specification of every modem is described in a manner so that it is completely analyzed in highlighting its promising performance parameters as well exposing its region of compromised performance. Besides, acoustic modems developed by commercial manufacturers are also described. These strategies help researchers, scientists and engineers to compare to opt for the right modem for the right application. They also provide knowledge of the margin for improvement in the characteristics of these modems. Finally, perspectives are given for future investigation to make these modems more efficient, robust, smart and effective.},

  abstract     = {Domain adaptation (DA) aims to train a robust predictor by transferring rich knowledge from a well-labeled source domain to annotate a newly coming target domain; however, the two domains are usually drawn from very different distributions. Most current methods either learn the common features by m atching inter-domain feature distributions and training the classifier separately or align inter-domain label distributions to directly obtain an adaptive classifier based on the original features despite feature distortion. Moreover, intra-domain information may be greatly degraded during the DA process; i.e., the source data samples from different classes might grow closer. To this end, this paper proposes a novel DA approach, referred to as inter-class distribution alienation and inter-domain distribution alignment based on manifold embedding (IDAME). Specifically, IDAME commits to adapting the classifier on the Grassmann manifold by using structural risk minimization, where inter-domain feature distributions are aligned to mitigate feature distortion, and the target pseudo labels are exploited using the distances on the Grassmann manifold. During the classifier adaptation process, we simultaneously consider the inter-class distribution alienation, the inter-domain distribution alignment, and the manifold consistency. Extensive experiments validate that IDAME can outperform several comparative state-of-the-art methods on real-world cross-domain image datasets.},

  abstract     = {In Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) the energy of Sensor nodes is not certainly sufficient. In order to optimize the endurance of WSN, it is essential to minimize the utilization of energy. Head of group or Cluster Head (CH) is an eminent method to develop the endurance of WSN that aggregates the WSN with higher energy. CH for intra-cluster and inter-cluster communication becomes dependent. For complete, in WSN, the Energy level of CH extends its life of cluster. While evolving cluster algorithms, the complicated job is to identify the energy utilization amount of heterogeneous WSNs. Based on Chaotic Firefly Algorithm CH (CFACH) selection, the formulated work is named “Novel Distributed Entropy Energy-Efficient Clustering Algorithm”, in short, DEEEC for HWSNs. The formulated DEEEC Algorithm, which is a CH, has two main stages. In the first stage, the identification of temporary CHs along with its entropy value is found using the correlative measure of residual and original energy. Along with this, in the clustering algorithm, the rotating epoch and its entropy value must be predicted automatically by its sensor nodes. In the second stage, if any member in the cluster having larger residual energy, shall modify the temporary CHs in the direction of the deciding set. The target of the nodes with large energy has the probability to be CHs which is determined by the above two stages meant for CH selection. The MATLAB is required to simulate the DEEEC Algorithm. The simulated results of the formulated DEEEC Algorithm produce good results with respect to the energy and increased lifetime when it is correlated with the current traditional clustering protocols being used in the Heterogeneous WSNs.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANET) are thought-about as a mainstay in Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). For an efficient vehicular Adhoc network, broadcasting i.e. sharing a safety related message across all vehicles and infrastructure throughout the network is pivotal. Hence an efficient TDMA based MAC protocol for VANETs would serve the purpose of broadcast scheduling. At the same time, high mobility, influential traffic density, and an altering network topology makes it strenuous to form an efficient broadcast schedule. In this paper an evolutionary approach has been chosen to solve the broadcast scheduling problem in VANETs. The paper focusses on identifying an optimal solution with minimal TDMA frames and increased transmissions. These two parameters are the converging factor for the evolutionary algorithms employed. The proposed approach uses an Adaptive Discrete Firefly Algorithm (ADFA) for solving the Broadcast Scheduling Problem (BSP). The results are compared with traditional evolutionary approaches such as Genetic Algorithm and Cuckoo search algorithm. A mathematical analysis to find the probability of achieving a time slot is done using Markov Chain analysis.},

  abstract     = {The agriculture industry is of great importance in many countries and plays a considerable role in the national budget. Also, there is an increased interest in plantation and its effect on the environment. With vast areas suitable for farming, countries are always encouraging farmers through variou s programs to increase national farming production. However, the vast areas and large farms make it difficult for farmers and workers to continually monitor these broad areas to protect the plants from diseases and various weather conditions. A new concept dubbed Precision Farming has recently surfaced in which the latest technologies play an integral role in the farming process. In this paper, we propose a SMART Drone system equipped with high precision cameras, high computing power with proposed image processing methodologies, and connectivity for precision farming. The SMART system will automatically monitor vast farming areas with precision, identify infected plants, decide on the chemical and exact amount to spray. Besides, the system is connected to the cloud server for sending the images so that the cloud system can generate reports, including prediction on crop yield. The system is equipped with a user-friendly Human Computer Interface (HCI) for communication with the farm base. This multidrone system can process vast areas of farmland daily. The Image processing technique proposed in this paper is a modified ResNet architecture. The system is compared with deep CNN architecture and other machine learning based systems. The ResNet architecture achieves the highest average accuracy of 99.78% on a dataset consisting of 70,295 leaf images for 26 different diseases of 14 plants. The results obtained were compared with the CNN results applied in this paper and other similar techniques in previous literature. The comparisons indicate that the proposed ResNet architecture performs better compared to other similar techniques.},

Besides the numerous benefits of cloud services, migrating to public cloud storage leads to security and privacy concerns. Encryption method protects data pri vacy and confidentiality. However, encrypted data stored in cloud storage reduces the flexibility in processing data. Therefore, the development of new technologies to search top representatives from encrypted public storage is the current requirement. This paper presents a similarity-based keyword search for multi-author encrypted documents. The proposed Authorship Attribute-Based Ranked Keyword Search (AARKS) encrypts documents using user attributes, and returns ranked results to authorized users. The scheme assigns weight to index vectors by finding the dominant keywords of the specific authority document collection. Search using the proposed indexing prunes away branches and processes only fewer nodes. Re-weighting documents using the relevant feedback also improves user experience. The proposed scheme ensures the privacy and confidentiality of data supporting the cognitive search for encrypted cloud data. Experiments are performed using the Enron dataset and simulated using a set of queries. The precision obtained for the proposed ranked retrieval is 0.7262. Furthermore, information leakage to a cloud server is prevented, thereby proving its suitability for public storage.},

By mirroring the human brain (Cognitive computing system), helps to solve some of the complicated problems without much of human supervision. In t he fast-changing world, the major challenge every organization facing is difficulty in retaining its employees. Employees may leave an organization due to low salary, overwork, lack of opportunities and recognition, work culture, work-life imbalance etc. Better ways to retain employees is to understand their requirements and fulfill them. The proposed employee feedback sentiment analysis system collects the employee feedback reviews from open forums and perform sentiment analysis using Recurrent Neural Network – Long Short-term Memory (RNN-LSTM) algorithm. On performing Sentiment analysis, employee review comments are classified as Positive or Negative. A report is generated and sent to the HR of the organization as webapp or mobile app. The report has total number of positive and negative comments and positive and negative counts with respect to salary, work pressure etc. With the report, the organization can arrive at identifying social sentiments of their brand and may take corrective actions to retain employees which benefits both organization and employees. This paper also captures the performance of various models in training and predicting the employee feedback dataset and the models evaluated are Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest Classifier, AdaBoost Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier and Gaussian Naïve Bayes. The classification report and accuracy of each model is captured. The dataset size was gradually increased from 200 to 1000 and accuracy was predicted for each model. It was identified that the accuracy of machine learning algorithms was ranging between 66% to 85%. On training RNN-LSTM algorithm with dataset of size 30 k, the accuracy was 88%. It was identified that Deep learning algorithm RNN-LSTM performs better with huge dataset. Increasing dataset size still increase the performance of RNN-LSTM algorithm in training and prediction. Thus, the objective function of the proposed model to perform sentiment analysis on employee feedback review comments is achieved successfully.},

Later, Oriented fast and Rotated Brief (ORB) is used to extract the images from the scanned documents. To train the CNN, MIDV-500 dataset of 256 Azerbaijani passport images, each with the size of 1040*744 pixels is taken. The proposed CNN model uses sliding window operations layers to evaluate the authenticity. The proposed model analyzes both the textual authenticity and image (seal, stamp and hologram) authenticity of the scanned document. The experimental analysis is carried out on the TensorFlow using python programming language. The results derived from the proposed CNN based forgery detection model is compared with existing models and the results are promising to implement on the real time applications},

  abstract     = {Data cognition plays an important role in cognitive computing. Cognition of low-resolution (LR) image is a long-stand problem because LR images have insufficient information about objects. For better cognition of LR images, a multi-resolution residual network (MRRN) is proposed to improve image res olution in this paper for cognitive computing systems. In MRRN, a multi-resolution feature learning (MRFL) strategy is introduced to achieve satisfying performance with low computational costs. Inspired by image pyramids, a feature pyramid is designed to implement multi-resolution feature learning in the building unit of the proposed MRRN. Specifically, multi-resolution residual units (MRRUs) are introduced as the building units of the proposed network, which consist of a feature pyramid decomposition stage and a feature reconstruction stage. To obtain informative features, transferred skip links (TSLs) are utilized to transfer fine-grain residual features in the pyramid decomposition stage to the reconstruction stage. The effectiveness of MRFL and TSL is demonstrated by ablation experiments. Also, the tests on standard benchmarks indicate the superiority of the proposed MRRN over other state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Robotic manipulators represent a class of nonlinear and multiple-degrees-of-freedom robots that have pronounced coupling effects and can be used in various applications. The challenge of understanding complexity in a system’s dynamic behavior, coupling effects, and sources of uncertainty presents s ubstantial challenges regarding fault estimation, detection, identification, and tolerant-control (FEDIT) in a robot manipulator. Thus, a proposed active fault-tolerant control algorithm, based on an adaptive modern sliding mode observer, is represented. Due to the effect of the system’s complexities and uncertainties for fault estimation, detection, and identification (FEDI), a sliding mode observer (SMO) is proposed. To address the sliding mode observer drawbacks for FEDI such as high-frequency oscillation (chattering) and fault estimation accuracy, the modern (T-S fuzzy higher order) technique is represented. In addition, the adaptive technique is applied to the modern sliding mode observer (MSMO) to self-tune the coefficients of the fault estimation observer to increase the reliability and robustness of decision-making for diagnosis of the fault. Next, the residual delivered by the adaptive MSMO (AMSMO) is split into windows, and each window is characterized by a numerical parameter. Finally, the machine learning technique known as a decision tree adaptively derives the threshold values that are used for problems of fault detection and fault identification in this work. Due to control of the effective fault, a surface automated new sliding mode controller (SANSMC) is presented in this work. To address the challenge of chattering and unlimited uncertainties (faults), the AMSMO is applied to the sliding mode controller (SMC). In addition, the surface-automated technique is used to fine-tune the surface coefficient to reduce the chattering and faults in the robot manipulator. The results show that the machine learning-based automated robust hybrid observer significantly improves the robustness, reliability, and accuracy of FEDIT in unknown conditions.},

As a competitive tool to statistical forecasting models, we use the popular classic neural network (NN) of perceptron type. To train NN, the Back-Propagation (BP) algorithm and heuristics like genetic and micro-genetic algorithm (GA and MGA) are implemented on the large data set. A comparative analysis of selected learning methods is performed and evaluated.

  abstract     = {The prevalence of environmental studies in the academy has increased in recent years, depending on the adverse effects of global warming on natural resources. Besides various environmentally benign applications, one of the most important instruments on eliminating the negative environmental effects of an increasing population is electric vehicles. There are various topics within the concept of electric vehicles, including the determination of electric vehicle type, routing, network design, and so on. However, in this study, determining the locations of electric charging stations is the main focus. The problem is handled as a multi-criteria decision-making problem with the consideration of the uncertainties in the decision-making environment. Specifically, the judgments of decision-makers play a critical role in the success of decisions, but for a decision-maker, it is usually difficult to express his/her preferences by using only one linguistic term due to the structure of some criteria type. Hence, with the proposed methodology, in this study, criteria are firstly classified as fuzzy and crisp according to their objective or subjective characteristics. Afterwards, besides the utilization of classic techniques for crisp type criteria, probabilistic linguistic terms sets are utilized for fuzzy type criteria with an extended version of TOPSIS. The proposed methodology is used for the comparison of 39 alternative electric charging locations in Istanbul, which is one of the most crowded cities in Europe.},

However, when information is of uncertain nature, it is difficult to decide on how to treat. A hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (HFLTS) approach is applied to overcome such uncertainties related to this multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. This approach can be used to facilitate experts’ decision-making processes in complex and uncertain situations. In this study, an integrated hesitant fuzzy linguistic (HFL) MCDM approach is proposed to evaluate smart health technologies. The criteria are weighted with HFL Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), and then, smart health technologies are evaluated with the HFL Combinative Distance-based Assessment (CODAS) method. A comparative analysis with HFL COPRAS and HFL TOPSIS is applied. Lastly, the potential of this approach is presented through a case study.},

  abstract     = {Due to the increase in energy demand, many countries suffer from energy poverty because of insufficient and expensive energy supply. Plans to use alternative power like nuclear power for electricity generation are being revived among developing countries. Decisions for installation of power plants need to be based on careful assessment of future energy supply and demand, economic and financial implications and requirements for technology transfer. Since the problem involves many vague parameters, a fuzzy model should be an appropriate approach for dealing with this problem. This study develops a Fuzzy Multi-Objective Linear Programming (FMOLP) model for solving the nuclear power plant installation problem in fuzzy environment. FMOLP approach is recommended for cases where the objective functions are imprecise and can only be stated within a certain threshold level. The proposed model attempts to minimize total duration time, total cost and maximize the total crash time of the installation project. By using FMOLP, the weighted additive technique can also be applied in order to transform the model into Fuzzy Multiple Weighted-Objective Linear Programming (FMWOLP) to control the objective values such that all decision makers target on each criterion can be met. The optimum solution with the achievement level for both of the models (FMOLP and FMWOLP) are compared with each other. FMWOLP results in better performance as the overall degree of satisfaction depends on the weight given to the objective functions. A numerical example demonstrates the feasibility of applying the proposed models to nuclear power plant installation problem.},

The aim of this study is to establish a football player value assessment model using machine learning techniques to support th e transfer decisions of football clubs. The proposed model is mainly based on the intrinsic features of the individual players which are provided in Football Manager simulation game. To do this, based on the individual statistics of 5316 players who are active in 11 different major leagues from Europe and South America, different value assessment models are conducted using advanced supervised learning techniques which include ridge and lasso regressions, random forests and extreme gradient boosting. All the models have been built in R programming language. The performances of the models are compared based on their mean squared errors and their fit to the real world examples. An ensemble model with inflation is proposed as the output.},

On the other side, since the customers can be targeted based on their locations and interests, the price of the advertisement should be modeled a dynamic pricing model.

Logistics corporations, especially, have been concentrating on developing efficiency in integrated data, fleet management, and communication issues, to achieve cost advantages. Experts from a well-known logistics company in Turkey contributed to our study by helping to assess critical factors for successful blockchain technology implementation. Our research topic included determining whether blockchain technology is suitable for this company. Fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) was used to determine and evaluate the critical factors to encourage blockchain technology adoption, based on the company’s requirements. For the company experts, the factors affecting the decision to adopt blockchain technology were, in order of priority: cryptocurrency, instant money transfer, privacy, real time processing, smart contract, security, authentication, transparency, immutability, traceability, distributed ledger, reduced delays, and peer-to-peer networks.},

Ranking of a number is to identify a relationship of scalar quantity between these numbers. Ranking of fuzzy numbers play an important role in modeling problems such as fuzzy decision making, fuzzy linear programming problems. In this study, a new ranking method for triangular intuitionistic fuzzy numbers is proposed. The method based on the incircle of the membership function and non-membership function of TIFN uses lexicographical order to rank intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. Two examples are provided to illustrate the applicability of the method. Also, a comparative study is performed to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method. The results indicate that proposed method is consistent with other methods in the literature. Also, the method overcomes the problems such as numbers being very small or close to each other.},

For these reasons, determination of the appropriate CNC router machine for manufacturing systems is a crucial decision. Different factors related to properties of machines are effective on the decision. Therefore, decision makers must include different effective aspects into decision process. Under this consideration, an analytic selection procedure for CNC router machines by taking uncertain expressions of experts on the selection criteria and variable values occur over time is proposed in this study. In order to handle the modelling difficulty of uncertainty of the statements and the value changes by time, dynamic intuitionistic multi attribute decision making is used to select the best CNC router.

  abstract     = {Uncertainty is so common in real decision situations that it has given rise to a new decision making approach so-called linguistic decision making, in which such uncertainty is modeled by using linguistic information. Many contributions have been proposed in order to solve LDM problems by following a Computing with Words (CW) approach to obtain linguistic outputs from linguistic premises by emulating the human beings’ reasoning process. Nowadays, there are several LDM models that, together with the complexity of LDM problems, make almost impossible to find a proper solution for these problems without a support tool. FLINTSTONES is a fuzzy decision support system that facilitates the decision process in LDM problems. This software aimed to solve LDM problems by means of the 2-tuple linguistic model, whose main advantages are high interpretability and precision of the results. However, it has other drawbacks such as the modeling of linguistic information by using solely single linguistic terms or the impossibility to model the experts’ hesitancy. Recently, the Extended Comparative Linguistic Expressions with Symbolic Translation (ELICIT) linguistic representation model was introduced in order to overcome existing drawbacks in terms of interpretability and accuracy in CW processes. This model allows to model experts’ hesitancy and, at the same time, carry out precise linguistic computations and provide interpretable results, overcoming the limitations of previous LDM models. Therefore, this contribution presents an updated version of FLINTSTONES able to manage ELICIT information in LDM problems and which integrates the ELICIT CW approach.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection (FS) has become an essential task in overcoming high dimensional and complex machine learning problems. FS is a process used for reducing the size of the dataset by separating or extracting unnecessary and unrelated properties from it. This process improves the performance of clas sification algorithms and reduces the evaluation time by enabling the use of small sized datasets with useful features during the classification process. FS aims to gain a minimal feature subset in a problem domain while retaining the accuracy of the original data. In this study, four computational intelligence techniques, namely, migrating birds optimization (MBO), simulated annealing (SA), differential evolution (DE) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are implemented for the FS problem as search algorithms and compared on the 17 well-known datasets taken from UCI machine learning repository where the dimension of the tackled datasets vary from 4 to 500. This is the first time that MBO is applied for solving the FS problem. In order to judge the quality of the subsets generated by the search algorithms, two different subset evaluation methods are implemented in this study. These methods are probabilistic consistency-based FS (PCFS) and correlation-based FS (CFS). Performance comparison of the algorithms is done by using three well-known classifiers; k-nearest neighbor, naive bayes and decision tree (C4.5). As a benchmark, the accuracy values found by classifiers using the datasets with all features are used. Results of the experiments show that our MBO-based filter approach outperforms the other three approaches in terms of accuracy values. In the experiments, it is also observed that as a subset evaluator CFS outperforms PCFS and as a classifier C4.5 gets better results when compared to k-nearest neighbor and naive bayes.},

  abstract     = {Metaheuristics gained world-wide popularity and researchers have been studying them vigorously in the last two decades. A relatively less explored approach in the improvement of metaheuristics is to design new neighbor generation mechanisms. Neighbor generation mechanisms are very important in the success of any single solution-based heuristic since they directly guide the search. In this study, a neighbor generation mechanism called cantor-set based (CB) method for single solution-based heuristics which use permutation solution representation is described. The inspiration for CB method stems from the recursive algorithm that constructs a cantor set which is a fractal set. Three variations of CB method are discussed (CB-1, CB-2, CB-3) considering the presented design possibilities. The computational experiments are conducted by embedding the mechanisms into the classical local search and simulated annealing algorithms, separately, to test their efficiency and effectiveness by comparing them to classical swap and insertion mechanisms. The traveling salesman problem (TSP) and quadratic assignment problem (QAP) which are very different problems that have incompatible characteristics have been chosen to test the mechanisms and sets of benchmark instances with varying sizes are chosen for the comparisons. The computational tests show that CB-2 gives very favorable results for TSP and CB-1 gives favorable results for QAP which means that CB-2 is suitable for problems that have steep landscapes and CB-1 is suitable for the problems that have flat landscapes. It is observed that CB-3 is a more generalized mechanism because it gives consistently good results for both TSP and QAP instances. The best mechanism for a given instance of the both problem types outperforms the classical neighbor generation of swap and insertion in terms of effectiveness.},

These parameters are needed to be numerically specified in order to make these dynamic equations usable for dynamic and control analysis. In this study, tw o powerful techniques in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), namely Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) are utilized to explain how unknown parameters in differential equations of dynamic systems can be identified. The data required for training and testing the ANN and the ANFIS are obtained by solving the direct problem i.e. solving the dynamic equations with different known parameters and input stimulations.

  abstract     = {Firms need to integrate multiple business functions in order to acquire, analyze, model, and evaluate information necessary for better understanding customer behaviors and making data-driven decisions to enhance the customer experience journey. This study proposes a customer oriented intelligent de cision support system (IDSS) to ultimately improve the customer experience journey. Besides, a real application study is handled for a multinational company located in Turkey, considering its abrasives product sales for years of 2017 and 2018. For the data utilized in application study, the proposed methodology is constructed for customer segmentation to develop appropriate data-driven marketing strategies for customers with similar values, preferences and other factors for creating customer-centric organizations. In this regard; firstly two-phased clustering process, which involves the hierarchical multivariate average linkage clustering algorithm and partitional k-means clustering algorithm, is used to present the number of clusters on the basis of three variables (expenditure, transaction and unit cost) and then to assign the customers to the related clusters (VIP, Platinum, Gold and Bronze), respectively. Secondly, the performances of company’s departments are ranked according to the preferences of customers from each segment considering 4Ps marketing mix concept via integrated methodology of interval type-2 Fuzzy AHP and hesitant fuzzy TOPSIS.},

  abstract     = {Recently, researchers have shown an increased interest in integrating the neutrosophic sets with multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods. Previous literature have suggested the integration of neutrosophic set with the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method, in which the three memberships of neutrosophic set are utilized to solve problems that are characterized by non-deterministic information. Differently from the neutrosophic DEMATEL, which directly used three independent memberships, this paper proposes bipolar neutrosophic DEMATEL (Bipolar NS-DEMATEL) of which the positive and negative of truth, indeterminate and false memberships of bipolar neutrosophic set are introduced to enhance decision in urban sustainable development. Three criteria and fifteen sub-criteria of urban sustainable development are the main MCDM structures that need to be solved using the proposed method. A group of experts were invited to provide rating of performance values of sub-criteria of urban sustainable development problem using a bipolar neutrosophic linguistic scale. The proposed Bipolar NS-DEMATEL is applied to segregate the sub-criteria of urban sustainable development into cause and effect groups. In addition, the network relation map is drawn to observe the interaction among the sub-criteria. The Bipolar NS-DEMATEL suggests that air quality (SC12) is the most important sub-criteria in managing urban sustainable development. The result also unveils that the sub-criterion safety (SC21) is impacted and influenced by other sub-criteria. The identification of sub-criteria in accordance with their net causer and net receiver would help the authority in prioritizing sub-criteria that may directly be affected by urban development.},

  abstract     = {Density Based Spatial Clustering of Application with Noise (DBSCAN) is one of the mostly preferred algorithm among density based clustering approaches in unsupervised machine learning, which uses epsilon neighborhood construction strategy in order to discover arbitrary shaped clusters. DBSCAN separ ates dense regions from low density regions and simultaneously assigns points that lie alone as outliers to unearth the hidden cluster patterns in the datasets. DBSCAN identifies dense regions by means of core point definition, detection of which are strictly dependent on input parameter definitions: ε is distance of the neighborhood or radius of hypersphere and MinPts is minimum density constraint inside ε radius hypersphere. Contrarily to classical DBSCAN’s crisp core point definition, intuitionistic fuzzy core point definition is proposed in our preliminary work to make DBSCAN algorithm capable of detecting different patterns of density by two different combinations of input parameters, particularly is a necessity for the density varying large datasets in multidimensional feature space. In this study, preliminarily proposed DBSCAN extension is studied: IFDBSCAN. The proposed extension is tested by computational experiments on several machine learning repository real-time datasets. Results show that, IFDBSCAN is superior to classical DBSCAN with respect to external &amp; internal performance indices such as purity index, adjusted rand index, Fowlkes-Mallows score, silhouette coefficient, Calinski-Harabasz index and with respect to clustering structure results without increasing computational time so much, along with the possibility of trying two different density patterns on the same run and trying intermediary density values for the users by manipulating α margin.},

Also, two different strategies in the design and implementation of the controllers are presented. In the first one, a PD controller scheme is extended by using a fuzzy system to have adaptive parameters P and D, additionally, Type-2 Fuzzy sets are used to give robustness to the controller. In the second case, a Fuzzy controller is designed to compute in a direct way the control variables and it is extended to Type-2 Fuzzy controller. Finally, experimental results and comparative analysis are presented for the five control schemes by comparing the running time and the standard deviation to measure the robustness of the control systems.},

This study aims to propose a model to predict whether credit card users will pay their debts or not. Using the proposed model, potential unpaid risks can be predicted and necessary actio ns can be taken in time. For the prediction of customers’ payment status of next months, we use Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and C4.5, which are widely used artificial intelligence and decision tree algorithms. Our dataset includes 10713 customer’s records obtained from a well-known bank in Taiwan. These records consist of customer information such as the amount of credit, gender, education level, marital status, age, past payment records, invoice amount and amount of credit card payments. We apply cross validation and hold-out methods to divide our dataset into two parts as training and test sets. Then we evaluate the algorithms with the proposed performance metrics. We also optimize the parameters of the algorithms to improve the performance of prediction. The results show that the model built with the CART algorithm, one of the decision tree algorithm, provides high accuracy (about 86%) to predict the customers’ payment status for next month. When the algorithm parameters are optimized, classification accuracy and performance are increased.},

We also present a comparative analysis of the correlations between the evaluated criteria of the kitchen staff, on the basis the application of the correlation methods of ICrA, Pearson (PCA), Spearman (SCA) and Kendall (KCA). The four-correlation analysis yielded very similar correlation coefficients, but only the ICrA can be applied to intuitionistic fuzzy evaluations. It is observed that considerable divergence of the ICrA results from those obtained by the other classical correlation analyzes, is only found when the input data contains mistakes.},

However, there are serious obstacles to their usage as; (i) all of the potential hazards are considered as an independent event, (ii) various risks are identified based on these hazards, (iii) risk magnitudes o f these risks are obtained without considering interdependencies among the hazards, and then (iv) the protective measures against the defined risks are taken based on these risk magnitudes. Therefore, conventional methods do not provide any assessment for overall risks in the working environment. Furthermore, although an accident may cause different severity such as loss of working days, loss of limbs, occupational disease, and death, the conventional methods do not consider all potential consequences of any accident, simultaneously. The main objective of this paper is to propose an effective risk assessment approach by using the fuzzy set theory, Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), Fuzzy Inference System (FIS), and Quality Function Deployment (QFD) methods to quantify the risk of any hazard considering interdependencies among all potential hazards and consequences in working environment.

The nature of fuzziness is favorable for any environment, which supports to predict the problem and solving it. Fuzzy graphs are bene ficial to give more precision and flexibility to the system as compared to the classical model (i.e.,) crisp theory. A topological index is a numerical quantity for the structural graph of the molecule and it can be represented through Graph theory. Moreover, its application not only in the field of chemistry can also be applied in areas including computer science, networking, etc. A lot of topological indices are available in chemical-graph theory and H. Wiener proposed the first index to estimate the boiling point of alkanes called ‘Wiener index’. Many topological indices exist only in the crisp but it’s new to the fuzzy graph environment. The main aim of this paper is to define the topological indices in fuzzy graphs. Here, indices defined in fuzzy graphs are Modified Wiener index, Hyper Wiener index, Schultz index, Gutman index, Zagreb indices, Harmonic index, and Randić index with illustrations. Bounds for some of the indices are proved. The algorithms for distance matrix and MWI are shown. Finally, the application of these indices is discussed.},

Autonomous navigation of robotic systems is examined in two basic areas, with and without external supports.

When the widely used control approaches in the literature are examined, PID and fuzzy-based approaches are frequently encountered. They both offer advantages and disadvantages. Within the scope of this study, the positive aspects of both of control approaches are utilized and the hybrid control approach for a robot that can autonomously follow the ground line presented as an external reference is mentioned. The success of the approach was tested comparatively on an exemplary mobile platform. The applied results obtained experimentally showed that a more efficient fuzzy logic-based hybrid control method could be developed. In addition, the effect of the number of conditions in the rule table on the success of the hybrid control technique is shown in the study.

This can be achieved by extracting information during smartphone usage, including application access patterns. In this paper, we present a flexible machine learning user authentication scheme for smart home networks based on smartphone usage. Considering that users may run their smartphone applications differently during different day time intervals as well as different days of the week, new features are extracted by considering this information. The scheme is evaluated on a real-world dataset for continuous user authentication. The results show that the presented scheme authenticates users with high accuracy.},

Keeping high levels of inventory, especially for healthcare products, can be beneficial to overcome such shortage problems. Nevertheless, keeping a high level of inventory can be costly, and the durability of the products creates a limit. The decision-makers have to carefully decide the inventory levels by considering many factors such as the criticality of the product and the easiness of producing the product.

  abstract     = {The economic interaction between the countries of the world is gradually strengthening. Among them, the US stock market is a “barometer” of the global economy, which has a huge impact on the global economy. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the data in the US stock market, especially the data mining algorithm of abnormal data. At present, although data mining technology has achieved many research results in the financial field, it has not formed a good research system for time series data in stock market anomalies. According to the actual performance and data characteristics of the stock market anomaly, this paper uses data mining techniques to find the abnormal data in the stock market data, and uses the isolated point detection method based on density and distance to analyze the obtained abnormal data to obtain its implicit useful information. However, due to the defects of traditional data mining algorithms in dealing with stock market anomalies containing uncertain factors, that is, the errors caused by other human factors, this paper introduces the roughening entropy of the uncertainty data and applies its theory to the field of data mining, a data mining algorithm based on rough entropy in the US stock market anomaly is designed. Finally, the empirical analysis of the algorithm is carried out. The experimental results show that the data mining algorithm based on rough entropy proposed in this paper can effectively detect the abnormal fluctuation of time series in the stock market.},

As cultural landscape is being valued more and more, the use of 3D modeling is becoming more and more important. As for the 3D reconstruction technology, mo st of the current methods are complicated in terms of network construction, use, and storage, and then affect the reconstruction efficiency of subsequent cultural landscape heritage. To obtain the 3D reconstruction technology with high reconstruction efficiency, this paper combines the circumferential binary feature extraction algorithm and cloud computing technology, and proposes a circumferential binary feature extraction and matching search method. The interior-point rate of the CBD algorithm in this paper is greater than 72%, which is higher than the interior point rate of other different algorithms, which indicates that the CBD algorithm in this paper is suitable for matching HD rotated images. The experimental results show that the circular binary features extracted by the article have strong adaptability and fast contrast rate. To better the 3D reconstruction of cultural landscape heritage in the later period, this paper also improves the 4PSC point cloud rough registration algorithm. The experimental results show that compared with other coarse registration algorithms, the improved point cloud coarse registration algorithm improves the registration accuracy and the registration effect is good, which proves the effectiveness of the algorithm.},

  abstract     = {The more and more developed network has caused more and more impact on people’s life and work, providing convenient channels for people’s information exchange, and then improving people’s living and working conditions. However, when data is transmitted through the network, there are hidden security risks, especially important accounting data. Once intercepted and used by criminals, it may cause serious harm to the owner of the data. Based on the above background, the purpose of this article is to study the use of the DES algorithm to encrypt accounting data in a computing environment. This paper proposes an improved quantum genetic algorithm and applies it to the S-box design of the DES algorithm, which improves the non-linearity of the S-box, reduces the differential uniformity, and enhances the security of the DES algorithm. This improved DES algorithm reduces the number of iterations by increasing the key length and iterative processing using a two-round function, which further increases the security of the algorithm and improves the operation speed of the encryption process. It is found that the 64 ciphertexts of the DES algorithm and the number of changed bits compared to the original ciphertext fluctuates around 32 bits, which explains the problems that should be paid attention to when using the DES algorithm to encrypt accounting data. The validity of key characters should be guaranteed to prevent key loss or leakage. Shorter data encryption regular solution.},

  abstract     = {Welding is an important method for modern material processing. In actual processing, due to the influence of processing accuracy and welding thermal deformation, various defects often appear in the appearance of the weld. At present, visual inspection is mainly used for the appearance inspection of welds. The detection of weld defects mainly depends on the work experience of the staff. Based on the above background, the purpose of this article is to visually inspect the weld surface quality. This article uses visually obtained fringe images of weld contours as information sources to explore a visual-based weld appearance detection algorithm, including the measurement of weld formation dimensions and the detection of weld appearance defects. This algorithm overcomes manual measurements of the misjudgments and omissions caused by eye fatigue and experience differences. It improves the efficiency and accuracy of welding appearance inspection, and meets the needs of automation and intelligence of the entire welding process. In this paper, a subpixel stripe centerline extraction algorithm based on the combination of the Hessian matrix method and the center of gravity method is used; to further improve the accuracy of the extraction of the centerline of the weld seam, this article also performs the work of removing the wrong points and the compensation of the broken seam. Obtain a fringe centerline with better connectivity. Comparing the extraction algorithms of each centerline, the centerline obtained by this method has high accuracy, less time-consuming and high stability. It laid the foundation for the subsequent inspection of weld appearance. Through the training of the model, the accurate classification and recognition of surface defects of tube and plate welds have been achieved. The experimental results show that the improved vision-based welding surface defect recognition and classification proposed in this paper has better performance and accuracy. Up to 96.34%.},

Although the development level of machine translation has been greatly improved, the quality of machine translation is still not very high, and it is difficult to meet the needs of users. Artificial intelligence is the science that studies the laws of human intelligent activity. The application of artificial intelligence technology in the English depression and depression, combined with the Internet and intelligent knowledge base, can develop English translation systems to solve the problem of English translation to a certain extent. Based on the above background, the research content of this article is a neural network-based artificial intelligence technology English translation system based on the intelligent knowledge base. This article is mainly based on the existing English-Chinese machine translation to find a more favorable method for English long sentence translation.

This paper proposes an improved hybrid recommendation algorithm, and through experimental simulation, the results show that the accuracy of the algorithm is not very high. The highest is 35.64%. The possible reason may be that the k value is selected during k-means text clustering, or the N value recommended by TopN is not selected properly, but the hybrid recommendation is still better than ordinary collaborative filtering.},

Fuzzy LDA enhancement model is used to enhance the contrast of lane area, another brightness contrast saliency model can be used for robust Lane extraction. Then, two models are applied to lane detection, a two-stage lane detection method is proposed and a blind area vehicle detection method is designed. Firstly, the vehicle area is roughly extracted based on road gray statistics, and then the typical vehicle features are screened finely. Finally, the extracted features and SVM classifiers are used to confirm the candidate regions. Experiments show that: The proposed method can detect the vehicle in the blind area very well and is insensitive to the shape distortion and size change of the vehicle.},

  abstract     = {In smart city wireless network infrastructure, network node deployment directly affects network service quality. This problem can be attributed to deploying a suitable ordinary AP node as a wireless terminal access node on a given geometric plane, and deploying a special node as a gateway to aggreg ate. Traffic from ordinary nodes is to the wired network. In this paper, Pareto multi-objective optimization strategy is introduced into the wireless sensor network node security deployment, and an improved multi-objective particle swarm coverage algorithm based on secure connection is designed. Firstly, based on the mathematical model of Pareto multi-objective optimization, the multi-target node security deployment model is established, and the security connectivity and node network coverage are taken as the objective functions, and the problems of wireless sensor network security and network coverage quality are considered. The multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm is improved by adaptively adjusting the inertia weight and particle velocity update. At the same time, the elite archive strategy is used to dynamically maintain the optimal solution set. The high-frequency simulation software Matlab and simulation platform data interaction are used to realize the automatic modeling, simulation analysis, parameter prediction and iterative optimization of wireless network node deployment in smart city based on adaptive particle swarm optimization. Under the premise of meeting the performance requirements of wireless network nodes in smart cities, the experimental results show that although the proposed algorithm could not achieve the accuracy of using only particle swarm optimization algorithm to optimize the parameters of wireless network nodes in smart cities, the algorithm is completed. The antenna parameter optimization process takes less time and the optimization efficiency is higher.},

This paper presented an improved ant colony algorithm by using data analysis technologies of cloud computing and data mining. And the influence of different spatio-temporal feature fusion methods on the steering wheel angle value of intelligent vehicles is explored by feature fusion method. Furthermore, time-constrained and space-constrained networks are utilized to extract the key features that affect the steering wheel angle value. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm improves the efficiency of data processing and information search by 35%, comparing to traditional ant colony algorithm.

The model can fuse topic features to obtain high-quality high -level text features. Experiments show that in binary sentiment classification, the highest classification accuracy of the model can reach more than 90%, which is higher than that of commonly used deep learning models. This paper focuses on the combination of deep neural networks and emerging text processing technologies, and improves and perfects them from two aspects of model architecture and training methods, and designs an efficient deep network sentiment analysis model. A CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model based on polymorphism is proposed. The model constructs the CNN input matrix by combining the word vector information of the text, the emotion information of the words, and the position information of the words, and adjusts the importance of different feature information in the training process by means of weight control.

  abstract     = {To overcome the disadvantages of low optimization accuracy and prematurity of the canonical PSO algorithm, we proposed an improved particle swarm optimization based on the interaction mechanism between leaders and individuals (PSO-IBLI), and used it to implement robot global path planning. In the P SO-IBLI algorithm, in different stages, each particle learns from the elites according to different regular. Moreover, the improved algorithm divides the execution state into two categories, where the parameters and the evaluation mechanisms are varied accordingly. In this way, the global best particles no longer walk randomly and have more learning objects. At the same time, other particles learn from not only the global best position, their historical best positions, but also the other elites. The learning strategy makes the search mode always in the adaptive adjustment, and it improves the speed of convergence and promotes this algorithm to find a more precise solution. The experimental results suggest that the precision and convergence speed of the PSO-IBLI algorithm is higher than the other three different algorithms. Additionally, some experiments are carried out to plan the robot’s entire collision-free path using the PSO-IBLI algorithm and the other three algorithms. The results show that the PSO-IBLI algorithm can obtain the shortest collision-free way in four algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, with the increased voice for protecting the environment by the people all over the world, the governments also have actively adopted more and more measures to further promote environmental conservation and sustainable development. Traditional procurement approaches have not well up dated to the current needs of the society, especially for the retail industry which is in relation to the national economy due to numerous products and different suppliers being involved. Therefore, the need for green procurement is more important. The qualified green supplier selection is the core of green procurement, which is the utmost importance in the business competition throughout the supply chain in today’s strong business competition. Thus, in order to obtain the optimal green supplier, integration of Entropy weights and multi-attributive border approximation area comparison (MABAC) under uncertain probabilistic linguistic sets (UPLTSs) has offered a novel integrated model, in which information Entropy is utilized for calculating objective weights with UPLTSs to acquire the final ranking result of green supplier. Besides, so as to indicate the applicability of devised method, it is confirmed by a numerical case for green supplier selection. Some comparative studies are made with some existing methods. The proposed method can also serve for selecting suitable alternative successfully in other selection problems.},

  abstract     = {A transportation problem basically deals with the problem which aims to minimize the total transportation cost or maximize the total transportation profit of distributing a product from a number of sources or origins to a number of destinations. While, in general, most of the real life applications are modeled as a transportation problem (TP) with the multiple, conflicting and incommensurate objective functions. On the other hand, for some reason such as shortage of information, insufficient data or lack of evidence, the data of the mentioned problem are not always exact but can be fuzzy. This type of problem is called fuzzy multi-objective transportation problem (FMOTP). There are a few approaches to solve the FMOTPs. In this paper, a new fuzzy DEA based approach is developed to solve the Fully Fuzzy MOTPs (FFMOTPs) in which, in addition to parameters of the MOTPs, all of the variables are considered fuzzy. This approach considers each arc in a FFMOTP as a decision making unit which produces multiple fuzzy outputs using the multiple fuzzy inputs. Then, by using the concept of the common set of weights (CSW) in DEA, a unique fuzzy relative efficiency is defined for each arc. In the following, the unique fuzzy relative efficiency is considered as the only attribute for the arcs. In this way, a single objective fully fuzzy TP (FFTP) is obtained that can be solved using the existing standard algorithms for solving this kind of TPs. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the developed approach.},

  abstract     = {Globalization of business around the world has turned individual firms into groups of collaborating business units whereby companies do not operate in isolation but function as integral part of big supply chain networks (SCN). Organization of SCN is quite complex as they operate with uncertainty in demands and operations. However, supply chain networks are required to be optimized in order to reduce the overall supply chain cost and increase service levels. Since these objectives are normally conflicting and incommensurable, instead of a singular solution, it is preferred to obtain a set of equitable solutions which is commonly referred to as set of Pareto optimal solutions. Subsequently, a suitable solution can be chosen by the user from the set of equitable solutions. In the present research, a multi-echelon SCN problem is formulated and two important objectives are identified. It is desired to minimize the total cost of supply chain network and at the same time maximize customer service level in terms of supply to demand ratio. Simultaneous optimization of these objectives has been carried out using an evolutionary algorithm (EA) called NSGA-II, which works with population of SCN solutions and is more likely to provide set of globally optimized solutions. However, at the conclusion of optimization, user needs to select a final solution from the Pareto optimal set of solutions after careful analysis. Existing approaches to carry out such analysis are complex and time consuming. We propose a novel method involving fuzzy logic in this research by which fuzzy indices corresponding to each of the solutions in the Pareto Front (PF) are obtained. Fuzzy indices of all the Pareto optimal SCN solutions are later compared to reach to a final solution from the Pareto optimal set.},

  abstract     = {A bad partition in an ensemble will be removed by a cluster ensemble selection framework from the final ensemble. It is the main idea in cluster ensemble selection to remove these partitions (bad partitions) from the selected ensemble. But still, it is likely that one of them contains some reliable clusters. Therefore, it may be reasonable to apply the selection phase on cluster level. To do this, a cluster evaluation metric is needed. Some of these metrics have been recently introduced; each of them has its limitations. The weak points of each method have been addressed in the paper. Subsequently, a new metric for cluster assessment has been introduced. The new measure is named Balanced Normalized Mutual Information (BNMI) criterion. It balances the deficiency of the traditional NMI-based criteria. Additionally, an innovative cluster ensemble approach has been proposed. To create the consensus partition considering the elected clusters, a set of different aggregation-functions (called also consensus-functions) have been utilized: the ones which are based upon the co-association matrix (CAM), the ones which are based on hyper graph partitioning algorithms, and the ones which are based upon intermediate space. The experimental study indicates that the state-of-the-art cluster ensemble methods are outperformed by the proposed cluster ensemble approach.},

Moreover, the combination of IoT and cloud computing technologies are playing major roles in e-health services.

In this system, the medical data is retrieved from various located patients who are utilizing the e-healthcare assisting devices. First, the retrieved and encrypted data is stored in cloud by applying a newly proposed secured cloud storage algorithm. Second, the stored data can be retrieved the data as original data by applying the decryption process. Third, a new cloud framework is introduced for predicting the status of heart beat rates and diabetes levels by using the medical data that is created by applying the UCI Repository dataset. In addition, a new deep learning approach which applies the Convolutional Neural Network for predicting the disease severity.

  abstract     = {Digital image steganography algorithms usually suffer from a lossy restoration of the cover content after extraction of a secret message. When a cover object and confidential information are both utilised, the reversible property of the cover is inevitable. With this objective, several reversible d ata hiding (RDH) algorithms are available in the literature. Conversely, because both are diametrically related parameters, existing RDH algorithms focus on either a good embedding capacity (EC) or better stego-image quality. In this paper, a pixel expansion reversible data hiding (PE-RDH) method with a high EC and good stego-image quality are proposed. The proposed PE-RDH method was based on three typical RDH schemes, namely difference expansion, histogram shifting, and pixel value ordering. The PE-RDH method has an average EC of 0.75 bpp, with an average peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 30.89 dB. It offers 100% recovery of the original image and confidential hidden messages. To protect secret as well as cover the proposed PE-RDH is also implemented on the encrypted image by using homomorphic encryption. The strength of the proposed method on the encrypted image was verified based on a comparison with several existing methods, and the approach achieved better results than these methods in terms of its EC, location map size and imperceptibility of directly decrypted images.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy logic is a multi-valued concept, whose emergence in software sciences has eliminated 0 and 1 computations, putting them within an infinite space of [0,1]. This characteristic of fuzzy logic has resolved ambiguity in numerous previous problems. The sentence roles in Persian language were speci fied based on the fuzzy logic’s capability to resolve ambiguity. For that purpose, we first obtained the best classification for each defuzzifier, based on which a classified fuzzy was implemented. Nonetheless, the fuzzy system used in this research was classified based on statistical computations. To achieve the best classification, five defuzzification methods (Mean Of Max, Max Of Membership, Largest Of Max, Smallest Of Max, and Central Average) competed in 16 roles each in five classes (different matrices). Finally, Mean of Max with a success rate of 64% proved to be a defuzzifier delivering the best output among 5 different defuzzification methods.},

Then, the optimal alternative is obtained through calculating largest relative relational degree from the probabilistic linguistic positive ideal solution (PLPIS) which considers both the largest grey relational coefficient (GRC) from the PLPIS and the smallest GRC form probabilistic linguistic negative ideal solution (PLNIS).

  abstract     = {The chest X-ray examination is one of the most important methods for screening and diagnosing of many lung diseases. Diagnosis of pneumonia by chest X-ray is one of the common methods used by medical experts. However, the image quality of chest X-Ray has some defects, such as low contrast, overlapp ing organs and blurred boundary, which seriously affects detecting pneumonia in chest X-rays. Therefore, it has important medical value and application significance to construct a stable and accurate automatic detection model of pneumonia through a large number of chest X-ray images. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid system for detecting pneumonia from chest X-Ray image: ACNN-RF, which is an adaptive median filter Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) recognition model based on Random forest (RF). Firstly, the improved adaptive median filtering is employed to remove noise in the chest X-ray image, which makes the image more easily recognized. Secondly, we establish the CNN architecture based on Dropout to extract deep activation features from each chest X-ray image. Finally, we employ the RF classifier based on GridSearchCV class as a classifier for deep activation features in CNN model. It not only avoids the phenomenon of over-fitting in data training, but also improves the accuracy of image classification. During our experiment, the public chest X-ray image dataset used in the experiment contains 5863 images, which comprises 4265 frontal-view X-ray images of 1574 unique patients. The average recognition rate of pneumonia is up to 97% by the proposed ACNN-RF. The experimental results show that the ACNN-RF identification system is more effective than the previous traditional image identification system.},

  abstract     = {Symmetric loss functions are widely used in regression algorithms to focus on estimating the means. Huber loss, a symmetric smooth loss function, has been proved that it can be optimized with high efficiency and certain robustness. However, mean estimators may be poor when the noise distribution i s asymmetric (even outliers caused heavy-tailed distribution noise) and estimators beyond the means are necessary. Under the circumstances, quantile regression is a natural choice which estimates quantiles instead of means through asymmetric loss functions. In this paper, an asymmetric Huber loss function is proposed to implement different penalty for overestimation and underestimation so as to deal with more general noise. Moreover, a smooth truncated version of the proposed loss is introduced to enhance stronger robustness to outliers. Concave-convex procedure is developed in the primal space with the proof of convergence to handle the non-convexity of the involved truncated objective. Experiments are carried out on both artificial and benchmark datasets and robustness of the proposed methods are verified.},

Due to the significance of solving the imbalanced k-coverage problem, this paper proposes a learning automata (LA)-based algorithm capable of selecting a minimum number of sensors in a way to provide k-coverage for all targets in a balanced way. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm performance, several experiments were conducted and the obtained results were compared to those of two greedy-based algorithms.

Then the effective part of the input sequence is preserved and output by masking matrix and convolution layer. Thirdly, the effective output of input sequence is input into BiGRU network for learning.

  abstract     = {Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a hot and significant task of natural language processing, which is composed of two subtasks, the aspect term extraction (ATE) and aspect polarity classification (APC). Previous researches generally studied two subtasks independently and designed neural net work models for ATE and APC respectively. However, it integrates various manual features into the model, which will consume plenty of computing resources and labor. Moreover, the quality of the ATE results will affect the performance of APC. This paper proposes a multi-task learning model based on dual auxiliary labels for ATE and APC. In this paper, general IOB labels, and sentimental IOB labels are equipped to efficiently solve both ATE and APC tasks without manual features adopted. Experiments are conducted on two general ABSA benchmark datasets of SemEval-2014. The experimental results reveal that the proposed model is of great performance and efficient for both ATE and APC tasks compared to the main baseline models.},

  abstract     = {In reliability field, the probabilities of basic events are often treated as exact values in conventional fault tree analysis. However, for many practical systems, because the concept of events may be ambiguous, the factors affecting the occurrence of events are complex and changeable, so it is dif ficult to obtain accurate values of the occurrence probability of events. Fuzzy sets can well deal with these situations. Thus this paper will develop a novel fault tree analysis method in the assumption of the values of probability of basic events expressed with triangular intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. First, a new ranking function of triangular intuitionistic numbers is established, which can reflect the behavior factors of the decision maker. Then a novel fault tree analysis method is put forward on the basis of operational laws and the proposed ranking function of triangular intuitionistic numbers. Finally, an example of weapon system “automatic gun” is employed to show that the proposed fault tree analysis method is feasible and effective.},

The proposed model integrates exchange, consumption and the agent’s fuzzy preference in the consumption set. We set up a new fuzzy binary relation on the consumption s et to evaluate the fuzzy preferences. Also, we prove that there exists a continuous fuzzy order-preserving function in the consumption set under certain conditions. The existence of a fuzzy competitive equilibrium for the PXE-FP is confirmed through a new result on the existence of fuzzy Nash equilibrium for fuzzy non-cooperative games. The payoffs of all strategy profiles for any agent are fuzzy numbers in fuzzy non-cooperative games. Finally, we show that the fuzzy competitive equilibrium could be characterized as a solution to an associated quasi-variational inequality, giving rise to an equilibrium solution.},

  abstract     = {Parking spaces are insufficient and are plagued by over-consumption in hot areas. To assist drivers easily in identifying available parking spaces, parking variable message signs are commonly adopted to display information on space availability. This paper analyzes the performance of various inform ation provision strategies. To achieve this objective, we first present the mechanisms of the information provision strategies. Then, the information provision strategies are classified into three categories: regular, symmetric, and discriminative. The regular strategies provide the collected parking information directly to drivers; the symmetric schemes employ the equal threshold values for all parking lots; and the discriminative schedules adopt an independent threshold value for each parking lot. The threshold value provides an upper limit for the Space Occupancy Percentage (SOP): when the SOP is larger than the threshold value, the parking lot status becomes FULL; otherwise, it is displayed having available spaces. Finally, an agent-based simulation model is introduced to describe the parking and traffic conditions. The results indicate that both the symmetric and discriminative strategies significantly decrease the highest failure rate and average travel time, whereas the latter performs better. The results of this comparative analysis can assist in the configuration and operation of an urban parking guidance and information system.},

Inspired by the excellent performance of deep tracker, a novel tracker based on MDNet is prop osed. As the prior information has great value for target tracking, a modified Back-Propagation network is used for predicting the scale of target during tracking. The result of the prediction is used for generating candidate windows for online learning, which can improve the performance of tracker. To evaluate the proposed tracking algorithm, we performed experiments on the VOT-TIR2016 and AMCOM infrared data. The experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm provides a 1.94% relative gain in accuracy and 21.4% in robustness on VOT-TIR2016 when compared with MDNet.},

The main contribution of this paper is the careful fusion of the employed algorithms where some of them work in parallel to strengthen each other in order to produce a precise and sophisticated real-time output. In addition, the RT_VDT provides fast enough computation to be embedded in CPUs that are currently employed by ADAS systems. The particulars of the employed algorithms together with their implementation are described in detail. Additionally, these algorithms and their various integration combinations are tested and their performance is evaluated using actual road images, and videos captured by the front-mounted camera of the car as well as on the KITTI benchmark with 87% average precision achieved. The evaluation of the RT_VDT shows that it reliably detects and tracks vehicle boundaries under various conditions.},

Traffic prediction is essential for intelligent transportation systems (ITSs), traffic management authorities, and travelers. Traffic prediction has become a challenging task due to various non-linear temporal dynamics at different locations, complicated underlying spatial dependencies, and more extended step forecasting. To accommodate these instances, efficient visualization and data mining techniques are required to predict and analyze the massive amount of traffic big data. This paper presents a deep learning-based parallel convolutional neural network (Parallel-CNN) methodology to predict the traffic conditions of a specific region. The methodology of deep learning contains multiple processing layers and performs various computational strategies, which is used to learn representations of data with multilevel abstraction. The data has captured from the department of transportation; thus, the size of data is vast, and it can be analyzed to get the behavior of the traffic condition. The purpose of this paper is to monitor traffic behavior, which enables the user to make decisions to build the traffic-free cities. Experimental results show that the proposed methodology outperforms other existing methods such as KNN, CNN, and FIMT-DD.},

In order to deal with deviations due to incomplete reliability of the evaluation, this paper first proposes the interval probability hesitant fuzzy linguistic variable (IPHFLV), which takes the HFLTS as the evaluation part and adds a novel element-reliability of evaluation, thus can describe the different credibility of information evaluation due to the familiarity of experts with schemes and the differences in knowledge cognition. The operation rules and comparison methods are also illustrated. Particularly, under the inspiration of probability theory, we propose the possibility degree of the IPHFLVs. Then we propose IPHFL-AHP based on the AHP and interval probability hesitant fuzzy linguistic variable. Especially, the general geometric consistency index (G-GCI) based on the unbiased estimator of the variance is presented to measure the consistency and the iterative algorithm is constructed to improve the consistency. We use the possibility degree to calculate the priority vector to acquire the total ranking and introduce the process of IPHFL-AHP.

In this context, neonatal incubators help maintaining good health conditions because they provide a thermally-neutral environme nt, which is adequate to ensure the least energy expenditure by the newborn. In the last decades, artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been established as one of the main tools for the identification of nonlinear systems. Among the various approaches used in the identification process, the fuzzy wavelet neural network (FWNN) can be regarded as a prominent technique, consisting of the combination of wavelet neural network (WNN) and adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). This work proposes the use of FWNN to infer the temperature and humidity values inside the incubator in order to certify the equipment operation. Results obtained with the analyzed neural system have shown the generalization and inference capacities of FWNNs, thus allowing their application to practical tasks aiming to increase the efficiency of incubators.},

Flipping classroom is a new teaching mode under the background of the rapid development of information technology. It is also an important way of multimedia networ k teaching. However, compared with the traditional teaching mode, teachers in the online teaching platform cannot judge the students’ psychological activities through the students’ state of mind, and they can grasp the students’ learning status through the teaching process. Based on this, based on the cloud computing platform, this study improves the data transmission effect and improves the algorithm according to the learning process of the online education platform. Moreover, this study combines support vector machine to construct a student state recognition system suitable for online education platform and conducts algorithm performance analysis through experiments. In addition, this study uses MKmeans algorithm, Kmeans algorithm and improved Kmeans algorithm, that is, K-mediods and Xmeans algorithm to compare the pre-processed final data sets.

Based on SVM, this study applies convolutional neural network algorithm to text recognition of English teaching content, and effectively recognizes text features. After feature extraction, the original text content has been changed into data that the machine can directly identify and analyze, and semantic analysis is performed. In order to verify the performance of the algorithm, the performance of the algorithm was analyzed by example verification.

This method takes one minute as time granularity, collects traffic data such as cross-section flow, section traffic flow velocity data, traffic density, road occupancy, section delay and steering ratio by using RFID technology, and analyzes and processes the data. By introducing Bayesian network in probabilistic network and combining K-nearest neighbor method, historical data and predicted traffic flow state are classified to realize the prediction of traffic flow with small time granularity at intersections. The experimental results show that this method has high prediction accuracy and reliability, and is a feasible traffic flow prediction method.},

A semi-supervised kernel fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm based on artificial fish swarm optimization (AFSA-KFC M) is proposed. Firstly, the kernel function is used to change the distance function in the traditional semi-supervised fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm to define a new objective function, thus improving the probabilistic constraints of the fuzzy C-means algorithm. Then, the artificial fish swarm algorithm with strong global optimization ability is used to improve the KFCM sensitivity to the initial cluster center and easy to fall into the local extremum, thus improving the convergence speed and improving the classification effect. The test results in the Wine and IRIS public datasets show that the AFSA-KFCM clustering algorithm is superior to the traditional algorithm in clustering accuracy and time efficiency. At the same time, the experimental results in KDDCUP99 experimental data show that the algorithm can obtain the ideal detection rate and false detection rate in intrusion detection.},

In case of living organisms transport of precise molecules across lipid membranes has been treated as vital part and for that reason a bigger transporter is required to carry out the molecules. Here ABC transporter families are evolved to transport the specific molecules such as sugars, amino acid, peptides, proteins, ions etc. within the plasma membrane. As we know another important component of human being is cholesterol, which is a major component in cell membrane and its main functions are to maintain integrity and mechanical stability.

  abstract     = {Edge detection and segmentation are the two main approaches being used since last three decades for successful image analysis in remote sensing domain. Although many intensive studies were undertaken, they all were limited to high-resolution aerial images and none addressed this problem exhaustivel y. The purpose of this study was to investigate both edge detection and segmentation by employing a novel hybrid method combining probability density function and partial differential equation to obtain accurate estimations. The newly proposed method is implemented in two phases: the first phase deals with smoothening that include improved kernel density estimation (KDE) with anisotropic diffusion coefficient function kernel with both adaptive bandwidth and constant threshold selection using Shannon entropy, in addition to a weighting parameter of 3 × 3 window for lower probability of the whole image in diffusion function; whereas in the second phase, edge detection and segmentation are dealt with by incorporating two prominent techniques, namely diffusion coefficient equation and six-sigma control limit. We carried out a cross-sectional analysis using different datasets such as SIPI database and ground truth images for smoothing, edging and segmentation. Afterward, the results were compared with the other state-of-the-art techniques. Finally, the performance measures of the implemented technique were evaluated by means of entropy, fractal dimension, and an equivalent number of looks for smoothened images, by the Pratt metric for edge detection, and in the case of segmentation, misclassification error was considered. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed scheme outperforms its counterparts in all aspects. Hence, the proposed hybrid scheme is better and robust, and results in accurate estimation for the given datasets.},

  abstract     = {During the last decade, ensemble clustering has been the subject of many researches in data mining. In ensemble clustering, several basic partitions are first generated and then a function is used for the clustering aggregation in order to create a final partition that is similar to all of the basi c partitions as much as possible. Ensemble clustering has been proposed to enhance efficiency, strength, reliability, and stability of the clustering. A common slogan concerning the ensemble clustering techniques is that “the model combining several poorer models is better than a stronger model”. Here at this paper, an ensemble clustering method is proposed using the basic k-means clustering method as its base clustering algorithm. Also, this study could raise the diversity of consensus by adopting some measures. Although our clustering ensemble approach has the strengths of kmeans, such as its efficacy and low complexity, it lacks the drawbacks which the kmeans suffers from; such as its problem in detection of clusters that are not uniformly distributed or in the circular shape. In the empirical studies, we test the proposed ensemble clustering algorithm as well as the other up-to-date cluster ensembles on different data-sets. Based on the experimental results, our cluster ensemble method is stronger than the recent competitor cluster ensemble algorithms and is the most up-to-date clustering method available.},

In comparison to the literature, the problem considers a more complete set of stages in the network e.g. simultaneous consideration of supplier, plant, distribution center, customer, and collection, recovering, recyc ling, and disposal centers. The problem makes location, capacity, allocation, demand mode and material/product flow decisions for optimizing net benefit including sales revenue, fixed establishing cost of facilities, transportation cost, material purchasing cost, production cost, and inventory holding cost. As a novelty, for the first time multi-mode demand satisfaction is considered in a closed loop supply chain problem. As another contribution, in order to be close to real-world situations, the problem is tackled in a fuzzy environment by using trapezoidal fuzzy parameters which yield a trapezoidal fuzzy objective function value. As solution methodology, considering the fuzzy objective function, the problem is reformulated as a multi-objective fuzzy mixed integer linear problem and is crisped using credibility measure of the fuzzy constraints.

  abstract     = {Knowledge discovery and data mining provide an array of solutions for real-world problems. When facing business requirements, the ultimate goal of knowledge discovery is not the knowledge itself but rather making the gained knowledge practical. Consequently, the models and patterns found by the min ing methods often require post-processing. To this end, actionable knowledge discovery has been introduced which is developed to extract actionable knowledge from data. The output of actionable knowledge discovery is a set of actions that help the domain expert to gain the desired outcome. Such a process where a set of actions are extracted is called action extraction. One of the challenges of action extraction is to incorporate causal dependencies among the variables to find actions with higher effectiveness compared to when no such dependencies are used. The goal of this paper is to dive into the lesser studied subject of “action discovery in social networks” and intends to extract actions by utilizing the casual structures discovered from such data. Furthermore, in order to capture the underlying information within a social network, we extract the corresponding structural features. We propose a method called SF-ICE-CREAM (Social Features included Inductive Causation Enabled Causal Relationship-based Economical Action Mining) to overcome the challenges introduced above. This method uses structural features to find the underlying causal structures within a social network and incorporates them into the action extraction process.},

Borumand Saeid [16] used a special family of extreme fuzzy filters F on a BL-algebra L, they constructed a uniform structure (L,K), and then the part K induced a uniform topology τF in L . Also, they proved that the pair (L,τF) is a topological BL-algebra, and some properties of (L,τF) were investigated. Inspired by their study, in this paper, we define the family of extreme fuzzy ideals I on a De Morgan residuated lattice L, we construct a uniform structure (L, K) , and then the part K induce a uniform topology τI in L . We prove that the pair (L,τI) is a Topological De Morgan Residuated lattice, and some properties of (L,τI) are investigated. In particular, we show that (L,τI) is a first-countable, zero-dimensional, disconnected and completely regular space. Finally, we give some characterizations of topological properties of (L,τI). We note that, since ideals and filters are dual in BL-algebras (see C. Lele and J. B. Nganou [12]), a study on extreme fuzzy ideals in BL-algebras follows by duality, but in the framework of De Morgan residuated lattices, which is a larger class than BL-algebras, the duality between ideals and filters does not hold, so the study of extreme fuzzy ideals in De Morgan residuated lattices becomes interesting from algebraic and topological point of view, and the results of X.

Firstly, the network probe stream data are captured and aggregated in real-time to extract network stream metadata. Secondly, by calculating Pearson correlation coefficient and maximum mutual information coefficient, feature selection of network metadata is carried out. Finally, the information entropy and stochastic forest algorithm are combined to detect the anomaly of probe traffic based on the selected key feature groups, and the probe traffic is accurately classified by multiple incremental learning. The results show that the proposed method can quickly locate the abnormal position of probe traffic and analyze the abnormal points, which greatly reduces the workload of application platform for power system security monitoring, and has high detection accuracy.

Protecting the IoT infrastructure is not a straightforward task. There is an urgent need to handle different attack scenarios within the IoT smart environme nt. Attackers continuously targeted the modern aspects of technology, and trying abusing these technologies using complex attack scenarios such as Botnet attacks. Botnet attacks considered a serious challenge faces of the IoT smart environment. In this paper, we introduce a novel idea that capable of supporting the detecting of IoT-Botnet attack and in meanwhile to avoid the issues associated with the deficiencies of the knowledge-based representation and the binary decision. This paper aims to introduce a detection approach for the IoT-BotNet attack by using the Fuzzy Rule Interpolation (FRI). The FRI reasoning methods added a benefit to enhance the robustness of fuzzy systems and effectively reduce the system’s complexity. These benefits help the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to generate more realistic and comprehensive alerts. The proposed approach was applied to an open-source BoT-IoT dataset from the Cyber Range Lab of the center of UNSW Canberra Cyber. The proposed approach was tested, evaluated and obtained a 95.4% detection rate. Moreover, it effectively smooth the boundary between normal and IoT-BotNet traffics because of its fuzzy-nature, as well as, it had the ability to generate the required IDS alert in case of the deficiencies of the knowledge-based representation.},

In DTN, nodes help to convey message even with connectivity problem. Instead of using the own resource to pass a message to other nodes, a relay node is preferred which discovers the sink node with a greater probability of transferring messages on its own. A condition named node’s selfishness is thus raised and it surely degrades network performance, which is more obvious in urban environment. To handle such problem, an incentive-based routing algorithm is generated by using the concept Selfishness-Enhanced Reliable Forwarding (SERF) to remove node selfishness and Direct Diffusion to omit duplicate messages present in relay node. This algorithm finds the probability of messages received by the relay node with reference to the usage of resources of sender node. Concurrently, buffer management policy is maintained, by setting the threshold of message copies according to the resource consumption of the source node when it generates a message. The result reveals that the proposed algorithm is better to the existing algorithms with regard to the performance metrics such as, delivery ratio, the average delay, and network overhead.},

By which, contents beyond the image boundaries may be extrapolated. In recent years, deep learning methods have achieved remarkable improvements in image inpaint ing, these techniques can be considered to be applied to image outpainting as solutions. However, many of these inpainting methods generate image blocks generally resulting in blur or smooth. Recently, hallucinating edges for the missing holes before completion has been proved to be a state-of-the-art image inpainting method. Refer to the aforementioned method, we propose a three-phase outpainting model that consists of an edge generation phase, an image expansion phase and a refinement phase. In order to depict the edge lines more accurately, we adopt a comparatively effective focal loss for edge prediction. An optimization stage with a refinement network is also added since large portions outside the image need to be inferred, and discriminator in this stage works on a decreased patch size with a coarse-to-fine fashion. In addition, with recursive outpainting, an image could be expanded arbitrarily. Experiments show that an image can be effectively expanded by our method, and our outpainting method of predicting edges and then coloring is generally superior to other methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.},

A deep artificial neural network framework has been suggested for the task of relative attribute prediction in this article. The paper suggests to use a convolutional artificial neural network for learning the mentioned attributes through a peripheral auxiliary layer, called also a ranking layer, which is able to learn how to rank the images. A suitable ranking cost function is used to train the whole network in an end-to-end manner.

  abstract     = {In decision making, very often the data collected are with different extents of uncertainty. The recently introduced concept, Basic Uncertain Information (BUI), serves as one ideal information representation to well model involved uncertainties with different extents. This study discusses some meth ods of BUI aggregation by proposing some uncertainty transformations for them. Based on some previously obtained results, we at first define IOWA operator with poset valued input vector and inducing vector. The work then defines the concept of uncertain system, on which we can further introduce the multi-layer uncertainty transformation for BUI. Subsequently, we formally introduce MUT_IOWA aggregation procedure, which has good potential to more and wider application areas. A numerical example is also offered along with some simple usage of it in decision making.},

  abstract     = {Multilevel thresholding is one of the effective image segmentation methods. However, it faces three big challenges: (1) how to adaptively determine the number of multiple thresholds; (2) how to overcome the sensitivity to image noise; (3) how to perform multilevel thresholding under several segment ation requirements. In order to solve these problems, an adaptive multilevel thresholding algorithm based on multiobjective artificial bee colony optimization (AMT-MABCO) segmentation is presented for noisy image in this paper. To improve the robustness of AMT-MABCO to image noise, a line intercept histogram which considers both the intensity and coordinate information in the neighborhood of the pixels is firstly utilized to define a novel between-class variance function as one fitness function. Then, an interval-valued fuzzy entropy function is constructed as another fitness function to deal with the blurred characteristic in images. AMT-MABCO tries to obtain a compromising multilevel thresholding result under these two segmentation requirements. To adaptively determine the number of thresholds, a grouping population initialization and evaluation strategies are proposed in AMT-MABCO. Furthermore, two novel search equations are constructed in AMT-MABCO to generate candidate solutions in the employed bees and onlookers phases, respectively. Experimental results show that AMT-MABCO outperforms state-of-the-art thresholding methods in noise robustness and segmentation performance.},

  abstract     = {The flexible multi-task scheduling problem has been extensively investigated in manufacturing systems, and its objectives are often related to the quality of manufacturing services. However, energy-related objectives along with workload balance have rarely been considered. Thus, a novel bi-objectiv e optimization model is proposed to achieve green manufacturing. The Pareto-based fitness evaluation is employed to make a trade-off between total energy consumption and workload balance. Intermediate buffers are also considered, making the model more practical and more complicated. To solve the proposed model, a new three-stage genetic algorithm (3S-GA) is presented. A Pareto-based adaptive population size method is proposed to maintain the diversity of the population and ensure the convergence rate. To cope with the subtask sequencing complexity, a real-time sequence scheduling heuristic is explored to effectively initialize the subtask sequence to save the energy in manufacturing systems, which is designed by minimizing the standby time according to the laxity of subtasks. After a series of experimental designs based on the Taguchi method, a suitable parameter combination of the 3S-GA is utilized. Further, computational experiments based on five instances demonstrate that the 3S-GA outperforms other four baseline algorithms taken from the literature in solving the proposed bi-objective optimization model.},

Consequently, this paper aims to propose a novel method of detecting the JavaScript malware by using a high-level fuzzy Petri net (HLFPN). First, the web pages are crawled to get JavaScript files. Second, those main features are extracted from JavaScript files. In total, six main features of the JavaScript, including longest word size, entropy, specific character, commenting style, function calls, and abstract syntax tree (AST) features are collected. Finally, an HLFPN model is used to determine whether the malicious code is available or not. The experimental results have fully demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Epilepsy is a nervous disorder that causes arbitrary recurrent seizures within the cerebral cortex region of the encephalon. The early diagnosis of a seizure is important in clinical therapy. An automatic epileptic seizure detection method for electroencephalogram (EEG) signals can significantly en hance the patient’s life in clinical aspect. The proposed paper is principally based on a completely unique approach of epileptic seizure detection using Q-Tuned Wavelet Transform (QTWT) and Approximate entropy (ApEn). This work focuses by utilizing and testing the common sense of Extreme Learning Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System Model (EXL-ANFIS) which foresees the elements of the mind states as a trajectory that results in the seizure event. QTWT is used for decomposing EEG signals into sub-band frequency signals. Approximate entropy is carried out to those sub-band signals as a discriminatory function because of its indefinite disordered feature. The solutions obtained by directing towards EXL- ANFIS shows an incredible advancement in the perpetual performance outlay for the classification of an epileptic seizure. The proposed classification method is implemented on publicly available Bonn dataset. The outcome confirms that by combining extreme learning and ANFIS model improves the classification accuracy and decrease the feature dimension with reduced computational complexity. This method achieves 99.72% of classification accuracy over existing models.},

We model this framework as a discretely constrained problem and solve it by Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Different from previous approaches, the proposed method reduces not only model size but also computational operations. In experimental section, we evaluate the proposed framework on CIFAR datasets with several popular models such as VGG-7/16/19 and ResNet-18/34/50, which demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain low-bit networks and dramatically reduce redundant channels of the network with slight inference accuracy loss.

This research study presents a Fractional Order Fuzzy PID (FOFPID) controller for frequency control in microgrid. To test effectiveness of proposed controller, its performance is evaluated and compared with standard PID and Fuzzy PID (FPID) controller. To find optimal parameters of the FOFPID, Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) is employed. To illustrate the effectiveness of GSA, its outcome is compared with existing algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms. Further performance of each controller and optimizing method is assessed by looking at the fitness function value, statistical data, frequency deviation, amplitude and oscillations of control signal. Finally, the most optimized algorithm-based controller is tested for robustness against parameter variations and nonlinearities like Generation Rate Constraint (GRC).},

Currently, both aspects of cognition can only be assessed using paper-based psychometric tests. The methods however, are exposed to inconsistency issues due to the variation of examination format and lang uage barriers. Hence, this study proposes an intelligent system for assessing intelligence quotient (IQ) level and learning style from the resting brainwaves using artificial neural network (ANN). Eighty-five individuals from varying educational backgrounds have participated in this study. Resting electroencephalogram (EEG) is recorded from the left prefrontal cortex using NeuroSky. Control groups are established using Kolb’s Learning Style Inventory (LSI) and a model developed based on Raven’s Progressive Matrices (RPM). Subsequently, theta, alpha and beta power ratio is extracted from the pre-processed EEG. Distribution and pattern of features show a correlation with the Neural Efficiency Hypothesis of intelligence and Alpha Suppression Theory. The power ratio features are then used to train, validate and test the ANN model. The system has demonstrated satisfactory performance for IQ classification with accuracies of 98.3% for training and 94.7% for testing. The proposed model is also able to classify learning style with accuracies of 96.9% for training and 80.0% for testing.},

  abstract     = {Learning from high-dimensional imbalanced data is prevalent in many vital real-world applications, which poses a severe challenge to traditional data mining and machine learning algorithms. The existing works generally use dimension reduction methods to deal with the curse of dimensionality, then a pply traditional imbalance learning techniques to combat the problem of class imbalance. However, dimensionality reduction may cause the loss of useful information, especially for the minority classes. This paper introduces an ensemble-based method, HIBoost, to directly handle the imbalanced learning problem in high dimensional space. HIBoost takes into account the inherent high-dimensional hubness phenomenon, i.e., high-dimensional data tends to contain the singular points (hubs and anti-hubs) which frequently or rarely occur in k-nearest neighbors of other points. For the singular hubs and anti-hubs induced by high dimension, HIBoost introduces a discount factor to restrict the weight growth of them in the process of updating weight, so that the risk of over fitting can be reduced when training component classifiers. For class imbalance problem, HIBoost uses SMOTE to balance the training data in each iteration so as to alleviate the prediction bias of component classifiers. Experimental results based on sixteen high-dimensional imbalanced data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of HIBoost.},

  abstract     = {Obstacle avoidance is one of the essential and indispensable functions for autonomous mobile robots. Most of the existing solutions are typically based on single condition constraint and cannot incorporate sensor data in a real-time manner, which often fail to respond to unexpected moving obstacles in dynamic unknown environments. In this paper, a novel real-time multi-constraints obstacle avoidance method using Light Detection and Ranging(LiDAR) is proposed, which is able to, based on the latest estimation of the robot pose and environment, find the sub-goal defined by a multi-constraints function within the explored region and plan a corresponding optimal trajectory at each time step iteratively, so that the robot approaches the goal over time. Meanwhile, at each time step, the improved Ant Colony Optimization(ACO) algorithm is also used to re-plan optimal paths from the latest robot pose to the latest defined sub-goal position. While ensuring convergence, planning in this method is done by repeated local optimizations, so that the latest sensor data from LiDAR and derived environment information can be fully utilized at each step until the robot reaches the desired position. This method facilitates real-time performance, also has little requirement on memory space or computational power due to its nature, thus our method has huge potentials to benefit small low-cost autonomous platforms. The method is evaluated against several existing technologies in both simulation and real-world experiments.},

First, the Choquet integrals for nonnegative functions with respect to the credibility measure are introduced, and their properties are investigated such as the monotonicity and translatability. Then, the symmetric Choquet integrals and translatable Choquet integrals of any measurable functions are developed through the use of the Choquet integrals of nonnegative functions.

The ability to detect churn customers precisely is something that every company would wish to achieve. From different experiments on customer churn, it can be s een that customers always could be divided into different types and the customers in the same segment generally have similar personas, behavioral preferences, and focus points. Therefore, a hybrid classification model named ClusGBDT for customer churn prediction is proposed. This model has three steps: a feature transformation stage, a customer clustering stage, and a prediction stage. At first, the multi-layer perceptron is used to training a prediction model and replace the original attributes with low-dimensional vectors. Then, customer segments are divided using K-means. Lastly, the unique prediction model based on GBDT is constructed for every customer segment. Several measures are used to evaluate the prediction performance. From the experiments, it is observed that our design could improve original classification algorithms include GBDT, random forest and logistic regression. Additionally, the proposed framework helps us to comprehend customer data.},

This combination gave computing time much faster than computing time when using genetic algorithms SPEA/R. On the other hand, this combination also significantly reduces the num ber of samples needed for the training of deep artificial neural networks. This is the task of finding out an optimal set that changes with the engine velocity of multi-objective optimization involving 12 simultaneous optimization goals: proportional P, integral I, derivative D, additional integration n and differentiation orders m factor, displacement amplification coefficient KDloop, acceleration amplification coefficient KAloop in two controllers acceleration and displacement to enhance the ride comfort. This article has provided a control algorithm of a Cascade FOPID controller to control the acceleration and displacement of the mount. Besides, the article also offers solutions to optimize the 12 simultaneous parameters of the two controllers by the new hybrid method HDNN&amp;SPEA/R and suitable for the speed of rotation of the engine. To increase the safety factor in operation, we use magnetorheological dampers (MR) in a powertrain mounting system and a continuous state damper controller that calculates the input voltage to the damper coil. The results of this control method are compared with traditional PID systems, optimal PID parameter adjustment using genetic algorithms (GA) and passive drive system mounts. The results are tested in both time and frequency domains, to verify the success of the proposed Cascade FOPID algorithm. The results show that the proposed Cascade FOPID controller of the MR engine mounting system gives very good results in comfort and softness when riding compared to other controllers. This proposal has reduced 335 hours for optimal computation time and reduce vibration a lot.},

To investigate the ability of ILFMVO, we have solved a constrained economic dispatch problem with a non-smooth, non-convex cost functions of three, six, and twenty thermal generator systems and two design engineering problems with nonlinear objectives and complex nonlinear constraints.

However, it is subject to the profitability of economic organizations and resource specificity, slack resources are the main source of fulfilling corporate social responsibility; And d ue to differences in management systems of enterprises in different natures, there are significant differences in the level and path of using slack resources to fulfill corporate social responsibility. In order to deeply explore the impact level and internal mechanism of organizational slack on corporate social responsibility in China, this paper conducts empirical research on the panel data of 373 listed intelligent manufacturing companies in Chinese A-share from 2013 to 2017, from the perspective of property heterogeneity. The research results show that organizational slack is widespread and presents the characteristics of property heterogeneity. Non-state-owned companies tend to reserve more slack resources due to more strict resource constraints. Organizational slack has a positive effect on improving corporate social responsibility performance, and its transmission is to improve the level of corporate responsibility performance and increase the quality of social responsibility information disclosure, but will not promote enterprises to take social responsibility into strategic considerations. There is a heterogeneous difference in the level of influence of organizational slack on the fulfillment of corporate social responsibility. The effect is more significant on the State-owned companies, nevertheless, its mechanism of action is not affected by the heterogeneous conditions of property. The research conclusions of this paper could make contribution for government agencies to improving the legal system of corporate social responsibility, accelerating the reform of factor markets, and formulating different incentive policies of property rights for fulfilling corporate social responsibility.},

Currently, only a few domestic automobile enterprises can fully disclose their social responsibility information. Most automobile ent erprises fail to establish an effective and comprehensive mechanism for social responsibility management and information disclosure, and the concept of social responsibility has not been popularized and widely accepted by automobile enterprises. In order to solve the problem of externalization of internal costs incurred from personal and property safety of consumers and environmental pollution control which should be borne by automobile enterprises, and to promote the establishment and effective implementation of a social responsibility management system in the automobile industry, this study constructs a comprehensive China automobile CSR evaluation index system from four aspects, including CSR to government, CSR to employees, CSR to consumers and CSR to environment and community. In addition, this study makes a comprehensive comparison of the CSR of China’s automobile enterprises based on the synthetical evaluation method of Analytic Hierarchy Process and Grey Relation Analysis (AHP-GRA Model). The results show that: (1) under the influence of macro-economic control by the state, automobile enterprises, irrespective of being joint ventures, state-owned or private enterprises, hold the green development of firms in great account, especially corporate environmental governance; (2) the AHP-GRA Model can offer remedies to the single evaluation model, making up for its lack of accuracy and objectivity; (3) through a trend evaluation based on the AHP-GRA comprehensive evaluation model, a simple and reliable evaluation model is provided for the government, market and consumers to understand the current situation and future development of the CSR of China’s automobile enterprises in a comprehensive and objective way. The study shows that the AHP-GRA comprehensive evaluation model is feasible in the evaluation of social responsibilities of automobile enterprises, which covers the shortage of the single evaluation method, and provides new decision-making ideas and methods for the evaluation and optimization of social responsibility of automobile enterprises.},

  abstract     = {With continuously accelerated development of China’s urbanization, the price of commercial housing is also rising and the housing problem has become a hot issue in China’s social development at current stage. The affordable housing, as a means to guarantee the housing rights of medium- and low-inco me groups, has seriously insufficient attractiveness to the returns on project investment due to its non-profit nature. The social capital is unwilling to enter this field and thus leads to inadequate supply of affordable housing. Therefore, it is very necessary to establish an investment compensation mechanism for affordable housing construction. Based on decision theory and reasonable return principle, this study constructs an investment compensation model for construction of rental-type affordable housing based on satisficing decision. Finally, it uses the data of a public rental housing project in Beijing, China to conduct empirical analysis, quantifies all government subsidies and actually calculates the government compensation amount with the net present value of project as the decision goal. The results show that: (1) determining the reasonable profit rate of affordable housing developers is the key point to promote the investment and development of affordable housing; (2) investment compensation model for affordable housing construction based on satisficing decision can be used to objectively calculate the compensation amount payable to the affordable housing developer; (3) the private sector that invests in affordable housing should not passively wait for subsidies and preferential policies and measures of the government; instead, they should actively innovate in the profit model of affordable housing and promote the construction of affordable housing. The study shows that the investment compensation model for affordable housing based on decision function is good to judge the project feasibility. Compared with other models, it improves the model’s interpretation and prediction ability and provides new decision ideas and methods for the government and enterprises to develop and construct affordable housing.},

  abstract     = {In the background of high-quality development, production factors, productivity and total factor productivity all propose new high standards to enterprises. Research and development (R&amp;D) design stage is the source and key to assure high quality of enterprise products. The quality-induced loss of p roducts in R&amp;D design stage is significantly higher than that in manufacturing stage. Made in China 2025 brings a new opportunity and a higher challenge to China’s machinery manufacturing industry through transforming from low cost competitive advantages to quality-benefit advantages. As the fundamental products of machinery manufacturing industry, mechanical processing products can prevent flaws fundamentally by improving quality characteristics in R&amp;D design stage, thus saving R&amp;D cost effectively and improving product quality and reliability significantly. In this study, a robust design for quality characteristics of tap which is a typical representative of mechanical processing products was proposed. According to theoretical analysis of influencing factors of tap quality characteristics as well as the relevant quality fluctuation caused by influencing factors, its lifespan is the key quality characteristic in R&amp;D design stage. As the key to determine tap lifetime, cryogenic temperature was chosen with soaking time by decision-making and trial evaluation laboratory as two of the most important factors that influence cryogenic treatment in the present study. A functional model between tape lifetime and these two selected factors were constructed through the response surface methodology. Optimized by multivariant optimization process memorise algorithm, the best parameter combination for cryogenic treatment was obtained. Research demonstrates that robust design of product quality characteristics helps enterprises to make product quality better and more quickly, lower operation cost, and improve productivity, thus promoting the high-quality development of enterprises.},

Related studies since 1981 are divided into four development phases and continue to present an expanding trend. Related mainstream viewpoints are divided into three types, namely, the Mongol nationality, Tangut people in the Western Xia Dynasty, and the Han nationality. Research arguments focus on whether people with surname Yu in southwestern China are descendants of Genghis Khan in Mongolia. Future research emphasis and difficulty lies in identifying if people with surname Yu in southwestern China are descendants of Genghis Khan in Mongolia, combining historical truths by processing and analyzing the enormous family trees with the surname Yu.

As the flight crew is the last line of defense for aviation safety, how to identify and quantitatively evaluate human errors in flight and reduce the error rate has become an important issue for the civil aviation, and it is a lso the most effective way to control flight operation risks. Thus, the human error mechanism for pilot was investigated by the combine of the fault tree and the Bayesian network theories based on historical research data of typical unsafe events caused by flight human errors. Firstly, the fault tree was used to identify and qualitatively analyze the risk of systems, and then transformed into a Bayesian network model to obtain the relative probability of intermediate events and top events. Finally, the system hierarchy of unsafe events caused by flight human error was quantitatively evaluated. The results showed that there were 96 failure modes in the system, and the flight human error was caused by the coupling of multiple risk factors. The probability of non-technical skill loss is the highest, followed by that of the lack of technical skills and violations. The basic events in the organization, environment and equipment factors have a great impact on the flight human error, which is a weak link in the system. The results provide some theoretical basis for developing preventive measures of flight human error and improving the level of flight safety.},

In view of the low survival rate of high-tech innovating enterprises and high input and high risk of high-tech enterprises, it is of great significance to assess and evaluate the operating efficiency of the high-tech innovating enterprises. This study used the entropy weight method to establish a DEA -based business performance evaluation index model to evaluate and analyze the business performance of the listed new energy vehicles enterprises in China in 2018. The result shows that most of the new energy vehicles enterprises are in the state of increasing returns to scale, conforming to the characteristic of high growth of high-tech enterprises; however, the overall operational efficiency of these enterprises is very low and some of them face the problem of obvious scientific research input redundancy; therefore, the improper input-output framework is the main reason lead to the low scale efficiency for the enterprises and provide corresponding policy proposals for these problems.},

One of the important reasons is the lack of pertinent evaluation of green buildings. The current assessment of the economic benefits of green building design is still at a qualitative stage, and there is a lack of quantitative assessment methods and models. Based on this, this study establishes a green building design evaluation index system including cost and economic benefits. In the cost estimation, a nonlinear evaluation model based on data mining is designed to ensure a better estimation accuracy and credibility. In the evaluation of economic benefits, an incremental benefit evaluation model based on fuzzy mathematics is designed to evaluate its comprehensive economic benefits in a quantitative way. The results of data simulation show that the least squares support vector machine has achieved a good balance between the estimation time and accuracy. The comprehensive evaluation model proposed in this paper has strong operability and good evaluation effect, which is of great significance to promote the development of green building design.},

This study builds a technology innovation risk evaluation system for high-tech enterprises from eight dimensions: technology risk, capital risk, patent risk, talent risk, management r isk, policy risk, industrial risk, and market risk. Based on the subjective and fuzzy characteristics of the evaluation indicators, a risk evaluation model for technological innovation based on fuzzy evaluation was established, and an empirical study was conducted with a technological innovation project of a petrochemical company in Shanghai. The research results show that the high-tech enterprises’ technology innovation risk evaluation model constructed in this study has high accuracy for the quantification of technological innovation risk, and the technology innovation risk evaluation model is highly practical, which provides a reasonable basis for risk management decisions in the process of a high-tech company technology innovation.},

The main conclusions are as follows: (1) The ability to identify opportunity is the necessary condition affecting the high innovation activity of enterprises; the lack of internal innovation culture, the low innovation activity. (2) The driving mechanism of high EI activity can be divided into three paths, and the different configurations of the five factors can produce many paths to achieve such activity. (3) The driving mechanism of low EI activity can be divided into two paths, and it has an asymmetric causal relationship with the driving mechanism of high EI activity.

Among them, university teachers are playing a social function that is equivalent to the enterprise innovation and entrepreneurship, embedding in the spiral mechanism of regional entrepreneurship, industrial, and value chains. However, studies on the academic entrepreneurship performance of university teachers are limited. Therefore, from the academic entrepreneurship data of 10 university teachers with active academic entrepreneurship behavior in China from 2012 to 2016, this study analyzes the approximate dependence of the academic entrepreneurship performance input and output indicators of university teachers. The rough set fuzzy clustering analysis method is used for the first time to measure the importance of academic entrepreneurship input and output indicators of university teachers in the entire entrepreneurial performance indicator system. In addition, this study analyzes the fuzzy evaluation of the academic entrepreneurship performance of university teachers. The objectives are to eliminate the subjectivity of weight setting, reduce the scale of the index, and establish an objective and effective evaluation index system. Results show that among the attributes of the academic entrepreneurial input and output conditions of university teachers, financial salary input and research funding are the reductions of five entrepreneurial output decision attributes. Moreover, financial salary input and research funding are the most important indicators and have a two-factor relationship with entrepreneurial output. The number of spin-off companies should not be selected as an indicator of entrepreneurial performance due to the almost zero discernable relationship with entrepreneurial input.},

  abstract     = {As a common disease, migraine has a high incidence but the pathogenesis is still not clear. Resting-state Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) is an important research topic in the field of brain medicine, which can classify rs-fMRI data to automatically diagnose brain diseases. However, the original features of the rs-fMRI data are difficult to be extracted and the high-dimensional characteristics, which make the data analysis an extremely complicated task. Those have also plagued many researchers and bring great challenges to the existing pattern classification methods. Aiming at the high dimensionality of rs-fMRI data, in this paper, we propose a feature extraction approach based on the combination of neighborhood rough set and PCA, thereby improving the accuracy of migraine identification. Firstly, Resting-State fMRI Data Analysis Toolkit plus was applied for preprocessing, calculating three characteristic indices: Amplitude of Low Frequency Fluctuation (ALFF), Regional Homogeneity (ReHo) and Functional Connectivity (FC. The inter-group difference analysis was performed by two-sample T test and GRF correction. Then, correlation coefficient matrix original features extraction was performed by means of automatic anatomical label template (AAL). Finally, the original features were trained by the traditional classification algorithm in machine learning. The experimental results show that the propose approach can obtain good performance in predicting migraine.},

In this subject, fuzzy creative data sets and learning retrieval network are constructed for the sake of extracting original creative data effectively. And the logical correlations between creative objects are acquired dynamically based on the graph neural network. Creative objects and creative styles are generated by using generative adversarial nets technology and style transfer technology, respectively. Then, the projectiles, boundary markers and location words of the creative scene objects are generated by analyzing related attributes of each entity. After adjusting the layout, creative works are automatically generated. A fuzzy creative generating environment is implemented. Experimental results show that the screened number of AGMCFC method is about twice as much as that of manual method, and the accuracy rate of AGMCFC method is improved compared with the manual method. AGMCFC method performs well at creative generation of fuzzy ideas automatically.},

Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Differential Evolution (DE) both are simple evolutionary algorithms (EAs) which are proposed for single-objective optimization and both of them have been proved to be efficient methods for optimizing applications, however, there are still some weakness existing within them. A innovative evolutionary method named QUasi-Affine TRansformation Evolutionary (QUATRE) algorithm which is derived from, also tackles some weaknesses of PSO and DE algorithm, and obtains better performance on commonly used test suites. The key characteristic of QUATRE is that an automatically generated matrix named evolution matrix M is implemented in evolutionary process, which is taken as an alternative of employing the crossover rate CR. Here in this paper, we present a novel QUATRE variant, named IS-QUATRE, which can explore the search area in a better way comparison with the previous method, and relatively good optimization ability can be obtained by our proposed IS-QUATRE algorithm under CEC2013 test suit.

  abstract     = {Differential Evolution (DE) was an easy-coding and efficient stochastic algorithm for global optimization, and the whole optimization process simulates biological evolution. Superior individuals of the population that were suitable for the environment were retained during the evolution, and conseq uently the tolerable solutions could be obtained in the end. Despite the excellent performance of DE algorithm, there were still some shortcomings. For example, the general performance of DE depended largely on mutation strategy and control parameters, how to design the appropriate control parameters and mutation strategy were difficult tasks. Here a novel DE variant was proposed to overcome these shortcomings. By incorporating the depth information of previous generations of populations, a better diversity of trial vector candidates could be secured during the evolution process. Moreover, the thought that successful parameters should be retained to guide the update of themselves during the evolution was also incorporated into the novel algorithm. The optimization performance of the new proposed DE variant was verified under CEC 2013 test suit containing 28 benchmarks, and the results showed its competitiveness with several state-of-the-art DE variants.},

In this study, we present a stock evaluation function that outputs the size of the stock in each fixed period as well as the consequences of increasing or decreasing the size of one’s position. The difficulties involved in using machine learning to adjust stock weighting can be attributed to difficulties in obtaining definite answers via supervised learning. We therefore train our evaluation function using reinforcement learning via CNN within the EIIE network architecture and have the agent adjust the size of the position with the purpose of maximizing profits. Back testing was performed using the top 50 stocks in Taiwan, based on market capitalization. In experiments, most of the stock returns outperformed conventional strategies in terms of cumulative stock value.},

  abstract     = {Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) has wide application fields, such as sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and other sequential data processing. For efficient prediction, a growing number of model owners choose to deploy the trained GRU models through the machine-learning-as-a-service method (MLaaS). However, deploying a GRU model in cloud generates privacy issues for both model owners and prediction clients. This paper presents the architecture of PrivGRU and designs the privacy-preserving protocols to complete the secure inference. The protocols include base protocols and principal protocols. Base protocols define basic linear and non-linear computations, while principal protocols construct the gating mechanisms of GRUs. The main benefit of PrivGRU is to address privacy problems while enjoying the efficiency and convenience of MLaaS. The overall secure inference is performed on shares, which retain two properties of security: correctness and privacy. To prove the security, this work adopts Universal Composability (UC) framework with the honest-but-curious corruption model. As each protocol is proved to UC-realize the ideal functionality, it can be arbitrarily composed in any manner. This strong security feature makes PrivGRU more flexible and practical in future implementation.},

In this work, we present two biomedical concepts in a lexical vector space which is constructed with their inner and context concepts’ lexical information, and then utilize two vector’s cosine distance to measure similarity value. Then, we propose a compact Evolutionary Algorithm (cEA) to find the concept correspondences.

Teece (“Profiting from technological innovation: Implications for integration, collaboration, licensing and public policy”, Research Policy 15, 1986), the concept of “appropriability regime” – defined as the level of threat stemming from potential imitators in the firm’s environment– has been useful in describing specific sectoral patterns at the aggregate level. However, there have been few attempts to formally prove the impact of different regimes on knowledge management strategies at the firm-level. Using firm-level longitudinal data from software and hardware sectors in Spain, we show that differences in appropriability regimes condition the profitability of open innovation strategies, and also induce specific patterns in firms’ knowledge management strategies. More specifically, we show that the appearance of diminishing returns from an open innovation strategy is more accelerated in firms immersed in weaker regimes (i.e. firms facing more threats from potential imitators). We also show that this is due to the fact that such firms must resort to more complex (and costly) practices that go far beyond the legal protection of intellectual property, internalizing other management practices related to productive capacity and the commercialization of innovations.},

The main advantage of the linear regression IOWA operator is that it unifies the IOWA operator with the linear regression in the same formulation considering the degree of optimism and pessimism of the decision maker. Thus, we can under- or over- estimate the regression according to complex attitudes that the decision may have in the analysis. The work ends analyzing the applicability of this new approach in a problem regarding exchange rate forecasting. The objective of the new approach is to analyze the information in a more complete way.},

  abstract     = {Logistic regression as a modelling technique of rare binary dependent variables with much fewer events (ones) than non-events (zeros) tends to underestimate their probability of occurrence. The vast literature devoted to the prediction of rare binary data identifies several ways to improve predicti ve performance by making modifications to the likelihood estimation. We propose two weighting mechanisms for incorporation in a pseudo-likelihood estimation that improve the predictive capacity of rare binary responses in data collected in complex surveys. We multiply sampling weights by specific correctors that lead to lower root mean square errors for event observations in almost all deciles. A case study is discussed where this method is implemented to predict the probability of suffering a workplace accident in a logistic regression model that is estimated with data from a survey conducted in Ecuador.},

The methodology used to meet this objective is Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), a type of Artificial Neural Network that allows patterns to be grouped together according to their similari ty, enabling us to classify mutual funds into surviving funds and disappeared funds. We consider the following variables: age, size, investment flows, performance, volatility, and Morningstar rating. We use a sample of 1,617 Spanish mutual funds, of which 943 had disappeared between 2004 and 2016. The results obtained indicate that SOM accurately classifies 80% of mutual funds. Therefore, SOMs are effective instruments for classifying the disappearance of Spanish mutual funds and the variables used to define them can explain their survival capacity.},

The Bank Financial Strength ratings D + and below are used as a bank default indicator. Independent variables include 1-year and 5-year EDFs, one for the adverse selection effect and another for accounting ratios. Our results show that EDF metrics combined with four CAMEL covariates and the variable capturing adverse selection are able to predict the defaults of European banks up to 8 quarters before an event. When comparing the model with another only including the EDF indicator, the statistical significance improves considerably, suggesting that added variables provide additional information and power to the model. This study proposes possible improvements to the EWS which could be useful to identify inputs to incorporate in intelligent models.},

Fuzzy math tools are then used, by means of an endecadarian scale, to allow diverse experts to state the degree to which they agree on the possible outsourcing of a public service. In order to facilitate their decision-making, experts can offer a confidence interval of that degree.

  abstract     = {Models of economic behavior are based on the search for and establishing of relationships between the various economic variables included in the model. Generally speaking, those coefficients that appear in relationships between the model variables are specific values that are determined when the mo del is to be used to make a given prediction. In this article we propose incorporating fuzzy logic into the study of economic models via the incorporation of fuzzy numbers to express the coefficients relating the different variables. To develop this idea, we analyze a simplified model for determining national income in which it is assumed that, for the sake of equilibrium, said value is composed of consumption and investment. Also, by relating the consumption function to income, we analyze a relationship model between the variables. To obtain broader and more real information than that resulting from the application of classical models, we incorporate fuzzy logic by assuming the parameters that establish the degree of dependence between the variables to be fuzzy numbers with a known membership function. Depending on their form, we determine their respective membership function for national income.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a novel approach to the bank ranking process based on the possibilistic theory is proposed. Through this new method, the sensitivity of the results can be improved. Several methods are applied in order to rank the financial performance of Spanish Banks. Methods such as the Fuzzy Anal ytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) and fuzzy TOPSIS are integrated in the proposed model. Criteria and sub-criteria weights are computed based on the judgments of experts using FAHP. These weights and financial indicators are inputs of the fuzzy TOPSIS methods for ranking the banks. The financial ratios are based on the CAMEL rating system criteria. Moreover, the results from the application of several distance measurements (Vertex, Hamming and Euclidean) in fuzzy TOPSIS as well as a new measure based on the possibilistic theory are compared. Finally, the results obtained applying fuzzy TOPSIS show that they vary depending on the separate measure, so it is necessary to have different measures to be able to correct decision making.},

A surface reconstruction algorithm for three-dimensional medical images based on segmentation is proposed. It combines image segmentation with MC (marching cubes) algorithm organically, which can be based on the characteristics of different medical images. An appropriate segmentation method is used to segment different tissues accurately, and the result of segmentation is used to extract the isosurface accurately, which avoids the limitation that MC is only suitable for threshold segmentation. After the medical image is segmented by combining threshold and region growth, the segmentation results are input as the reconstructed data, and the improved algorithm of three-dimensional reconstruction is realized. The medical image is rendered on three-dimensional surface, and the debugging results of the software are displayed. At the same time, a cube detection method based on region growing is adopted to improve the efficiency of surface tracking. Experiments show that this algorithm can improve the reconstruction speed and display effect.},

There is a big difference in the morphology of pleural effusion cancer cells, and uncertainty, so the edge detection algorithm is improved, with the simulated edge detection method used to extract information. After image segmentation, feature extraction is of vital importance for cell image classification. A method of block statistics based on Gabor coefficient is proposed. Firstly, the cell image is filtered by multi-scale and multi-directional filtering, then the average and variance are calculated, and the image is divided into several blocks to solve the problem of large amount of data. Finally, BP neural network is established to input the morphological characteristics of hydrothorax cells, and the results are classified directly.

Therefore, it can be concluded that the concept of fuzzy mathematics is applied to cartographic generalization. Fuzzy mathematics can deal with this kind of fuzziness better, which makes cartographic generalization possible to use more map information.

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of the economy, the demand for urban land resources is also growing. How to make more rational use of land resources and make more rational planning of cities become a major problem in current economic development. At present, the use of remote sensing images to classify urban land use areas has become a research hot spot. However, the traditional classification accuracy rate using the maximum likelihood classification method needs to be improved. How to improve the classification accuracy rate of urban land use area of remote sensing image has become the focus and key of the research. Both rough sets and fuzzy sets are mathematical methods for dealing with uncertain problems. The rough fuzzy sets generated by the combination of the two can solve the problem of information loss due to the rough set discretization process. Based on the advantages of fuzzy rough sets, this paper applies fuzzy rough sets to the study of urban land use area classification of remote sensing images, so as to improve the accuracy of urban land use area classification of remote sensing images. Firstly, the spectral features and texture features of the remote sensing image are extracted after preprocessing the remote sensing image. Secondly, using the domain relationship fuzzy rough set reduces the extracted features. Finally, the support vector machine is used to classify the reduced feature set, and the classification of urban land use area is realized. In the simulation experiment, the classification accuracy is evaluated by the overall classification accuracy, Kappa coefficient, and single class classification success index. The evaluation data shows that the fuzzy rough set is applied to the remote sensing image urban land use area classification, which has a good application effect.},

Also, it can continuously accumulate and increase the data, as well as improving the learning accuracy. Incremental learning technology correctly processes, retains, and utilizes the historical results, thereby reducing the training time of new samples by using historical results. Therefore, the clustering algorithm mostly clusters the cluster-liked shape of discrete datasets and uses the hierarchical clustering algorithm, which is more suitable for measuring the similarity of time series, to replace the Euclidean distance for distance metric and hierarchical clustering. The distance matrix update method is improved to reduce the computational complexity, which proves that the algorithm has higher clustering validity and reduces the operating time of the algorithm.},

During the motions, the 6-DOF industrial robots have weak avoidance ability toward the encountered obstacles, which is not conducive to the safe production and will reduce industrial efficiency. Therefore, by analyzing and summarizing the previous researches, the fuzzy control algorithm is used to construct and optimize the kinematics model, thereby proposing a method of robot motion path planning.

The fuzzy system begins at the macro level and covers the fuzzy features of human brain thinking. It has advantages in describing advanced knowledge. Fuzzy se ts can mimic the comprehensive conclusions of people solving fuzzy information problems, which are difficult to solve by conventional mathematical methods, so computer applications can be extended to humanities, social sciences and complex systems. In this way, it can better solve nonlinear problems and is widely used in automatic control, decision analysis, time series signal processing, economic information systems, medical diagnostic systems, and earthquake prediction systems. This paper aims to study the data mining algorithm of fuzzy systems based on fuzzy sets. By using the powerful fuzzy data modeling function of fuzzy theory, it combines with other intelligent processing methods, and makes practical use in industrial life. By comparing the application of fuzzy set data mining and algorithm, it is found that in the application state, the economic benefits of the factory are improved by 36% and the production efficiency is improved by 25% under the application of data mining and algorithm. The research data shows that the data mining and recommendation algorithms of fuzzy sets are beneficial to the development and operation of the factory. The research results show that compared with the conventional production and processing plan, the technology uses fuzzy set theory to transform the fuzzy attributes, which is more advantageous in scientific and technical systems and algorithms with its scientificity, accuracy, innovation and extensiveness.},

Accompanying this is the geometric growth of information contained in Web pages. Web text data in Bayesian networks usually hide rich knowledge and rules of user value. However, due to the semi-structured, real-time and discrete characteristics of Web text data, it is difficult for users to obtain the knowledge they need directly from such complex data sets. The emergence of fuzzy mathematics provides a good research idea and method for solving such problems. It can use the idea of fuzzy mathematics to analyze the practical problems in text data. Therefore, how to effectively mine the Web text data information and knowledge that users really care about from Bayesian network, and present it in a way that users can understand, it is a very popular research topic at present. In this paper, we select the text of Bayesian network: microblog data for experiments. User data model of microblog is established by using relevant knowledge of fuzzy theory. The concept of fuzzy measure is introduced to calculate the non-additive measure value under the interaction relationship between the detection indicators. Determine the membership function relationship between the detection user and the text data, calculate the integral values of Choquet integral, Sugeno integral and Wang integral of the membership function under the non-additive measure, the final valuable web text data is judged by integral value. On the basis of the above research contents, the research results of Web text mining technology and fuzzy arithmetic mathematics are combined, design and implement information acquisition and analysis for Bayesian network community.

It is often impossible to correctly analyze the valuable information contained in the data, and it becomes more difficult to obtain valuable information. Therefore, it faces the status of “ric h data and scarce knowledge”. Traditional information processing technology can no longer meet the needs of reality. There is an urgent need for more capable and effective information processing skills to help us analyze the information we need from big data and guide us to make the right decisions. Data mining technology is born in the background. Data mining technology is one of the effective methods to solve rich data and improve lack of knowledge. It is also one of the main research topics in the field of information science. Related research and applications have greatly improved people’s decision-making ability. It has been recognized as one of the extremes of data research and has a very broad application prospect. Large databases often contain redundant and unnecessary attributes for many search rules, so the ability to remove duplicate attributes can greatly improve the clarity of potential system knowledge and reduce the time complexity of finding rules. At the same time, it enables efficient operation and improved adaptability. Because the structure of the neural network is variable, it has strong self-organization, self-learning, nonlinearity and high fault tolerance, but the ability to express and interpret knowledge is very poor. The network parameters lack physical meaning and learning. Therefore, it has become an inevitable trend to form a fuzzy neural network combining the characteristics of the two. Therefore, exploring the organic combination between rough sets and fuzzy neural networks is undoubtedly of great significance for data mining technology research. This paper proposes a data mining method based on the combination of rough set and fuzzy neural network technology. Using the approximate set to discover the rules of the database rules, the initial structure of the fuzzy neural network is determined, and the training data is used to train the network. Since the fuzzy neural network thus constructed has a good topology of data distribution features from the beginning, the network scale can be greatly reduced and the network training speed can be improved.},

Due to the interference of lights and other light sources, the gray value of the background area also changes frequently. A common method during the day is to detect these background areas as moving vehicles, which greatly reduces the detection accuracy. The most reliable information at night is the headlights. If the light can be accurately detected and other sources are excluded, accurate detection can be performed and tracking accuracy can be guaranteed. Vehicle safety assisted driving technology is one of the main research directions of intelligent transportation systems. It mainly uses computer technology, sensor technology and communication technology to collect and analyze the state information of roads, other vehicles and drivers. Provide advice and warnings to the driver before reaching the danger, determine current traffic conditions and avoid traffic accidents in advance. This paper studies some problems of night vehicle target recognition and detection, mainly the division of target and background, and the classification and recognition of target extraction. To solve these problems, a particle filter algorithm is introduced to introduce nonlinear statistics. The fuzzy theory is introduced to classify the video processed by the particle filter algorithm. The target recognition is realized by the method, and the purpose of identifying the night vehicle target is achieved. Comparative experimental analysis shows that this method is more accurate and powerful than the common target recognition algorithm and can be applied to real scenes.},

The purpose of this paper is to realize the evaluation of the reform effect of AVG comprehensive practice in digital media art through fuzzy theory. In this paper, the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method is used to comprehensively evaluate the AVG practice of digital media art. Because the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method is very restrictive to the index weight, it cannot be well adapted to the system. In this paper, the processing scheme of the index weight value of the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method is interval data, so that the algorithm can be better applied in the system. In the determination of weight, this paper uses the improved entropy weight method to determine the weight of the index. By comparing with other algorithms that obtain the weight of the index, it can be concluded that using the improved entropy weight method to obtain the weight value can not only effectively reduce the external interference. Moreover, the weight value obtained can well reflect the importance of the indicator. The experimental results show that the dynamic variability of fuzzy set theory can satisfactorily meet the comprehensiveness and reliability of AVG comprehensive practice reform evaluation results.

Most of the exist ing researches rely on the signal strength to train heuristic models, while the relationship between intrusion targets and signal fluctuations is not explored fully. In this circumstance, this paper proposes a novel indoor intrusion detection method based on fuzzy membership degree and Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST). First of all, the correlation between WLAN signal fluctuation features and locations of intrusion targets are converted into DST mass function by fuzzy membership. Second, the reliability values from each MP are combined to select reliable reference positions by using the reliability combination rules in DST. Finally, the positions of the intrusion target are calculated based on the weighted maximum likelihood and centroid method. Finally, the related experimental results show that the proposed approach can not only ensure the high accuracy of intrusion detection but also obtain ideally accurate locations of the intrusion target.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we derive out an analytical result towards fuzzy error bound of indoor Neighbor Matching based Positioning Algorithm (NMPA). First of all, in a typical Line-of-sight (LOS) environment, we utilize the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation approach to obtain the fuzzy membership of the target in fingerprint matching. Second, we present an analysis of the theoretical relationship between the positioning error of NMPA and different environmental parameters. Third, we work out the fuzzy closed form solution to the positioning error of NMPA concerning the size of environment, the spacing of Reference Points (RPs), number of neighbors, and positions of Access Points (APs). Finally, relevant experiments verify that the fuzzy error bound proposed in this paper can reflect the influence of different factors of the environment on the performance of the positioning system, thereby, the positioning accuracy can be improved and the deployment costs can be reduced by optimizing the environmental parameters.},

  abstract     = {The complex-value-based generalized Dempster–Shafer evidence theory, also called complex evidence theory is a useful methodology to handle uncertainty problems of decision-making on the framework of complex plane. In this paper, we propose a new concept of belief function in complex evidence theor y. Furthermore, we analyze the axioms of the proposed belief function, then define a plausibility function in complex evidence theory. The newly defined belief and plausibility functions are the generalizations of the traditional ones in Dempster–Shafer (DS) evidence theory, respectively. In particular, when the complex basic belief assignments are degenerated from complex numbers to classical basic belief assignments (BBAs), the generalized belief and plausibility functions in complex evidence theory degenerate into the traditional belief and plausibility functions in DS evidence theory, respectively. Some special types of the generalized belief function are further discussed as well as their characteristics. In addition, an interval constructed by the generalized belief and plausibility functions can be utilized for fuzzy measure, which provides a promising way to express and model the uncertainty in decision theory.},

Can diagnose the degree of malignancy of ischemic optic neuropathy as quickly as possible, and can take an effective treatment plan for the patient early.Therefore, image segmentation of ischemic optic neuropathy based on fuzzy clustering theory is particularly important for the diagnosis of disease in patients. This paper analyzes the research status of medical image segmentation at home and abroad and the development trend in this aspect in China. Discussed the fuzzy C-means clustering (FCM) image segmentation algorithm in depth, studied the effects of iterative cutoff error, initial clustering center, number of clustering categories and fuzzy weighted index on the practical application of the algorithm. At the same time, the traditional algorithm is not sensitive to the spatial information of the image, making the algorithm sensitive to noise. Firstly, introduced the spatial information of the image, and introduced the algorithm based on spatial information constraint, Based on the above description and based on the neighborhood properties described by the two-dimensional histogram, studied and proposed a relatively easy to understand multidimensional distance measurement method. That is, the two-dimensional pixel value and the neighborhood pixel value viewpoint that can be updated in the two-dimensional direction, by setting a clustering objective function, a clustering measurement method includes neighborhood information. Through the above two-dimensional image segmentation algorithm based on neighborhood spatial information, proposed an image segmentation algorithm for ischemic optic neuropathy of fuzzy kernel clustering theory combined with spatial information. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can show excellent results in ischemic neuropathy image segmentation, and the algorithm has faster convergence speed and higher classification accuracy. Experimental results of artificial images and actual images show that the algorithm has strong noise immunity and practicability.},

Therefore, in order to improve the conventional algorithm, an image segmentation algorithm based on fuzzy C-means clustering (FCM) algorithm is propo sed in this study. Through the information of the gray-scale distribution histogram, the proposed algorithm divides the different wave-peak regions, where the pixels are relatively concentrated, into different clusters to determine the number of clusters. In addition, the gray values of these clusters are calculated to determine the initial cluster center. Next, the calculation results are used as the input of the FCM algorithm to complete the clustering segmentation of FCM. The research results show that the algorithm proposed in this study avoids the human participations of the traditional FCM algorithm. Also, based on the original algorithm, the proposed algorithm can reduce the calculation iterations, thereby improving the computational efficiency and obtaining the number of clusters with reference significance. As the results indicate, the proposed algorithm can better describe the fuzzy information in the image, thereby avoiding the problem of classifying the pixels into one category. Besides, the exponential function is used to control the influence weight of the neighboring pixels, and the adaptive weighting of the pixel grayscale is realized to improve the calculation accuracy of pixel grayscale and realize the image segmentation.},

As a branch of the swarm intelligence optimization algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) provides a new power and direction for the development of image segmentation. However, the algorithm has a large probability of loss of particle diversity in the late stage, which makes the algorithm converge prematurely. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to improve the problem existing in the PSO algorithm and apply the improved algorithm in image segmentation. In this paper, the whole population of PSO algorithm is divided into multiple sub-populations and co-evolution. The mutation operation from the genetic algorithm is introduced at the same time.

Update, and then carry out simulation experiments on some classical test functions.

Actual image processing is generally mixed with noise. How to eliminate the false edge caused by noise interference and ensure the accuracy of edge positioning, it becomes an important problem to be solved in edge detection and is also the purpose of this paper. Firstly, a histogram matching image enhancement algorithm based on maximum fuzzy entropy dynamic improvement is proposed. The algorithm first maps gray scale images from the spatial domain to the fuzzy domain, the target image is divided into several gray layers based on maximum fuzzy entropy. And then, for the characteristics of different gray levels, histogram matching method is used to design corresponding matching function for each gray layer. These matching functions are used to enhance the corresponding gray layer to obtain the enhanced image. Image enhancement method combines fuzzy entropy and histogram matching algorithm, it can effectively suppress noise and improve image contrast ratio. Secondly, an image edge detection algorithm based on improved fuzzy theory is proposed. This algorithm uses the improved fuzzy enhancement algorithm to enhance the original image. The non-maximum suppression algorithm is used to process the enhanced image; the optimal threshold value is obtained by fuzzy extraction and maximum inter-group variance method. This algorithm is used for edge detection of image. Experiments show that the algorithm is feasible and effective, and has some advantages.},

  abstract     = {With the establishment and development of technologies and theories such as computer technology, image processing, pattern recognition and artificial intelligence, image analysis systems have gradually become one of the methods of automatic quantitative analysis and testing in the medical field. H owever, the current technology is limited to the objectivity and comprehensiveness of blood edge detection, and no detection method with high accuracy can be found. In order to accurately and effectively detect the blood color of the color ultrasound image, this paper classifies the image feature extraction method, and simulates the classical differential algorithm, mathematical morphology algorithm and fuzzy Pal.King. In the following, the classical canny algorithm and its improved algorithm and the improved fuzzy Pal.King algorithm are introduced in detail. Finally, the simulation results are obtained. Among the indicators tested, DD has the highest accuracy. In the curve analysis, the FI value of FIB was &gt; 0.05, the area under the curve of FDP was 67.9%, the sensitivity was 64%, and the specificity was 59%. In this paper, the quantitative analysis of the image feature extraction effect is given by the calculation results, and the subjective and objective unity is achieved. At the same time, the improved algorithm proposed in this paper is applied to the evaluation system for analysis and summary, and the results obtained are consistent with the theoretical analysis.},

  abstract     = {With the development of society, health has attracted more and more attention. Heart disease is a common and frequently occurring disease, and it is fatal. Rapid and timely diagnosis and treatment of heart disease is very important. Electrocardiogram (ECG) reflects human heart health and is widely used in heart disease examination. Existing methods depending on doctors’ personal experience and diagnostic level are time-consuming and inefficient. Therefore, a classification method that can automatically analyze ECG is required. Aiming at the classification of 12-lead ECG, based on the good performance of convolution neural network, this paper proposes a method of ECG classification based on lead convolution neural network, which can effectively and accurately detect, recognize and classify ECG. First, the image features are extracted after the ECG is preprocessed, and then using the fuzzy set reduces the extracted ECG image features. Then, residual learning is used to optimize the convolutional neural network, and in order to ensure that the network is easy to train and fast convergence, a random parameter initialization method is introduced to achieve better classification results. The simulation results show that the proposed multi-lead filtering algorithm reduces the loss of useful information while eliminating noise; at the same time, the convolution neural network can effectively and accurately classify ECG images; and the introduction of residual network can improve the classification effect.},

  abstract     = {With the development of technology, fingerprint identification has become an effective means of personal identification, and has been widely used in the fields of public security, custom, banking, network security and other areas requiring identification. Nowadays, many effective methods have been proposed for fingerprint identification, but these methods are not effective in identifying damaged fingerprints, and the correct recognition rate is low. In order to effectively solve the problem of identification and classification of damaged fingerprints, this paper proposes a method for classification of broken fingerprints based on deep learning fuzzy theory. Firstly, after pre-processing the fingerprint, using the bifurcation point and the endpoint in the broken fingerprint image as the minutiae, the feature extraction ability of the deep convolutional neural network is utilized to extract the feature of the damaged fingerprint minutiae. Secondly, the fuzzy rough set is used to reduce the feature. Finally, using the reduced feature uses the Softmax classifier to classify the damaged fingerprint image. The simulation results show that, after preprocessing the damaged fingerprint image, using OPTA algorithm to refine the damaged fingerprint image, the features of the fingerprint image can be extracted effectively by deep convolutional neural network, and then the classification accuracy can be improved by using Softmax classifier to reduce the features.},

  abstract     = {Image steganography provides efficient techniques and methods for embedding secure data into an image. Researchers face many challenges in this field such as: ensuring the quality of the stego image is adequate, ensuring the hidden message is secure, increasing the hiding capacity, recovering the h idden message and the cover image losslessy, and overcoming the effects of lossy image compression on the hidden message. In this paper, we address the above challenges by proposing a new image steganography model to ensure the security of data in cloud storage. The fundamental processes within the base level of the proposed model are to preprocess both the cover image and the secret message. The cover image is transformed to the wavelet domain using integer-to-integer transform while the secret message is compressed using lossless entropy coding and then it is encrypted for additional security before embedding. The control level of the model drives the steganography process as follows. Firstly, it selects significant coefficients from the transformed cover image according to some threshold values. Then, it creates groups of 7-bits and 3-bits from non-lossy bits of selected significant coefficients and the encrypted bit stream of the secret message, respectively. Finally, the non-lossy bits in the selected significant coefficients are updated by injecting the secret bits. Through the process of steganography, the consistency between the payload of the secret message and the number of selected significant coefficients is checked. The model is validated and verified using extensive real experiments. Moreover, the performance of the proposed model is measured by comparison with other recent models.},

To address these issues, this paper proposes a methodology for sender oriented anti-spamming that identifies and filters spam at its origin, thus not only discourages spam but also reduces the resource wastage. To the best of our knowledge, addressing this wastage by spam has not been done before. Along with blocking spam at origin, this research proposes a diagonal hash algorithm to optimize image spam filtering, and email hash token generator to promote email authentication and discourage zombie accounts.

  abstract     = {Aiming at the problem of mainline congestion and ramp queue spill in urban expressway, an optimized on-ramp control method based on reinforcement learning is put forward. Online reinforcement learning algorithm is used to optimize on-ramp control regulation by taking the metering rate as the action , the length of ramp queue, the throughput and the occupancy rate of the interweaving area as the state, and the volume of the road network as the reward function. By iterating the value function with actual behavior, the proposed method can avoid the establishment of an accurate traffic model and the reliance on prior knowledge. Meanwhile, the real-time update of the value function Q compensates for the defect of control hysteresis. Compared with the classical method in simulation scenarios of Nanjing Kazimen Expressway, the average delay of the proposed method is reduced by 16.83%, the total delay reduced by 15.83%, the average speed enhanced by 6.80%, and the total travel time decreased by 5.22%; the average queue length of the on-ramp decreased by 89%; the average occupancy rate of the weaving area is decreased by 2.42% at rush hours, and the average traffic volume increased by 109veh/h.},

Aiming at the problem that the accuracy of the traditional calibration algorithm is greatly affected by the initial value, a parameter calibration algorithm based on hybrid WOA-LM algorithm is proposed. This algorithm can dynamically fuse levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm with Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA). By making full use of the global search ability of WOA algorithm and the local optimization ability of LM algorithm, the problems of traditional algorithm relying on the initial value, easy to fall into local convergence, low WOA algorithm’s calibration efficiency and calibration results are solved. Compared with WOA method, Li method, and the two-step method, this method has better performance. Simulation and experimental results show that this method can optimize all parameters of the star sensor with high accuracy and efficiency.},

WHO organization has reported that 1 in every 12 women could be subjected to a breast abnormality during her lifetime. To increase survival rates, it is found that early detection of breast tumor is very critical. Mammography-based breast cancer screening is the leading technology to achieve this aim. However, it still can not deal with the cases where the tumor size less than 2mm. Thermography-based breast cancer detection methods can address this problem. In this paper, a breast cancer detection method is proposed. The proposed method is consists of four phases: (1) Image Pre-processing using homomorphic filtering, (2) Region of interest (ROI) Segmentation using K-mean clustering, (3) feature extraction using signature boundary, and (4) classification using Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The proposed method is evaluated using the public dataset DMR-IR. Different activation functions in ELM are evaluated. The obtained results founded that “Tribas” is the best activation function under different experiments. It produced an accuracy result of 95.94% while talking 0.0469 second to detect the existence of malignant tumor, benign tumor or normal image. These promising results would be useful to develop thermography-based breast cancer detection system.},

  abstract     = {The k-NN algorithm is an instance-based learning algorithm which is widely used in the data mining applications. The core engine of the k-NN algorithm is the distance/similarity function. The performance of the k-NN algorithm varies with the selection of distance function. The traditional distance/ similarity functions in k-NN do not perfectly handle the mix-mode words such as when one string has multiple substrings/words. For example, a two-word string of “Employee Name”, a one-word string of “Name” or more than one word such as, “Name of Employee”. This ambiguity is faced by different distance/similarity functions causing difficulties in finding the perfect match of words. To improve the perfect-match calculation functionality in the traditional k-NN algorithm, a new similarity distance metric is developed and named as word-distance (w-distance). The perfect match will help us to identify the exact required value. The proposed w-distance is a hybrid of distance and similarity in nature because it is to handle dissimilarity and similarity features of strings at the same time. The simulation results showed that w-distance has a better impact on the performance of the k-NN algorithm as compared to the Euclidean distance and the cosine similarity.},

However, most of this research was executed in developed countries while under-developed and developing countries got little atten tion. The main objective of this study is to assess the impact of critical factors on the success of software projects for under-developed countries (like Pakistan), because enterprise environmental factors along with staff working habits, their experience and expertise level also have an impact on the success of a project. To accomplish this, a survey was conducted through the Pakistan Software Export Board (PSEB), and logistic regression enquiry was executed to measure the relationship between various factors affecting software. The results reflect that improper planning along with wrong cost and time estimation are positively and significantly associated with software failure. Based on the finding of the survey, a model is proposed for intelligent decision support system (IDSs). The proposed model keeps track of the previous knowledge and behavior in a well-structured manner that might be helpful for project managers in the estimation and decision-making process of upcoming software projects. This research adds new knowledge from an under-developed country which will open new dimensions for the IT industry and project manager working under similar circumstances.},

In PS, while their amplitudes s tay uncorrelated, the position between two coupled chaotic (or hyperchaotic) systems remains in step with each other. The absence of the sum of relevant variables can characterize APS. To study PS and APS with complex variables of hyperchaotic nonlinear systems, the active control technique on the basis of stability analysis is proposed. PS and APS investigations for high dimensional systems are demonstrated by studying a 6-dimensional Lü system. Phase synchronization concerns were also used to construct a straightforward and simple secure communication application.

In this paper, we present a novel algorithm to enhance the security of data using a hybrid model which uses an adaptive encoding technique alongside Chaotic Hopfield Neural Network. The proposed computation upgrades the security of a key shared between any nodes. Our experimental results show that the security of transmitted data is better than traditional algorithms. Moreover, we also show that the computational time for the proposed algorithm is less than known traditional algorithms.},

The cost reduction and the richer information of RGB-D images make the research of gesture recognition based on RGB-D images more and more. However, the current gesture process ing methods for RGB-D images still can not fully utilize the information contained. Aiming at the above problems, this paper studies the feature extraction method of RGB-D image, and proposes a multimodal and multilevel feature extraction method. By extracting multimodal and multilevel image features for mapping and splicing, the utilization of RGB-D image information and the accuracy in recognition are improved effectively. Finally, the experiments verified the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method based on the self-built gesture database. Compared and analyzed with several other RGB-D processing methods, the processing method of this paper is more advanced and effective, and can achieve better results in gesture recognition.},

Specifically, these heterogeneous TCLs are composed of lots of homogeneous load clusters and each one can be modeled by a TISO (third-inp ut single-output) aggregate model with the aggregate power being the output, and the changes of ambient/setpoint temperature and the ramping rate of the setpoint temperature being inputs. According to the aggregate model of the TCL cluster, a distributed leader-following communication protocol is proposed such that each cluster just needs to communicate with its neighbors and partial clusters are connected to the load agent, and then the aggregate power tracking problem can be solved in a distributed way. Finally, numerical results are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed aggregate tracking algorithm.},

However, as the n umber of users increases in the cloud, the service complexity and new security challenges take place. Data security is one of the major issues, which blocks users from adopting cloud. In this paper, we conducted a detailed literature review divided into two categories i.e. Single/multi-cloud data security issues and data security techniques used to secure the data in cloud virtual environment. We worked hard to find out the limitations of the existing data security solutions. This effort may help the research community to analyze single and multi-cloud in more details.},

Predictive analytics is the process of using data along with analysis, statistics, and machine learning techniques to create a predictive model for forecasting future events. Predictive analytics is often discussed in the context of big data as businesses apply algorithms to derive insights from large datasets using a framework like Hadoop, HDFS, and Spark. Building MATLAB-based framework for data analytics applied to Hajj dataset is the main aim of this research paper. The proposed framework is mainly relying on four main concepts; namely the cloud-based Internet of things (IoT), fog, Edge-of-Things (EoT), and predictive analytics. This proposed framework helps in reducing the amount of data sent, lowering network traffic, increasing bandwidth, and reducing power energy consumption. On top that, the framework including regression has the potential to predict how likely Hajj is susceptible to illness or even death.},

Therefore, in this paper, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to optimize the center value and the width value of the radial basis function in the RBF neural network. And the author uses the EMG signal acquisition device and the electrode sleeve to collect the four-channel continuous EMG signals generated by eight consecutive gestures. Then, the author performs noise reduction and active segment detection based on the summation, and extracts the well-known 5 time domain features. Finally, the data obtained are normalized and divided into training set and test set to train and test the classifier.

Firstly, some indicators such as the current ratio, quick ratio, asset-liability ratio, accounts receivable turnover rate, and other indicators taken from the solvency, operating capacity, profitability, and growth capacity of a company are selected to set up an AMBD constraint system. Then, the principal component analysis method is used to achieve the classification of the constraints of the AMBD. Finally, by combining particle swarm optimization with ant colony optimization, the optimal accounting model is obtained through iteration. Experimental results show that the proposed method has high efficiency and user satisfaction, and achieves a high coefficient of rationality.

  abstract     = {The process of cyanobacteria bloom in rivers and lakes is a highly non-stationary and non-linear process. The existing cyanobacterial bloom prediction method mainly uses time series model and single intelligent model, but time series model and single intelligent model cannot effectively explain the cyanobacterial bloom generation process, and the prediction accuracy is not high. In view of the above deficiencies, this paper proposes to use the cyanobacteria bloom spatiotemporal sequence data for modeling. Considering the characteristics of large-scale nonlinear trend term and small-scale residual term in the cyanobacteria bloom spatial-temporal sequence, the deep belief networks is used to model and explain the large-scale nonlinear trend term of the cyanobacteria bloom spatiotemporal sequence. Then use the time autocorrelation model and the multivariate spatiotemporal autocorrelation model to model and interpret the small-scale residual term; finally, after superimposing the large-scale nonlinear trend term and the small-scale residual term, the adaptive neuro-fuzzy system model is used to predict the chlorophyll a value of the water. Therefore, a fuzzy spatial and temporal sequence prediction method based on fuzzy expert system is proposed. The model verification results show that compared with the existing time series model and single intelligent model, the method can more fully explain the non-stationary and nonlinear dynamic changes of the cyanobacterial bloom spatial-temporal sequence. It provides a new method for accurately predicting cyanobacteria bloom in rivers and lakes.},

Hence, compressive sensing solves the contradictions among massive sampling data, signal processing spe ed and hardware equipment in the framework of traditional Shannon’s sampling theorem. In this study, as a means of compressive sensing, a new failure recognition method of rolling bearing based on the characteristic parameters of compressed data and fuzzy-C mean (FCM) clustering is proposed. In this method, kurtosis, variance and waveform factor are used as the characteristic parameters. Using the proposed method, the sensitive characteristics were extracted by using the compressed information directly, and the eigenvectors of the sample signals were classified and identified through FCM clustering. In the experiment, the proposed method was compared with different compressed matrix methods and the traditional signal acquisition methods under the same axis diameter and different axis diameters. The results demonstrated the improved performance of the proposed method compared to the other methods.},

  abstract     = {Sensor-based human activity recognition has a wide range of applications including caring the elderly, helping chronic patients, fitness, etc. As a new kind of single-layer feedforward network, extreme learning machine (ELM) has faster training speed and stronger generalization performance, which p rovides an effective technique for activity recognition. However, due to the random determination of input weights and hidden deviations, the ELM may converge to a local minimum in some cases. Therefore, in order to overcome the shortcomings of ELM and design a reliable and accurate recognition system, this paper proposes a multi-classifier recognition framework which utilizes extreme learning machines optimized by quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) as the base classifiers. The quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization was used to select the optimal parameters of base ELMs which are trained on different attribute characteristics. The proposed approach is assessed with two inertial sensor data sets. Comparative experiments with other optimization methods indicated that QPSO-ELM has better accuracy performance for inertial sensor-based human activityrecognition. The experiment showed that the proposed ensemble QPSO-ELM recognition method achieves an accuracy of 96.4% for recognizing six activities.},

The financial management information is collected through a data collection method that ensures high efficiency and high stability. In the process of accessing, the semantic ontology is formed, and the access group in the time domain is classified by the support vector machine method to improve the access speed. The repetitive data model is established, and the deduplication processing is realized by the fractional Fourier transform technique combined with the post-processing result of fourth-order cumulant.

In order to ensure the scheduling properties of an EOS, it is important to verify the implementation of its task scheduler. However, the implementation of a task scheduler requires the manipulation of machine registers di rectly and uses very complex C pointer structures to manage the task related data. Thus, we need a verification system that can formally describe both C pointer programs and embedded code pointers (e.g., update the stack register) naturally. Based on the Verified Software Toolchain and the CompCert ARM assembly syntax and semantics, we utilize the Coq proof assistant to develop formal reasoning support for the verification of a low-level task scheduler. Our verification system has the capability to verify both C and ARM assembly language; it supports the separation of logical abstractions and specific implementations. More importantly, all the verification can be done in a unified modular verification framework, which minimizes semantic gaps at specification interfaces.},

Maritime safety is an important problem of marine transportation. Therefore, it is very important to set up the ship abnormal real-time monitoring system. In order to reali ze the real-time monitoring of abnormal data in the course of ship driving, a hybrid single classification framework based on depth learning is designed. DDBN-OCSVM framework uses the deep network to solve the problem that complex high-dimensional data are difficult to reduce and learn. The single classification algorithm is used to avoid the impact of data imbalance on the results of ship real-time monitoring anomaly detection. Finally, the experimental analysis and discussion of the data are carried out. The experimental results show that DDBN-OCSVM can effectively reduce the detection error under the accelerating effect of GPU and cuDNN. The DDBN-OCSVM algorithm proves that the unsupervised feature learning and hierarchical representation are effective and feasible.

  abstract     = {Firstly, the paper analyzes the information propagation mode of Sina Weibo, and proposes a new MURank algorithm based on PageRank algorithm, which fully considers the relationship between users, the transmission relationship between users and microblogs, and the forwarding relationship between micr oblogs. At the same time build the user-microblog mode diagram. The design of the thesis is also more in line with the information dissemination mode of the actual Weibo platform. Experiments prove that MURank can effectively solve the impact of “zombie powder” and “level sinking” problems, and more realistically reflect the level of influence of users. Secondly, the paper combines BP neural network algorithm to improve the QoE hierarchical index system, and proposes a five-level index model. The mobile video service is taken as an example to illustrate the establishment process of the indicator system and the QoE quantitative evaluation method. By verifying on the open source distributed platform Hadoop platform, it is found that the proposed method is a solution to deal with massive data analysis.},

The rapid development of marine transportation increases great pressure on the maritime monitoring and administration in the ship locks. Hence, it is essential to explore the navigational risk factors. This study proposes a new dynamics model to investigate the evolution mechanism of navigational risk in Three Gorges ship lock. Intelligent expert system was used to analyze the risk factors. Experimental validation results demonstrate that the weather may impact the ship navigational safety with a high risk probability. Meanwhile, the navigational risk in flood season is relatively higher than that in dry season due to the increase of flow velocity and rain fall. The present study may provide useful insights to the evolution of inland navigational risk as well as maritime administration in the Three Gorges ship lock.},

Therefore, analyzing this temporal-sensitive information in multimedia is a vital issue. To this end, this paper analyses the temporal sensitivity of multimedia web information to find what kind of information is temporal-sensitive, how this information is responsive to time, and how to evaluate the temporal sensitivity of information. We start with four types of features, that is time, content, user behavior and related multimedia news, then set up a triple model to depict news. By establishing the energy transfer relationship between news and related and similar news, time, and user behavior, we measure the energy, and use the change ratio of energy as the temporal sensitivity of news. The data set is a multimedia news corpus, including video, image and text news. In the experiment, we take the users’ comments as the validation set. The result basically matches the validation set, and it shows our metric is reasonable.},

In this paper, we use data obtained through the Twitter API to study the influence maximization problem based on the relationship graph of the social network and information dissemination model. In the current independent cascade propagation model, the influence weights between nodes are based largely on the fixed-value assumption and the randomized probability of acceptance; however, this does not conform to real life. The influence weight between users is closely related to the strength of relationships, content of communication, and so on. Focusing on user relation-ships, we introduce an improved weighted cascade mode combined with a heuristic algorithm to find an approximate solution to the problem of influence maximization. Example analysis indicates that the improved weighted cascade model can obtain a more significant and influential node set compared to conventional methods.},

Aiming at the shortcomings of super-voxels concavo-convex segmentation algorithm for 3D point cloud, an efficient segmentation method based on multi-feature fusion is proposed. Firstly, the noises of 3D point cloud are removed by the statistical outlier removal filter, and the denoised 3D point cloud is simplified by the voxel grid filter. Secondly, it is divided into many voxels with the same size by the octree, and the voxels with the smallest mean curvature in local neighbourhood are used as seed voxels for regional growth to form super-voxels. Next, the super-voxels adjacency graph is structured and the concave-convex feature, continuous feature and colour feature between adjacent super-voxels are calculated as the weight on their edges. Finally, an arbitrary super-voxel is selected as the seed super-voxel to regional growth based on multi-feature weights of the edges in order to achieve the segmentation of the point cloud. The experimental results show that the proposed method whose segmentation speed, stability and accuracy are higher than existing methods greatly improves the over-segmentation or under-segmentation of the super-voxels segmentation algorithm.},

  abstract     = {In wind farms with high integrated automation systems, different communicated structures, such as different communication protocols and communication mediums, exist among various intelligent equipment. Different communication protocols or media will lead to incompatibility of communication between various intelligent devices. Developing communication protocol converters is an effective way to solve such problems. In this way, the communication efficiency between intelligent devices will be affected to some extent, and then the operation of the whole wind farm will be affected. This study introduces a communication protocol converter integrated with a multiserial, multiprotocol, and multinetwork system. The protocol converter treats the microcontroller STM32F407 as the microcontroller unit of the converter to integrate multiple communication interfaces. Meanwhile, the compatibility problems of communication between the intelligent equipments in the wind field monitoring system can be solved using software to realize the conversion between the various communication protocols.},

And the switching frequency was randomized by switching the preset carrier, i.e., an improved kind of random carrier frequency modulation (RCFM). The simulation and experimental results showed that the proposed random PWM method could not only suppress the high-order harmonics of the output voltage more effectively, but also have better sinusoidal waveform than the conventional random PWM method.},

For a single mode, a single-modal industrial product (SMIP) color design model is established by using users’ color image requirements as the design goal to transform the dynamic color design problem of products into weighting forms of several single modes and to realize the discretization of continuous problems. Finally, a dynamic color design model of MMIPs is established. A genetic algorithm (GA) is used to optimize this model to obtain the color design scheme that conforms to the users’ dynamic image perception.

  abstract     = {Multi-phase computed tomography images are widely applied to doctors’ routine interpretation of organic lesions or before human abdominal surgery. However, because of the lack of intuitive and three-dimensional (3D) observations, human factors lead to 80% of the clinical errors. A primary malignant tumor resection system based on a virtual reality (VR) helmet and a force-feedback device combined with a 3D printing model is proposed in this paper. First, we used the thin-plate spline (TPS) deformation method to register the different phase images. In the case of a metastatic tumor, a spherical scoring filter (SSF) model was built for searching the tumor pattern with edge detection and subtraction processing, from which the initial tumors were selected on the basis of the calculated score. For hepatocellular carcinoma cases, candidates were extracted as the areas without edges by using edge detection filters on the subtraction image between the equilibrium and arterial phase images. Finally, the false positive (FP) candidate was eliminated before obtaining the 3D shape of the liver tumor in the expansion process, thus providing an accurate volume of lesions for the surgical plan for the liver resection. The results showed that our virtual surgery system enabled the user to simulate the use of a scalpel for cutting and removing the organ labels; 3D display on a VR helmet with a deformable effect; and touching organs with a force-feedback device. Our virtual surgery tools could simulate all of the effects of the doctors’ operations and make clinical practice more efficient.},

The quantified model of drivers’ behavior risk was proposed based on the safety speed difference. The variation characteristics of behavior risk both inside the tunnel and ordinary highway were analysed. Further, the NARX neural network was used to predict real-time speed with the heart rate regarded as the input variable. Results showed that skilled drivers showed the highest behavior risk in the internal zone, while the highest value of unskilled drivers was at the exit zone in the tunnel section. Both two types of drivers presented the highest and the lowest behavior risk on the ordinary highway and the tunnel entrance zone respectively. The proposed NARX model could predict synchronous speed with high accuracy.

  abstract     = {The traditional point cloud alignment method suffers from drawbacks such as a large extensive computation, low computing speed, and poor alignment accuracy. To overcome these problems, this paper proposes a fast and highly accurate algorithm based on fast point feature histograms (FPFH) algorithm a nd spatial constraints. The proposed algorithm first filters, denoises the point cloud dataset, and calculates the point cloud normal to obtain the FPFH eigenvalue. Then, the vertebral space is divided into three regions according to its location, and the feature points in each region are calculated. The Euclidean distance between a feature point and the boundary of the adjacent region, and the weight coefficient corresponding to the feature point are given according to the calculated distance. The method overcomes the defect that the query feature point has a large workload in the traditional ICP algorithm and improves the registration precision of the point cloud. The experimental results show that the proposed method effectively solves the problems of the traditional point cloud registration algorithm, can effectively reduce the mismatch rate of point cloud registration, and can improve the registration accuracy and stability without reducing the registration of the elements.},

  abstract     = {The frequency modulated continuous wave circular synthetic aperture radar (FMCW CSAR) is a high resolution imaging radar, which plays an important role in target recognition. However, the traditional wave number domain imaging algorithm has a low resolution for the target far from the scene center, which limits its wide applications in CSAR imaging. In this paper, when the targets are sparse or compressible, a circular convolution algorithm based on compressed sensing is proposed to improve the resolution. In the algorithm, the circular convolution and the Fourier transform is used to reduce computation cost. What’s more, the compressed sensing is applied to improve the imaging resolution for the target far from the scene center, which can effectively avoid the complex calculation of the system kernel function in the traditional wave number domain algorithm. Some simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

However, model uncertainties, especially complicated friction, seriously affect the collision detection performance of these methods. In this pape r, a nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO) originally proposed for friction estimation is applied for the first time in robot collision detection. To verify that the collision detection performance of the NDO is better than that of the classical generalized momentum observer (GMO), the detection sensitivity, robustness and external torque estimation accuracy of each method are compared and analyzed. Then, to eliminate the effects of friction uncertainties on the collision detection results, a modified nonlinear disturbance observer (MNDO) based on neural networks is proposed to improve the collision detection performance. To verify the effectiveness of the algorithm, simulations and experiments are conducted with a 6-DOF robot and two single-joint platforms. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm is accurate and effective.},

Therefore, this paper suggests that Internet social users should distinguish Internet friend-making from traditional friend-making, and do not have too many unrealistic expectations of Internet friend-making.},

  abstract     = {Aggregated search is the task of integrating results from potentially multiple specialized search services, or verticals (images, videos, news, etc.), into the Web search results. Major search engines perform what is known as Aggregated Search. Aggregated search is relatively new and its advantage s need to be evaluated. With the increasing size of the data set on the network, different results retrieved from different dimensions are sometimes entirely different for a given search problem. In this paper, a new aggregated search algorithm was proposed. Firstly, the retrieval data in the vertical domain was textualized, and Doc2Vec makes the vector representation of the data. Then the results are aggregated and output by dimension reduction and density clustering. The experimental results show that the model achieves good accuracy in 20 given queries and significantly improves the aggregated search results. Discussion about the results also allowed us to identify some useful thoughts concerning the evaluation of AS approaches.},

  abstract     = {The difference of feeder impedance and the nonlinear load may deteriorate reactive power sharing and worsen the power quality, which may cause the breakdown of power supply in islanded microgrids. An enhanced discrete consensus algorithm considering information transmission delay is put forward in order to optimize the convergence dynamic. The proposed algorithm defines the independent iteration number of times variable for every agent, which can be transferred to its adjacent agents together with the communication data to control the times of the iteration calculation. The optimized control strategy is adopted for three-phase distributed generators to balance the reactive power sharing. Eventually, the simulation results show that the reactive power will be evenly shared among distributed generators in proportion to their rated capacity and the proposed algorithm achieves good dynamic performance during the transition.},

  abstract     = {Medical image restoration is a fundamental issue in the area of medical signal processing, which aims recove high quality medical image from its degradation observation. Recently, the methods with nonlocal self-similarity prior have led to a great improvement on many medical image restoration tasks . Nevertheless, the nonlocal technique is generally embedded with only one kind of constraint, such as sparsity or low-rank in the conventional model, which limits their abilities and show good performance on certain prior. To address this problem, in this paper, we present a novel medical image restoration method with multiple nonlocal-based prior regularizations. The surfacelet transformation is introduced to construct a cubic sparsity constraint to a group of nonlocal similar patches. Likewise, due to the self-similarity existed in the medical image, two extra kinds of nonlocal-based priors, nonlocal total variation and nonlocal weighted low-rank, are also exploited to constrain the local smoothness and nonlocal relationship jointly. In this way, each of the designed priors can well recover a group of patches with similar structure. And then, the designed priors are combined into a unified proposed optimization framework, which will obtain the advantages from all of them simultaneously. Finally, to solve the objective function in the proposed framework, we develop an iterative numerical scenario based on alternating direction multipliers method. The extensive experiments on test medical images demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms the comparison methods on both of visual quality and objective evaluation results.},
