  abstract     = {The rise of artificial intelligence (A.I.) based systems is already offering substantial benefits to the society as a whole. However, these systems may also enclose potential conflicts and unintended consequences. Notably, people will tend to adopt an A.I. system if it confers them an advantage, at which point non-adopters might push for a strong regulation if that advantage for adopters is at a cost for them. Here we propose an agent-based game-theoretical model for these conflicts, where agents may decide to resort to A.I. to use and acquire additional information on the payoffs of a stochastic game, striving to bring insights from simulation to what has been, hitherto, a mostly philosophical discussion. We frame our results under the current discussion on ethical A.I. and the conflict between individual and societal gains: the societal value alignment problem. We test the arising equilibria in the adoption of A.I. technology under different norms followed by artificial agents, their ensuing benefits, and the emergent levels of wealth inequality. We show that without any regulation, purely selfish A.I. systems will have the strongest advantage, even when a utilitarian A.I. provides significant benefits for the individual and the society. Nevertheless, we show that it is possible to develop A.I. systems following human conscious policies that, when introduced in society, lead to an equilibrium where the gains for the adopters are not at a cost for non-adopters, thus increasing the overall wealth of the population and lowering inequality. However, as shown, a self-organised adoption of such policies would require external regulation.},

The approach can also be considered as semi-supervised anomaly detection because it operates with the training dataset containing labelled instances for the known classes only. During the training phase the classification mode l is learned. It is assumed that at least two known classes exist in the available training dataset. In the testing phase instances are classified as normal or anomalous based on the classifier confidence. In other words, if the classifier cannot assign any of the known class labels to the given instance with sufficiently high confidence (probability), the instance will be declared as novelty (anomaly). We propose two procedures to objectively measure the classifier confidence. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is comparable to methods known in the literature.},

However, despite significant progress , this field is still subject to many theoretical debates and technical challenges. It therefore seems important to make a general inventory of the different lines of research and to present a synthesis of recent results in this field. To this end, we have carried out a systematic review of the literature according to the guidelines of the PRISMA method. A search of 13 documentary databases identified a total of 220 references over the period 2014–2019. After a global presentation of the current systems and their performance, we grouped and analyzed the selected articles in the light of the main problems encountered in the field of automated facial expression recognition. The conclusion of this review highlights the strengths, limitations and main directions for future research in this field.},

In this work, we present a fully automated tool – Empirical Scaling Analyzer (ESA) – for performing sophisticated and detailed empirical scaling analyses. The methodological approach underlying ESA is based on a combination of automatic function fitting and bootstrap sampling; previous versions of the methodology have been used in prior work to characterize the empirical scaling behaviour of several prominent, high-performance SAT and TSP solvers. ESA is applicable to any algorithm or system, as long as running time data can be collected on sets of problem instances of various sizes. We present results from rigorous stress-testing to critically assess ESA on scenarios with challenging characteristics. We also give an overview of empirical scaling results obtained using ESA.},

In this paper, we present a deep learning system, which uses a variety of data for a subset of the stocks on the NASDAQ exchange to forecast the stock price. Our framework allows the use of a variational autoencoder (VAE) to remove noise and time-series data engineering to extract higher-level features. A Stacked LSTM Autoencoder is used to perform multi-step-ahead prediction of the stock closing price. This prediction is used by two profit-maximization strategies that include greedy approach and short selling. Besides, we use reinforcement learning as a third profit-enhancement strategy and compare these three strategies to offline strategies that use the actual future prices. Results show that the proposed methods outperform the state-of-the-art time-series forecasting approaches in terms of predictive accuracy and profitability.},

  abstract     = {Multiple instance learning is a modification in supervised learning that handles the classification of collection instances, which called bags. Each bag contains a number of instances whose features are extracted. In multiple instance learning, the standard assumption is that a positive bag contain s at least one positive instance, whereas a negative bag is only comprised of negative instances. The complexity of multiple instance learning relies heavily on the number of instances in the training datasets. Since we are usually confronted with a large instance space, it is important to design efficient instance selection techniques to speed up the training process, without compromising the performance. Firstly, a multiple instance learning model of support vector machine based on grey relational analysis is proposed in this paper. The data size can be reduced, and the importance of instances in the bag can be preliminarily judged. Secondly, this paper introduces an algorithm with the bag-representative selector that trains the support vector machine based on bag-level information. Finally, this paper shows how to generalize the algorithm for binary multiple instance learning to multiple class tasks. The experimental study evaluates and compares the performance of our method against 8 state-of-the-art multiple instance methods over 10 datasets, and then demonstrates that the proposed approach is competitive with the state-of-art multiple instance learning methods.},

This calls for new approaches and algorithms, that are able to efficiently deal with these challenges. In this paper we propose the use of a Genetic Algorithm to Optimize a Stacking Ensemble specifically developed for streaming scenarios. A pool of solutions is maintained in which each solution represents a distribution of weights in the ensemble. The Genetic Algorithm continuously optimizes these weights to minimize the cost function. Moreover, new models are added at regular intervals, trained on more recent data. These models eventually replace older and less accurate ones, making the ensemble adapt continuously do changes in the distribution of the data.},

  abstract     = {Manufacturing companies typically use sophisticated production planning systems optimizing production steps, often delivering near-optimal solutions. As a downside for delivering a near-optimal schedule, planning systems have high computational demands resulting in hours of computation. Under norma l circumstances this is not issue if there is enough buffer time before implementation of the schedule (e.g. at night for the next day). However, in case of unexpected disruptions such as delayed part deliveries or defectively manufactured goods, the planned schedule may become invalid and swift replanning becomes necessary. Such immediate replanning is unsuited for existing optimal planners due to the computational requirements. This paper proposes a novel solution that can effectively and efficiently perform replanning in case of different types of disruptions using an existing plan. The approach is based on the idea to adhere to the existing schedule as much as possible, adapting it based on limited local changes. For that purpose an agent-based scheduling mechanism has been devised, in which agents represent materials and production sites and use local optimization techniques and negotiations to generate an adapted (sufficient, but non-optimal) schedule. The approach has been evaluated using real production data from Huawei, showing that efficient schedules are produced in short time. The system has been implemented as proof of concept and is currently reimplemented and transferred to a production system based on the Jadex agent platform.},

However, it is impossible for EC based feature selection approaches to possess big p opulation sizes because of very long and infeasible computational time. We have proposed a method screening individuals by estimating their classification performances rapidly instead of deriving theirs with a certain classifier dilatorily. Consequently, aiming at improving classification accuracies, we propose an approach named as FS-NN-GA (Feature Selection approach based on Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms) in this work. The proposed approach employs the neural networks trained with some randomly generated individuals, and their actual classification accuracies to estimate individuals’ classification accuracies and screens them in each round of GA. The individuals with low estimated accuracies are directly eliminated. Only a small number of individuals with high estimated accuracies are reserved, evaluated by deriving their accuracies with a certain classifier, and participate GA operations to be explored emphatically. As a result, big population sizes become feasible, and a huge number of individuals can be considered by GA in acceptable and feasible time, which improves performances of GA and derives high accuracies. We perform the experiments with 10 data sets in comparison with 11 available approaches. The experimental results show that FS-NN-GA outperforms other approaches on most data sets.},

For this reason, a business intelligence architecture system is hereby proposed to allow the detection of discrete changes or weak signals in the present, indicative of more significant phenomena and transcendental changes in the future. In contrast to work currently available focusing on structured information sources, or at most with a single type of data source, the detection of these signals is here quantitatively based on heterogeneous and unstructured documents of various kinds (scientific journals, newspaper articles and social networks), to which text mining and natural language processing techniques (a multi-word expression analysis) are applied. The system has been tested to study the future of the artificial intelligence sector, obtaining promising results to help business experts in the recognition of new driving factors of their markets and the development of new opportunities.},
