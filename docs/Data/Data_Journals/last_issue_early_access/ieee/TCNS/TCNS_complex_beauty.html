  abstract     = {Network games provide a framework to study strategic decision making processes that are governed by structured interdependencies among agents. However, existing models do not account for environments in which agents simultaneously interact over multiple networks, or when agents operate over multiple action dimensions. In this paper, we propose new models of multiplex network games to capture the different modalities of interactions among strategic agents, and multilayer network games to capture their interactions over multiple action dimensions. We explore how the properties of the constituent networks of a multiplex/multilayer network can undermine or support the existence, uniqueness, and stability of the game&#39;s Nash equilibria. Notably, we highlight that both the largest and smallest eigenvalues of the constituent networks (reflecting their connectivity and two-sidedness, respectively) are instrumental in determining the uniqueness of the multiplex/multilayer network game&#39;s equilibrium. Together, our findings shed light on the reasons for the fragility of equilibria when agents interact over networks of networks, and point out potential interventions to alleviate them.},

  abstract     = {Assuming agents possess sensing capabilities and dynamics relative to their body coordinate frames, this paper addresses a displacement-based strategy for discrete-time formation control through attitude synchronization. Unlike the Eulerian approximation, the first challenge lies in developing discrete-time models that capture both position and attitude motions, thereby complementing existing continuous-time systems with a discretized version. Then, two leader-following control protocols are designed, incorporating a jointly-connected topology to relax the connectivity requirements. The analysis of these systems often relies on the Lyapunov function, the existence of which may be hard to guarantee. Consequently, geometric properties of several polytopes are explored under the dynamic topologies and time-varying parameters. By extending the ergodicity results to leader-following scenarios, these properties are characterized as positively invariant sets. This invariance, which is independent of the existence of the Lyapunov function or the solvability of its associated criteria, provides a beneficial tool for analyzing time-variant systems. Utilizing this invariance and some mathematical techniques, the desired formation shape can be achieved in the cases where the attitudes of the followers synchronize with the leader. Finally, a numerical simulation validates the results.},

  abstract     = {In transmission networks, power flows and network topology are deeply intertwined due to power flow physics. Recent literature shows that a specific more hierarchical network structure can effectively inhibit the propagation of line failures across the entire system. In particular, a novel approach named tree partitioning has been proposed, which seeks to bolster the robustness of power networks through strategic alterations in network topology, accomplished via targeted line switching actions. Several tree partitioning problem formulations have been proposed by considering different objectives, among which power flow disruption and network congestion. Furthermore, various heuristic methods based on a two-stage and recursive approach have been proposed. The present work provides a general framework for tree partitioning problems based on mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). In particular, we present a novel MILP formulation to optimally solve tree partitioning problems and also propose a two-stage heuristic based on MILP. We perform extensive numerical experiments to solve two tree partitioning problem variants, demonstrating the excellent performance of our solution methods. Lastly, through exhaustive cascading failure simulations, we compare the effectiveness of various tree partitioning strategies and show that, on average, they can achieve a substantial reduction in lost load compared to the original topologies.},

Attaining the optimal secure formation control policy located at the Nash equilibrium depends on solving the game-associated coupled Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation.

On this basis, the double-layer stochastic process is constructed, which consists of an attack sequence and an observation one. Second, since the attack modes are inaccessible, a controller is constructed based on the observation sequence by virtue of the emission probability to stabilize the system under random attacks. Due to the complexity of the network, the probability that an observer can accurately detect an attack when it occurs is considered unknown. Based on the introduced double-layer stochastic process, a mode-associated Lyapunov function is constructed to facilitate the stability analysis. Building on this foundation, sufficient conditions that can ensure the $\delta$-error mean square stability of the closed-loop system are derived.

To address this problem, we propose a computationally efficient and robust algorithm which builds on a probabilistic technique for stochastic gradient computation, which we believe will be applicable to a wide range of problems in decentralized information processing, learning and control. Specifically, we show that the proposed method achieves an oracle complexity (computational complexity) of $O(1/\epsilon ^{2})$ for smooth and non-convex functions with stochastic gradients, which is known to be sharp for its respective function class, and is an improvement over the computational cost obtained in previous works. Additionally we retain the $O(1/\epsilon ^{3})$ rate for the communication cost, which is at par with the communication cost obtained in previous works. We also show how the proposed algorithm has robust performance in environments with unreliable computational resources. Finally, the theoretical findings are validated via numerical experiments.},

Notably, this observer operates independently of the choice of control input, thus decoupling it from the controller design. Alongside estimates of states and faults, we develop a cooperative fault-tolerant controller to ensure that the constrained state difference remains within the prescribed range throughout the system&#39;s evolution, ultimately converging to the desired value. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach in the context of cooperative fault-tolerant cruise control for multiple high-speed trains, where we consider simultaneous constraints on train position and velocity.},

To solve the quantizer saturation problem caused by DoS attacks, the quantization mechanism is equipped to have zooming-in and holding capabilities, in which the holding capability is consistent with the results in quantized consensus under DoS. A sufficient condition on the number of quantizer levels is provided, under which the quantizers are free from saturation under DoS attacks. The proposed distributed quantized NE seeking strategy is shown to have the so-called maximum resilience to DoS attacks.

In a centralized setting, variational inference is a fundamental tool to extend the utility of Bayesian estimation, by approximating a parametrized form of an intractable posterior density. Our key contribution is deriving the distributed evidence lower bound (DELBO) from the centralized estimation objective, whose separable structure enables distributed inference with one-hop sensor communication. The DELBO consists of observation likelihood and divergences to prior estimates, and the gap to the measurement evidence is ascribed to consensus and modeling errors. For supervised learning, we design a DELBO-maximizing online distributed algorithm, and specialize it to Gaussian variational densities with non-linear likelihoods. We extend the resulting distributed Gaussian variational inference (DGVI) updates via diagonalized and 1-rank covariance inversions for high-dimensional estimates and apply it to multi-robot probabilistic mapping using indoor LiDAR data.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates impulsive security protocols with the goal of achieving consensus of fractional-order fuzzy multi-agent systems (FOFMASs). In contrast to multi-agent systems characterized by ordinary differential equations, FOFMASs are created using T-S fuzzy rules and fractional-order differential equations, which allow for nonlinearities with parameter uncertainties and also manage memory effects. Due to the potential of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, the topology among nodes may change, and it is necessary to gain insight into the security consensus under topology switching. This paper tackles the security protocol problem by designing a distributed impulsive control for each agent, relying on global delayed communications and topology switching resulting from DoS attacks. Analyzing the stability of impulse-free error systems is a salient problem. Supported by the Lyapunov method and average impulsive interval method, for two cases of self-stabilization or instability of the error system in the absence of impulse, some sufficient conditions are presented to ensure the exponential consensus of FOFMASs under distributed impulsive control with communication delays. Besides, several corollaries are provided to guarantee the consensus under distributed impulsive control without communication delays. Finally, two numerical examples are provided, and some numerical simulations are given to confirm the efficacy of the theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the fixed-time Nash equilibrium seeking for noncooperative games over networked players, where the players are supposed to have only access to the actions of their neighboring players. Novel consensus-based distributed fixed-time Nash equilibrium seeking strategies are proposed for players with both the first- and second-order dynamics. Via Lyapunov-based techniques, it is proved that under the proposed strategies, the actions of players with both first- and second-order dynamics can converge to the Nash equilibrium within a fixed time, which is upper bounded by a finite constant independent of the players&#39; initial conditions. Simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed seeking strategies.},

  abstract     = {Quantifying the average communication rate (ACR) of a networked event-triggered stochastic control system (NET-SCS) with deterministic thresholds is challenging due to the non-stationary nature of the system&#39;s stochastic processes. For a NET-SCS, the propagation of nonlinear statistics of the network communication status brought up by deterministic thresholds makes the precise computation of ACR difficult. Previous work used to over-simplify the computation using a Gaussian distribution without incorporating this nonlinearity, leading to sacrificed precision. This paper proposes a novel approach to calculate the exact ACR for a NET-SCS using a recursive model. We use theoretical analysis and a numerical study to qualitatively evaluate the deviation gap of the conventional approach that ignores the side information. The accuracy of our proposed method, alongside its comparison with the simplified results of the conventional approach, is validated by experimental studies. Our work is promising to benefit the efficient resource planning of networked control systems with limited communication resources by providing accurate ACR computation.},
