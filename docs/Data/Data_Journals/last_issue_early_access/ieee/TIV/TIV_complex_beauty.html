  abstract     = {Vehicular edge computing (VEC) is a new paradigm in smart cities with the potential to provide and manage resources such as computing and storage closer to resourceconstrained smart vehicles (SV) to support ultra-reliable lowlatency communications and knowledge sharing. However, it is challenging to make optimal resource allocation and offloading decisions due to the mobility, ubiquitous communications, and diverse resource demands of SVs and the dynamic nature of the vehicular network topology. In this paper, we propose an adaptive resource allocation and task offloading scheme for HAPS-assisted Internet of Vehicle networks by exploiting the potential of digital twins (DT), blockchain, and federated multiagent deep reinforcement learning (FMADRL) technologies to address these issues. The DT network is utilized to intelligently monitor and control the demand and supply of resources in the digital representation of the physical operating environment. We adopt a dynamic pricing-based double auction to model the supplies and demands of resource providers and requesters. This enables resource providers and SVs to make adaptive and optimal resource allocation and task offloading decisions. In addition, we deploy a consortium blockchain to enable distributed and secure resource allocation. The resource allocation and task offloading multi-objective optimization problem is formulated as a multiagent extension of the Markov decision process and solved using an FMADRL-based multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (FMADDPG) algorithm. The numerical results show that the proposed scheme archives efficient resource allocation and maximizes the utility function while minimizing costs compared to the baseline schemes.},

The system addresses and refines misclassifications made by black-box object detectors. Raw sensor data from camera, Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR), and radar are extracted within the bounding box region identified by the black-box detector. The classification is based on the extracted images and point cloud data, with the inclusion of a &#39;fault class&#39; to detect misclassifications by the black-box detectors. This approach also consolidates class labels to improve classification reliability and reduce computational costs. A dataset is built to evaluate the performance of system. The classification performance is analyzed based on different sensor types (camera, LiDAR, radar), machine learning techniques (attention mechanisms), and sensor fusion methods (early, middle, late). The classification result is obtained by probabilistically fusing the outputs of both black-box and fusion-based classifiers. The results demonstrate that this fusion-based approach significantly improves the reliability of the classification, providing a robust solution to safe autonomous driving},

By deeply integrating obstacle avoidance mechanisms with global path tracking and leveraging POMDP to enhance the system&#39;s capability to handle environmental uncertainties, we establish a navigation framework that is both efficient and secure.

The upgrade of vehicle sensors provides us an opportunity for a better judgement of the driver&#39;s driving style. This paper proposes a new driving style classification method based on the active learning. This method first uses the concept of driving volatility measurement to measure the performance of vehicles in terms of speed and acceleration, and then generates data to reduce the influence of data distribution on learning effect. The proposed method divides drivers&#39; behaviors into aggressive, ordinary and calm styles. It can effectively learn the features related to driving style in driving volatility measurement, and the active learning method itself can reduce the requirement of human expert experience. The effectiveness of the proposed method is proved by the experiments on the UAH-Driveset, and then this paper uses the proposed method to analyze some data from the Security Pilot Model Deployment (SPMD).},

  abstract     = {Large language models (LLMs) as autonomous agents offer a novel avenue for tackling real-world challenges through a knowledge-driven manner. These LLM-enhanced methodologies excel in generalization and interpretability. However, the complexity of driving tasks often necessitates the collaboration of multiple, heterogeneous agents, underscoring the need for such LLM-driven agents to engage in cooperative knowledge sharing and cognitive synergy. Despite the promise of LLMs, current applications predominantly center around single-agent scenarios, which limits their scope in the face of intricate, interconnected tasks. To broaden the horizons of knowledge-driven strategies and bolster the generalization capabilities of autonomous agents, we propose the $\mathsf {KoMA}$ framework consisting of the multi-agent interaction, the multi-step planning, the shared-memory, and the ranking-based reflection modules to enhance multi-agents&#39; decision-making in complex driving scenarios. Based on the framework&#39;s generated text descriptions of driving scenarios, the multi-agent interaction module enables LLM agents to analyze and infer the intentions of surrounding vehicles based on scene information, akin to human cognition. The multi-step planning module enables LLM agents to analyze and obtain final action decisions layer by layer to ensure consistent goals for short-term action decisions. The shared memory module can accumulate collective experience to make superior decisions, and the ranking-based reflection module can evaluate and improve agent behavior with the aim of enhancing driving safety and efficiency. The $\mathsf {KoMA}$ framework not only enhances the robustness and adaptability of autonomous driving agents but also significantly elevates their generalization capabilities across diverse scenarios. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over traditional methods, particularly in its ability to handle complex, unpredictable driving environments without extensive retraining.

  abstract     = {Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are emerging as the future of the automotive industry for secure, efficient and sustainable mobility. CAVs are being rapidly adapted for passenger transportation, delivery of cargo, disaster management and military reconnaissance missions. CAVs for urban transportation are in line with the evolution of “smart cities.” However, as CAVs belong to the family of cyber-physical systems (CPS), they inherit some of the generic cyber vulnerabilities of CPS. Due to the unique features of vehicular networks, establishing secure communication between vehicle to vehicle (V2V) and vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) has remained a challenge for vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) service providers. The vulnerabilities associated with the multitude of sensors and internal connectivity modules increase the threat of cyber-attack on CAVs by many folds. This necessitates clear identification of the potential threats and classify them in terms of attack mechanisms. This classification will help in mapping the existing security solutions and exploration of new defense strategies for CAVs. This article has conducted a comprehensive survey of the cyber-attacks on CAVs and the ongoing research on the defense mechanisms. This work organizes the cyber-attacks based on the attacker strategies, attack surfaces, and attack vectors. The mitigation strategies are categorized based on the underlying defense approaches such as cryptography, intrusion detection, access control, and authentication in relation to their effectiveness in mitigating different attack categories.

To address this issue, this paper introduces a virtual traffic control system called advanced stop point and prior start time (ASP-PST). The ASP-PST leverages vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications between traffic signals and connected and automated heavy trucks. The system guides autonomous heavy trucks on where to stop and when to initiate their movement ahead of the green light. This strategy reduces start-up delays by managing vehicle movement control, enabling trucks to reach sufficient speed before approaching the intersection, thereby ensuring smooth passing and harmonized traffic flow. An analytical solution for the ASP-PST has been developed and validated through microscopic simulation tests at signalized intersections. The results show reductions in travel time of up to 50% in mixed traffic conditions, consisting of both heavy trucks and general cars, and illustrate the formation of well-coordinated platoons with uniform spacing. Demonstrating efficacy across various network environments, the ASP-PST offers a potential solution to enhance traffic flow and reduce congestion caused by heavy trucks at intersections.},

Recently, diffusion models have gained increasing attention as a promising approach for learning multimodal trajectory distribution. However, existing diffusion models for trajectory prediction tasks are mainly based on the modality of trajectory points, which exhibit rapidly increasing uncertainty over the temporal dimension in vehicle prediction. To overcome this limitation, we propose leveraging the bird&#39;s-eye-view (BEV) trajectory grids to represent trajectory in different time horizons. The diffusion on such representation will benefit from its robust context representation capabilities and inherently lower variance disparity among spatial pixel variables. To alleviate systematic errors arising from the limited resolution of rasterized images, Trajectory Refiner is employed to take as input rough trajectories extracted from the denoised BEV images and output accurate trajectory. Our method is rigorously tested on benchmark datasets including ETH/UCY and nuScence, demonstrating superior performance in long-term prediction accuracy compared to current diffusion-based trajectory prediction methods. Additionally, our experiments show that diffusion on trajectory grid can accelerate inference process with fewer denoising steps compared with trajectory points},

  abstract     = {This study introduces a robust Dynamic Population Evacuation (DPE) framework in response to the escalating challenges in wildfire-urban interface regions. The DPE model elevates emergency response strategies by seamlessly integrating traffic simulation, real-time mobility tracking, optimization systems leveraging advanced algorithms, and cloud-based communication. The offline component of the framework focuses on pre-disaster preparation by optimizing the allocation of evacuation shelters and generating initial route plans for impacted populations, incorporating changing on-the-ground hazard conditions and geography. The online phase dynamically reallocates shelters and provides real-time guidance for vehicle navigation. This approach significantly improves the efficiency and safety of evacuation processes by utilizing advanced algorithms and cloud infrastructure. Key innovations include an offline planning phase, optimizing shelter allocation and route plans with a keen eye on evolving hazards and geography. Extensive testing and simulations of the DPE framework, including models of real-world evacuation scenarios such as the Tubbs fire in California, validate the proposed approach and demonstrate significant improvement in efficiency, responsiveness, and safety for populations relative to traditional evacuation planning methods and frameworks. The study further underscores the broader applicability of the DPE model to enhance resilience and outcomes in urban evacuations not only for wildfires but also for other hazards such as floods and earthquakes.},

  abstract     = {Assuring safety of artificial intelligence (AI) applied to safety-critical systems is of paramount importance. Especially since research in the field of automated driving shows that AI is able to outperform classical approaches, to handle higher complexities, and to reach new levels of autonomy. At the same time, the safety assurance required for the use of AI in such safety-critical systems is still not in place. Due to the dynamic and far-reaching nature of the technology, research on safeguarding AI is being conducted in parallel to AI standardization and regulation. The parallel progress necessitates simultaneous consideration in order to carry out targeted research and development of AI systems in the context of automated driving. Therefore, in contrast to existing surveys that focus primarily on research aspects, this paper considers research, standardization and regulation in a concise way. Accordingly, the survey takes into account the interdependencies arising from the triplet of research, standardization and regulation in a forward-looking perspective and anticipates and discusses open questions and possible future directions. In this way, the survey ultimately serves to provide researchers and safety experts with a compact, holistic perspective that discusses the current status, emerging trends, and possible future developments.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely used in reconnaissance missions due to their good maneuverability, low cost and high efficiency. When multiple UAVs complete reconnaissance tasks, they need accurate positioning and cooperation. In the case that some UAVs lack positioning equipment, cooperative reconnaissance of UAV groups in a certain spatial area can be realized. The innovation of this research lies in the proposal of a novel combinatorial metaheuristic optimization method, named Combinatorial Manta Ray Foraging Optimization (CM RFO). This method uniquely combines the Hungarian algorithm from combinatorial optimization with the manta ray foraging optimization from metaheuristic optimization to systematically address collaborative task planning problems for multiple UAVs. According to the requirements of the cooperative reconnaissance task, a model is established that is divided into three stages: estimation of the optimal reconnaissance position of the UAV, estimation of the position of the UAV itself and reconnaissance subtask assignment. In the experiment, through the optimization results of particle swarm optimization, the Harris eagle algorithm and Manta ray foraging optimization in position estimation, the superiority of the Manta ray foraging optimization algorithm is demonstrated, and the Hungarian algorithm is then used to obtain the optimal distribution results of reconnaissance subtasks. We also show the completion process of the multi UAV cooperative reconnaissance task in some scenes where UAVs lack positioning equipment through graphical simulation and verify the proposed multiple unmanned aerial vehicle cooperative reconnaissance model},

This study introduces a novel method that leverages a pre-trained biosignal transformer (BIOT) to classify DCL using unimodal and multimodal multivariate biosignals. The proposed transformer-based model features an encoder-only architecture with efficient multi-head self-attention to process input tokens derived from various biosignals. Our approach includes Fourier-based biosignal tokenization techniques and a perturbation module as a data augmentation layer. Additionally, we employed a hierarchical spatiotemporal embedding framework, using additive absolute position embeddings for temporal encoding and additive learnable tokens for each channel for spatial encoding. Experimental results demonstrate that our model, trained on raw biosignals, outperforms previous methods, highlighting its potential for monitoring DCL using wearable devices. It achieved error rates that were at least 2.4% and up to 20% lower in ternary classification tests when compared to the baseline models. The findings suggest that integrating a pretrained transformer-based architecture with perturbation-based augmentation can significantly enhance the model&#39;s accuracy and robustness.

In this perspective, Sore4PMP, a hierarchical parallel motion planner, is presented as a suitable solution. Based on raw perception data and descriptive prompts, Sore4PMP can first leverage the advanced generative capabilities of Sora to generate virtual OOD events, and then integrate these events into the decision-making process, thereby enhancing the robustness and generalization of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in emergency scenarios. With a comprehensive outlook, this perspective aims to provide a potential direction for the development of foundation models coupled with autonomous driving and finally promote the safety, efficiency, reliability, and sustainability of AVs.},

Furthermore, we identify representative hazard scenarios, trigger conditions and performance deficiencies in VDC. Building upon data-driven fault-tolerant control theory, a comprehensive framework consisting of adaptive filter, iterative learning, fault diagnosis and identification, and fault-tolerant control modules is presented. The proposed framework is specifically designed to address trigger conditions such as driving environment variations, integration of multiple control systems, performance degradation due to components aging and maintenance. The framework features online driving state supervision, driving risk measurement, and intervention for mitigation of the SOTIF issues.

While still focused on extreme speed, autonomous racing differs from conventional automobile racing in its development philosophy, as human drivers are no longer involved. The absence of human drivers should be regarded as a new chance to increase competitiveness and entertainment value. This letter discusses opportunities to promote education-oriented autonomous racing. Recall that the flagship car race is Formula 1, where “formula” denotes technical restrictions that should be satisfied strictly.

  abstract     = {As economic and social activities continue to increase, transportation is increasingly contributing to climate change, air pollution and other environmental damage. The growing concerns about the sustainability of transportation are forcing everyone in this field to think about solutions to keep our mobility environmentally, economically and socially sustainable. To provide a forum for the exchange of ideas and experiences from industry, academia and the public sector, we have recently held a series of seminars and the first Distributed/Decentralized HybridWorkshop on Sustainability for Transportation and Logistics (DHW-STL), part of Distributed/Decentralized Hybrid Symposia on Sustainability for Transportation and Logistics (DHS-STL), and Distributed/Decentralized Hybrid Conferences on Sustainability for Transportation and Logistics (DHC-STL). This letter provides a brief report of the First DHW-STL and discusses the potentials, possibilities and perspectives driven by Intelligent Vehicles (IV) technologies to achieve sustainable intelligent systems for transportation and logistics.},

At present, the design and validation for AVs predominantly rely on simulation software or real-road testing methodologies. However, these approaches possess inherent limitations, leading to inaccuracy, reduced efficiency, and potential hazards during the development process. This letter reports our first DHW (decentralized and hybrid workshop) on Scenarios Engineering (SE), that aims to calibrate and validate AV modules through advanced scenarios. Specifically, the DHW discusses combining SE with existing simulation software and real-road testing strategies, enabling developers to maximize the advantages of each approach while ensuring the safety and efficacy in the development of autonomous vehicles. Our findings demonstrate the benefits of enhancing realism of simulation scenarios in the aspects of both content and appearance. Furthermore, the use of scenarios engineering is explored in order to enhance the diversity and safety of real-road testing by means of integrating virtual and physical components.},

  abstract     = {With the continuous development of autonomous driving technology, intelligent vehicles represented by autonomous taxis have begun to participate in the transportation system. Improving the sustainability of intelligent vehicles can increase the useful life of vehicles and reduce the overall increase of vehicles in society. This reduction reduces emissions and energy consumption, thereby increasing environmental sustainability. However, most of the current intelligent vehicles are modified from existing vehicles. The initial design of these vehicle does not consider the requirements for autonomous driving, which can easily lead to a mismatch between the control algorithm and the mechanical structure. Moreover, current intelligent vehicles mainly focus on the development of autonomous driving algorithms and ignore sustainable design, which will lead to increased energy consumption and reduced lifespan. This letter proposes a multi-dimensional circular design (MDCD) framework to improve the sustainability of intelligent vehicles from sustainable lifecycle management perspective. The MDCD framework consists of six parts, which are intelligent design, sensing, control, supervision, diagnosis and recycle.

We further discuss the prospective influence of ChatGPT on the field of intelligent vehicles, particularly possible applications of ChatGPT in areas like autonomous driving, human-vehicle interaction, and intelligent transportation systems, highlighting challenges and opportunities associated with these applications. Additionally, we address technical questions, such as the feasibility of training intelligent vehicles using the same methods as ChatGPT and the reflection of the intelligence of intelligent vehicles in the context of human-machine shared control.

The following is a brief review of the findings from our DHS, DHWs, and Seminars, in particularly about a novel emission regulatory framework for intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and smart cities (SCs) in ERS. Vehicle emissions are one of the main anthropogenic contributors to global warming and atmospheric pollution. However, effective regulation of transportation emissions is still challenging, even in intelligent transportation systems and smart cities. To realize accurate estimations and credible predictions, a parallel framework is proposed in this letter, consisting of a parallel transportation level and a parallel vehicle level. Through low-cost computational experiments and parallel executions, both accurate estimation and emission-aware optimal planning can be achieved. Unlike previous emission models, modern aftertreatment systems (ATS) are considered as a core module in this novel modular integration model (MIM). An application case on $\rm CO_{2}$ emissions is conducted to validate the fundamental function of this framework.},

This letter forms part of a series of reports emanating from the IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles&#39;s Decentralized and Hybrid Workshops (DHW) dedicated to the field of Scenarios Engineering. Our research proposes a scenario engineering-based calibration and validation framework for trajectory prediction of autonomous vehicles to more effectively validate the performance of the method in challenging scenarios. First, Scenarios Engineering (SE) uses OpenSCENARIO and real dataset to generate high-definition maps for challenging driving scenarios. Then, the vectorization approach is employed to extract contextual details from the scene and agent trajectory information from the HD map, and the graph neural network is used to model the high-order interaction to realize the interactive trajectory prediction. Compared with the traditional method, the trajectory prediction can be calibrated through SE so that the prediction process can use more traffic information and attribute characteristics, and improve the evaluation index of prediction. The DHW discusses a practical case to verify the potential of the trajectory prediction framework based on scenarios generation in improving the authenticity and accuracy of trajectory prediction.},

Using and exchanging real-time position and sensor information about Vulnerable Road Users introduces new privacy threats, as the data can reveal, e.g., social relationships or even users&#39; identity. We contribute to these investigations by identifying new, application-specific privacy threats resulting from different architectures. In addition to highlighting attacker models, we show that broadcast-based peer-to-peer architectures are the most privacy-friendly as compared to client-server and hybrid systems.

  abstract     = {In this era of automation, drones have considered to be a key element with its wide applicability in various situations. Additionally, the efficiency of drones can be further improved via collaborated learning techniques such as federated learning (FL). However, the drone-based FL requires a significant amount of communications because the drones share their FL data over wireless channels. Therefore, the unstable channel condition of wireless transmission introduces the low success probability in large-scale parameter transmission. According to quantum computing (QC) advantages, this problem can be tackled due to less parameter utilization in quantum neural network (QNN) training. Therefore, a novel QC-based FL known as the adaptive quantum federated learning (AQFL) is proposed for drone license plate recognition in autonomous surveillance applications. In our proposed AQFL, adaptive QNNs (AQNNs) are used as local models which can control the depths of QNNs by adding measurement computations in the middles of QNN architectures. Thus, our proposed AQFL is robust even in training data non-iidness and large local model variances while maintaining sufficient learning performance. Finally, the evaluation results verify that our proposed AQFL achieves the desired performance improvements.},

Automated eco-driving, i.e. adapting vehicle behaviour in order to reduce energy consumption is a way of achieving it. However, for an eco-driving algorithm to be implemented in a commercial vehicle some constraints on drivability, safety and computing power are to be addressed. In this paper, we propose an acceleration maneuver model allowing to explicitly consider drivability constraints. The model is based on many empirical studies on Physiology and Ergonomics and has been verified using real driving recordings. Then we propose an Automated Eco-driving algorithm, allowing to minimize driving energy consumption while meeting drivability and safety constraints. The algorithm is able to adapt to changes in the driving scenario and its architecture is compatible with a real-time implementation.},

  abstract     = {LiDAR and camera are two critical sensors for multi-modal 3D semantic segmentation and are supposed to be fused efficiently and robustly to promise safety in various realworld scenarios. However, existing multi-modal methods face two key challenges: 1) difficulty with efficient deployment and realtime execution; and 2) drastic performance degradation under weak calibration between LiDAR and cameras. To address these challenges, we propose CPGNet-LCF, a new multi-modal fusion framework extending the LiDAR-only CPGNet. CPGNet-LCF solves the first challenge by inheriting the easy deployment and real-time capabilities of CPGNet. For the second challenge, we introduce a novel weak calibration knowledge distillation strategy during training to improve the robustness against the weak calibration. CPGNet-LCF achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes and SemanticKITTI benchmarks. Remarkably, it can be easily deployed to run in 20 ms per frame on a single Tesla V100 GPU using TensorRT TF16 mode. Furthermore, we benchmark performance over four weak calibration levels, demonstrating the robustness of our proposed approach. Our code is available at https://github.com/humemarx/CPG-LCF.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous driving systems are inevitably influenced by kinds of noise, which may further incur unwanted safety problems. In this paper, a polynomial noise resilience neural dynamics (PNRND) is proposed to efficiently solve the predictive steering control (PSC) strategy for autonomous vehicles. In this sense, the reliability of autonomous vehicles can be guaranteed under noisy conditions, which are potentially caused by uneven road surfaces and sensor inaccuracies. By applying the Taylor expansion theorem, these noises can be represented in polynomial forms for the desired accuracy, providing a unique perspective for handling noise disturbances. Moreover, the robustness and stability of the proposed PNRND model are analyzed using theoretical derivations. At last, experiments conducted on the CarSim-Simulink platform and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) platform demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and real-time performance of the proposed neural dynamics approach.},

For detecting road irregularities such as speed bump, look-ahead sensors such as camera and Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) sensors have been used. However, these preview systems perform poorly in night and adverse weather conditions. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel machine learning-based speed bump prediction system that predicts remaining distance to and height of speed bumps using in-vehicle data, which is robust to external environment and represent driving pattern of driver. The proposed system consists of three components: machine learningbased bump predictor, automatic training dataset generator, and cloud-based continuous learning system. The effectiveness of the proposed system was confirmed through tests with varied datasets in different drivers and locations. The prediction of the distance to the speed bump demonstrated a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 6.37 meters, while the height prediction showed an RMSE of 0.9 cm. Additionally, after applying cloud-based continuous learning for driver-specific personalization, the RMSE for the distance prediction improved to 5.96 meters. Furthermore, experiments conducted under challenging conditions showed that our system outperformed existing systems.},

However, cameras are not robust against severe weather conditions, lidar sensors are expensive, and the performance of radar-based perception is still inferior to the others. Camera-radar fusion methods have been proposed to address this issue, but these are constrained by the typical sparsity of radar point clouds and often designed for radars without elevation information. We propose a novel camera-radar fusion approach called Dual Perspective Fusion Transformer (DPFT), designed to overcome these limitations. Our method leverages lower-level radar data (the radar cube) instead of the processed point clouds to preserve as much information as possible and employs projections in both the camera and ground planes to effectively use radars with elevation information and simplify the fusion with camera data. As a result, DPFT has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on the K-Radar dataset while showing remarkable robustness against adverse weather conditions and maintaining a low inference time.

The MDD dynamics model is calibrated across two driving scenarios, two adhesion conditions, and three load states using eight optimizers, resulting in 96 calibrations. The results indicate that the MAPSO-HL performs the best, with average calibration improvements of 54.636% and 40.78% over standard particle swarm optimization (PSO) and adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO), respectively. Meanwhile, the calibrated dynamics model accurately characterizes the kinematic acceleration of the MDD vehicle, highlighting the effectiveness of the extensible dynamics model and its parameter calibrator.

In this work, we propose a novel framework, SUSTechGAN, with customized dual attention modules, multi-scale generators, and a novel loss function to generate driving images for improving object detection of autonomous driving in adverse conditions. We test the SUSTechGAN and the well-known GANs to generate driving images in adverse conditions of rain and night and apply the generated images to retrain object detection networks. Specifically, we add generated images into the training datasets to retrain the well-known YOLOv5 and evaluate the improvement of the retrained YOLOv5 for object detection in adverse conditions. The experimental results show that the generated driving images by our SUSTechGAN significantly improved the performance of retrained YOLOv5 in rain and night conditions, which outperforms the well-known GANs.

Our methodology begins by leveraging the LLM for user input, which adapts it to relevant keywords needed to run python scripts. These scripts are designed to convert specified regions into coordinates, fetch data from OpenStreetMap, transform it into a road network, and subsequently run SUMO simulations with the designated traffic conditions. The outputs of the simulations are then interpreted by the LLM resulting in informative comparisons and summaries. Users can continue the interaction and generate a variety of customized scenarios without prior traffic simulation expertise. Any city available from OpenStreetMap can be imported, and for demonstration, we created a real-world simulation for the city of Albany.

  abstract     = {3D multi-object tracking is one of the important research directions in computer vision and holds significant research value in the field of autonomous driving. Relying solely on single image information or point cloud information is insufficient to overcome tracking challenges in complex scenarios. Currently, multimodal fusion 3D tracking methods still face numerous issues in fusion performance, data association, and trajectory management. Therefore, this paper proposes a dynamic 3D multi-object tracking method based on spatiotemporal features. First, a multi-scale spatial feature embedding fusion network is designed to enhance the weight of critical information within different modal features, thereby improving the prominence of target features. Second, a temporal aggregation embedding module is proposed to address the characteristics of point cloud features and fusion features, enhancing feature alignment when target features are integrated into temporal features, resulting in more robust temporal features. Finally, a multi-stage hybrid affinity dynamic association module and an adaptive dynamic trajectory management module are combined to reduce the impact of similar targets on tracking, which improves the model&#39;s ability to perceive target positions in dense scenes, and enhances the robustness of target association matching. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset have demonstrated that the proposed method achieves better tracking performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods.},

This study examines the effects of alert intensity and driver engagement in non-driving related tasks on takeover performance in automated vehicles. Forty-one participants navigated simulated driving scenarios with various hazards and alert conditions, allowing analysis of response times, physiological responses, and subjective perceptions. The findings showed that higher-intensity alerts significantly reduced reaction times, leading to quicker driver takeovers. Interestingly, engagement in certain secondary tasks sometimes improved driver responsiveness, suggesting that moderate cognitive engagement may enhance alertness. Response times varied across different driving scenarios, indicating the influence of situational context on driver behavior. Physiological measures, including eye-tracking and heart rate monitoring, showed increased cognitive and physiological arousal during takeover events, particularly in response to stronger alerts. Participants reported higher confidence and satisfaction with high-intensity alerts, without reporting increased annoyance, indicating a preference for more assertive alert mechanisms. These outcomes highlight the critical role of adaptive alert mechanisms in ADS design, promoting for context-aware signaling and real-time driver state monitoring to improve takeover performance and ensure vehicular safety. The study suggests that future ADS should integrate dynamic alert systems capable of adjusting intensity based on situational urgency and driver engagement, thereby enhancing overall system reliability and user acceptance.},

  abstract     = {Motion prediction plays an essential role in autonomous driving systems, enabling autonomous vehicles to achieve more accurate local-path planning and driving decisions based on predictions of the surrounding vehicles. However, existing methods neglect the potential missing values caused by object occlusion, perception algorithm failures, etc., which inevitably degrades the trajectory prediction performance in real traffic scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a novel end-to-end framework for incomplete vehicle trajectory prediction, named Multi-scale Temporal Fusion Transformer (MTFT), which consists of the Multi-scale Attention Head (MAH) and the Continuity Representation-guided Multi-scale Fusion (CRMF) module. Specifically, the MAH leverages the multi-head attention mechanism to parallelly capture multi-scale motion representation of trajectory from different temporal granularities, thus mitigating the adverse effect of missing values on prediction. Furthermore, the multi-scale motion representation is input into the CRMF module for multi-scale fusion to obtain the robust temporal feature of the vehicle. During the fusion process, the continuity representation of vehicle motion is first extracted across time steps to guide the fusion, ensuring that the resulting temporal feature incorporates both detailed information and the overall trend of vehicle motion, which facilitates the accurate decoding of future trajectory that is consistent with the vehicle&#39;s motion trend. We evaluate the proposed model on four datasets derived from different traffic scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate its superior performance in the incomplete vehicle trajectory prediction task compared with state-of-the-art models, e.g. , a comprehensive performance improvement of more than 39% on the HighD dataset.
