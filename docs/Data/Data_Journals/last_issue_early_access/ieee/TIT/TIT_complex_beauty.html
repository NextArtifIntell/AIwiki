  abstract     = {Subfield codes of linear codes over finite fields have recently attracted great attention due to their wide applications in secret sharing schemes, authentication codes and association schemes. There are two major ingredients in this paper. The first ingredient is to solve four conjectures recently proposed by Heng and Ding (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 68(6): 3643-3656, 2022). Besides, we also determine the weight distributions of subfield codes derived from x3 and oval polynomials over F2m. The second ingredient is to obtain two classes of p-ary linear codes from monomials over Fpm. We study the parameters of the constructed codes and determine their weight distributions. Notably, we show that the codes C(p) (xpi, pm) are optimal and almost optimal in many cases with respect to the online Database of Grassl. Finally, we observe that the derived linear codes also have the minimality property for most cases.},

Here we correct the proof but as a consequence we get a slightly weaker result. In [CST23, Theorem 9] we claimed that for integers k and n such that k &lt; n/9, there exists an [n; k]q RS code that can decode from n − 2k + 1 insdel errors where q = O (k5 (en/k−1)4k−4). Here we prove the following. Theorem .1. For integers n and k &lt; n/9, there exists an [n; k]q RS-code, where q = O (k4 · (4en/4k−3)4en/4k−3)) is a prime power, that can decode from n − 2k + 1 adversarial insdel errors. Note that the exponent of n is 4k−3 whereas in [CST23, Theorem 9] it is 4k − 4. For constant dimensional codes, the field size is of order O(n4k−3), and in particular, for k = 2 the field size is of order O(n5).},

  abstract     = {Fundamental limits on the error probabilities of a family of decentralized detection algorithms (eg., the social learning rule proposed by Lalitha et al. [2]) over directed graphs are investigated. In decentralized detection, a network of nodes locally exchanging information about the samples they observe with their neighbors to collectively infer the underlying unknown hypothesis. Each node in the network weighs the messages received from its neighbors to form its private belief and only requires knowledge of the data generating distribution of its observation. In this work, it is first shown that while the original social learning rule of Lalitha et al. [2] achieves asymptotically vanishing error probabilities as the number of samples tends to infinity, it suffers a gap in the achievable error exponent compared to the centralized case. The gap is due to the network imbalance caused by the local weights that each node chooses to weigh the messages received from its neighbors. To close this gap, a modified learning rule is proposed and shown to achieve error exponents as large as those in the centralized setup. This implies that there is essentially no first-order penalty caused by decentralization in the exponentially decaying rate of error probabilities. To elucidate the price of decentralization, further analysis on the higher-order asymptotics of the error probability is conducted. It turns out that the price is at most a constant multiplicative factor in the error probability, equivalent to an o(1/t) additive gap in the error exponent, where t is the number of samples observed by each agent in the network and the number of rounds of information exchange. This constant depends on the network connectivity and captures the level of network imbalance. Results of simulation on the error probability supporting our learning rule are shown. Further discussions and extensions of results are also presented.},

We test whether the quantum system is correlated to the classical system or is independent of it. Here, the null hypothesis is composed of states having the quantum system is correlated to the classical system in an arbitrarily varying form. The second problem is the problem of reliable communication over classical-quantum arbitrarily varying multiple access channels (CQ-AVMAC) and establishing its capacity region by giving multiple achievability techniques. We prove that each of these techniques is optimal by proving a converse. Further, for both these techniques, the decoder designed is a universal decoder and can achieve any rate pair in the capacity region without time sharing and also these decoders do not depend on the channel and therefore they are universal. Our result covers the case when the channel parameter is continuous, which has not been studied even in the classical case. Further, both these techniques can be easily generalized to the case when there are T(T &gt; 2) senders. The design of each of these decoders is based on the study of multiple independence testing. This approach allows us to study the problem of reliable communication over CQ-AVMAC from the point of view of hypothesis testing. Further, we also give a necessary and sufficient condition for the deterministic code capacity region of CQ-AVMAC to be non-empty.},

Finding the error locator polynomial is one of the key steps in the error correction procedure of RS codes. Modular Approach (MA) is an effective algorithm for solving the Welch-Berlekamp (WB) key-equation problem to find the error locator polynomial that needs 2t steps, where t is the error correction capability. In this paper, we first present a new MA algorithm that only requires 2e steps and then propose two fast decoding algorithms for RS codes based on our MA algorithm, where e is the number of errors and e ≤ t. We propose the Improved-Frequency Domain Modular Approach (I-FDMA) algorithm that needs 2e steps to solve the error locator polynomial and present our first decoding algorithm based on the I-FDMA algorithm. We show that, compared with the existing methods based on MA algorithms, our I-FDMA algorithm can effectively reduce the decoding complexity of RS codes when e &lt; t. Furthermore, we propose the t0-Shortened I-FDMA (t0-SI-FDMA) algorithm (t0 is a predetermined even number less than 2t – 1) based on the new termination mechanism to solve the error number e quickly. We propose our second decoding algorithm based on the SI-FDMA algorithm for RS codes and show that the multiplication complexity of our second decoding algorithm is lower than our first decoding algorithm (the I-FDMA decoding algorithm) when 2e &lt; t0 + 1.},

Charlie uses local and pairwise shared randomness to compute a bivariate function of the measurement outcomes. The objective of three agents is to faithfully simulate the given distributed quantum measurement acting on the given quantum state while minimizing the communication and shared randomness rates. We demonstrate a new inner bound to the rate region using random structured POVMs based on asymptotically good algebraic codes, and characterize the performance limit using single-letter quantum mutual information quantities. This new bound subsumes the largest known inner bound and improves upon it strictly for identified examples. One of the challenges in analyzing these structured POVMs is that they exhibit only pairwise independence and induce only uniform single-letter distributions. We address these in the non-commutative quantum setting, and provide a two-party distributed faithful simulation and function computation protocol.},

  abstract     = {We consider unsourced random access (uRA) in a cell-free (CF) user-centric wireless network, where a large number of potential users compete for a random access slot, while only a finite subset is active. The random access users transmit codewords of length L symbols from a shared codebook, which are received by B geographically distributed radio units (RUs), each equipped with M antennas. Our goal is to devise and analyze a centralized decoder to detect the transmitted messages (without prior knowledge of the active users) and estimate the corresponding channel state information. A specific challenge lies in the fact that, due to the geographically distributed nature of the CF network, there is no fixed correspondence between codewords and large-scale fading coefficients (LSFCs). This makes current activity detection approaches which make use of this fixed LSFC-codeword association not directly applicable. To overcome this problem, we propose a scheme where the access codebook is partitioned in location-based subcodes, such that users in a particular location make use of the corresponding subcode. The joint message detection and channel estimation is obtained via a novel Approximated Message Passing (AMP) algorithm for a linear superposition of matrix-valued sources corrupted by noise. The statistical asymmetry in the fading profile and message activity leads to different statistics for the matrix sources, which distinguishes the AMP formulation from previous cases. In the regime where the codebook size scales linearly with L, while B and M are fixed, we present a rigorous high-dimensional (but finite-sample) analysis of the proposed AMP algorithm. Exploiting this, we then present a precise (and rigorous) large-system analysis of the message missed-detection and false-alarm rates, as well as the channel estimation mean-square error. The resulting system allows the seamless formation of user-centric clusters and very low latency beamformed uplink-downlink communication without explicit user-RU association, pilot allocation, and power control. This makes the proposed scheme highly appealing for low-latency random access communications in CF networks.},

  abstract     = {The goal of the trace reconstruction problem is to recover a string x ϵ {0, 1}n given many independent traces of x, where a trace is a subsequence obtained from deleting bits of x independently with some given probability p ϵ [0; 1): A recent result of Chase (STOC 2021) shows how x can be determined (in exponential time) from exp(O(n1/5)log5 n) traces. This is the state-of-the-art result on the sample complexity of trace reconstruction. In this paper we consider two kinds of algorithms for the trace reconstruction problem. We first observe that the bound of Chase, which is based on statistics of arbitrary length-k subsequences, can also be obtained by considering the “k-mer statistics”, i.e., statistics regarding occurrences of contiguous k-bit strings (a.k.a, k-mers) in the initial string x, for k = 2n1/5. Mazooji and Shomorony (arXiv.2210.10917) show that such statistics (called k-mer density map) can be estimated within ε accuracy from poly(n, 2k, 1/ε) traces. We call an algorithm to be k-mer-based if it reconstructs x given estimates of the k-mer density map. Such algorithms essentially capture all the analyses in the worst-case and smoothed-complexity models of the trace reconstruction problem we know of so far. Our first, and technically more involved, result shows that any k-mer-based algorithm for trace reconstruction must use exp(Ω(n1/5√log n)) traces, thus establishing the optimality of this number of traces. The analysis of this result also shows that the analysis technique used by Chase (STOC 2021) is essentially tight, and hence new techniques are needed in order to improve the worst-case upper bound. This result is shown by considering an appropriate class of real polynomials, that have been previously studied in the context of trace estimation (De, O’Donnell, Servedio. Annals of Probability 2019; Nazarov, Peres. STOC 2017), and proving that two of these polynomials are very close to each other on an arc in the complex plane. Our proof of the proximity of such polynomials uses new technical ingredients that allow us to focus on just a few coefficients of these polynomials. Our second, simple, result considers the performance of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE), which specifically picks the source string that has the maximum likelihood to generate the samples (traces). We show that the MLE algorithm uses a nearly optimal number of traces, i.e., up to a factor of n in the number of samples needed for an optimal algorithm, and show that this factor of n loss may be necessary under general “model estimation” settings.},

  abstract     = {In order to explore how blind interference alignment (BIA) schemes may take advantage of side-information in computation tasks, we study the degrees of freedom (DoF) of a K user wireless network setting that arises in full-duplex wireless MapReduce applications. In this setting the receivers are assumed to have reconfigurable antennas and channel knowledge, while the transmitters have neither, i.e., the transmitters lack channel knowledge and are only equipped with conventional antennas. The central ingredient of the problem formulation is the message structure arising out of the Shuffle phase of MapReduce, whereby each transmitter has a subset of messages that need to be delivered to various receivers, and each receiver has a subset of messages available to it in advance as side-information. We approach this problem by decomposing it into distinctive stages that help identify key ingredients of the overall solution. The novel elements that emerge from the first stage, called broadcast with groupcast messages, include an outer maximum distance separable (MDS) code structure at the transmitter, and an algorithm for iteratively determining groupcast-optimal reconfigurable antenna switching patterns at the receiver to achieve intra-message (among the symbols of the same message) alignment. The next stage, called unicast with side-information, reveals optimal inter-message (among symbols of different messages) alignment patterns to exploit side-information, and by a relabeling of messages, connects to the desired MapReduce setting.},

The Ziv-Zakai technique relies on connecting the bound to an M-ary hypothesis testing problem. There are three versions of the Ziv-Zakai bound (ZZB): the first version relies on the so-called valley-filling function, the second one is a relaxation of the first bound which omits the valleyfilling function, and the third one, namely the single-point ZZB (SZZB), replaces the integration present in the first two bounds with a single point maximization. The first part of this paper focuses on providing the most general version of the bounds. It is shown that these bounds hold without any assumption on the distribution of the estimand. This makes the bounds applicable to discrete and mixed distributions. Then, the SZZB is extended to an M-ary setting and a version of it that holds for the multivariate setting is provided. In the second part, general properties of these bounds are provided. First, unlike the Bayesian Cramér-Rao bound, it is shown that all the versions of the ZZB tensorize. Second, a characterization of the high-noise asymptotic is provided, which is used to argue about the tightness of the bounds. Third, a complete low-noise asymptotic is provided under the assumptions of mixedinput distributions and Gaussian additive noise channels. In the low-noise, it is shown that the ZZB is generally tight, but there are examples for which the SZZB is not tight. In the third part, the tightness of the bounds is evaluated. First, it is shown that in the low-noise regime the ZZB without the valley-filling function, and, therefore, also the ZZB with the valley-filling function, are tight for mixed-input distributions and Gaussian additive noise channels. Second, for discrete inputs it is shown that the ZZB with the valley-filling function is always sub-optimal, and equal to zero without the valley-filling function. Third, unlike for the ZZB, an example is shown for which the SZZB is tight to the MMSE for discrete inputs. Fourth, sufficient and necessary conditions for the tightness of the bounds are provided. Finally, some examples are provided in which the bounds in the Ziv-Zakai family outperform other well-known Bayesian lower bounds, namely the Cramér-Rao bound and the maximum entropy bound.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present a class of codes, referred to as random staircase generator matrix codes (SGMCs), which have staircase-like generator matrices. In the infinite-length region, we prove that the random SGMC is capacity-achieving over binary-input output-symmetric (BIOS) channels. In the finite-length region, we propose the generalized representative ordered statistics decoding with local constraints (LC-ROSD) algorithm for the SGMCs. The most distinguished feature of the SGMCs with LC-ROSD is that the staircase-like matrices enable parallel implementation of the Gaussian elimination (GE), avoiding the serial GE of conventional OSD and supporting a potential low decoding latency, as implied from simulations. To analyze the performance of random SGMCs in the finite-length region, we derive the ensemble weight spectrum and invoke the conventional union bound. We also derive a partially random coding union (RCU) bound, which is tighter than the conventional one and is used as a criterion to design the SGMCs. Staircase-like generator matrices allow us to derive a series of (tighter and tighter) lower bounds based on the second-order Bonferroni inequality with the incremental number of codewords. The numerical results show that the decoding performance can match well with the proposed partially RCU bound for different code rates and different profiles. The numerical results also show that the tailored SGMCs with the LC-ROSD algorithm can approach the finite-length performance bound, outperforming the 5G low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, 5G polar codes, and Reed-Muller (RM) codes.},

We then optimize the parameters of our code in the asymptotic regime where the average error probability ϵ remains a constant as the average decoding time N approaches infinity. Our second-order achievability bound is an improvement of Polyanskiy et al.’s (2011) achievability bound. We also develop a universal VLF code that does not rely on the knowledge of the underlying channel parameters. Our universal VLF code employs the empirical mutual information as its decoding metric and universalizes the code by Polyanskiy et al. (2011). We derive a second-order achievability bound for universal VLF codes. Our results for both VLF and universal VLF codes are extended to the additive white Gaussian noise channel with an average power constraint. The former yields an improvement over Truong and Tan’s (2017) achievability bound. The proof of our results for universal VLF codes uses a refined version of the method of types and an asymptotic expansion from the nonlinear renewal theory literature.},

In this paper, we study two classes of extended twisted generalized Reed-Solomon (ETGRS) codes involving their non-GRS MDS properties, covering radii, and deep holes. In other words, we obtain two classes of non-GRS MDS codes with known covering radii and deep holes. As applications, we further directly derive more non-GRS MDS codes, and get some results on the existence of their error-correcting pairs. As a byproduct, we find some connections between the well-known Roth-Lempel codes and these two classes ETGRS codes.},

Hence it is a challenging task to construct non-Reed-Solomon type cyclic MDS codes. In this work, we obtain many new cyclic MDS codes for certain parameters by determining the solutions of the system of polynomial equations.

Analog transmitters hold sequences of analog values. Some functions of these distributed values (but not the values themselves) need to be conveyed to the receiver, subject to a fidelity criterion such as mean squared error (MSE) or a certain maximum error with given confidence. For the case in which the computed function for the analog transmitters is a sum of values in –[1, 1], we derive inner and outer bounds for the tradeoff of digital and analog rates of communication under peak and average power constraints for digital transmitters and a peak power constraint for analog transmitters. We then extend the achievability result to a class of functions that includes all linear and some non-linear functions. This extended scheme works over fading channels as long as full channel state information is available at the transmitter. The practicality of our proposed communication scheme is shown in channel simulations that use a version of the scheme based on low density parity check (LDPC) coding. We evaluate the system performance for different block lengths and Gaussian as well as non-Gaussian noise distributions.},

  abstract     = {We study the Distributed Wireless Link Scheduling (DWLS) problem: there is a set of n autonomous stations, called senders, each with a message to be delivered to some other station, called receiver. The names and locations of all stations are arbitrarily selected and unknown to each other, to mirror an arbitrary scenario that may occur in mobile communication. Each pair ((sender,receiver),message) is called a request, and the event of successfully delivering the message is called the realization of the request. In the DWLS problem, the requests are realized through wireless communication links (which is a conceptual notion of two nodes being capable of direct wireless delivery of a message) between the stations. The decision to transmit a message is made locally by each station. We consider networks where communication links may interfere with each other, where the interference is an arbitrary input function of each pair of links, customarily called affectance; if the total affectance of other links whose senders are currently transmitting is above a given threshold, the considered transmission is not successful. In the above context, we study the impact of the number of truly random bits used by each link/sender, on the length of the transmission schedules. Specifically, for any set L of n requests with maximum average affectance A(L), we present a deterministic algorithm (i.e., 0 random bits) and a randomized algorithm using O(log A(L) log n) random bits per link. (In this abstract we present formulas in simplified forms, for brevity.) The lengths of their transmission schedules are O(A(L)2 log3 n) and O(A(L) log n), respectively. We then combine both approaches to get a randomized solution using O(log W log n) truly random bits per station with schedules of length O(A(L)2/W log n), for any W ≤ A(L). To the best of our knowledge, our study is a first step towards understanding the trade-offs between randomness and time complexity of Link Scheduling under arbitrary interference. It is particularly important as currently used (in practice) wireless protocols are either deterministic or use a very small random seed of (truly) random bits.},

This comes at the expense of increasing the replication, i.e., the number of workers each partial gradient is computed by. In this work, we propose a way to reduce the replication to s+1 instead of 2s + 1 in the presence of s malicious workers. Our method detects erroneous inputs from the malicious workers, transforming them into erasures. This comes at the expense of s additional local computations at the main node and additional rounds of light communication between the main node and the workers. We define a general framework and give fundamental limits for fractional repetition data allocations. Our scheme is optimal in terms of replication and local computation and incurs a communication cost that is asymptotically, in the size of the dataset, a multiplicative factor away from the derived bound. We furthermore show how additional redundancy can be exploited to reduce the number of local computations and communication cost, or, alternatively, tolerate straggling workers.},

In the non-coherent case, where the CSI is unknown but remains constant during T symbol periods, we first obtain the exact asymptotic capacity for T ≤ 3. Then, we propose a scheme involving uniform signaling in the covariance space and derive a non-asymptotic lower bound on the capacity for an arbitrary block size T. Furthermore, we propose a genie-aided upper bound where the channel is revealed to the receiver. We show that the upper and lower bounds coincide when T is large. In the low SNR regime, we derive the asymptotic capacity up to a vanishing term, which, remarkably, matches our capacity lower bound.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents new variants of the Welch–Berlekamp algorithm that are favorable to hardware implementation. First, we derive the parallel Welch–Berlekamp (PWB) algorithm in a constructive manner based on the properties of solutions to the rational interpolation problem. The algorithm features the simultaneously performed discrepancy computation and polynomial update. Second, we explore the early-termination mechanism of the PWB algorithm for decoding of Reed–Solomon (RS) codes. By introducing the concept of incomplete error locator polynomial, we show that if e ≤ t (where e is the number of errors and t is the error correction capability), the PWB algorithm can be terminated at latest at the completion of the (t + e)-th iteration. This leads to the early-terminating PWB (EPWB) algorithm. Finally, we develop frequency-domain versions of the PWB and EPWB algorithms, namely, FPWB and FEPWB. The key point toward the two algorithms is to replace the update of polynomial coefficients with the update of polynomial evaluations. It is worth noting that the FEPWB algorithm applies only to shortened RS codes. Furthermore, an efficient systolic architecture for the FPWB algorithm is designed, which is easily adapted for the FEPWB algorithm.},

  abstract     = {A typical setup in many machine learning scenarios involves a server that holds a model and a user that possesses data, and the challenge is to perform inference while safeguarding the privacy of both parties. Private Inference has been extensively explored in recent years, mainly from a cryptographic standpoint via techniques like homomorphic encryption and multiparty computation. These approaches often come with high computational overhead and may degrade the accuracy of the model. In our work, we take a different approach inspired by the Private Information Retrieval literature. We view private inference as the task of retrieving inner products of parameter vectors with the data, a fundamental operation in many machine learning models. We introduce schemes that enable such retrieval of inner products for models with quantized (i.e., restricted to a finite set) weights; such models are extensively used in practice due to a wide range of benefits. In addition, our schemes uncover a fundamental tradeoff between user and server privacy. Our information-theoretic approach is applicable to a wide range of problems and robust in privacy guarantees for both the user and the server.},

To accomplish this, the paper first derives tighter upper bounds for the gap size in both periodic and aperiodic scenarios under the assumption that all frequencies within the designated frequency slot set are fully utilized. Subsequently, this paper proposes a class of wide-gap frequency hopping sequences (WGFHSs) and a class of multi-timeslot wide-gap frequency hopping sequences (MTWGFHSs), both of which simultaneously exhibit optimal NHZ length and optimal gap.},

This generalization which we term &quot;higher-order staircase codes&quot; arises from the marriage of two distinct combinatorial objects: difference triangle sets and finite-geometric nets, which have typically been applied separately to code design. We demonstrate one possible realization of these codes, obtaining powerful, high-rate, low-error-floor, and low-complexity coding schemes based on simple iterative syndrome-domain decoding of coupled Hamming component codes. We anticipate that the proposed codes could improve performance–complexity–latency tradeoffs in high-throughput communications applications, most notably fiber-optic, in which classical staircase codes and zipper codes have been applied. We consider the construction of difference triangle sets having minimum scope and sum-of-lengths, which lead to memory-optimal realizations of higher-order staircase codes. These results also enable memory reductions for early families of convolutional codes constructed from difference triangle sets.},

Not only does this determine the ultimate performance of entanglement testing, but it also establishes the reversibility of all quantum resource theories under asymptotically resource non-generating operations, with the regularised relative entropy of resource governing the asymptotic transformation rate between any two quantum states. As a by-product, we prove that the same Stein exponent can also be achieved when the null hypothesis is only approximately i.i.d., in the sense that it can be modelled by an ‘almost power state’. To solve the problem we introduce two techniques. The first is a procedure that we call ‘blurring’, which, informally, transforms a permutationally symmetric state by making it more evenly spread across nearby type classes. Blurring alone suffices to prove the generalised Stein’s lemma in the fully classical case, but not in the quantum case. Our second technical innovation, therefore, is to perform a second quantisation step to lift the problem to an infinite-dimensional bosonic quantum system; we then solve it there by using techniques from continuous-variable quantum information. Rather remarkably, the second-quantised action of the blurring map corresponds to a pure loss channel. A careful examination of this second quantisation step is the core of our quantum solution.},

We do so in the highly general setting in which the interarrival times pertaining to the tagged stream can have any distribution, and also the service times of both the tagged stream and the background stream are generally distributed. The packet arrival times of the background process are assumed to constitute a Poisson process, which is justified by the fact that it typically is a superposition of many relatively homogeneous streams. The first main contribution is that we derive an expression for the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the AoI in the resulting GI+M/GI+GI/1 model. Second, we use stochastic ordering techniques to identify tight stochastic bounds on the AoI, leading to an explicit lower and upper bound on the mean AoI. In addition, when approximating the tagged stream’s inter-generation times through a phase-type distribution (which can be done at any precision), we present a computational algorithm for the mean AoI. As illustrated through a sequence of numerical experiments, the analysis enables us to assess the impact of background traffic on the AoI of the tagged stream. It turns out that the upper bound on the mean AoI is remarkably close to its true value, which yields an explicit expression (in terms of the model parameters) for an accurate proxy of the AoI-minimizing generation rate.},

In this work, we present a new quantity, the zero-error unitary capacity, and show that it can be succinctly represented as the tensor product value of a quantum game. By studying the structure of finite automata, we show that the unitary capacity is within a controllable factor of the zero-error capacity. This allows new upper bounds through the sum-of-squares hierarchy, which converges to the commuting operator value of the game. Under the conjecture that the commuting operator and tensor product value of this game are equal, this would yield an algorithm for computing the zero-error capacity.},

Our first lower bound is derived from a connection between insdel codes and matchings in special hypergraphs. This lower bound, together with our upper bound, shows that for fixed block length n and edit distance d, when q is sufficiently large, the maximum size of insdel codes is qn-d/2 + 1/(dn/2 - 1)(1 ± o(1)).

  abstract     = {Due to the non-convex nature of training Deep Neural Network (DNN) models, their effectiveness relies on the use of non-convex optimization heuristics. Traditional methods for training DNNs often require costly empirical methods to produce successful models and do not have a clear theoretical foundation. In this study, we examine the use of convex optimization theory and sparse recovery models to refine the training process of neural networks and provide a better interpretation of their optimal weights. We focus on training two-layer neural networks with piecewise linear activations and demonstrate that they can be formulated as a finite-dimensional convex program. These programs include a regularization term that promotes sparsity, which constitutes a variant of group Lasso. We first utilize semi-infinite programming theory to prove strong duality for finite width neural networks and then we express these architectures equivalently as high dimensional convex sparse recovery models. Remarkably, the worst-case complexity to solve the convex program is polynomial in the number of samples and number of neurons when the rank of the data matrix is bounded, which is the case in convolutional networks. To extend our method to training data of arbitrary rank, we develop a novel polynomial-time approximation scheme based on zonotope subsampling that comes with a guaranteed approximation ratio. We also show that all the stationary points of the nonconvex training objective can be characterized as the global optimum of a subsampled convex program. Our convex models can be trained using standard convex solvers without resorting to heuristics or extensive hyper-parameter tuning unlike non-convex methods. Due to the convexity, optimizer hyperparameters such as initialization, batch sizes, and step size schedules have no effect on the final model. Through extensive numerical experiments, we show that convex models can outperform traditional non-convex methods and are not sensitive to optimizer hyperparameters. The code for our experiments is available at https://github.com/pilancilab/convex_nn.},

Ye and Barg (IEEE TIT, 2017) leveraged permutation matrices and Reed-Solomon type codes to devise 7 explicit constructions for constructing MDS array codes with optimal repair property (as known as MSR codes) or even optimal access property. Drawing inspiration from these explicit constructions, we provide two generic constructions for constructing MSR codes from high-rate MDS codes or MDS array codes. In this paper, we introduce the concepts of s-pairwise MDS codes sets and s-pairwise MDS array codes sets. Two generic constructions (Generic Constructions I and II) for constructing the MSR code using the s-pairwise MDS codes sets or the s-pairwise MDS array codes sets are given. Constructions 1 to 3 proposed by Ye and Barg can be regarded as some special cases of Generic Construction I, and Constructions 1 to 3 proposed by Li et al. (IEEE TCOM, 2024) can be regarded as some special cases of Generic Construction II. It is worth mentioning that Generic Construction II can be applied to any finite field, including the binary field. We also demonstrate how to obtain the s-pairwise MDS code sets and the s-pairwise MDS array code sets from a high-rate MDS code or MDS array code over Fq. We obtain a novel class of MSR codes by utilizing the MDS array codes provided by Lv et al. (IEEE TIT, 2023) as component codes according to Generic Construction II. As a byproduct of Constructions 4 to 7 in (IEEE TIT, 2017), we obtain a new class of MSR codes with optimal access property. Using two types of sets Γ1 and Γ2 with the property that matrices commute, we present several new constructions for MSR codes with the optimal access property over any finite field. In this paper, compared with the constructions over binary field proposed by Li et al.

In this paper, we propose a novel and statistically optimal spectral algorithm. Unlike the existing methods which use {UjU1⊤}j≥2, ours constructs an anchor matrix M by aggregating useful information from all of the block submatrices and estimates the latent permutations through {UjM⊤}j≥1. This modification overcomes a crucial limitation of the existing methods caused by the repetitive use of U1 and leads to an improved numerical performance.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the capacity of finite-state channels (FSCs) with feedback. We derive an upper bound on the feedback capacity of FSCs by extending the duality upper bound method from mutual information to the case of directed information. The upper bound is expressed as a multi-letter expression that depends on a test distribution on the sequence of channel outputs. For any FSC, we show that if the test distribution is structured on a Q-graph, the upper bound can be formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) whose state being a belief on the channel state. In the case of FSCs and states that are either unifilar or have a finite memory, the MDP state simplifies to take values in a finite set. Consequently, the MDP consists of a finite number of states, actions, and disturbances. This finite nature of the MDP is of significant importance, as it ensures that dynamic programming algorithms can solve the associated Bellman equation to establish analytical upper bounds, even for channels with large alphabets. We demonstrate the simplicity of computing bounds by establishing the capacity of a broad family of Noisy Output is the State (NOST) channels as a simple closed-form analytical expression. Furthermore, we introduce novel, nearly optimal analytical upper bounds on the capacity of the Noisy Ising channel.},

  abstract     = {For a multi-source multi-terminal noiseless network, the multicast key-dissemination problem, here called the key-cast problem, involves the task of multicasting a (secret) key K from the network sources to its terminals. Unlike traditional communication, where messages must be delivered from source to destination(s) unchanged, key-cast is more flexible since key-cast need not require source reconstruction at destination nodes. Instead, the distributed key can be a mixture of sources from which the sources themselves may be unrecoverable. Key-cast (also known as secret key agreement) in memoryless networks has seen significant studies over the past decades. This work initiates the study of key-cast in noiseless networks, i.e., network coding, and addresses the similarities and differences between traditional forms of communication that require source reconstruction and the less constrained form of communication in the key-cast task. The study varies according to three criteria. The setting can be secure, in which case the shared key is not revealed to an eavesdropper (whose capabilities we constrain), or non-secure, in which case the key need not be hidden. The setting can have one or multiple source nodes capable of generating independent randomness to be used in the key generation process. And the setting can have one or multiple terminal sets, where the latter case is referred to as multiple key-cast. In multiple key-cast, one requires that terminals in each terminal set decode a different shared key. In the given settings, this work derives combinatorial conditions for key-cast and multiple key-cast and designs corresponding communication schemes. In addition, the study compares the key-cast rate with and without the restriction of source reconstruction that is needed in traditional forms of communication. Key-cast achieves a strict advantage in rate when source reconstruction is relaxed.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we show a polar coding scheme for the deletion channel with a probability of error that decays roughly like 2−√Λ, where Λ is the length of the codeword. That is, the same decay rate as that of seminal polar codes for memoryless channels. This is stronger than prior art in which the square root is replaced by a cube root. Our coding scheme is similar yet distinct from prior art. The main differences are: 1) Guard-bands are placed in almost all polarization levels; 2) Trellis decoding is applied to the whole received word, and not to segments of it. As before, the scheme is capacity-achieving. The price we pay for this improvement is a higher decoding complexity, which is nonetheless still polynomial, O(Λ4).},

  abstract     = {We consider entanglement-assisted communication over the qubit depolarizing channel under the security requirement of covert communication, where the transmission itself must be concealed from detection by an adversary. Previous work showed that O(√ n) information bits can be reliably and covertly transmitted in n channel uses without entanglement assistance. However, Gagatsos et al. (2020) showed that entanglement assistance can increase this scaling to O(√ n log n) for continuous-variable bosonic channels. Here, we present a finite-dimensional parallel, and show that O(√ n log n) covert bits can be transmitted reliably over n uses of a qubit depolarizing channel. The coding scheme employs “weakly” entangled states such that the squared amplitude scales as O(1/√ n).},

  abstract     = {We study codes that can correct backtracking errors during nanopore sequencing. In this channel, a sequence of length n over an alphabet of size q is being read by a sliding window of length ℓ, where from each window we obtain only its composition. Backtracking errors cause some windows to repeat, hence manifesting as tandem-duplication errors of fixed length k in the ℓ-read vector of window compositions. While existing constructions for duplication-correcting codes can be straightforwardly adapted to this model, even resulting in optimal codes, their asymptotic rate is hard to find. In the regime of unbounded number of duplication errors, we either give the exact asymptotic rate of optimal codes, or bounds on it, depending on the values of k, ℓ and q. In the regime of a constant number of duplication errors, t, we find the redundancy of optimal codes to be t logq n + O(1) when ℓ|k, and only upper bounded by this quantity otherwise.},

  abstract     = {We approach two interconnected problems of quantum information processing in networks: Conference key agreement and entanglement distillation, both in the so-called source model where the given resource is a multipartite quantum state and the players interact over public classical channels to generate the desired correlation. The first problem is the distillation of a conference key when the source state is shared between a number of legal players and an eavesdropper; the eavesdropper, apart from starting off with this quantum side information, also observes the public communication between the players. The second is the distillation of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states by means of local operations and classical communication (LOCC) from the given mixed state. These problem settings extend our previous paper [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 68(2):976-988, 2022], and we generalise its results: using a quantum version of the task of communication for omniscience, we derive novel lower bounds on the distillable conference key from any multipartite quantum state by means of non-interacting communication protocols. Secondly, we establish novel lower bounds on the yield of GHZ states from multipartite mixed states. Namely, we present two methods to produce bipartite entanglement between sufficiently many nodes so as to produce GHZ states. Next, we show that the conference key agreement protocol can be made coherent under certain conditions, enabling the direct generation of multipartite GHZ states.},

  abstract     = {In the implementation of quantum information systems, one type of Pauli error, such as phase-flip errors, may occur more frequently than others, like bit-flip errors. For this reason, quantum error-correcting codes that handle asymmetric errors are critical to mitigating the impact of such impairments. To this aim, several asymmetric quantum codes have been proposed. These include variants of surface codes like the XZZX and ZZZY surface codes, tailored to preserve quantum information in the presence of error asymmetries. In this work, we propose two classes of Calderbank, Shor and Steane (CSS) topological codes, referred to as cylindrical and Möbius codes, particular cases of the fiber bundle family. Cylindrical codes maintain a fully planar structure, while Möbius codes are quasi-planar, with minimal non-local qubit interactions. We construct these codes employing the algebraic chain complexes formalism, providing theoretical upper bounds for the logical error rate. Our results demonstrate that cylindrical and Möbius codes outperform standard surface codes when using the minimum weight perfect matching (MWPM) decoder.},
