  abstract     = {The air suspension is an advanced suspension system for vibration suppression of vehicles. However, the real-time controllability of the air suspension is weak due to the time-delay characteristics of the air spring. This study designs a novel magnetorheological semi-active air suspension (MSAS) system and examines the fault characteristics of the MSAS system to improve the performance of vibration suppression. First, the generalized fuzzy hysteresis (GFH) model is novelly proposed to approximate the hysteresis nonlinearity of the MRF damper. Then, the MSAS model with various fault modes is constructed to study the dynamic performance of the MSAS system under different fault modes. Furthermore, the intermediate estimator is adopted to detect the generation of the sensor and actuator faults. Based on the fault estimation, a reinforcement learning-based fault-tolerant (RLF) controller is proposed to improve the dynamic performance of the MSAS system. Moreover, a double wishbone suspension (DWS) is built to examine the effectiveness of the proposed RLF controller. Experimental results show that the dynamic performance of the MSAS system with the proposed RLF controller is improved in comparison with the MSAS system with the model-based controllers and the passive suspension.},

This article develops a double Q Learning based adaptive fuzzy attention inference (FAI) to control a microgrid connected to the grid. Detailed dynamic modeling is presented with renewable sources such as photovoltaic (PV), wind, fuel, and microalternators with respective power electronics interfaces. The inference scheme controls the phase angle of the static compensator (STATCOM) coupled with capacitive energy storage device in the microgrid. STATCOM provides reactive power, while the capacitive storage corrects real power imbalances. Numerical results showed the developed control scheme restores stability rapidly in the event of severe symmetrical three-phase to ground fault on the grid bus. Rule base and corresponding membership function of the inference dynamically adapts based on the double Q learning mechanics. Prioritized experience and shallow neural net reward model are integrated where importance sampling of the temporal difference based rewards, contributes to overcomes microgrid transients. The proposed control outperform conventional optimized PID, MP (model predictive), and SM (sliding mode) control schemes to restore normal operation of the converters across different levels of electromechanical transients.},

  abstract     = {In reality, the laborious nature of label annotation leads to the widespread existence of limited labeled data. Moreover, multi-scale data have received widespread attention due to its rich knowledge representation. However, current research on multi-scale data primarily focuses on supervised learning environments, while semi-supervised feature selection for multi-scale data with limited labels remains inadequately explored. Meanwhile, existing studies on multi-scale data often emphasize selecting optimal scales and further conducting feature selection, but this strategy may result in losing potentially valuable information from other scales. To overcome these limitations, by adopting a multi-scale fuzzy information fusion mechanism, this article proposes two new semi-supervised feature selection approaches for multi-scale data with limited labels from both global and local perspectives. Initially, by fusing fuzzy information at various scales, a label learning method is proposed to convert the decision of missing labels into a fuzzy decision of label distribution. Subsequently, label-distributed multi-scale fuzzy global and local rough sets are constructed from global and local perspectives, respectively. Based on the two models, two semi-supervised feature selection algorithms are developed based on global and local multi-scale fuzzy information fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to other advanced feature selection algorithms, the two proposed algorithms can effectively handle multi-scale data with limited labels and exhibit superior classification performance, computational efficiency and robustness.},

  abstract     = {Unsupervised domain adaptation that relies on data matching can raise privacy concerns when leveraging transferable knowledge from the source domain(s). To address this issue, source-free domain adaptation has been proposed and subsequently developed. However, privacy risks persist due to potential data leaks from model inversion attacks even when using only source models without accessing the source data directly. Alongside this, another underexplored problem is feature heterogeneity across multiple source domains. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy domain adaptation method, FuzHDA, that learns fuzzy rules from heterogeneous teacher models, even when these models are black boxes. The proposed method first trains heterogeneous source models privately on individual devices without sharing any information, including neither data nor model parameters. Then, using a memory bank that stores all target predictions from the pre-trained source models, we apply a self-knowledge distillation approach to train a target model which simulates the predictions from these heterogeneous source teachers. After completing the target model, a cross-modality hybrid model leveraging prompt learning and uncovering causal factors is fine-tuned via self-supervision at the last step to facilitate transfer performance. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed FuzHDA.},

To protect players&#39; sensitive information, Laplace noise is added on shared messages among players to perturb the raw information. By combining with the heavy-ball method, Nesterov gradient descent strategy and the consensus protocol, a momentum-based auxiliary system is designed to generate the Nash equilibrium signals with differential privacy guarantee with the help of the fixed gradient step size. And a weakening factor is adopted to ensure the almost sure convergence of the designed auxiliary system in the presence of noise. Then, we analyze the linear convergence of the auxiliary system to the Nash equilibrium by using the linear systems inequalities. The rigorous differential privacy with a finite cumulative privacy budget without requiring a trade-off between the convergence accuracy and differential privacy is also proven. In addition, an adaptive fuzzy method is used to deal with the unknown nonlinear dynamics and the controller is designed to drive the actions of the players to the neighbourhood of Nash equilibrium with the aid of auxiliary system.

  abstract     = {Multi-passive-sensor target tracking systems (MPSTTs) enable non-contact and covert acquisition of the target status, with bearings processing being a prerequisite for accurately predicting the target behavior over large spatial ranges. However, MPSTTs are prone to fuzziness owing to coordinate coupled and Gaussian truncation errors. To address these challenges, we propose a high-precision robust tracker that uses divide-and-conquer multiple-importance Kalman filtering (DCMIKF) via a fuzzy measure. Specifically, we designed coupling maneuver models and attached their model-truth probabilities as a fuzzy set. The measurements-to-target data association was then formulated as a fuzzy maxima searching problem with soft spatiotemporal causal constraints. The proposed approach enables the integration of all available information to derive the fuzzy measure, dividing the hybrid state estimation into variable-structure model estimation and model-conditioned filtering. Simultaneously, DCMIKF combines importance prediction with constrained convex measurement updating using KF and fuses the outputs via fuzzy model probability. Besides, it offers a purely mathematical approach for quantifying the average fuzziness yielded from the fuzzy set, thereby smoothing the mismatches between multi-likelihoods, proposal distribution, and target posterior. Simulated and measured results conformed well; compared with the regression Gaussian process motion tracker, DCMIKF overcame the prior hypotheses in machine learning, reducing the problematic cubic complexity in the number of time steps to the linear time complexity; compared to the interacting multiple model minimax particle filter, DCMIKF significantly improves filtering accuracy and tracking robustness.},

This mechanism dynamically adjusts fuzzy control rules in real time, enabling the system to adapt to changing conditions and enhancing its robustness against nonlinear disturbances. Secondly, to alleviate communication overhead and reduce control frequency, an event-triggered impulse strategy is implemented. This strategy activates impulse control only under specific conditions, effectively minimizing control actions while maintaining system consensus. Using Lyapunov stability theory, sufficient conditions for achieving system consensus are established, demonstrating the global consensus and robustness of the MASs under certain criteria.

The nonlinear plant with parameter uncertainty is represented by an interval type-2 fuzzy model, where the membership functions of the fuzzy rules are related to the system mode. Since sojourn information is challenging to obtain in practice, the sojourn time probability density function is considered to be incompletely available. The considered system is more general, not only relaxing the traditional assumption that all the sojourn time probability density functions are completely available but also covering completely available sojourn time probability density functions as a special case. The main innovation is that an observer-based SMC scheme is designed, which makes the discrete nonlinear models have better dynamic performance, and realizes the reachability of discrete quasi-sliding mode. By the interval type-2 fuzzy and classical Lyapunov function, the mean-square stability criterion of the semi-Markov jump models is constructed employing additional matrix variables. Then, an observer-based SMC mechanism is constructed to achieve the reachability of the quasi-sliding mode.

In contrast to MVMD, FMVMD focuses on capturing finer alignment details by leveraging fuzzy clustering techniques. The proposed FMVMD algorithm proceeds through the following steps: Firstly, FMVMD employs a modified clustering algorithm, termed fuzzy C-means (FCM), to categorize sub-modes within each channel into fuzzy clusters based on their contribution to common center frequencies. Secondly, a variational optimization model is formulated, extending the principles of MVMD to accommodate the fuzzy clustering approach used in FMVMD. Finally, an optimization technique called the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is employed to derive the optimal solution for the FMVMD model. Experimental results show that FMVMD achieves a 41% and 28% improvement in center frequency alignment performance compared to MVMD when using two and three fuzzy clusters, respectively, and a 13% improvement compared to GMVMD with the same number of clusters. Under a 25dB SNR condition, FMVMD demonstrates a noise resistance improvement of 44% and 24% compared to MVMD with two and three fuzzy clusters, respectively, and a 37% improvement compared to GMVMD. Validation using EEG data in the forms of bipolar leads and common average reference confirms the effectiveness of FMVMD, achieving consistently favorable results.},

However, reliably utilizing the minimal point-wise annotations for unlabeled data in complex and large-scale scenes is still challenging, such as only 20 points labeled in 2 million points. To tackle this challenge, we propose a new Uncertainty-aware Superpoint Graph Transformer (UaSGT) framework that utilizes minimal annotations for unlabeled data learning through reliable long-range supervision propagation from labeled superpoints to unlabeled superpoints. First, we propose a superpoint graph transformer to achieve long-range supervision propagation along the attention-based fuzzy subsets defined on superpoints. The attention-based fuzzy subset measures the membership of unlabeled superpoints to clusters centered on labeled superpoints. Second, we employ an uncertainty-aware membership rectification technique on the fuzzy subset to ensure reliable propagation among superpoints within the same category. This technique integrates an uncertainty prediction module to mask the influence of unreliable membership and a spatial prior refinement module to reduce uncertainty in intra-class membership degrees. Finally, experimental results on two large-scale benchmarks S3DIS and ScanNet-V2 demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to the state-of-the-art with at least 90% annotation reduction, and our method also achieves comparable performance to fully supervised methods with less than 0.1% labeled points.

  abstract     = {Broad learning system (BLS) is renowned for its excellent generalization and high efficiency in data classification. However, when confronted with class imbalance problems, BLS treats all samples as equally important, resulting in performance degradation. Additionally, the presence of noise and outliers in imbalanced data further complicates BLS&#39;s ability to handle real-world classification problems. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Graph-Embedding Intuitionistic Fuzzy Adaptive Broad Learning System (GEIB). The graph embedding strategy proposed by GEIB leverages the geometric topology of the data and class-specific information, effectively capturing variability among imbalanced samples and improving class separability. Furthermore, we introduce intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) theory. The BLS integrated with it considers both the homogeneity and heterogeneity of sample neighborhoods, enabling it to address uncertainty and imprecision in the data. It further differentiates clean samples from noisy ones in imbalanced datasets, thereby enhancing model robustness. To further investigate the prior distribution information of imbalanced data, we design an adaptive class-specific penalty mechanism based on global distribution and local density information. This mechanism accounts for both intra- and interclass density information and class global distribution. We verify the superiority of our method by conducting a comparison with current approaches using real-world datasets that include both Gaussian noise and noise-free versions.},

  abstract     = {The secondary membership functions (MFs) of type-2 (T2) fuzzy sets (FSs) are generally assumed to be convex, normal, and upper semicontinuous. Although not explicitly stated, this fact can be detected by taking a look at the $\alpha$-cuts of their join and meet in vertical-slice format. These two operations induce $[0,1]_\mathcal {F}$, i.e., the complete lattice of the convex normal upper semicontinuous FSs on $[0, 1]$ together with the so-called convolution order. In this paper, we deduce the $\alpha$-cut representations of suprema and infima over finite and infinite sets that occur in the inference mechanisms of general type-2 (GT2) fuzzy inference systems (FISs). We continue by developing a complete, albeit not distributive, lattice structure for the class of all convex upper semicontinuous FSs on $[0, 1]$, denoted $\mathcal {F}_{CU}$, that permits designing T2 FISs involving T2 FSs whose secondary MFs are not necessarily normal. Using our formulae of the $\alpha$-cuts of suprema and infima in $[0,1]_\mathcal {F}$ and $\mathcal {F}_{CU}$, whose elements we describe using so-called anti-dilations, we prove that $[0,1]_\mathcal {F}$ is a closed sublattice of $\mathcal {F}_{CU}$. We also expand on the lattice-theoretical relations between $[0,1]_\mathcal {F}$ and the complete lattices of the convex (strictly) normal FSs. In addition, we show that $[0,1]_\mathcal {F}$ and $\mathcal {F}_{CU}$ contain complete sublattices of (extended) interval type-2 (IT2) FSs. With these results at hand, it becomes easy to perform the transitions FISs under the minimm t-norm $\to$ (closed) IT2 FISs $\to$ GT2 FISs currently used in practice $\to$ GT2 FISs having not necessarily normal secondary MFs.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the event-triggered $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ filtering problem for interval type-2 fuzzy networked control systems with data loss. The goal of this paper is to design an event-triggered fuzzy filter with adjustable gains to further improve the $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ performance of the filtering error system (FES) while saving communication resources. Firstly, an adaptive event-triggered mechanism (ETM) that utilizes the average filtering error to adaptively adjust the triggered threshold is proposed to mitigate network congestion. In contrast to the existing filtering achievements, the proposed adaptive ETM considers the impact of filtering error on data transmission which can achieve the effect of saving more communication resources. Then, an interval stability theory is applied to adjust the filter gains for achieving the purposes of changing the convergence speed of the FES and improving the $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ performance. Moreover, under the conditions of imperfect communication links, sufficient criteria for designing the $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ filter with adjustable gains are obtained based on the interval stability theory and linear matrix inequalities technique. Finally, the simulation results are utilized for demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed method.},
