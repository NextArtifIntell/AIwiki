  abstract     = {As malware as a service (MaaS) and organized attacks develop and drive a shift in malware variant generation mechanism, current variant detection, designed to counter conventional obfuscation and anti-detection strategies, falls short in facing new challenges, particularly in identifying variants that maintain core functionalities while altering local behaviors, or those sharing similar code logic but diverge in actual functionalities. To tackle the problems, we present ISCMVD, an Instruction Stream-augmented CFG-based Malware Variant Detection scheme, melding control flow structures with machine semantic information from instruction streams within blocks to build a comprehensive functional representation for variants’ basic and detailed behaviors. Leveraging a global-enhanced attentive graph neural network to integrate local and global functional features, we significantly boost the capture of representative stable primary behaviors’ similarity from variants within the same family identifying variants generated under attackers’ code rewriting, module modification, and other transformation means. Additionally, through cross-family associative analysis, we eliminate classification interference of variants’ logic similarities stemming from the same organization generating. Evaluation results on public and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority and robustness of ISCMVD with an average of 99.29% in AC and 99.25% in F1 and perform well even in few-shot cases. What’s more important, we achieve a breakthrough in two special sample sets including variants related to MaaS and APT group, and outperform state-of-the-art methods under the current variant generation mechanism, proving its suitability for future trends.},

  abstract     = {Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning framework that allows multiple clients to collaboratively train an intermediate model with keeping data local, however, sensitive information may be still inferred during exchanging local models. Although homomorphic encryption and multi-party computation are applied into FL solutions to mitigate such privacy risks, they lead to costly communication overhead and long training time. As a result, functional encryption (FE) is introduced into the field of privacy-preserving FL (PPFL) for boosting efficiency and enhancing security. Nevertheless, existing FE-based PPFL frameworks that support dynamic participation either required a trusted third party that may lead to single-point failure, or require multiple rounds of interaction that inevitably incur large communication overhead. Therefore, we propose PrivLDFL, a lightweight and dynamic PPFL framework for resource-constrained devices. Technically, we formalize dynamic decentralized multi-client FE and give instantiations, then present efficiency optimizations via designing a vector compression funnel based on Chinese Remainder Theorem, and finally achieve client dropouts via a client partitioning strategy. Besides formal security analysis on PrivLDFL, we implement it and state-of-the-art solutions on Raspberry Pi to conduct extensive experiments, confirming the practical performance of PrivLDFL on best-known public datasets.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach for collaboratively training machine learning models while preserving data privacy. Due to its decentralized nature, FL is vulnerable to poisoning attacks, where malicious clients compromise the global model through altered data or updates. Identifying such malicious clients is crucial for ensuring the integrity of FL systems. This task becomes particularly challenging under privacy-enhancing protocols such as secure aggregation, creating a fundamental trade-off between privacy and security. In this work, we propose FedGT, a novel framework designed to identify malicious clients in FL with secure aggregation while preserving privacy. Drawing inspiration from group testing, FedGT leverages overlapping groups of clients to identify the presence of malicious clients via a decoding operation. The clients identified as malicious are then removed from the model training, which is performed over the remaining clients. By choosing the size, number, and overlap between groups, FedGT strikes a balance between privacy and security. Specifically, the server learns the aggregated model of the clients in each group—vanilla federated learning and secure aggregation correspond to the extreme cases of FedGT with group size equal to one and the total number of clients, respectively. The effectiveness of FedGT is demonstrated through extensive experiments on three datasets in a cross-silo setting under different data-poisoning attacks. These experiments showcase FedGT’s ability to identify malicious clients, resulting in high model utility. We further show that FedGT significantly outperforms the private robust aggregation approach based on the geometric median recently proposed by Pillutla et al. and the robust aggregation technique Multi-Krum in multiple settings.},

To protect privacy, plenty of methods have been proposed to change identity in the face, thus blocking malicious face recognition. However, these methods fail to satisfy authentication requirements for special application scenarios, e.g., face authentication in surveillance capture. In this paper, we propose a novel face privacy protection model, which supports robust image authentication via information-conditional identity transformation. Specifically, we first introduce a basic face manipulation model (FMM), which can preserve identity-irrelevant attributes when manipulating identity. Based on FMM, we further design a lightweight protector called AIDPro, outputting a transformed identity which is different from the original one and is embedded a message presenting authentication information. Benefiting from the semantic robustness, our model does not require noise layers to achieve accurate message extraction after various image distortions. In addition, the message can be the condition to guide the identity transformation for privacy protection, which avoids extra resource consumption from supporting image authentication. Extensive experimental results demonstrate our model has comparable privacy protection performance, superior attribute preservation performance, and robust authentication performance especially in JPEG compression and screen shooting. Our code is available at https://github.com/daizigege/AIDPro.},

  abstract     = {In privacy-preserving machine learning with vertically distributed data, private entity alignment methods are used to securely match and utilize features of the same samples. However, existing methods not only risk exposing sample intersections and introducing unnecessary samples but also face a gap in adapting to multi-party scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose PEAFOWL, a novel multi-party private entity alignment protocol. PEAFOWL achieves entity alignment among multiple parties through a mapping from original datasets to intersections, termed permutation. This method mitigates intersection disclosure and sample redundancy concerns by avoiding direct use of the intersection. The proposed protocol leverages a cloud server that utilizes secret-shared shuffle to protect the privacy of the permutation, in case of colluding data providers reconstructing intersections. Further, by integrating a seed homomorphic pseudorandom generator, PEAFOWL avoids the intensive communication of secret sharing and achieves superior runtime performance. Additionally, an offline/online variant is introduced to ensure a linear growth in communication and computation complexity relative to the dataset size by pre-computing permutation calculations. Implemented on a real PPML framework, the protocol demonstrates practical efficiency in various multi-party settings. Experimental results indicate that PEAFOWL’s overhead is less than 1% of the total training cost, while the offline/online variant achieves approximately a 50% reduction in online runtime. Overall, PEAFOWL offers an efficient and straightforward solution for multi-party PPML, making it an attractive option for implementation and future improvements.},

In this work, we propose a scheme called MUFTI (Multi-Domain Distillation-based Heterogeneous Federated ConTInuous Learning). On one hand, we have extended domain adaptation to FL via extracting features to obtain feature representations on unlabeled public datasets for collaborative training, narrowing the distance between feature outputs of different models under the same sample. On the other hand, we propose a combining knowledge distillation method to solve the catastrophic forgetting issue. Within a single task, dual-domain distillation is used to avoid data forgetting between different domains; for cross task learning in task flow, the logits output of the previous model is used as the teacher to avoid forgetting old tasks. The experiment results showed that MUFTI had a better performance in accuracy and robustness comparing to state-of-the-art methods. The evaluation also demonstrated that MUFTI could perform well in handling task increment issues, reducing catastrophic forgetting, and achieving trade-offs between multiple objectives.},

  abstract     = {Visible-infrared person re-identification (V-I ReID) seeks to retrieve images of the same individual captured over a distributed network of RGB and IR sensors. Several V-I ReID approaches directly integrate the V and I modalities to represent images within a shared space. However, given the significant gap in the data distributions between V and I modalities, cross-modal V-I ReID remains challenging. A solution is to involve a privileged intermediate space to bridge between modalities, but in practice, such data is not available and requires selecting or creating effective mechanisms for informative intermediate domains. This paper introduces the Adaptive Generation of Privileged Intermediate Information (AGPI2) training approach to adapt and generate a virtual domain that bridges discriminative information between the V and I modalities. AGPI2 enhances the training of a deep V-I ReID backbone by generating and then leveraging bridging privileged information without modifying the model in the inference phase. This information captures shared discriminative attributes that are not easily ascertainable for the model within individual V or I modalities. Towards this goal, a non-linear generative module is trained with adversarial objectives, transforming V attributes into intermediate spaces that also contain I features. This domain exhibits less domain shift relative to the I domain compared to the V domain. Meanwhile, the embedding module within AGPI2 aims to extract discriminative modality-invariant features for both modalities by leveraging modality-free descriptors from generated images, making them a bridge between the main modalities. Experiments conducted on challenging V-I ReID datasets indicate that AGPI2 consistently increases matching accuracy without additional computational resources during inference.},

The improvement of SKG rate is quite a huge challenge, especially in scenarios with untrusted internal helpers or eavesdroppers that aim to wiretap the negotiated secret keys between legitimate parties. In this paper, we propose a token-based SKG scheme to deal with the problem of information leakage with internal eavesdropping attacks. The basic idea is to cover random pilots with protective tokens to confuse eavesdroppers. Three scenarios including passive external eavesdropping, active internal eavesdropping with a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted untrusted helper, and active internal eavesdropping with an untrusted relay are considered and analyzed to evaluate the performance of the proposed anti-eavesdropping scheme. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed token-based SKG scheme can perfectly secure the key negotiation, achieving zero information leakage even in the untrusted relaying scenario without a direct link between Alice and Bob. Moreover, closed-form expressions for secret key capacity (SKC) are obtained. Finally, numerical results indicate that the proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Using a token-generation mapping function with greater diversity in amplitude and phase, our approach achieves enhanced SKC performance across various scenarios, including those with a passive eavesdropper, a RIS-assisted untrusted helper, and an untrusted relay.},

  abstract     = {UAV surveillance offers a unique aerial perspective, enabling the monitoring of large areas and capturing targets from angles that fixed ground cameras cannot achieve. UAV-based object re-identification (ReID) differs from the extensively studied city camera scenarios, as it involves identifying specific objects in aerial images captured from a dynamic bird’s-eye view. The challenge lies in the significant variation in object perspectives and the often uncertain rotational changes captured by UAVs. Existing ReID methods designed for city cameras struggle to adapt to these rotational variations. To address these challenges, we propose a Transformer-based learnable rotation generalization enhancement method specifically for UAV-based ReID. To improve the model’s adaptability to uncertain rotational changes, we introduce a learnable feature-level rotation simulation technique that generates multiple rotated features. Building on this, we design a rotation diversification loss to decorrelate different rotated features, ensuring a rich feature representation. Additionally, to mitigate the negative effects of image-level rotation augmentation, we propose instance-level and distribution-level rotation invariance regularization. This approach establishes explicit associations between images and their rotated counterparts, facilitating the learning of visually consistent rotation-invariant features. Instance-level constraints ensure that detailed features remain consistent during rotation, while distribution-level constraints maintain the model’s semantic understanding. Notably, our method demonstrates strong versatility, covering a wide range of objects, including persons, vehicles, and various animals. Evaluations on multiple UAV-collected person and vehicle ReID datasets, as well as several animal datasets, consistently show outstanding performance, underscoring its robustness and adaptability to the unique challenges posed by UAV-based ReID.},

However, a few efforts have been made to adequately utilize these features for mining identity information. To address this issue, we propose a Region-Specific Network (RSNet) for contactless palm vein authentication. Our RSNet is a dual-branch structure for global and local feature extraction. Firstly, a Region-based Local feature Enhancement Block (RLEB) is proposed at the local branch to extract region-specific features. In the RLEB, the intermediate feature maps are divided into three asymmetrical patches based on the physiological characteristics of palm vein and palm shape for extracting diversified features, enhancing the local feature representation. Then, a Multi-scale Aggregation Block (MAB) is proposed that efficiently aggregates multi-scale features at a more granular level. Furthermore, to guide the global and local branches in learning complementary feature aspects, a difference loss is introduced to apply a soft subspace orthogonality constraint between the global and local vectors during training. The global branch is designed to assist the learning process of local features, without being adopted for inference.

  abstract     = {As a common metric, maximum similarity between two objects is widely employed by web platforms to provide matching services. However, the calculation of maximum similarity involves numerous sensitive or confidential users’ data, and the web platform server is often not trusted who might peep these data out of curiosity, or even worse sell them to unauthorized entities to make profits. Therefore, many research lines on functional encryption have been suggested and studied on how to calculate the maximum similarity while ensure the privacy of users’ data. Unfortunately, all of them will divulge some intermediate results to the web platform server when processing this issue. In this paper we present a new functional encryption scheme supporting privacy-preserving maximum similarity, which enables the web service platforms to figure out the maximum similarity without learning anything else about their data. Moreover, we provide a formal analysis to prove the security of the proposed scheme, followed by some experimental evaluations and comprehensive comparisons with the related works. It shows that, our scheme is the first functional encryption realization on maximum similarity without divulging the intermediate result and meanwhile achieve a higher security-function privacy, as well as a traditional data privacy.},

  abstract     = {As cloud computing continues to gain widespread adoption, safeguarding the confidentiality of data entrusted to third-party cloud service providers becomes a critical concern. While traditional encryption methods offer protection for data at rest and in transit, they fall short when it comes to where it matters the most, i.e., during data processing. To address this limitation, we present HELM, a framework for privacy-preserving data processing using homomorphic encryption. HELM automatically transforms arbitrary programs expressed in a Hardware Description Language (HDL), such as Verilog, into equivalent homomorphic circuits, which can then be efficiently evaluated using encrypted inputs. HELM features three modes of encrypted evaluation: a) a gate mode that consists of Boolean gates, b) a small-precision lookup table mode which significantly reduces the size of the circuit by combining multiple gates into lookup tables, and c) a high-precision lookup table mode tuned for multibit arithmetic evaluations. Finally, HELM introduces a scheduler that leverages the parallelism inherent in arithmetic and Boolean circuits to efficiently evaluate encrypted programs. We evaluate HELM with the ISCAS’85 and ISCAS’89 benchmark suites, as well as real-world applications such as image filtering and neural network inference. In our experimental results, we report that HELM can outperform prior works by up to 65×.},

In this paper, we perform the first systematic security study in this scenario. With in-depth analysis, we identify six new types of vulnerabilities and conduct real-world measurements on the top 500 Alexa Rank websites. Among these websites, 182 (36.4%) use cloud storage services, illustrating the widespread use of the cloud. Then, we perform a detailed analysis of 28 popular websites that allow user uploading. Surprisingly, they all have at least one of the six types of vulnerabilities. In total, we discover 79 new vulnerabilities and responsibly report them to the websites. Many popular websites respond positively, including Google, Reddit, and CSDN. etc. We discuss the root causes of these vulnerabilities and propose possible mitigation methods.

  abstract     = {Is it secure to measure the reliability of local models by similarity in federated learning (FL)? This paper delves into an unexplored security threat concerning applying similarity metrics, such as the L2 norm, Euclidean distance, and cosine similarity, in protecting FL. We first uncover the deficiencies of similarity metrics that high-dimensional local models, including benign and poisoned models, may be evaluated to have the same similarity while being significantly different in the parameter values. We then leverage this finding to devise a novel untargeted model poisoning attack, Faker, which launches the attack by simultaneously maximizing the evaluated similarity of the poisoned local model and the difference in the parameter values. Experimental results based on seven datasets and eight defenses show that Faker outperforms the state-of-the-art benchmark attacks by 1.1-9.0X in reducing accuracy and 1.2-8.0X in saving time cost, which even holds for the case of a single malicious client with limited knowledge about the FL system. Moreover, Faker can degrade the performance of the global model by attacking only once. We also preliminarily explore extending Faker to other attacks, such as backdoor attacks and Sybil attacks. Lastly, we provide a model evaluation strategy, called the similarity of partial parameters (SPP), to defend against Faker. Given that numerous mechanisms in FL utilize similarity metrics to assess local models, this work suggests that we should be vigilant regarding the potential risks of using these metrics.},

This paper presents a watermarking scheme capable of withstanding severe screen-shooting distortion. First, a dataset is constructed to train a screen-shooting distortion simulation network based on style transfer. Subsequently, a comprehensive noise layer is built upon this network to achieve robustness against severe screen-shooting distortion. Additionally, this paper incorporates structural re-parameterization techniques into the traditional U-shaped encoder to improve the quality of encoded images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed scheme’s superior performance in terms of robustness and generalization, especially under severe screen-shooting distortion conditions.},

The rollup, a well-known Layer 2 scaling protocol, uses an aggregate signature scheme based on the succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge (SNARG) to package transactions. The further promotion of rollup faces the challenge of balancing computation efficiency and communication costs. In addition, with the continuous development of quantum computing, a transition to post-quantum cryptography is considered crucial for long-term security. Our main contribution is an aggregate Falcon signature scheme for post-quantum rollup based on a novel SNARG scheme. The proposed SNARG is based on the Plonkish circuit with enhanced custom gates, referred to as the ECG circuit, and a post-quantum multilinear polynomial commitment scheme (PolyCom). The former can represent more complex operations while also controlling the witness scale. The latter realizes quantum-resistant security for the proposed SNARG and the aggregate signature. In comparison to the aggregate signature based on Orion, our scheme achieves lower aggregation and communication costs. Performance analysis indicates a 38% decrease in aggregation time and a 88% decrease in communication costs. As an additional contribution, we introduce a novel polynomial interactive oracle proof (PolyIOP) protocol for the ECG circuit, which can combine with a multilinear PolyCom scheme to form a SNARG protocol with lower computation and communication overhead compared to existing schemes.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the fundamental limits of covert communications covered by randomly activated overt users in both single-frame and multi-frame transmission scenarios. While traditional covert communications mainly consider concealing signal power characteristics, the existence of overt users provides opportunities such that covert communications can be achieved through the confusion between the users. This benefit is first revealed in single-frame transmission scenario. The major obstacle in analyzing performance limits is that the conventional Kullback-Leibler divergence based covertness measurement becomes infinite. To overcome the intractability, a tighter upper bound of the total variation distance (TVD) is then developed using a novel recursive-iterative approximation. On this basis, the collapse effect of the TVD is derived, which shows that the TVD is strictly less than 1 if the covert user sets the transmit power to be an integer multiple of that of the overt users. Then, we find that O(N)-bit information can be transmitted over N channel uses under the above setting, which breaks the well-known square root law. If the above setting is violated, the TVD instantly approaches 1 as N → ∞, and only O(√N)-bit information can be covertly transmitted. To prove this, the detection method of the warden is modified to cope with the random activation of overt users. These conclusions also hold for the transmission with uncertain powers or in fading channels, which resembles realistic wireless transmissions. In multi-frame transmission scenario, however, the access characteristics of overt users can be exposed from a statistical perspective, such that the rate gain disappears and the covert transmission rate drops to O(√N) bits per frame. To obtain a positive covert transmission rate, we propose a ratesplitting based covert transmission scheme that introduces an opportunistic access branch to bring randomness, through which the covert user can transmit up to O(NL)-bit information over L frames.},

  abstract     = {In the reversible data hiding (RDH) community, both prediction and mapping strategies are vital for reducing distortion. With high prediction performance, small prediction errors can be generated to reduce the embedding distortion. Besides, the efficient mapping strategy can improve the practicality. In this paper, we propose a new RDH method for color images by using convolution neural networks (CNNs) for prediction and an efficient 3D mapping strategy for embedding. At first, each color image is elaborately divided into three isolated image sets so that the proposed deep prediction network (DPN) can exploit more neighboring pixels in the current channel and the correlation between three channels. Then, an efficient 3D mapping strategy is luminously designed by using the symmetry of the 3D prediction error histogram (PEH). The symmetry of 3D PEH has been analyzed in statistical and experimental ways. Based on the proposed deep prediction network and efficient 3D mapping strategy (DPEM), we construct an efficient RDH method for color images. The performance of the proposed DPN is evaluated by comparing it with several predictors on different image datasets. The embedding performance has been demonstrated by hiding information in color images, e.g., the average PSNR value of the Kodak dataset is 63.63 dB with an embedding capacity of 50,000 bits. Furthermore, the experimental results on the ImageNet and PASCAL VOC2012 datasets have shown the proposed RDH method is superior to several state-of-the-art RDH methods. With the introduction of deep learning, the development of the RDH method for color images can be promoted.},

Using this technique, we present a numerically-derived upper bound for the achievable secrecy rate in the finite blocklength regime that is tighter than traditional infinite blocklength bounds. We also propose a secrecy coding technique that outperforms random binning codes. When there is one overhead bit, this coding technique is optimum and achieves the newly derived bound. For cases with additional bits of overhead, our coding scheme can achieve equivocation rates close to the new bound. Furthermore, we explore the patterns of the generator matrix and the parity-check matrix for linear codes and we present binning techniques for both linear and nonlinear codes using two different approaches: recursive and non-recursive. To our knowledge, this is the first optimization solution for secrecy coding obtained through linear programming. Our new bounds and codes mark a significant breakthrough towards understanding fundamental limits of performance (and how to achieve them in some instances) for the binary symmetric wiretap channel with real finite blocklength coding constructions. Our techniques are especially useful for codes of small to medium blocklength, such as those that may be required by applications with small payloads, such as the Internet of Things.},

To address this, we propose a principled method based on Kullback-Liebler divergence to design a residual generator that significantly increases the signal-to-noise ratio against BIAs. For systems without integrator vulnerability, our method also enables a trade-off between transient and steady-state detectability.

Moreover, most existing schemes cannot achieve efficient queries and updates while preserving the access pattern. In this paper, we propose an efficient MRQ scheme for hiding volume and access patterns. We first design a joint data index using Order-Revealing Encryption (ORE) and Pseudo-random functions (PRFs) to realize volume-hiding range queries. Then, we combine the private set intersection (PSI) and hardware Software Guard Extensions (SGX) to compute each attribute’s intersection of query results. In addition, we preserve access patterns during queries by designing a batch refresh algorithm and an update protocol.

However, research regarding information-theoretic security in heterogeneous DSSs remains limited. Furthermore, unlike traditional DSSs, the heterogeneous DSSs face eavesdropper with diverse operating patterns, complicating the secrecy models. In this paper, we aim to investigate the secrecy capacity and code constructions for clustered DSSs (CDSSs), a type of heterogeneous DSSs in which the system is divided into clusters with an equal number of nodes and different repair bandwidths for intra-cluster and cross-cluster against two types of eavesdroppers: the occupying-type eavesdropper and the osmotic-type eavesdropper. We construct two CDSS secrecy models tailored to these aforementioned eavesdroppers, derive the upper bounds on adjustable secrecy capacities, and explore the relationships between the upper bounds of perfect secrecy capacities and the number of compromised nodes. Notably, the upper bounds obtained in this paper generalize those of the traditional DSS model. Additionally, we propose three repair-by-transfer code constructions that achieve the secrecy capacity under both eavesdropper scenarios. These codes are based on nested MDS code and represent a generalized form of the minimum bandwidth regenerating (MBR) codes in traditional DSSs.},

  abstract     = {Cloud-edge computing has been widely-adopted for large-scale data sharing and processing. In practical data sharing systems, data are very sensitive and typically encrypted, such as health records. Unauthorized users may attempt to decrypt ciphertexts to recover the data. Due to mistakes or malice, some users might try to share sensitive information with others who do not have access. Clearly, strong access control should be employed to restrict the read and write privilege of users. There was a rich literature on mandatory fine-grained information flow control for such scenarios, but three important issues remain. First, payload privacy was often neglected. Most of the known solutions focused on the protection ciphertext header, but ignored the payload, i.e. encrypted data, which may leak information by a malicious sender. Second, no guarantee of the encrypted data. Ill-formed ciphertexts, e.g. encrypted garbage data, can pass the global policy check, causing decryption failures or disseminating bad information, hence are incapable of content distribution. Finally, the heavy computation cost of sender authentication impedes the practical deployment. In this work, we introduce Hodor, a robust fine-grained information flow control scheme that not only guards the transmission channel with mandatory fine-grained access control for massive data, but also protects whole data traffic, checks ciphertext well-formedness, and efficiently authenticates the sender. In particular, Hodor considers full data traffic protection of both the ciphertext header and encrypted payload to resist information leakage, completely verifies the consistency between the claimed access structure and the actual access structure, and achieves efficient sender authentication with a succinct challenge-response protocol. We present a formal model and give detailed proofs. We also implement and evaluate Hodor using various optimization techniques to boost its performance. The results demonstrate the efficiency and practicality of Hodor for cloud-edge data sharing.},

  abstract     = {Recently intrusion detection technology has been deployed in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), which is an efficacious approach to enhancing security. However, identifying previously unseen and unknown attacks, referred to as the open-set problem, has become increasingly difficult due to the openness of IoT architecture and the continuous evolution of attack patterns. Moreover, existing open-set intrusion detection solutions are challenging to be applied directly to IIoT because of their unique characteristics, such as limited computational and storage capabilities, long detection times, and the inability to continuously learn. In this paper, we propose an efficient, lightweight, and dynamic open-set intrusion detection scheme for IIoT. It consists of three stages: the known attack classification stage focuses on extracting features from known data to efficiently classify normal data and known attacks; the unknown attack recognition stage analyzes the distribution of reconstruction errors to effectively distinguish between known data and unknown attacks; and the dynamic update detection stage introduces a lightweight detection architecture for unknown attacks detection, significantly reducing the computational overhead and storage requirements of IIoT devices. Simultaneously, it learns from and updates with newly detected unknown attacks to further optimize detection capabilities. We conduct experiments on four widely used datasets to evaluate the performance of open-set intrusion detection for IIoT. The experimental results delineate the superiority of our proposed method over four state-of-the-art approaches in open-set intrusion detection. Meanwhile, our proposed lightweight model updating method significantly reduces detection time by over 65% and memory overhead by over 80% compared to retraining methods, while achieving an average detection accuracy of 96%.},

  abstract     = {Federated Learning (FL) allows collaborative training of a Machine Learning (ML) model while preserving data privacy across participating clients. Most existing studies consider FL clients to be proactive and completely honest in their participation. However, in reality, clients might lack the motivation to participate, and malicious behavior among some clients could negatively impact the interests of others. For these reasons, ensuring trust and fairness among FL clients is paramount but remains challenging due to limitations in FL consensus mechanisms and incentive strategies. To address these challenges, we introduce a Trustworthy and Fair FL (TFFL) framework that develops a reputation-based consensus mechanism called Dynamic Reputation Consensus (DRC), where clients’ reputations are dynamically assessed based on subjective opinions by evaluating real-time client behavior. We also incorporate time decay and temporal discounting of TFFL interactions along with the weighted measures of clients’ data quality, performance, and reliability to accurately reflect the evolving nature of client behavior over time. By adaptively adjusting clients’ incentives based on reputations and a cooperative game theory, DRC incentivizes honest participation and discourages malicious intent. In addition, we utilize blockchain and smart contracts to provide decentralized, regularized, and secure reputation management that is resistant to tampering and non-repudiation. Theoretical analysis and empirical results on widely used datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100) demonstrate the effectiveness of DRC in enhancing trust and fairness, improving performance, and providing robust security in FL settings. Results further exhibit that DRC offers superior performance in local model validation, consensus decision, and convergence time compared to related research approaches across various experimental settings.},

  abstract     = {In vector commitments, the complex process of generating and updating proofs, along with the large-sized proofs, seriously hinders the practicality of stateless cryptocurrencies. In this work, we present NTTproofs, containing two sub-schemes, a vector commitment (VC) and a mulit-vector commitment (MC). Both sub-schemes are maintainable and aggregatable, and they also enjoy fast openings (i.e., generating all the proofs) as well as efficient proof updates. MC in NTTproofs employs the Fast Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) and sharding technique to significantly improve the time of generating all proofs by up to 0.76× and 0.32×, respectively, over Balanceproofs, Matproofs. Moreover, our proposed MC in NTTproofs is efficiently maintainable and requires merely 15.78 milliseconds at n1 = n2 = 212 to update all proofs. Meanwhile, NTTproofs schemes exhibit superior aggregatability, taking 0.003 seconds in VC and 0.05 seconds in MC to aggregate 1024 proofs and reducing the size of an aggregated proof to a constant size of 96 Bytes. Finally, macrobenchmarks indicate that our proposed MC in NTTproofs outperforms the other schemes, but is slightly inferior to that of Balanceproofs.},

  abstract     = {The rapid evolution of image generation techniques has benefited several fields, but it has also given rise to security concerns. As countermeasures, a series of AI-generated image detection methods have been developed successfully. However, existing methods exhibit an inefficiency in handling the continual emergence of new generative models. To address this issue, we formulate the detection of AI-generated images in an extensible manner using an adapter-based domain incremental learning framework. Specifically, we first investigate the global consistency property of generation artifacts and design a content-agnostic adapter equipped on a vision transformer to extract common forensic features, where a token-level shuffling strategy is constructed for the dual-stream comparison to mitigate the fitting to specific image content. Then, motivated by the compactness of real images and the diversity of fake images due to their inherent generation processes, an asymmetric category-aware domain alignment method is designed to reduce the domain shift arisen from different generators. Finally, a multi-view knowledge distillation module, considering both point-to-point and structure-to-structure forensic knowledge, is devised to alleviate catastrophic forgetting. Experiments are conducted on several protocols using various image generators, and experimental results verify the superiority of our method compared to state-of-the-art methods for extensible detection.},

  abstract     = {The latest pandemic COVID-19 brought governments worldwide to use various containment measures to control its spread, such as contact tracing, social distance regulations, and curfews. Epidemiological simulations are commonly used to assess the impact of those policies before they are implemented. Unfortunately, the scarcity of relevant empirical data, specifically detailed social contact graphs, hampered their predictive accuracy. As this data is inherently privacy-critical, a method is urgently needed to perform powerful epidemiological simulations on real-world contact graphs without disclosing any sensitive information. In this work, we present RIPPLE, a privacy-preserving epidemiological modeling framework enabling standard models for infectious disease on a population’s real contact graph while keeping all contact information locally on the participants’ devices. As a building block of independent interest, we present PIR-SUM, a novel extension to private information retrieval for secure download of element sums from a database. Our protocols are supported by a proof-of-concept implementation, demonstrating a 2-week simulation over half a million participants completed in 7 minutes, with each participant communicating less than 50 KB.},
