  abstract     = {This paper introduces a class of model-free feedback methods for solving generic constrained optimization problems where the mathematical forms of the cost and constraint functions are not available. The proposed methods, termed Projected Zeroth-Order (P-ZO) dynamics, incorporate projection maps into a class of continuous-time zeroth-order dynamics that use direct measurements of the cost function and periodic dithering for the purpose of gradient learning. In particular, the proposed P-ZO algorithms can be interpreted as new extremum-seeking algorithms that autonomously drive an unknown system toward a neighborhood of the set of solutions of an optimization problem using only output feedback, while simultaneously guaranteeing that the input trajectories remain in a feasible set for all times. In this way, the P-ZO algorithms can properly handle hard and asymptotic constraints in model-free optimization problems without using penalty terms or barrier functions. Moreover, the proposed dynamics have suitable robustness properties with respect to small bounded additive disturbances on the states and dynamics, a property that is fundamental for practical real-world implementations. Additional tracking results for time-varying and switching cost functions are also derived under stronger convexity and smoothness assumptions and using tools from hybrid dynamical systems. Numerical examples are presented throughout the paper to illustrate the above results.},

  abstract     = {A recent theoretical analysis of a Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) method properly modified from the “upper confidence bound applied to trees” (UCT) algorithm established a surprising result, due to a great deal of empirical successes reported from heuristic usage of UCT with relevant adjustments for various problem domains in the literature, that its rate of convergence of the expected absolute error to zero is $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ in estimating the optimal value at an initial state in a finite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP), where $n$ is the number of simulations. We strengthen this dispiriting slow convergence result by arguing within a simpler algorithmic framework in the perspective of MDP, apart from the usual MCTS description, that the simpler strategy, called “upper confidence bound 1” (UCB1) for multi-armed bandit problems, when employed as an instance of MCTS by setting UCB1&#39;s arm set to be the policy set of the underlying MDP, has an asymptotically faster convergence-rate of $\rm {O(\ln n / n)}$. We also point out that the UCT-based MCTS in general has the time and space complexities that depend on the size of the state space in the worst case, which contradicts the original design spirit of MCTS. Unless heuristically used, UCT-based MCTS has yet to have theoretical supports for its applicabilities.},

The underlying technique is driven by a particular type of grid-based quasi-interpolation scheme. The QuIFS algorithm departs drastically from conventional approximation algorithms that are employed in the MPC industry (in particular, it is neither based on multi-parametric programming tools nor does it involve kernel methods), and the essence of its point of departure is encoded in the following challenge-answer approach: Given an error margin $\varepsilon &amp;gt; 0$, compute in a single stroke a feasible feedback policy that is uniformly $\varepsilon$-close to the optimal MPC feedback policy for a given nonlinear system subjected to constraints and bounded uncertainties. Closed-loop stability guarantees under the approximate feedback policy are also established. We provide a couple of numerical examples to illustrate our results.},

  abstract     = {Event-triggered control has attracted considerable attention for its effectiveness in resource-restricted applications. To make event-triggered control as an end-to-end solution, a key issue is how to effectively learn unknown system dynamics from event-triggered measurements and consequently, develop a learning-based event-triggered controller. Existing works learn system dynamics based on periodic time-triggered measurements, and it is yet to know how to learn a controller with performance guarantee based on event-triggered measurements. To address this issue, we consider the problem of learning an event-triggered state feedback controller for an unknown linear system based on event-triggered state measurements in this work. In particular, we first analyze the event-triggered measurements within a set-membership framework. We prove that the estimation error belongs to a bounded ellipsoid determined by the historical measurements and the event-triggering condition. Subsequently, we demonstrate that all admissible systems compatible with the collected data samples can be explicitly represented in the form of quadratic matrix inequalities using the state estimates. With the acquired set of admissible systems, a co-design problem for the data-driven controller and event-triggering condition is solved using the linear matrix inequality technique, with guaranteed closed-loop stability and $\mathcal {L}_{2}$-gain performance. Finally, numerical examples and comparisons are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed event-triggered learning and control approach.},

Our constructive framework couples control barrier function (CBF) theory with a new uncertainty estimator to ensure robust safety. We use the estimated uncertainty, along with a derived upper bound on the estimation error, for synthesizing CBFs and safety-critical controllers via a quadratic program-based feedback control law that rigorously ensures robust safety while improving disturbance rejection performance. We extend the method to higher-order CBFs (HOCBFs) to achieve safety under unmatched uncertainty, which may cause relative degree differences with respect to control input and disturbances. We assume the relative degree difference is at most one, resulting in a second-order cone constraint. We demonstrate the proposed robust HOCBF method through a simulation of an uncertain elastic actuator control problem and experimentally validate the efficacy of our robust CBF framework on a tracked robot with slope-induced matched and unmatched perturbations.},

These properties facilitate the use of gradient-based optimization and learning-based control techniques, offering greater efficiency compared to traditional gradient-free methods. We propose three approaches leveraging these robustness properties to control the MAS. The first combines a gradient-based optimization algorithm with a heuristic one (hybrid optimization). The second uses imitation learning to learn a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) controller from a dataset generated by off-line optimizations. The third approach employs a model-based policy search algorithm to learn an RNN controller directly without a dataset. We showcase our proposed approaches in a simulated example. We demonstrate that, with hybrid optimization, the MAS can achieve a high success rate of compliance with the t-STREL requirement, while the imitation learning approach can be used for real-time control. The model-based policy search approach can concurrently achieve both objectives within a relatively short training time.},

We consider such stabilization of plants with rational transfer functions of relative degree 0, 1, or 2. Finding such controllers requires an interpolant $U(s)$ with specific properties. Existing methods for finding $U(s)$ use an iterative manual calculation or, when the plant&#39;s right half plane zeros are simple, a matrix calculation based on Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation. We present a new interpolant of the form $\prod _{i} ( \frac{s+a_{i}}{s+b_{i}})^{m_{i}}$, where $a_{i}, b_{i} &amp;gt; 0$. While our final interpolant has integer $m$&#39;s, we allow non-integer or real $m$&#39;s in intermediate calculations. This allows our search to be continuous instead of discrete. Repeated right half plane zeros of the plant are accommodated easily. Real $m$&#39;s are obtained whenever the plant satisfies the PIP, and integer $m$&#39;s are obtained for suitably chosen $a$&#39;s and $b$&#39;s.

The behavior of optimal control in high-order problems lacks precise characterization. Even the existence of the chattering phenomenon, i.e., the control switches infinitely many times over a finite period, remains unknown. This paper establishes a theoretical framework for chattering in the problem, providing novel findings on the uniqueness of state constraints inducing chattering, the upper bound of switching times in an unconstrained arc during chattering, and the convergence of states and costates to the chattering limit point. For the first time, this paper proves the existence of chattering in the considered problem. The chattering optimal control for 4th-order problems with velocity constraints is precisely solved, providing an approach to plan time-optimal snap-limited trajectories. Other cases of order $n\leq 4$ are proved not to allow chattering. The conclusions rectify a prevalent misconception in the industry concerning the time-optimality of S-shaped trajectories with minimal switching times.},

Such a mechanism is suitably interlaced with a local proportional action steering each agent estimate to the solution of the original consensus optimization problem. First, in the case of ideal networks, by using tools from system theory, we prove the linear convergence of the scheme with strongly convex costs. Then, by exploiting the averaging theory, we extend such a first result to prove that the robust extension of our method preserves linear convergence in the case of asynchronous agents and packet losses. Further, by using the notion of Input-to-State Stability, we also guarantee the robustness of the schemes with respect to additional, generic errors affecting the agents&#39; updates.

A sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the subgradient information can be computed using local information. This then leads to a subgradient algorithm for updating the auxiliary variables. A case with sparse coupling constraints is further considered, and it is shown to have better memory and communication efficiency. For the specific case of a CBF-induced time-varying quadratic program (QP), an update law is proposed that achieves finite-time convergence.

  abstract     = {Suboptimal methods in optimal control arise due to a limited computational budget, unknown system dynamics, or a short prediction window among other reasons. In this work, we study the transient closed-loop performance of such methods by providing finite-time suboptimality gap guarantees. We consider the control of discrete-time, nonlinear time-varying dynamical systems and establish sufficient conditions for such guarantees. These allow the control design to distribute a limited computational budget over a time horizon and estimate the on-the-go loss in performance due to suboptimality. We study exponential incremental input-to-state stabilizing policies and show that for nonlinear systems, under some mild conditions, this property is directly implied by exponential stability without further assumptions on global smoothness. The analysis is showcased on a suboptimal model predictive control use case.},

Given an undirected network, we consider a setup where each node measures an ellipsoid, defined as a time-varying positive semidefinite matrix. The goal is to devise a distributed algorithm to track the tightest outer approximation of the intersection of all the ellipsoids. The solution is based on a novel distributed reformulation of the original centralized semi-definite outer Löwner-John program, characterized by a non-separable objective function and global constraints. We prove finite-time convergence to the global minima of the centralized problem in the static case and finite-time bounded tracking error in the dynamic case. Moreover, we prove boundedness of estimation in the tracking of the global optimum and robustness in the estimation against time-varying inputs. We illustrate the properties of the algorithm with different simulated examples, including a distributed estimation showcase where our proposal is integrated into a distributed Kalman filter to surpass the state-of-the-art in mean square error performance.},

A novel leader-follower formation architecture is proposed, termed “linear formation control”. In this architecture, both the shape of the formation and its translational motions are represented by a linear transformation matrix determined by the positions of the leaders. This setup allows the leaders&#39; movements to generate time-varying desired formations. To facilitate followers&#39; tracking of desired formations, an integrated control structure is proposed, comprising two estimators and a compatible controller. The first estimator is responsible for obtaining the time-varying linear formation shape parameters by measuring the leaders&#39; relative displacements, the kernel of which essentially involves solving a system of time-varying linear equations in a distributed manner. The second estimator focuses on inferring the time-varying translation parameters using leaders&#39; positions. Subsequently, utilizing the outputs of these estimators, a tracking controller is proposed to track the desired time-varying formation precisely.

Traditionally, the study of optimization problems with decision-dependent distributions has assumed either the absence of constraints or fixed constraints. This work considers a more general setting where the constraints can also dynamically adjust in response to changes in the decision variables. Specifically, we consider linear constraints and analyze the effect of decision-dependent distributions in both the objective function and constraints. Firstly, we establish a sufficient condition for the existence of a constrained equilibrium point, at which the distributions remain invariant under retraining. Moreover, we propose and analyze two algorithms: repeated constrained optimization and repeated dual ascent. For each algorithm, we provide sufficient conditions for convergence to the constrained equilibrium point. Furthermore, we explore the relationship between the equilibrium point and the optimal point for the constrained decision-dependent optimization problem. Notably, our results encompass previous findings as special cases when the constraints remain fixed. To show the effectiveness of our theoretical analysis, we provide numerical experiments on both a market problem and a dynamic pricing problem for parking based on real-world data.},

In this paper, we establish a connection between selecting the most informative data and finding the top-$k$ elements of a multiset. The top-$k$ selection in a network can be formulated as a distributed nonsmooth convex optimization problem known as quantile estimation. Unfortunately, the lack of smoothness in the local objective functions leads to extremely slow convergence and poor scalability with respect to the network size. To overcome this deficiency, we propose an accelerated method that employs smoothing techniques. Leveraging the piecewise linearity of the local objective functions in quantile estimation, we characterize the iteration complexity required to achieve top-$k$ selection, a challenging task due to the lack of strong convexity. Several numerical results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the algorithm and the correctness of the theory.},

We present two control schemes that achieve closed-loop stability without Zeno behavior. The first scheme is implemented under logarithmic quantization and uses the quantized state for the threshold in the triggering condition. The second one is a joint design of zooming quantization and self-triggered sampling, where the adjustable zoom parameter for quantization changes based on inter-sampling times and is also used for the threshold of self-triggered sampling. In both schemes, the self-triggering mechanism predicts the future state from the quantized data for the computation of the next sampling time.

In contrast, a new form of distributed observer, which ensures that all agents asymptotically estimate the system state under the mild network connectivity condition without increasing the need for the detectability condition, is proposed. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of the proposed distributed observer are established. The key to the proposed method is a refined canonical decomposition form of the coefficient matrices of the system which is introduced leveraging the real Jordan canonical form, the Popov-Belevitch-Hautus test, the matrix permutation, and the observable decomposition.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the joint problem of dynamics learning and tracking control for a class of parabolic partial differential equation (PDE) systems with infinite-dimensional uncertain nonlinear dynamics. A new learning control scheme is proposed based on the deterministic learning (DL) theory. One key feature of the proposed scheme is its capability of accurately learning the system&#39;s nonlinear uncertain dynamics during real-time tracking control with provable stability and convergence of the overall PDE closed-loop system. Specifically, the Galerkin method is first employed to deal with the infinite dimensionality of the PDE system; a novel DL-based adaptive learning control scheme is then proposed using dual radial basis function neural networks (RBF NNs), in which a pair of RBF NNs are employed to address respectively the matched and unmatched components of uncertain nonlinear system dynamics. This control scheme is finally examined on the original PDE system, and it is rigorously proved that: (i) the PDE system&#39;s state tracks the prescribed reference trajectory with guaranteed closed-loop stability and tracking accuracy; and (ii) locally accurate identification of the PDE system&#39;s dominant nonlinear uncertain dynamics can be achieved with provable convergence of associated NN weights to their optimal values, thereby the learned knowledge can be ultimately stored and represented by the convergent constant RBF NN models. Based on this, an experience-based control scheme is further proposed, which is capable of recalling the associated learned knowledge in real-time to further improve control performance and reduce computational complexity with maintained provable stabilization. It is worth stressing that although this work is focused particularly on parabolic PDE systems, it is groundbreaking with important technical breakthroughs that would facilitate a more complete extension of the DL theory from traditional ordinary differential equation (ODE) systems to PDE systems in the future. Extensive simulation studies have been conducted to demonstrate effectiveness and advantage of the proposed results.},

  abstract     = {Entropy regularization is an efficient technique for encouraging exploration and preventing a premature convergence of (vanilla) policy gradient methods in reinforcement learning (RL). However, the theoretical understanding of entropy regularized RL algorithms has been limited. In this paper, we revisit the classical entropy regularized policy gradient methods with the soft-max policy parametrization, whose convergence has so far only been established assuming access to exact gradient oracles. To go beyond this scenario, we propose the first set of (nearly) unbiased stochastic policy gradient estimators with trajectory-level entropy regularization, with one being an unbiased visitation measure-based estimator and the other one being a nearly unbiased yet more practical trajectory-based estimator. We prove that although the estimators themselves are unbounded in general due to the additional logarithmic policy rewards introduced by the entropy term, the variances are uniformly bounded. We then propose a two-phase stochastic policy gradient (PG) algorithm that uses a large batch size in the first phase to overcome the challenge of the stochastic approximation due to the non-coercive landscape, and uses a small batch size in the second phase by leveraging the curvature information around the optimal policy. We establish a global optimality convergence result and a sample complexity of $\widetilde{\mathcal {O}}(\frac{1}{\epsilon ^{2}})$ for the proposed algorithm. Our result is the first global convergence and sample complexity results for the stochastic entropy-regularized vanilla PG method.},

Such equivalence inherits the well-known property of contracting ODE systems on a specific manifold.

  abstract     = {The leader-following consensus problem for multiple uncertain Euler-Lagrange (EL) systems has been extensively studied by two approaches: robust control approach and adaptive control approach. The adaptive control approach has the advantage that it does not require the bounds of unknown parameters be known but has the shortcoming that the control law is of high dimension as every unknown parameter has to be estimated by the local control law of every follower. On the other hand, the robust control has the advantage that the dimension of the control law is lower than the adaptive one but it needs to assume that the bounds of the uncertain parameters and the disturbances are known. Moreover, the validity of the existing robust control approaches relies on some restrictive assumptions on the communication networks and the dynamics of the EL systems. In this paper, we consider the leader-following consensus problem for multiple uncertain EL systems where both the bounds of the uncertain parameters and the disturbances are unknown. We solve this problem by augmenting the robust control law with an adaptive control mechanism for estimating the unknown bound of all uncertain parameters and the unknown bound of all disturbances of each follower. As a result, regardless of the number of the uncertain parameters and the dimension of the disturbances of each follower, the dimension of each local control law of each follower in this paper is only two, which is in contrast with the dimension of the adaptive control approach in the literature. Moreover, we consider jointly connected switching networks which can be disconnected at any time instant.},

Acknowledging the vulnerability of these transmitted data to cyber threats, we analyze two types of stealthy attacks that compromise either one or both channels. We explicitly present the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of stealthy single-channel attacks. To mitigate these security risks, we implement encryption-based countermeasures, including linear time-invariant and periodic encryption methods. We detail sufficient conditions under which these encryption strategies effectively thwart single- and dual-channel stealthy attacks. The effectiveness of these approaches and the theoretical findings are demonstrated through numerical simulations.},

The corresponding QSR-dissipative properties of the overall matrix-gain-scheduled system, which depends on the QSR properties of the subsystems scheduled, are explicitly derived. The use of scheduling matrices is a generalization of the scalar scheduling signals used in the literature, and allows for greater design freedom when scheduling systems, such as in the case of gain-scheduled control. Furthermore, this work extends the existing gain-scheduling results to a broader class of QSR-dissipative systems. The matrix-scheduling of important special cases, such as passive, input strictly passive, output strictly passive, finite $\mathcal {L}_{2}$ gain, very strictly passive, and conic systems are presented. The proposed gain-scheduling architecture is used in the context of controlling a planar three-link robot subject to model uncertainty. A novel control synthesis technique is used to design QSR-dissipative subcontrollers that are gain-scheduled using scheduling matrices. Numerical simulation results highlight the greater design freedom of scheduling matrices, leading to improved performance.},

To solve this problem, a novel composite policy iteration (CPI) algorithm based on adaptive dynamic programming is developed to adaptively learn the optimal control policy from system data. The existing methods require the initial stabilizing control policy, the persistence of excitation (PE) condition and the data storage to ensure the algorithm convergence. Fundamentally different from them, these restrictions can be relaxed in the proposed method. Specifically, an adaptive parameter is elaborately designed to remove the requirement of the initial stabilizing control policy. Besides, an online data calculation scheme is proposed, which can not only replace the stored historical data by online data, but also can relax the PE condition to the interval excitation (IE) condition. The simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm, and its superiority is also demonstrated by comparing it with existing algorithms.},

Specifically, multiple workers independently perform system rollouts to estimate zero-order PGs, which are then aggregated in a master for policy updates. Moreover, each worker is allowed to interact with the master asynchronously, leading to delayed PG estimates. By quantifying the convergence rate of AZOPG, we show a linear speedup property both in theory and simulation, which reveals the advantages of using asynchronous parallel workers in learning policies.},

We develop methods with the potential to address these issues by applying an offline-computed safety guaranteeing controller on a physical system, to track a virtual system that evolves through a trajectory that is replanned online, accounting for constraints updated online. The first method we propose is designed for general time-varying systems over a finite horizon. Our second method overcomes the finite horizon restriction for periodic systems.

However, designing the RISE controller to yield exponential tracking error convergence in the presence of actuator saturation has been an open problem. Although there are existing results that provide a saturation scheme for RISE controllers, these results only guarantee asymptotic tracking error convergence using a Lyapunov-based analysis. In this paper, a new design strategy is developed using a projection algorithm and auxiliary filters to yield exponential tracking error convergence. This new strategy does not employ trigonometric or hyperbolic saturation functions inherent to previous saturated (or amplitude limited) controllers. As a result, a Lyapunov-based analysis can be constructed that yields exponential convergence of the tracking errors. Comparative simulation results demonstrate the performance of the developed method in comparison with a baseline controller. The developed method can operate at a lower saturation limit than the baseline method while maintaining stability and achieving exponential tracking error convergence.},

To give a trade-off between the two, this paper focuses on the bipartite synchronization problems over signed topologies and aims to achieve finite-time control for general linear agents subject to input saturation constraints. Firstly, this paper considers homogeneous agents and presents a class of bipartite synchronization protocols with saturation constraint, which exploits the solution of the time-varying Riccati equation (TVRE) to design the control gain. Then, a time-varying parameter scheduler is tactically designed for TVRE and achieves finite-time bipartite synchronization. Note that the design uses the solution computed online and brings a bit of conservatism in determining the settling time. So, for heterogeneous agents, this paper constructs a modified parameter scheduler computed off-line to reduce the conservatism. A class of finite-time bipartite synchronization generators and generator-based finite-time protocols are proposed. It shows that, in both designs, the control input subjects to the bound saturation during convergence even if the gain escapes to infinity towards the settling time. Moreover, the trade-off among the finite convergence time, the saturation bound of the input, and the initial domain are analyzed explicitly in theory. Finally, two simulations verify the validity of the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {In decentralized optimization over networks, synchronizing the updates of all nodes incurs significant communication overhead. For this reason, much of the recent literature has focused on the analysis and design of asynchronous optimization algorithms where nodes can activate anytime and contact a single neighbor to complete an iteration together. However, most works assume that the neighbor selection is done at random based on a fixed probability distribution (e.g., uniform), a choice that ignores the optimization landscape at the moment of activation. Instead, in this work we introduce an optimization-aware selection rule that chooses the neighbor providing the highest dual cost improvement (a quantity related to a dualization of the problem based on consensus). This scheme is related to the coordinate descent (CD) method with the Gauss-Southwell (GS) rule for coordinate updates; in our setting however, only a subset of coordinates is accessible at each iteration (because each node can communicate only with its neighbors), so the existing literature on GS methods does not apply. To overcome this difficulty, we develop a new analytical framework for smooth and strongly convex functions that covers our new class of setwise CD algorithms –a class that applies to both decentralized and parallel distributed computing scenarios– and we show that the proposed setwise GS rule can speed up the convergence in terms of iterations by a factor equal to the size of the largest coordinate set. We analyze extensions of these algorithms that exploit the knowledge of the smoothness constants when available and otherwise propose an algorithm to estimate these constants. Finally, we validate our theoretical results through extensive simulations.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, an optimal transportation particle method has been proposed to deal with data fusion problem. The proposed method can handle prediction, filtering, and smoothing problems uniformly more robustly and stably than traditional algorithms. Our main idea is to approximate the trajectory in Wasserstein space which is the set of probability distributions equipped with the Wasserstein metric. Recent literature has demonstrated the successful application of optimal transportation for prediction and filtering problems. In our paper, we derive an optimal transportation particle for solving the smoothing problem utilizing Mayne - Fraser&#39;s formula [1], [2]. Detailed convergence results are presented, and the proposed algorithms are tested on missing observation processes, showcasing their ability to solve hybrid data fusion problems. This work introduces a new approach to particle methods that expands their possibilities in data fusion applications.},

  abstract     = {This work is dedicated to a less conservative observer-based controller design LMI method for discrete-time quasilinear systems with polynomial parameter dependencies subject to stochastic noise. While robust closed loop stability of the deterministic part of the closed loop is guaranteed by a Lyapunov-based approach, the performance is improved by a separate $\mathcal {D}_{\mathrm{R}}$ eigenvalue region for the controller and observer. In addition, input, process, and sensor noise is suppressed by solving an optimization problem with an objective function derived from the discrete-time Itô differential operator. Therefore, an iterative LMI method is utilized, which leads to less conservative optimization results. Polynomial parameter dependencies are treated by including the calculation of upper and lower bounds in the set of LMIs with the theorem of Ehlich and Zeller. Therefore, the polynomial nonlinearities are formulated by means of quasilinear system representations, which are interpreted as polynomial matrices. Thus, the polynomial nonlinearities are treated in their original polynomial form, without using polytopic approximations. As a result, the optimization of the controller parameters is improved in contrast to conventional polytopic approaches. The results of the novel approach of polynomial uncertainty representations are discussed in detail in two examples, wherein the reproducibility is guaranteed and the practical applicability of the approach is demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {Common tasks in system analysis and control include optimal control, peak estimation, reachable set estimation, and maximum control invariant set estimation. A standard method to solve these problems is to lift them into infinite-dimensional convex linear programs. However, finite-dimensional truncations of these problems suffer a curse of dimensionality with respect to the size of the state and input. In the case where the dynamical system is input-affine and the input is restricted to a convex set, decomposition methods may be employed to eliminate the input and yield more tractable finite-dimensional truncations. Prior work on these eliminations include enforcing vertex constraints (switching), or employing facial decompositions in the case where the polytopic set is a scaled box. This work generalizes the box-facial technique towards the decompositions of arbitrary convex input-constraining sets using methods from robust optimization. The robustified programs are proven to have the same optimal value and an equivalent set of optimizers as the original program under mild compactness and regularity constraints. Specific attention is paid towards robust-counterpart decomposition of semidefinite representable sets when employing the Moment-Sum-of-Squares hierarchy for polynomial optimization. Efficacy is demonstrated under data-driven peak and distance estimation problems.},

In particular, we decompose the original problem into the (control-constrained) partially-observed LQ risk-sensitive control problem and the LQ risk-neutral problem for the mean-field dynamics. While the optimal solution of the former is characterized by the risk-sensitive state estimator and satisfies the associated control constraint, the optimal solution of the latter is represented by the state-feedback mean-field type process. Then by combining the optimal solutions of these two problems, we obtain the explicit feedback-type linear optimal solution to the original problem.

Our analysis is explicit on the similarity between Hessian matrices of local objective functions which captures the degree of data homogeneity. We illustrate the impact of our analysis through studying the transient time, defined as the minimum number of iterations required for a distributed algorithm to achieve comparable performance as its centralized counterpart. When the local objective functions have similar Hessian, the transient time of DSGD can be as small as ${\cal O}(n^{2/3}/\rho ^{8/3})$ for smooth (possibly non-convex) objective functions, ${\cal O}(\sqrt{n}/\rho)$ for strongly convex objective functions, where $n$ is the number of agents and $\rho$ is the spectral gap of graph. These findings provide a theoretical justification for the empirical success of DSGD. Our analysis relies on a novel observation with higher-order Taylor approximation for gradient maps that can be of independent interest. Numerical simulations validate our findings.},

A further contribution of this paper is the appropriate motion planning design of the so-called probing (or perturbation) signal, which is more involved than in the non-distributed counterpart. Hence, with these two design ingredients, we provide an averaging-based methodology that can be implemented using the gradient and Hessian estimates. Local exponential stability for the closed-loop equilibrium of the average error dynamics is guaranteed through a Lyapunov-based analysis. By employing the averaging theory for infinite-dimensional systems, we prove that the trajectory converges to a small neighborhood surrounding the optimal point.

By exploiting the set-theoretic nature of the information provided by the quantizer, the problem is cast in the set membership estimation setting. Assuming the possibility of suitably tuning the quantizer range and resolution, the optimal design of adaptive quantizers is formulated in terms of the minimization of the radius of information associated to the state estimation problem. The optimal solution is derived for first-order systems and the result is exploited to design adaptive quantizers for generic systems, minimizing the size of the feasible output signal set. Then, the number of sensor thresholds for which the adaptive quantizers guarantee asymptotic boundedness of the state estimation uncertainty is established. Threshold adaptation mechanisms based on several types of outer approximations of the feasible state set are also proposed. The effectiveness of the designed adaptive quantizers is demonstrated on numerical tests, highlighting the trade off between the resulting estimation uncertainty and the computational burden required by recursive set approximations.},

Different from the existing works, the nonlinear growth rates under consideration are allowed to contain unknown constants and state-input-dependent functions, and the impulse effects are allowed to have unknown sizes. This problem has remained unsolved because it exceeds the coverage of common assumptions in impulsive systems. To this end, we propose a novel logic-based switching gain approach. Specifically, the well-designed logic-based switching mechanism detects the Lyapunov function in real-time to adjust the candidate gain online such that the gain grows large enough to effectively dominate the strong nonlinearities and serious uncertainties. Interestingly, the proposed approach removes the restriction on impulse frequency (reflected by the average impulsive interval constant) within the lower-triangular structural framework, and executes only one switching action to obtain the upper bound of the required gain within the upper-triangular structural framework. It is shown that the logic-based switching adaptive controller ensures that all the closed-loop signals are bounded and the system states converge to the origin at an exponential rate. Finally, the effectiveness of the presented results is demonstrated by two representative examples.},

To quantify the resilience of the interconnected system under the action of replay attacks, we derive bounds on the duration of each cyber-attack and the resting time between two consecutive cyber-attacks. Specifically, when each attack duration is smaller than our designed upper bound, the interconnected system controlled by the distributed approximation-based controller remains asymptotically stable. Moreover, if the resting time between two consecutive attacks is larger than the proposed bound, then all signals of the control system are guaranteed to be bounded.

First, to prevent the violation of the full-state constraints of each EL system, a nonlinear state-dependent transformation (NSDT) is adopted for both the leader and followers, where the constraints will not be violated as long as the transformed states remain finite. Then, a constrained nonlinear fully distributed observer is constructed using only neighbors&#39; states, and an adaptive gain is designed to eliminate the dependence of the global information. The theoretical analysis is completed via constructing a novel integration-based Lyapunov function using a graph-based diagonal matrix, ensuring the achievement of consensus. Using the observed state, an adaptive back-stepping state tracking control protocol is developed such that the position of each EL system can track the leader within a tolerable bounded region. Thus, the leader-following consensus of multiple EL systems with time-varying asymmetric full-state constraints is achieved.

  abstract     = {The noncooperative game with private constraints is studied, where heterogeneous players communicate over a weight-unbalanced digraph. A novel distributed Nash equilibrium (NE) seeking algorithm is adapted for this problem tackling two main difficulties. First, the presence of the unbalanced digraph disrupts some essential properties of the Laplacian matrix. To overcome this limitation, a compensation mechanism based on output feedback is introduced. Second, to ensure players&#39; actions meet the constraints, an adaptive penalty technique is introduced. This technique effectively uses the information obtained from the intrinsic nature of the constraints and fulfills the quantitative estimation of penalty parameters, where the penalty parameters are able to vary along with the degree of constraint violation. To reduce unnecessary communication among players, a novel distributed NE seeking algorithm with a bivariate dynamic event-triggered mechanism is employed, which ensures exponential NE seeking while avoiding the Zeno behavior. Finally, a connectivity control game is given to evaluate the effectiveness of the results.},

  abstract     = {This paper delves into the investigation of a distributed aggregative optimization problem within a network. In this scenario, each agent possesses its own local cost function, which relies not only on the local state variable but also on an aggregated function of state variables from all agents. To expedite the optimization process, we amalgamate the heavy ball and Nesterov&#39;s accelerated method with distributed aggregative gradient tracking, resulting in the proposal of two innovative algorithms, aimed at resolving the distributed aggregative optimization problem. Our analysis demonstrates that the proposed algorithms can converge to an optimal solution at a global linear convergence rate when the objective function is strongly convex with the Lipschitz-continuous gradient, and when the parameters (e.g., step size and momentum coefficients) are chosen within specific ranges. Additionally, we present several numerical experiments to verify the effectiveness, robustness and superiority of our proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the privacy-preserving distributed optimization problem, aiming to prevent attackers from stealing the private information of agents. For this purpose, we propose a novel privacy-preserving algorithm based on the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), which is both secure and computationally efficient. By appropriately constructing the underlying weight matrices, our algorithm can be applied to time-varying directed networks. We show that the proposed algorithm can protect an agent&#39;s privacy if the agent has at least one honest neighbor at the initial iteration. Under the assumption that the objective function is strongly convex and Lipschitz smooth, we rigorously prove that the proposed algorithm has a linear convergence rate. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by numerical simulations of the canonical sensor fusion problem.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a dynamic high-gain-based decentralized optimal fault-tolerant control (FTC) strategy for a class of strong interconnected systems with unknown actuator faults is proposed. The interactions considered are bounded by some functions that depend on all subsystems&#39; states. A two-layer control framework is presented for each subsystem to steer its tracking error asymptotically to zero. In the upper layer, an error optimizer is designed to generate optimal error trajectory based on a local objective function that converges to zero. In the lower layer, with the aid of an auxiliary system, a trajectory-tracking fault-tolerant controller is given to adaptively accommodate the effects of parametric uncertainties and actuator faults, where an adaptive high-gain approach is adopted to address the unknown strong interactions. In comparison with existing results, the proposed algorithm relaxes the requirement of output trajectory derivatives, and asymptotic tracking is accomplished. Application results obtained using an electrical power system case demonstrate the validity of the proposed algorithm.},
