  abstract     = {Industrial video surveillance systems play a pivotal role in smart industry prioritizing safety protection. Object detection resorting to deep neural networks (DNNs) is promising in achieving accurate and autonomous localization and identification of anomalies in video frames, supporting broad intelligent video surveillance applications. However, existing approaches are either computation- or communication-intensive. Limited by the constrained resources of industrial systems, they usually suffer from a high end-to-end (E2E) latency, cannot be directly applied to latency-sensitive applications. In this article, we present a lightweight edge-cloud collaborative branchy DNN, CombiNet, and customize an intelligent edge device, Edge-Vbox, to construct an effective real-time video object detection (VOD) solution. In our case study of intelligent smart grid substation operation and maintenance, experimental results using real-world data demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-ofthe-art methods in E2E latency, and manages to achieve real-time VOD with negligible accuracy loss. Source code is available at https://github.com/iotdata-grid/CombiNet.},

  abstract     = {Over the last few years, there has been increasing use of drones by terror groups and in armed conflict. Several technologies have been developed to detect drone flights. However, much less work has been done on the Drone Threat Prediction Problem (DTPP): predicting which drone trajectories are threatening and which ones are not. We propose DEWS (Drone Early Warning System), a framework to solve this problem. Solving DTPP early is key. Once a drone starts on its trajectory, we show that DEWS can make accurate predictions within 20-30 seconds of the flight with an F1-score of over 80% on data about a major European city. We study the tradeoff between earliness of predictions and accuracy. We identify the key features that ensure good predictions.},
