  abstract     = {Remote air traffic control offers inexpensive and efficient service to multiple airports. Recent research shows that one remote air traffic control officer can safely control up to three low-traffic airports simultaneously. In a multiple remote tower center, airports can be flexibly allocated across air traffic control officers based on prospective traffic loads. The main task of the supervisor in such a center is balancing the workload of each air traffic control officer by allocating airports accordingly. This study analyzes the supervisor&#39;s visual attention during interaction with a planning tool for their daily tasks. Five use cases were identified as the main tasks of the supervisor representing a mixture of planned and unplanned events. A mixed methods within-subjects design was used to assess the workload and eye-movement patterns associated with each of these use cases. In total, 15 professional air traffic control officers participated in the study. Workload and eye movement were analyzed independently in relation to the use cases but also in combination with each other. Across all use cases, a small correlation between subjective workload ratings and fixation duration was found, supporting previous findings of fixation duration being associated with information processing. Transitions between areas of interest on the supervisor planning tool provided valuable insights into the layout design of future supervisor planning tools.},

  abstract     = {This article introduces the global-local image perceptual score (GLIPS), an image metric designed to assess the photorealistic image quality of AI-generated images with a high degree of alignment to human visual perception. Traditional metrics such as Fréchet inception distance (FID) and kernel inception distance scores do not align closely with human evaluations. The proposed metric incorporates advanced transformer-based attention mechanisms to assess local similarity and maximum mean discrepancy to evaluate global distributional similarity. To evaluate the performance of GLIPS, we conducted a human study on photorealistic image quality. Comprehensive tests across various generative models demonstrate that GLIPS consistently outperforms existing metrics like FID, structural similarity index measure, and multiscale structural similarity index measure in terms of correlation with human scores. In addition, we introduce the interpolative binning scale, a refined scaling method that enhances the interpretability of metric scores by aligning them more closely with human evaluative standards. The proposed metric and scaling approach not only provide more reliable assessments of AI-generated images but also suggest pathways for future enhancements in image generation technologies.},

  abstract     = {The motivation behind the development of a wearable assistive upper limb exoskeleton robot was to provide comprehensive multijoint therapy by assisting physiotherapists in enhancing the recovery of hemiplegic patients. However, the controlling of an upper limb exoskeleton for rehabilitation is a challenging task because of its nonlinear characteristics. This article presents a novel fuzzy adaptive controller that utilizes a high-dimensional integral-type Lyapunov function for a wearable assistive upper limb exoskeleton. A disturbance observer had been used to tackle uncertainties in the exoskeleton&#39;s dynamic model, thereby enhancing the tracking performance of the joints. The aim of this control scheme was to overcome unknown parameters in the dynamic model. The performance of the adaptive controller was validated through human interactive experiments and periodically repeated reference trajectory tests. The results demonstrated that the proposed fuzzy adaptive controller, with the inclusion of a disturbance observer, could effectively compensate for uncertain disturbances and could achieve efficient tracking of the reference trajectory. The statistical analysis revealed that the fuzzy adaptive controller performed 45% , 44% , and 31% less in average error compared to adaptive conventional controllers. The findings ascertained the potential of the proposed controller in improving the recovery of motor functions of hemiplegic patients.},

  abstract     = {Neural or muscular injuries, such as due to amputation, spinal cord injury, and stroke, can affect hand functions, profoundly impacting independent living. This has motivated the advancement of cutting-edge assistive robotic hands. However, unintuitive myoelectric control of these devices remains challenging, which limits the clinical translation of these devices. Accordingly, we developed a robust motor-intent decoding approach to continuously predict the intended fingertip forces of single and multiple fingers in real time. We used population motor neuron discharge activities (i.e., neural drive from brain to spinal cord) decoded from a high-density surface electromyogram (HD-sEMG) signals as the control signals instead of the conventional global sEMG features. To enable real-time neural-drive prediction, we employed a convolutional neural network model to establish the mapping from global HD-sEMG features to finger-specific neural-drive signals, which were then employed for continuous and real-time control of three prosthetic fingers (index, middle, and ring). As a result, the neural-drive-based approach can decode the motor intent of single-finger and multifinger forces with significantly lower force estimation errors than that obtained using the global HD-sEMG-amplitude approach. Besides, the force prediction accuracy was consistent over time and demonstrated strong robustness to signal interference. Our network-based decoder can also achieve better finger isolation with minimal forces predicted in unintended fingers. Our work demonstrates that the accurate and robust finger force control could be achieved through this new decoding approach. The outcomes offer an efficient intent prediction approach that allows users to have intuitive control of prosthetic fingertip forces in a dexterous way.},

This research presents a novel approach to quantitatively measure human comfort levels during HRC through the development of two metrics: a comfortability index (CI) and an uncomfortability index (UnCI). We conducted HRC experiments where participants performed assembly tasks while the robot&#39;s behavior was systematically varied. Participants&#39; subjective responses (including surprise, anxiety, boredom, calmness, and comfortability ratings) were collected alongside physiological signals, including electrocardiogram, galvanic skin response, and pupillometry data. We propose two novel approaches for estimating CI/UnCI: an adaptation of the emotion circumplex model that maps comfort levels to the arousal–valence space, and a kernel density estimation model trained on physiological data. Time-domain features were extracted from the physiological signals and used to train machine learning models for real-time comfort levels estimation. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approaches can effectively estimate human comfort levels from physiological signals alone, with the circumplex model showing particular promise in detecting high discomfort states. This work enables real-time measurement of human comfort during HRC, providing a foundation for developing more adaptive and human-aware collaborative robots.},

Disassembly plays a key role in the remanufacturing and reuse of waste products. However, with the rapid development of production automation, designers tend to ignore the fact that manual operation is more flexible. It is of great importance to consider human factors in a disassembly process. This work considers two human disassembly postures, namely standing and sitting. The multiobjective disassembly line balancing problem considering human posture changes is studied. A mathematical model with the objective functions of maximizing profit, minimizing the number of posture changes at a workstation, and minimizing the difference of maximum posture changes between any two workstations is established. The model is solved through a newly proposed Pareto-based discrete harmony search algorithm. Three neighborhood structures are designed to enlarge the search space for better solutions. Furthermore, an elite reserve strategy is used to improve the global optimization ability of the proposed algorithm. Finally, the proposed model and algorithm are applied to cases of different scales of complexities, and the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm is verified in comparison with four competitive algorithms.},

Traditional game theory limits players to two choices, i.e., either cooperation or defection. However, player behavior in real-world scenarios is often multidimensional and complex; therefore, this work employs a continuous action iterated dilemma that allows players to choose a wider range of strategies. Moreover, traditional convergence analysis often relies on Jacobian matrices, which entail complex derivations. In contrast, the proposed strategy employs a time generator-based protocol that achieves agreement between all the players at a prescribed time, explicitly set by the user through a time parameter within the protocol. A comprehensive Lyapunov analysis affirms the prescribed time convergence even when the network is exposed to information loss during data transfer. Numerical simulations illustrate that the proposed scheme leads to a faster agreement at the preassigned time and with a better resilience performance compared to existing methods.},

Monthly clinical visits were scheduled to monitor workers’ health. Effectiveness, usability and acceptance metrics were collected at the beginning of the study and after six months. No side effects were found in clinical metrics during the study. Significant reductions, consistent overtime, were observed in shoulder muscle activity (up to 30%) and in effort perception-related metrics (up to 2.4 out of 10 points). Usage time settled around 10% of the monthly work-shift and gradually decreased possibly due to external factors (e.g., social, motivational, and seasonal factors) beyond researchers&#39; control.

We determined that wearing exoskeletons reduced the biomechanical efforts of workers measured by joint kinematics and electromyography as well as the estimated shoulder joint reaction forces and torques derived from simulation. These quantitatively measured variables were statistically associated with subjective measures collected through satisfaction questionnaires. We specifically found that participants increased the shoulder flexion and abduction angles as well as the shoulder range of motion while wearing exoskeletons. Participants also reduced muscle activities, joint torques for shoulder flexion, and reaction forces exerted on the shoulder joints while wearing exoskeletons. Interestingly, our analysis also found that the increased shoulder movement while wearing the device was negatively associated with the satisfaction level. This indicates that although the assistance provided by the device allows users to perform a wider range of arm lifting movements, the deviation from their original movement with the device may lead to decreases in satisfaction levels. This integrative approach using biomechanics and ergonomics suggests that we can potentially predict the subjective scale of satisfaction based on biomechanical variables and preliminarily evaluate the usability and comfort while wearing exoskeletons in real-world settings.},

  abstract     = {Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in Wi-Fi-based gesture recognition. However, existing works have predominantly focused on closed-set paradigms, where all testing gestures are predefined during training. This poses a significant challenge in real-world applications, as unseen gestures might be misclassified as known class during testing. To address this issue, we propose WiOpen, a robust Wi-Fi-based open-set gesture recognition (OSGR) framework. Implementing OSGR requires addressing challenges caused by the unique uncertainty in Wi-Fi sensing. This uncertainty, resulting from noise and domains, leads to widely scattered and irregular data distributions in collected Wi-Fi sensing data. Consequently, data ambiguity between classes and challenges in defining appropriate decision boundaries to identify unknowns arise. To tackle these challenges, WiOpen adopts a twofold approach to eliminate uncertainty and define precise decision boundaries. Initially, it addresses uncertainty induced by noise during data preprocessing by utilizing the channel state information (CSI) ratio. Next, it designs the OSGR network based on an uncertainty quantification method. Throughout the learning process, this network effectively mitigates uncertainty stemming from domains. Ultimately, the network leverages relationships among samples&#39; neighbors to dynamically define open-set decision boundaries, successfully realizing OSGR. Comprehensive experiments on publicly accessible datasets confirm WiOpen&#39;s effectiveness.},

Therefore, this article proposes a miner mental state evaluation scheme with decision-level fusion based on multidomain EEG information. First, in the comprehensive lab for coal-related programs of Xi&#39;an University of Science and Technology, the coal mine environment is simulated, and a realistic EEG dataset is constructed. Second, the multidomain features are extracted to represent abundant information in time, frequency, time-frequency, and space domain. These features with low dimension are classified adopting support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (kNN), and back propagation (BP) network to obtain the optimal evaluation submodel (four domains corresponding to four submodels). Finally, based on the state probabilities provided by the optimal evaluation submodel, we adopt stack fusion and an improved Yager rule to fuse four submodels in order to find the most suitable fusion algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that the average accuracy can reach 93.19% on the self-built dataset when utilizing the improved Yager rule with weight, and it realizes a better evaluation accuracy.},

The third dataset is multiclass, including two hands and two feet actions.
