  abstract     = {This article presents two fixed-time (FXT) distributed adaptive algorithms to solve a class of convex optimization problems for multiagent systems. First, a distributed adaptive protocol based on edge weights is developed to achieve global FXT optimization, in which the initial states are the local optimal points. Subsequently, an adaptive power-law algorithm is designed to realize local FXT optimization for each agent with arbitrary initial state. In the convergence analysis, unlike previous analysis method based on Lyapunov FXT stability criteria, this study employs the definition of FXT stability with Laplace transformation and a method of contradiction, several sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure that the states of all agents converge to the global optimal value within a fixed time, and the upper bound of convergence time is estimated. Furthermore, these adaptive algorithms on undirected graphs are extended to weight-balanced digraphs. Finally, the validity of the proposed edge-based adaptive distributed algorithms is demonstrated through numerical simulations of two packet-level charge-state balance problems.},

  abstract     = {Cumulative belief rule-based system (CBRBS) is a recent representative of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). However, the use of CBRBS as XAI still faces many challenges, e.g., over-reliance on expert experience and applying unreasonable rule synthesis in the existing modeling process. Hence, a novel modeling approach is proposed for constructing CBRBS in the aim of providing a better XAI, in which a joint optimization model is proposed first to describe the mathematical model of parameter and structure optimization, and the corresponding algorithm is further designed to automatically achieve the joint optimization of CBRBS. Afterward, a domain-based calculation method of synthesis factor is proposed to develop a new rule synthesis method for CBRBS, which not only achieves the reduction of inefficient and inconsistent rules but also takes into account interpretability and generalization ability. In experimental analysis, the proposed modeling approach is employed to construct CBRBS for handling rice taste assessment and benchmark classification problems. The comparison results show that the proposed approach makes it possible for CBRBS to achieve a good balance between model complexity and inference accuracy. More importantly, the resulting CBRBS has better accuracy and lower complexity than some existing rule-based systems and classical classifiers.},

Load torque is first modeled as a mismatched disturbance, where its estimation via a disturbance observer is drawn to construct an error system. Then, optimal speed regulation problem for PMSM is equivalently transformed into an optimal control problem for the error system. Given the presence of model variable couplings, an adaptive dynamic programming method is adopted to derive the optimal controller, where a critic neural network (NN) and an actor NN are used to approximate the cost function and the optimal controller, respectively. Notably, this article addresses the simultaneous occurrence of disturbances and actuator faults within the optimal control framework by designing separate treatments. Eventually, a composite controller, fulfilling optimality, robustness and safety constraints, is presented with rigorous proof via Lyapunov method. The proposed method is substantiated through both comparative numerical examples and experimental validation on a PMSM platform.},

By the comparison of the continuous control system and the sample-data control system, the equivalence condition on the stabilities of the two systems is studied. Meanwhile, estimates for the maximum tolerable attack probability and the corresponding largest sampling period are obtained. Moreover, a qualitative analysis of various indicators for the deception attacks and the sampling period is revealed. Following this, the theorized results are applied to linear systems with multiple time delays under nonlinear coupling, and matrix inequalities for identifying the appropriate value of the control gain are provided by the generalized Halanay inequality.

  abstract     = {Industrial robots inevitably incur kinematic errors in the advanced manufacturing and assembly processes, resulting in the severe reduction of the absolute positioning accuracy (APA). Kinematic calibration (KC) is well-known as a vital technique in APA-promoting tasks. However, existing KC models generally adopt a single distance-oriented Loss, e.g., an L2 norm-oriented one that neglects the featured Lp norms. In response to this critical issue, this study presents an Adaptive p-norms-oriented Kinematic Calibration (ApKC) model on the basis of threefold ideas: 1) studying the effects of diversified Lp norms on the industrial robot calibration performance; 2) combining multiple Lp norms to obtain the aggregated loss with the hybrid effects by different norms; and 3) implementing the weight adaptation on the norm components of the aggregated loss, and rigorously prove its ensemble capability benefiting the calibration performance. Afterwards, a novel Newton interpolated Adaptive Differential Evolution (NADE) algorithm is further proposed to optimize the ApKC model. Empirical studies on an HRS JR680 industrial robot demonstrate that the achieved ApKC-NADE calibrator can significantly reduce the robot’s maximum positioning error from 4.610 to 0.856 mm. It can vigorously support the high-accuracy application of industrial robots.},

In addition, a tailored SMC law that ensures the system’s trajectory reaches and maintains a preset sliding surface over a specified finite time is applied. To address the challenges of communication load, a novel multizone probabilistic dynamic event-triggered protocol is introduced, leveraging the time-varying nature of transmission delays and incorporating two adjustable internal dynamic variables. The establishment of sufficient conditions for ensuring the stochastic finite-time stability of the closed-loop system is achieved through an effective Lyapunov functional methodology.

Specifically, this research investigates a neural network structure determined by the mechanical characteristics of a computer numerical control (CNC) machine tool. We explore a method to generate training trajectories that fill the designated feature space or repeatedly pass through hidden layer nodes, ensuring that deterministic learning achieves a sufficient PE level. Then, we validated the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments conducted on a three-axis CNC machine tool using actual machining trajectories. The experimental results consistently confirmed that the generated training trajectories endow the RBF neural network with more feature information than random NURBS trajectories.

In such multivehicle systems, SOTIF objectives are particularly challenging, since new issues arise due to the presence of interactions that propagate and intensify the effects and the risk connected to faults/failures/uncertainties, triggered by any platoon member and external conditions. To tackle and solve the SOTIF-oriented platoon control problem, we propose a robust and resilient decentralized control protocol, based on distributed observer which exploits the information shared via the Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication network. The approach allows maintaining acceptable SOTIF performance in adversarial conditions, mitigating the effects of the unreasonable risks originated from sensors/actuators performance limitations/faults and disturbances. The uniformly ultimate bounded (UUB) stability and the input-to-state string stability (ISSS) of the platoon dynamics are analytically proved via the Lyapunov theory. Feasible linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are obtained as stability conditions, whose solution allows adapting the distributed control/observer gains according to leader-tracking performance and robustness margins. A detailed analysis via the vehicular co-simulation platform mixed traffic simulator (MiTraS) corroborates the theoretical derivations and shows the achievement of the SOTIF platoon goals for a set of nontrivial and uncertain driving scenarios.},

A novel dynamic ETM is skillfully developed based on the information of quantization and two internal dynamic adjusting variables to further enhance the network bandwidth utilization. The dual asynchronous phenomenon between the plant and controller (asynchronous modes and mismatched premise variables) is addressed. This implies that the designed controller is not required to share the same membership functions and modes as the plant, establishing a more rational structure. The hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) is attained to characterize the stochastic varying channel fading amplitudes. The Lyapunov function incorporating mode and fuzzy information is constructed to establish sufficient criteria ensuring the strictly dissipative performance and mean-square exponential stability (MSES) of the resulting closed-loop systems, and a new security fuzzy dual asynchronous controller is then developed.

During real-time information exchange among agents, communication failures between agents occur randomly, which may result in each possible network topology occurring with a certain probability, and its sojourn time is also stochastic. This necessitates the consideration of a more general switching signal to describe the stochastic switching phenomenon of networks. In pursuit of this goal, a semi-Markov chain is introduced to characterize the switching signal of stochastic interaction networks, whose sojourn time distribution allows for arbitrary continuous-time distribution and depends on the current and next state. Additionally, this article delves into the impact of two distinct types of DoS attacks on MASs. The first type involves random DoS attacks, which are also modeled by a semi-Markov chain to capture the stochastic nature of attack durations. The second type is deterministic DoS attacks, characterized by their frequency and duration. The proposed new stochastic analysis method, based on the law of large numbers, is used to analyze the ASC for MASs featuring SMSNs under the DoS attacks. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by evaluating the results obtained from two illustrative numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {This article concentrates on the event-triggered control problem for interconnected nonlinear systems under hybrid stochastic faults. Unlike existing results, our work considers both, sensor stochastic faults and process stochastic faults, which are referred to as hybrid stochastic faults. First, under hybrid stochastic faults, an observer is constructed to estimate all states, which converts the process stochastic faults into a processable form. Second, an event-triggered mechanism is proposed for the estimated states to reduce their update frequency. To deal with the problem that the triggered estimated states are nondifferentiable, a continuous controller with continuous estimated states is developed, and the event-triggered controller with triggered estimated states is established accordingly. By the use of Lyapunov stability theory, it can be rigorously shown that all signals of the closed-loop systems are bounded in probability. The proposed approach is illustrated with the simulation of two interconnected pendulums.},

  abstract     = {Exploring the structure information is crucial for data clustering task, particularly for the sceneries of incomplete multiview clustering (IMVC) when some views are missing. However, almost all of the existing graph-based IMVC methods either introduce the Laplacian constraint with fixed graphs or simply fuse the graphs of all views, which are vulnerable to the quality of the constructed graphs. To address this issue, we propose a new graph-based method, called confident local structure-aware incomplete multiview spectral clustering. Different from existing works, our method seeks to adaptively uncover the inherent similarity structure among the available instances in each view and learn the optimal consensus graph within a unified learning framework. Moreover, to mitigate the adverse effects of imbalance information across incomplete views and improve the quality of consensus graph, we further impose some adaptive weights on the consensus graph learning model w.r.t. each view and introduce some confident structure graphs to explore the most confident similarity information in the model. In contrast to existing works, our approach simultaneously takes into account the pairwise similarity information and neighbor group-based confident structure information. This dual consideration makes our method more effective in achieving the optimal consensus graph and delivering superior IMVC performance. Experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that our method effectively learns a high-quality and clustering-friendly graph from incomplete multiview data, and it outperforms many state-of-the-art IMVC methods in terms of clustering performance.},

In this study, a robust dissimilarity analytics model (RDAM) is established with Laplace distribution to detect process anomalies in noisy environment. Because of the heavy-tailed characteristic of Laplace distribution, the proposed RDAM method is more robust to ambient noise and outliers when compared to Gaussian distribution-based models. Besides, the missing data problem is also considered and solved in the model development procedure. Using the variational Bayesian inference, the model parameters and latent variables of the RDAM model can be estimated. After that, a monitoring strategy is designed based on the obtained results with both static and dynamic statistics. By this means, both the static deviation of the current sample and the temporal correlation within the process data can be effectively revealed. A simulated example and a real low-pressure heater process are adopted to illustrate the performance of the proposed RDAM method. Specifically, the proposed RDAM method is robust to the ambient noise and missing values, and it has better detection sensitivity for the process anomalies than the selected comparison methods.},

First, considering the impact of DoS attacks on closed-loop systems, an AET controller against DoS attacks is designed. Unlike other event-triggered controllers, the complete timeline is divided, and the AET controller is built with two switching modes based on the intervals of dormant and active periods of DoS attacks in which the system is located. Second, to reconcile AET controller with actuator saturation, a switched system modeling approach is established that explicitly incorporates saturation constraints into the coupled network dynamics. Third, a switched Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF) is proposed, with which sufficient conditions are provided to ensured the RPS, and a joint design strategy is developed for the desired triggered matrix and feedback gain using linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Moreover, the results are generalized to the case of actuator faults, indicating that the system is able to achieve RPS with actuator faults.

Nevertheless, this task presents significant challenges attributed to the high rates of false positives and false negatives in electronic device detection (EDD), compounded by the low resolution of objects when viewed from multiple angles.To address these challenges, we propose a deep learning-based cascaded detection framework. Specifically, we design a mixed region sampling (MRS) method to enhance the foreground perception with background information and image details. We design a nonstrided downsampling method (ASDP) to map the attention spatial features to depth and improve the detection of low-resolution objects with fine-grained features. We enhance the model’s robustness to different viewing angles by feature perturbation during training. Moreover, we use a cascaded strategy to reduce false positives. To evaluate our method, we construct a real review room dataset (EDD) with 28,000 images from multiple angles. Our method improves the multiview generalization performance by 4.48% mAP and 5.62% mAR. On the public datasets Pascal VOC-2007 and visDrone-2019, our method is also superior to other suboptimal methods.

Traditionally, in the remote state estimation with the innovation or raw measurement case, denial of service (DoS) and false data injection (FDI) attacks are investigated thoroughly. Notably, for remote state estimation with local estimate cases considered in this article, most existing works consider DoS attacks but not FDI attacks, negatively affecting remote state estimation performance. Furthermore, current detection mechanisms encounter challenges when identifying such attacks due to the unavailable innovation or raw measurement. As such, we study FDI attacks under this framework and provide the corresponding secure analysis using a dual-perspective approach. Specifically, we propose a detector to detect such attacks using the prior information extracted from the remote estimator. Then, we analyze the existence of stealthy attacks and characterize the corresponding performance evaluation for the remote estimation under such attacks. Following this, we construct the optimal attack scheme, maximizing the expected average and terminal estimation error covariances, respectively. To reduce the above vulnerability, we develop a co-design transmission strategy and offer an analytical detection performance evaluation under different attack scenarios.

  abstract     = {The industrial system usually contains not only controllable variables (CVs) but also uncontrollable variables (unCVs), e.g., weather conditions and friction. These unCVs have a direct impact on system control performance. Despite the success of current deep reinforcement learning (DRL) control algorithms, most of them neglect the impact of unCVs, which can cause the deterioration of control performance and instability of the system. To perceive and eliminate the impact of unCVs, a performance-aware self-optimizing universal controller (PASOUC) is designed in this article. The PASOUC aims at integrating the representation of unCVs and controller design to perceive and eliminate the impact of unCVs under different conditions, which goes beyond most existing control methods. Technically, a historical trajectory-inspired control performance perceptron is developed to perceive the impact of unCVs on system control performance under different conditions. Subsequently, a new performance-aware reward is designed to integrate the representation of unCVs and controller design while training the DRL controller. In addition, the domain randomization (DR) training strategy is employed to learn a universal control policy, which can access the approximate optimal trajectory under nonideal conditions. In this way, the impact of unCVs can be eliminated. To handle the low efficiency of the DR training, the policy improvement-policy proximal optimization (PI-PPO) is proposed to enhance the convergence speed of the DR training by performing explicit policy improvement. Finally, illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.},

It is shown that the derived results can degenerate into the consensus criteria for general MASs with fixed-scale topology. Also, the potential packet loss phenomenon existing in controller is considered, which is integrated into the consensus performance via the average packet loss interval (APLI) condition, thereby guaranteeing the robustness of consensus performance against packet loss.

Based on the event-triggered communication mechanisms, the updates of neural network weight and controllers are implemented solely under triggering conditions of violation, which markedly reduces unnecessary communication resources and minimizes inefficient control costs compared with the traditional control method. Radial basis function neural networks (RBF NNs) are employed to handle the nonlinear uncertainties of MASs. Simultaneously, an adaptive compensatory mechanism is incorporated within the backstepping process to address the nonlinear effect posed by input saturation. Additionally, we demonstrate the system stability by extending the Lyapunov theorem to jump and continuous scenarios while excluding Zeno behavior, realizing that all followers can enter the convex hull constructed by leaders. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed methodology is verified through application simulations.},

First, the framework of node-based DoS attack is introduced, including its influences, detection, and recovery mechanisms. Second, a new variable-order fractional difference (VO-FD) inequality is proposed to accurately evaluate the variable-order fractional derivative of the power function. Based on the developed inequality, two novel finite-time stability theorems are presented based on the developed inequality, which fill up the gap in variable-order fractional finite-time stability without and with DoS attacks, respectively. Third, a resilient distributed control protocol is proposed, where the dynamic event-triggered mechanism (DETM) is introduced based on the detected signal of attack to ensure the desired control performance and economize system resources. According to the Lyapunov stability theory, the consensus can be achieved within the settling time, and some linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based conditions are obtained. Finally, the feasibility and validity of theoretical analysis is illustrated by simulation example.},

  abstract     = {Data-driven soft sensing has become quite popular in recent years, which can provide real-time estimations of key variables in industrial processes. While the introduction of deep learning does improve the prediction performance, it is highly restricted to the number of labeled training data, as well as large computational burden and cumbersome parameter tuning procedures. How to break through the bottleneck of data-drive models in terms of limited labeled data and high computational complexity should be one of the main recent focuses in the field of industrial soft sensing. In this article, a deep co-training PLS (deep CT-PLS) model is proposed to extend the ordinary PLS model to the semi-supervised deep form. While the deep model can efficiently extract inherent natures of process data, the co-training strategy makes lots of unlabeled data useful through a two-view cross training and annotation process. In this case, the performance restriction of the deep PLS model can be greatly relieved, with the incorporation of additional unlabeled data, while at the same time the designed model structure keeps in a low computational complexity. Based on the case study on a real industrial production process, the deep CT-PLS model can significantly improve the soft sensing performance.},

With this problem in mind, we redesign ETMs for quasi-synchronization of T–S fuzzy neural networks (FNNs) with time delays on time scales. First, a novel ETM is designed for continuous-time FNNs with time-varying delays to achieve quasi-synchronization, with which synchronization errors is suppressed to globally exponentially converge to a ball. Second, we introduce the ETM for continuous-time FNNs to discrete-time FNNs, owing to the existence of discrete-time states, the Lypunov function of synchronization errors run over the exponentially decay curve, but it can be suppressed to evolve under another exponentially decay curve. Third, for FNNs on time scales with constant and time-varying delays, we estimate the forward jump operator of the Lyapunov functions and design ETMs to guarantee that the Lypunov functions evolve under the exponentially decay curves, so quasi-synchronization can be achieved. Last but not least, we prove that Zeno behavior will not happen and four numerical examples are introduced to verify the validity and the superiority of the proposed ETMs in reducing information transmission.},

  abstract     = {With increasingly challenging applications for quadrotors, higher requirements are emerging for tracking accuracy and safety. While high accuracy is a prerequisite for complex tasks, safety is ensured through tolerance to actuator faults and resistance to external disturbances. In this article, adaptive robust control (ARC) integrated with Gaussian processes (GPs), i.e., ARC-GP, is proposed to achieve enhanced accuracy, fault tolerance, and anti-disturbance. These three requirements are interrelated and affected by uncertainties. The primary idea of this article is to categorize uncertainties into parametric and nonparametric types, which are then addressed through parameter adaptation and GP, respectively. First, a detailed dynamic model is established, including actuator models that reflect different types of faults corresponding to changes in different physical parameters. Then, parameter adaptation is designed, with direct and indirect methods adopted for different parameters. In particular, the actuator parameters are effectively estimated to achieve targeted fault compensation. Regarding GP for nonparametric uncertainties, its model parameters are also updated via parameter adaptation. The GP thereby also learns parameter estimation errors along with external disturbances. Accordingly, ARC controllers are designed, for which robust feedback terms are constructed to further mitigate uncertainties on the basis of the covariances predicted by GP. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed ARC-GP can actively tolerate various types of actuator faults and better resist wind disturbances.},

First, a predefined time error transformation function (PTETF) is developed and combined with a barrier function based on constant value constraints for control design, which not only significantly simplifies the derivation process of the proposed predefined time prescribed performance control (PTPPC), but also equips it with the ability of global constraints on the trajectory tracking error.

  abstract     = {This article investigates the robust fault estimation (FE) scheme for a class of discrete-time nonlinear dynamics subject to simultaneous bounded disturbances, sensor and actuator/process faults through the T–S fuzzy method. By constructing an augmented system that contains sensor faults as part of its state, a dissipativity-based FE observer is proposed to achieve sensor and actuator/process faults reconstruction. Combine with the fuzzy Lyapunov function method and dissipativity theory, some brand-new conditions with slack scalars and matrices are attained to ensure that observation error systems are strictly $(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{W},\mathcal{S})$ $-\delta-$ dissipative. Besides, to improve the transient FE performance, regional pole placement problem is also considered in FE observer design. It is worth mentioning that different from some existing results which assume that actuator faults occur in a constant form, the method given in this article is suitable for more types of faults such as time-varying ones. By two simulation experiments, the validity and practicability of the proposed FE observer are fully illustrated.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we investigate the problem of capturing a noncooperative target with deception behavior using reinforcement learning (RL) under incomplete information. The pursuer copes not only with its maneuverability constraint but also with the target’s deception behavior, in which the target deliberately conceals its private preference information. The target capture game involving deception behavior is formulated as a nonlinear differential game framework where the information structure is incomplete and asymmetric. The solution to this differential game is proposed based on an RL policy that incorporates critic, actor, and virtual actor neural networks (NNs), when taking into consideration the maneuverability constraint and information structure of the pursuer. Moreover, the states of the constrained adversarial system and the weight errors are proven to be ultimately uniformly bounded (UUB). To counter the deception of the target, we adopt unscented Kalman filter (UKF) to obtain the target intention on energy preference, and integrate it into the pursuer strategy. The feasibility of the proposed strategy and its superiority are verified through comparisons with recent works.},

  abstract     = {To address the challenges posed by flight envelope limitation, external disturbances, model uncertainties and actuator failures in quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), we propose an adaptive neural attitude control method that incorporates a Nussbaum function and nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO). By designing the Nussbaum function, we effectively address potential actuator failures while leveraging the NDO enables us to employ feedforward compensation strategy to mitigate perturbation effects. To handle the flight envelope limitation and model uncertainties, we introduce a nonlinear state-dependent function (NSDF) and neural networks (NNs), respectively. The NSDF is utilized to directly constrain the attitude, while the NNs are constructed to estimate the unknown components. Simulation results demonstrate that this approach successfully addresses the flight envelope limitation and maintains robust tracking performance even in the presence of external disturbances, model uncertainties and actuator failures in the controlled system.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates an adaptive bipartite consensus tracking control algorithm for a class of heterogeneous nonaffine nonlinear multiagent systems (MASs) with prescribed finite-time tracking performance under an unbalanced communication topology. In the case of an unbalanced digraph, a novel locally optimal bipartition strategy is proposed to transform the unbalanced communication topology into a structurally balanced one, thereby enabling the implementation of bipartite consensus tracking control. To achieve the expected tracking performance, the design philosophy focuses on developing a prescribed finite-time performance function (PFTPF), capable of preassigning the convergence time and accuracy precisely beforehand. The explored adaptive control algorithm can ensure that the whole signals concerning the closed-loop MASs remain bounded while the bipartite consensus errors converge to a predetermined range around zero within the prescribed finite time. Ultimately, the simulation results on robotic systems prove the availability of the developed design solution.},

A full-state feedback control law based on a hyperbolic sine function is developed such that the resulted closed-loop system can achieve two stable equilibria. By Lyapunov stability theory and Barbalat’s Lemma, it is proven that the obtained closed-loop system is almost globally asymptotically stable, and achieves unwinding-free performance. Further, by constructing a strict Lyapunov function, it is demonstrated that the two stable equilibria are exponentially stable. Moreover, subsets of attraction regions corresponding to each stable equilibrium are characterized. The simulation results illustrate that the proposed attitude control scheme can effectively avoid the unwinding problem during attitude tracking.},

  abstract     = {This study introduces a novel control framework for human-drone interaction (HDI) in industrial warehouses, targeting pick-and-delivery operations. The goals are to enhance operator safety as well as well-being and, at the same time, to improve efficiency and reduce production costs. To these aims, the speed and separation monitoring (SSM) operation method is employed for the first time in HDI, drawing an analogy to the safety requirements outlined in collaborative robots’ ISO standards. The so-called protective separation distance is used to ensure the safety of operators engaged in collaborative tasks with drones. In addition, we employ the rapid upper limb assessment (RULA) method to evaluate the ergonomic posture of operators during interactions with drones. To validate the proposed approach in a realistic industrial setting, a quadrotor is deployed for pick-and-delivery tasks along a predefined trajectory from the picking bay to the palletizing area, where the interaction between the drone and a moving operator takes place. The drone navigates toward the interaction space while avoiding collisions with shelves and other drones in motion. The control strategy for the drone cruise navigation integrates simultaneously the time-variant artificial potential field (APF) technique for trajectory planning and the iterative linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controller for trajectory tracking. Differently, in the descent phase, the receding horizon LQR algorithm is employed to follow a trajectory planned in accordance with the SSM, which starts from the approach point at the border of the interaction space and ends in the volume with the operator’s minimum RULA. The presented control strategy facilitates drone management by adapting the drone’s position to changes in the operator’s position while satisfying HDI safety requirements. The results of the proposed HDI framework simulations for the case study demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in ensuring a safe and ergonomic HDI within industrial warehouses.},

  abstract     = {Unsupervised cross-domain reinforcement learning (RL) pretraining shows great potential for challenging continuous visual control but poses a big challenge. In this article, we propose cross-domain random pretraining with prototypes (CRPTpro), a novel, efficient, and effective self-supervised cross-domain RL pretraining framework. CRPTpro decouples data sampling from encoder pretraining, proposing decoupled random collection to easily and quickly generate a qualified cross-domain pretraining dataset. Moreover, a novel prototypical self-supervised algorithm is proposed to pretrain an effective visual encoder that is generic across different domains. Without finetuning, the cross-domain encoder can be implemented for challenging downstream tasks defined in different domains, either seen or unseen. Compared with recent advanced methods, CRPTpro achieves better performance on downstream policy learning without extra training on exploration agents for data collection, greatly reducing the burden of pretraining. We conduct extensive experiments across multiple challenging continuous visual-control domains, including balance control, robot locomotion, and manipulation. CRPTpro significantly outperforms the next best Proto-RL(C) on 11/12 cross-domain downstream tasks with only 54.5% wall-clock pretraining time, exhibiting state-of-the-art pretraining performance with greatly improved pretraining efficiency.},
