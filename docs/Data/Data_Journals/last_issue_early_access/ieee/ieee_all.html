  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicles trained through multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) have shown impressive results in many driving scenarios. However, the performance of these trained policies can be impacted when faced with diverse driving styles and personalities, particularly in highly interactive situations. This is because conventional MARL algorithms usually operate under the assumption of fully cooperative behavior among all agents and focus on maximizing team rewards during training. To address this issue, we introduce the personality modeling network (PeMN), which includes a cooperation value function and personality parameters to model the varied interactions in high-interactive scenarios. The PeMN also enables the training of a background traffic flow with diverse behaviors, thereby improving the performance and generalization of the ego vehicle. Our extensive experimental studies, which incorporate different personality parameters in high-interactive driving scenarios, demonstrate that the personality parameters effectively model diverse driving styles and that policies trained with PeMN demonstrate better generalization than traditional MARL methods.},

  abstract     = {The growth of distributed renewable energy in microgrids (MGs) raises challenges in energy management and consumption. As an innovative approach, peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading offers a promising solution to address these problems. In this article, we propose a bi-layer decentralized (BLD) optimization algorithm for P2P energy trading in multimicrogrids (MMG). Compared with traditional optimization algorithms that are single-layer decentralized (i.e., decentralizing solely at inter-MG trading and typically centralizing prosumers within the MG), the proposed algorithm achieves bi-layer decentralization (i.e., decentralization extends to both inter-MG and intra-MG trading). In this way, the BLD algorithm can significantly preserve the information privacy and decision independence of prosumers. In addition, the proposed algorithm can efficiently manage power flow in a decentralized manner at both layers, whereas existing decentralized algorithms frequently neglect this critical feature. Furthermore, an accelerated BLD (ABLD) algorithm is proposed to address time-consuming issues in this nested P2P trading for MMG. Numerical simulations on various test systems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The results indicate that the error of the proposed algorithm is below 0.1%. In addition, BLD requires 15602.03 s to converge with 560 prosumers, while ABLD only requires 228.05 s.},

By directly analyzing the closed-loop system matrix, a necessary and sufficient condition for parameter selection is derived. Subsequently, to overcome the phase lag defect of the linear integrator, we propose a new PI-based protocol with a split-path nonlinear integrator. The nonlinear consensus protocol can not only ensure that the system achieves asymptotic consensus, but also enhance the transient performance with respect to overshoot. Finally, some simulation comparisons are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed protocols.},

Specifically, to address the practical limitation that communication links between subsystems of IMMPSs may be unavailable, we first formulate a sparse LQT problem in which the sparse patterns of controllers match the actual communication links. Meanwhile, in order to be applicable to real-time applications while overcoming model uncertainty caused by parameter variability common in IMMPSs models, we subsequently develop a data compression-based model-free PI algorithm for the abovementioned sparse LQT problem. The main advantages of this algorithm over existing algorithms for IMMPSs control are threefold: first, it has the ability to operate without a prior knowledge of system model, second, its embedded data compression significantly reduces the time consumption for controller design, making it suitable for real-time applications, and third, it designs controllers based on actual communication links, making it practical for applications where communication infrastructure may be constrained. Finally the efficacy of the proposed algorithm is verified through the IEEE 39-bus New England Power System.},

Besides, the demand for server computational resources increasingly ascends as the volume of processing tasks grows. However, in reality, many devices have similar computing tasks and require the same computing data. Therefore, servers can effectively reduce server computing latency and bandwidth costs by caching task data. This investigation explores task security offloading and data caching optimization strategies in scenarios with multiple interfering devices. With the goal of minimizing the total energy consumption, the UAV trajectories, transmission power, task offloading scheduling strategies, and caching decisions is jointly optimized. The corresponding optimization problem, which consists of mixed integer nonlinear programming problem, is formulated. To make this problem solved, the original problem is decomposed into three tiers, and an iterative algorithm named CDSFS which is based on the coordinate descent, successive convex approximation, and flow shop scheduling is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate the stability and superiority of the proposed algorithm.},

The method is based on intracluster and intercluster distance evaluations to achieve a good partition. A quasi-convex curve is formed to select the optimal NoC, ensuring an excellent computational time to converge. Tests are carried out using K-means, and simulations are conducted using IEEE unbalanced test feeders. Different input random variables are tested, including correlated and noncorrelated variables, with and without renewable distributed generators. The results prove that the input conditions significantly affect the optimal NoC. Comparisons are made with Monte Carlo simulation to justify the proposed application, showing that the computational time reduction provided by the clustering algorithm reaches up to ∼99% . Since the optimal NoC increases dramatically with the size of the input database, guidelines are proposed to reduce the MPPF dimensionality for more effective probabilistic procedures.},

This article explores optimal UAV positioning to maximize coverage in hybrid aerial–ground communication links. Exploiting a probabilistic line-of-sight (LOS) model, we examine coverage radius behavior in mixed urban and suburban environments to meet specific quality-of-service (QoS) targets. The analysis reveals that the coverage radius expands as the probability of LOS increases, which in turn increases with the UAV height. However, beyond a certain height, path loss becomes dominant, and further increases in altitude negatively impact the coverage radius. By studying the maximum coverage radius for minimum signal strength and spectral efficiency requirements, we numerically determine a configuration space of UAV altitudes and the corresponding maximum radius that satisfies the target QoS. The results illustrate a dual-regime behavior, where coverage increases with altitude up to a certain value, beyond which it declines, indicating the existence of an optimal altitude for reliability. In addition, the analysis of ground surface effects shows that flying over concrete surfaces significantly enhances coverage, offering a radius up to five times larger compared to rough, vegetated surfaces.},

The challenge is to accurately monitor deep parameters in real-time during synchronization, although existing digital twin technologies have made good progress in monitoring shallow parameters. This study proposes a virtual-real synchronization method for digital twins of an aeroengine gas path system (AGPS) based on deep reinforcement learning (RL). First, the parameters are divided into directly measurable parameters (DMP) and nondirectly measurable parameters (NDMP). Then, different algorithms are applied to different types of parameters. An unscented Kalman filtering algorithm is utilized to aid in the synchronization of the DMP. An RL approach is employed to train parameter inference models for the NDMP. By combining the two algorithms, synchronization between these two parameter classes is achieved. This method excels by integrating the NDMP into the virtual-real synchronization of the AGPS digital twin, concurrently reducing the inference time for this specific segment. Comparative experiments are conducted, and the results indicate an effective improvement in the accuracy of parameter inference with the proposed method. Simultaneously, it ensures real-time and robust parameter inference.},

  abstract     = {Satellite communications (SatComs) have recently been through a renaissance, both technologically and entrepreneurially. Ambitious plans have already come into fruition with the operation of low-Earth orbit (LEO) constellations including thousands of satellites and supported by state of the art but proprietary technologies, such as active antenna arrays and intersatellite links (ISLs). In this context, this article aims to provide a forward-looking vision of use cases and a deep dive into technological enablers that will be prominent in space communications beyond 2030. In parallel, it motivates how open standards can play a role in delivering affordable communication services in space. Starting from the 5G plans for nonterrestrial networks, we provide a survey and roadmap toward artificial intelligence (AI)-supported satellite systems, space-enabled quantum networks, and joint communications and positioning (JCAP) for space missions and interplanetary exploration.},

  abstract     = {The recent advances in quantum information processing, sensing, and communications are surveyed with the objective of identifying the associated knowledge gaps and formulating a roadmap for their future evolution. Since the operation of quantum systems is prone to the deleterious effects of decoherence, which manifests itself in terms of bit-flips, phase-flips, or both, the pivotal subject of quantum error mitigation is reviewed both in the presence and absence of quantum coding. The state of the art, knowledge gaps, and future evolution of quantum machine learning (QML) are also discussed, followed by a discourse on quantum radar systems and briefly hypothesizing about the feasibility of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) in the quantum domain (QD). Finally, we conclude with a set of promising future research ideas in the field of ultimately secure quantum communications with the objective of harnessing ideas from the classical communications field.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a class of model-free feedback methods for solving generic constrained optimization problems where the mathematical forms of the cost and constraint functions are not available. The proposed methods, termed Projected Zeroth-Order (P-ZO) dynamics, incorporate projection maps into a class of continuous-time zeroth-order dynamics that use direct measurements of the cost function and periodic dithering for the purpose of gradient learning. In particular, the proposed P-ZO algorithms can be interpreted as new extremum-seeking algorithms that autonomously drive an unknown system toward a neighborhood of the set of solutions of an optimization problem using only output feedback, while simultaneously guaranteeing that the input trajectories remain in a feasible set for all times. In this way, the P-ZO algorithms can properly handle hard and asymptotic constraints in model-free optimization problems without using penalty terms or barrier functions. Moreover, the proposed dynamics have suitable robustness properties with respect to small bounded additive disturbances on the states and dynamics, a property that is fundamental for practical real-world implementations. Additional tracking results for time-varying and switching cost functions are also derived under stronger convexity and smoothness assumptions and using tools from hybrid dynamical systems. Numerical examples are presented throughout the paper to illustrate the above results.},

  abstract     = {A recent theoretical analysis of a Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) method properly modified from the “upper confidence bound applied to trees” (UCT) algorithm established a surprising result, due to a great deal of empirical successes reported from heuristic usage of UCT with relevant adjustments for various problem domains in the literature, that its rate of convergence of the expected absolute error to zero is $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ in estimating the optimal value at an initial state in a finite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP), where $n$ is the number of simulations. We strengthen this dispiriting slow convergence result by arguing within a simpler algorithmic framework in the perspective of MDP, apart from the usual MCTS description, that the simpler strategy, called “upper confidence bound 1” (UCB1) for multi-armed bandit problems, when employed as an instance of MCTS by setting UCB1&#39;s arm set to be the policy set of the underlying MDP, has an asymptotically faster convergence-rate of $\rm {O(\ln n / n)}$. We also point out that the UCT-based MCTS in general has the time and space complexities that depend on the size of the state space in the worst case, which contradicts the original design spirit of MCTS. Unless heuristically used, UCT-based MCTS has yet to have theoretical supports for its applicabilities.},

The QuIFS algorithm departs drastically from conventional approximation algorithms that are employed in the MPC industry (in particular, it is neither based on multi-parametric programming tools nor does it involve kernel methods), and the essence of its point of departure is encoded in the following challenge-answer approach: Given an error margin $\varepsilon &amp;gt; 0$, compute in a single stroke a feasible feedback policy that is uniformly $\varepsilon$-close to the optimal MPC feedback policy for a given nonlinear system subjected to constraints and bounded uncertainties. Closed-loop stability guarantees under the approximate feedback policy are also established. We provide a couple of numerical examples to illustrate our results.},

  abstract     = {Event-triggered control has attracted considerable attention for its effectiveness in resource-restricted applications. To make event-triggered control as an end-to-end solution, a key issue is how to effectively learn unknown system dynamics from event-triggered measurements and consequently, develop a learning-based event-triggered controller. Existing works learn system dynamics based on periodic time-triggered measurements, and it is yet to know how to learn a controller with performance guarantee based on event-triggered measurements. To address this issue, we consider the problem of learning an event-triggered state feedback controller for an unknown linear system based on event-triggered state measurements in this work. In particular, we first analyze the event-triggered measurements within a set-membership framework. We prove that the estimation error belongs to a bounded ellipsoid determined by the historical measurements and the event-triggering condition. Subsequently, we demonstrate that all admissible systems compatible with the collected data samples can be explicitly represented in the form of quadratic matrix inequalities using the state estimates. With the acquired set of admissible systems, a co-design problem for the data-driven controller and event-triggering condition is solved using the linear matrix inequality technique, with guaranteed closed-loop stability and $\mathcal {L}_{2}$-gain performance. Finally, numerical examples and comparisons are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed event-triggered learning and control approach.},

Our constructive framework couples control barrier function (CBF) theory with a new uncertainty estimator to ensure robust safety. We use the estimated uncertainty, along with a derived upper bound on the estimation error, for synthesizing CBFs and safety-critical controllers via a quadratic program-based feedback control law that rigorously ensures robust safety while improving disturbance rejection performance. We extend the method to higher-order CBFs (HOCBFs) to achieve safety under unmatched uncertainty, which may cause relative degree differences with respect to control input and disturbances. We assume the relative degree difference is at most one, resulting in a second-order cone constraint. We demonstrate the proposed robust HOCBF method through a simulation of an uncertain elastic actuator control problem and experimentally validate the efficacy of our robust CBF framework on a tracked robot with slope-induced matched and unmatched perturbations.},

These properties facilitate the use of gradient-based optimization and learning-based control techniques, offering greater efficiency compared to traditional gradient-free methods. We propose three approaches leveraging these robustness properties to control the MAS. The first combines a gradient-based optimization algorithm with a heuristic one (hybrid optimization). The second uses imitation learning to learn a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) controller from a dataset generated by off-line optimizations. The third approach employs a model-based policy search algorithm to learn an RNN controller directly without a dataset. We showcase our proposed approaches in a simulated example. We demonstrate that, with hybrid optimization, the MAS can achieve a high success rate of compliance with the t-STREL requirement, while the imitation learning approach can be used for real-time control. The model-based policy search approach can concurrently achieve both objectives within a relatively short training time.},

Existing methods for finding $U(s)$ use an iterative manual calculation or, when the plant&#39;s right half plane zeros are simple, a matrix calculation based on Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation. We present a new interpolant of the form $\prod _{i} ( \frac{s+a_{i}}{s+b_{i}})^{m_{i}}$, where $a_{i}, b_{i} &amp;gt; 0$. While our final interpolant has integer $m$&#39;s, we allow non-integer or real $m$&#39;s in intermediate calculations. This allows our search to be continuous instead of discrete. Repeated right half plane zeros of the plant are accommodated easily. Real $m$&#39;s are obtained whenever the plant satisfies the PIP, and integer $m$&#39;s are obtained for suitably chosen $a$&#39;s and $b$&#39;s.

The behavior of optimal control in high-order problems lacks precise characterization. Even the existence of the chattering phenomenon, i.e., the control switches infinitely many times over a finite period, remains unknown. This paper establishes a theoretical framework for chattering in the problem, providing novel findings on the uniqueness of state constraints inducing chattering, the upper bound of switching times in an unconstrained arc during chattering, and the convergence of states and costates to the chattering limit point. For the first time, this paper proves the existence of chattering in the considered problem. The chattering optimal control for 4th-order problems with velocity constraints is precisely solved, providing an approach to plan time-optimal snap-limited trajectories. Other cases of order $n\leq 4$ are proved not to allow chattering. The conclusions rectify a prevalent misconception in the industry concerning the time-optimality of S-shaped trajectories with minimal switching times.},

Indeed, to robustly achieve dynamic consensus on the solution estimates and the global descent direction, we embed in our algorithms a distributed implementation of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Such a mechanism is suitably interlaced with a local proportional action steering each agent estimate to the solution of the original consensus optimization problem. First, in the case of ideal networks, by using tools from system theory, we prove the linear convergence of the scheme with strongly convex costs. Then, by exploiting the averaging theory, we extend such a first result to prove that the robust extension of our method preserves linear convergence in the case of asynchronous agents and packet losses. Further, by using the notion of Input-to-State Stability, we also guarantee the robustness of the schemes with respect to additional, generic errors affecting the agents&#39; updates.

The optimization problem is defined over a network that collectively minimizes a separable cost function with coupled linear constraints. An equivalent optimization problem with auxiliary decision variables and a decoupling structure is proposed. A sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the subgradient information can be computed using local information. This then leads to a subgradient algorithm for updating the auxiliary variables. A case with sparse coupling constraints is further considered, and it is shown to have better memory and communication efficiency. For the specific case of a CBF-induced time-varying quadratic program (QP), an update law is proposed that achieves finite-time convergence. Numerical results involving a static resource allocation problem and a safe coordination problem for a multi-agent system demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.},

The solution is based on a novel distributed reformulation of the original centralized semi-definite outer Löwner-John program, characterized by a non-separable objective function and global constraints. We prove finite-time convergence to the global minima of the centralized problem in the static case and finite-time bounded tracking error in the dynamic case. Moreover, we prove boundedness of estimation in the tracking of the global optimum and robustness in the estimation against time-varying inputs.

This work considers a more general setting where the constraints can also dynamically adjust in response to changes in the decision variables. Specifically, we consider linear constraints and analyze the effect of decision-dependent distributions in both the objective function and constraints. Firstly, we establish a sufficient condition for the existence of a constrained equilibrium point, at which the distributions remain invariant under retraining. Moreover, we propose and analyze two algorithms: repeated constrained optimization and repeated dual ascent. For each algorithm, we provide sufficient conditions for convergence to the constrained equilibrium point. Furthermore, we explore the relationship between the equilibrium point and the optimal point for the constrained decision-dependent optimization problem. Notably, our results encompass previous findings as special cases when the constraints remain fixed. To show the effectiveness of our theoretical analysis, we provide numerical experiments on both a market problem and a dynamic pricing problem for parking based on real-world data.},

In this paper, we establish a connection between selecting the most informative data and finding the top-$k$ elements of a multiset. The top-$k$ selection in a network can be formulated as a distributed nonsmooth convex optimization problem known as quantile estimation. Unfortunately, the lack of smoothness in the local objective functions leads to extremely slow convergence and poor scalability with respect to the network size. To overcome this deficiency, we propose an accelerated method that employs smoothing techniques. Leveraging the piecewise linearity of the local objective functions in quantile estimation, we characterize the iteration complexity required to achieve top-$k$ selection, a challenging task due to the lack of strong convexity.

We present two control schemes that achieve closed-loop stability without Zeno behavior. The first scheme is implemented under logarithmic quantization and uses the quantized state for the threshold in the triggering condition. The second one is a joint design of zooming quantization and self-triggered sampling, where the adjustable zoom parameter for quantization changes based on inter-sampling times and is also used for the threshold of self-triggered sampling. In both schemes, the self-triggering mechanism predicts the future state from the quantized data for the computation of the next sampling time.

Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of the proposed distributed observer are established. The key to the proposed method is a refined canonical decomposition form of the coefficient matrices of the system which is introduced leveraging the real Jordan canonical form, the Popov-Belevitch-Hautus test, the matrix permutation, and the observable decomposition.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the joint problem of dynamics learning and tracking control for a class of parabolic partial differential equation (PDE) systems with infinite-dimensional uncertain nonlinear dynamics. A new learning control scheme is proposed based on the deterministic learning (DL) theory. One key feature of the proposed scheme is its capability of accurately learning the system&#39;s nonlinear uncertain dynamics during real-time tracking control with provable stability and convergence of the overall PDE closed-loop system. Specifically, the Galerkin method is first employed to deal with the infinite dimensionality of the PDE system; a novel DL-based adaptive learning control scheme is then proposed using dual radial basis function neural networks (RBF NNs), in which a pair of RBF NNs are employed to address respectively the matched and unmatched components of uncertain nonlinear system dynamics. This control scheme is finally examined on the original PDE system, and it is rigorously proved that: (i) the PDE system&#39;s state tracks the prescribed reference trajectory with guaranteed closed-loop stability and tracking accuracy; and (ii) locally accurate identification of the PDE system&#39;s dominant nonlinear uncertain dynamics can be achieved with provable convergence of associated NN weights to their optimal values, thereby the learned knowledge can be ultimately stored and represented by the convergent constant RBF NN models. Based on this, an experience-based control scheme is further proposed, which is capable of recalling the associated learned knowledge in real-time to further improve control performance and reduce computational complexity with maintained provable stabilization. It is worth stressing that although this work is focused particularly on parabolic PDE systems, it is groundbreaking with important technical breakthroughs that would facilitate a more complete extension of the DL theory from traditional ordinary differential equation (ODE) systems to PDE systems in the future. Extensive simulation studies have been conducted to demonstrate effectiveness and advantage of the proposed results.},

  abstract     = {Entropy regularization is an efficient technique for encouraging exploration and preventing a premature convergence of (vanilla) policy gradient methods in reinforcement learning (RL). However, the theoretical understanding of entropy regularized RL algorithms has been limited. In this paper, we revisit the classical entropy regularized policy gradient methods with the soft-max policy parametrization, whose convergence has so far only been established assuming access to exact gradient oracles. To go beyond this scenario, we propose the first set of (nearly) unbiased stochastic policy gradient estimators with trajectory-level entropy regularization, with one being an unbiased visitation measure-based estimator and the other one being a nearly unbiased yet more practical trajectory-based estimator. We prove that although the estimators themselves are unbounded in general due to the additional logarithmic policy rewards introduced by the entropy term, the variances are uniformly bounded. We then propose a two-phase stochastic policy gradient (PG) algorithm that uses a large batch size in the first phase to overcome the challenge of the stochastic approximation due to the non-coercive landscape, and uses a small batch size in the second phase by leveraging the curvature information around the optimal policy. We establish a global optimality convergence result and a sample complexity of $\widetilde{\mathcal {O}}(\frac{1}{\epsilon ^{2}})$ for the proposed algorithm. Our result is the first global convergence and sample complexity results for the stochastic entropy-regularized vanilla PG method.},

Such equivalence inherits the well-known property of contracting ODE systems on a specific manifold. Subsequently, we construct an auxiliary ODE system from a DAE system whose trajectories encapsulate those of the corresponding variational DAE system. Using the auxiliary ODE system, a sufficient condition for contraction of the time-varying DAE system is established by using matrix measures, which allows us to estimate a lower bound on the parameters of the auxiliary system.

  abstract     = {The leader-following consensus problem for multiple uncertain Euler-Lagrange (EL) systems has been extensively studied by two approaches: robust control approach and adaptive control approach. The adaptive control approach has the advantage that it does not require the bounds of unknown parameters be known but has the shortcoming that the control law is of high dimension as every unknown parameter has to be estimated by the local control law of every follower. On the other hand, the robust control has the advantage that the dimension of the control law is lower than the adaptive one but it needs to assume that the bounds of the uncertain parameters and the disturbances are known. Moreover, the validity of the existing robust control approaches relies on some restrictive assumptions on the communication networks and the dynamics of the EL systems. In this paper, we consider the leader-following consensus problem for multiple uncertain EL systems where both the bounds of the uncertain parameters and the disturbances are unknown. We solve this problem by augmenting the robust control law with an adaptive control mechanism for estimating the unknown bound of all uncertain parameters and the unknown bound of all disturbances of each follower. As a result, regardless of the number of the uncertain parameters and the dimension of the disturbances of each follower, the dimension of each local control law of each follower in this paper is only two, which is in contrast with the dimension of the adaptive control approach in the literature. Moreover, we consider jointly connected switching networks which can be disconnected at any time instant.},

  abstract     = {Safely exploring environments with a-priori unknown constraints is a fundamental challenge that restricts the autonomy of robots. While safety is paramount, guarantees on sufficient exploration are also crucial for ensuring autonomous task completion. To address these challenges, we propose a novel safe guaranteed exploration framework using optimal control, which achieves first-of-its-kind results: guaranteed exploration for non-linear systems with finite time sample complexity bounds, while being provably safe with arbitrarily high probability. The framework is general and applicable to many real-world scenarios with complex non-linear dynamics and unknown domains. We improve the efficiency of this general framework by proposing an algorithm, SageMPC, SAfe Guaranteed Exploration using Model Predictive Control. SageMPC leverages three key techniques: i) exploiting a Lipschitz bound, ii) goal-directed exploration, and iii) receding horizon style re-planning, all while maintaining the desired sample complexity, safety and exploration guarantees of the framework. Lastly, we demonstrate safe efficient exploration in challenging unknown environments using SageMPC with a car model.},

The use of scheduling matrices is a generalization of the scalar scheduling signals used in the literature, and allows for greater design freedom when scheduling systems, such as in the case of gain-scheduled control. Furthermore, this work extends the existing gain-scheduling results to a broader class of QSR-dissipative systems. The matrix-scheduling of important special cases, such as passive, input strictly passive, output strictly passive, finite $\mathcal {L}_{2}$ gain, very strictly passive, and conic systems are presented. The proposed gain-scheduling architecture is used in the context of controlling a planar three-link robot subject to model uncertainty. A novel control synthesis technique is used to design QSR-dissipative subcontrollers that are gain-scheduled using scheduling matrices. Numerical simulation results highlight the greater design freedom of scheduling matrices, leading to improved performance.},

The existing methods require the initial stabilizing control policy, the persistence of excitation (PE) condition and the data storage to ensure the algorithm convergence. Fundamentally different from them, these restrictions can be relaxed in the proposed method. Specifically, an adaptive parameter is elaborately designed to remove the requirement of the initial stabilizing control policy. Besides, an online data calculation scheme is proposed, which can not only replace the stored historical data by online data, but also can relax the PE condition to the interval excitation (IE) condition. The simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm, and its superiority is also demonstrated by comparing it with existing algorithms.},

To improve the theoretical understanding, we adopt the asynchronous parallel zero-order policy gradient (AZOPG) method to solve the continuous-time linear quadratic regulation problem. Specifically, multiple workers independently perform system rollouts to estimate zero-order PGs, which are then aggregated in a master for policy updates. Moreover, each worker is allowed to interact with the master asynchronously, leading to delayed PG estimates. By quantifying the convergence rate of AZOPG, we show a linear speedup property both in theory and simulation, which reveals the advantages of using asynchronous parallel workers in learning policies.},

The satisfaction of these objectives becomes more challenging when considering time-varying dynamics and disturbances, which arise in real-world contexts. We develop methods with the potential to address these issues by applying an offline-computed safety guaranteeing controller on a physical system, to track a virtual system that evolves through a trajectory that is replanned online, accounting for constraints updated online. The first method we propose is designed for general time-varying systems over a finite horizon. Our second method overcomes the finite horizon restriction for periodic systems.

However, designing the RISE controller to yield exponential tracking error convergence in the presence of actuator saturation has been an open problem. Although there are existing results that provide a saturation scheme for RISE controllers, these results only guarantee asymptotic tracking error convergence using a Lyapunov-based analysis. In this paper, a new design strategy is developed using a projection algorithm and auxiliary filters to yield exponential tracking error convergence. This new strategy does not employ trigonometric or hyperbolic saturation functions inherent to previous saturated (or amplitude limited) controllers. As a result, a Lyapunov-based analysis can be constructed that yields exponential convergence of the tracking errors. Comparative simulation results demonstrate the performance of the developed method in comparison with a baseline controller. The developed method can operate at a lower saturation limit than the baseline method while maintaining stability and achieving exponential tracking error convergence.},

To give a trade-off between the two, this paper focuses on the bipartite synchronization problems over signed topologies and aims to achieve finite-time control for general linear agents subject to input saturation constraints. Firstly, this paper considers homogeneous agents and presents a class of bipartite synchronization protocols with saturation constraint, which exploits the solution of the time-varying Riccati equation (TVRE) to design the control gain. Then, a time-varying parameter scheduler is tactically designed for TVRE and achieves finite-time bipartite synchronization. Note that the design uses the solution computed online and brings a bit of conservatism in determining the settling time. So, for heterogeneous agents, this paper constructs a modified parameter scheduler computed off-line to reduce the conservatism. A class of finite-time bipartite synchronization generators and generator-based finite-time protocols are proposed. It shows that, in both designs, the control input subjects to the bound saturation during convergence even if the gain escapes to infinity towards the settling time. Moreover, the trade-off among the finite convergence time, the saturation bound of the input, and the initial domain are analyzed explicitly in theory. Finally, two simulations verify the validity of the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {In decentralized optimization over networks, synchronizing the updates of all nodes incurs significant communication overhead. For this reason, much of the recent literature has focused on the analysis and design of asynchronous optimization algorithms where nodes can activate anytime and contact a single neighbor to complete an iteration together. However, most works assume that the neighbor selection is done at random based on a fixed probability distribution (e.g., uniform), a choice that ignores the optimization landscape at the moment of activation. Instead, in this work we introduce an optimization-aware selection rule that chooses the neighbor providing the highest dual cost improvement (a quantity related to a dualization of the problem based on consensus). This scheme is related to the coordinate descent (CD) method with the Gauss-Southwell (GS) rule for coordinate updates; in our setting however, only a subset of coordinates is accessible at each iteration (because each node can communicate only with its neighbors), so the existing literature on GS methods does not apply. To overcome this difficulty, we develop a new analytical framework for smooth and strongly convex functions that covers our new class of setwise CD algorithms –a class that applies to both decentralized and parallel distributed computing scenarios– and we show that the proposed setwise GS rule can speed up the convergence in terms of iterations by a factor equal to the size of the largest coordinate set. We analyze extensions of these algorithms that exploit the knowledge of the smoothness constants when available and otherwise propose an algorithm to estimate these constants. Finally, we validate our theoretical results through extensive simulations.},

While robust closed loop stability of the deterministic part of the closed loop is guaranteed by a Lyapunov-based approach, the performance is improved by a separate $\mathcal {D}_{\mathrm{R}}$ eigenvalue region for the controller and observer. In addition, input, process, and sensor noise is suppressed by solving an optimization problem with an objective function derived from the discrete-time Itô differential operator. Therefore, an iterative LMI method is utilized, which leads to less conservative optimization results. Polynomial parameter dependencies are treated by including the calculation of upper and lower bounds in the set of LMIs with the theorem of Ehlich and Zeller. Therefore, the polynomial nonlinearities are formulated by means of quasilinear system representations, which are interpreted as polynomial matrices. Thus, the polynomial nonlinearities are treated in their original polynomial form, without using polytopic approximations. As a result, the optimization of the controller parameters is improved in contrast to conventional polytopic approaches. The results of the novel approach of polynomial uncertainty representations are discussed in detail in two examples, wherein the reproducibility is guaranteed and the practical applicability of the approach is demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {Common tasks in system analysis and control include optimal control, peak estimation, reachable set estimation, and maximum control invariant set estimation. A standard method to solve these problems is to lift them into infinite-dimensional convex linear programs. However, finite-dimensional truncations of these problems suffer a curse of dimensionality with respect to the size of the state and input. In the case where the dynamical system is input-affine and the input is restricted to a convex set, decomposition methods may be employed to eliminate the input and yield more tractable finite-dimensional truncations. Prior work on these eliminations include enforcing vertex constraints (switching), or employing facial decompositions in the case where the polytopic set is a scaled box. This work generalizes the box-facial technique towards the decompositions of arbitrary convex input-constraining sets using methods from robust optimization. The robustified programs are proven to have the same optimal value and an equivalent set of optimizers as the original program under mild compactness and regularity constraints. Specific attention is paid towards robust-counterpart decomposition of semidefinite representable sets when employing the Moment-Sum-of-Squares hierarchy for polynomial optimization. Efficacy is demonstrated under data-driven peak and distance estimation problems.},

Under this setting, we obtain the practically implementable explicit feedback-type linear optimal solution to the problem. In particular, we decompose the original problem into the (control-constrained) partially-observed LQ risk-sensitive control problem and the LQ risk-neutral problem for the mean-field dynamics. While the optimal solution of the former is characterized by the risk-sensitive state estimator and satisfies the associated control constraint, the optimal solution of the latter is represented by the state-feedback mean-field type process. Then by combining the optimal solutions of these two problems, we obtain the explicit feedback-type linear optimal solution to the original problem.

Our analysis is explicit on the similarity between Hessian matrices of local objective functions which captures the degree of data homogeneity. We illustrate the impact of our analysis through studying the transient time, defined as the minimum number of iterations required for a distributed algorithm to achieve comparable performance as its centralized counterpart. When the local objective functions have similar Hessian, the transient time of DSGD can be as small as ${\cal O}(n^{2/3}/\rho ^{8/3})$ for smooth (possibly non-convex) objective functions, ${\cal O}(\sqrt{n}/\rho)$ for strongly convex objective functions, where $n$ is the number of agents and $\rho$ is the spectral gap of graph. These findings provide a theoretical justification for the empirical success of DSGD. Our analysis relies on a novel observation with higher-order Taylor approximation for gradient maps that can be of independent interest. Numerical simulations validate our findings.},

A further contribution of this paper is the appropriate motion planning design of the so-called probing (or perturbation) signal, which is more involved than in the non-distributed counterpart. Hence, with these two design ingredients, we provide an averaging-based methodology that can be implemented using the gradient and Hessian estimates. Local exponential stability for the closed-loop equilibrium of the average error dynamics is guaranteed through a Lyapunov-based analysis. By employing the averaging theory for infinite-dimensional systems, we prove that the trajectory converges to a small neighborhood surrounding the optimal point.

The optimal solution is derived for first-order systems and the result is exploited to design adaptive quantizers for generic systems, minimizing the size of the feasible output signal set. Then, the number of sensor thresholds for which the adaptive quantizers guarantee asymptotic boundedness of the state estimation uncertainty is established. Threshold adaptation mechanisms based on several types of outer approximations of the feasible state set are also proposed. The effectiveness of the designed adaptive quantizers is demonstrated on numerical tests, highlighting the trade off between the resulting estimation uncertainty and the computational burden required by recursive set approximations.},

Different from the existing works, the nonlinear growth rates under consideration are allowed to contain unknown constants and state-input-dependent functions, and the impulse effects are allowed to have unknown sizes. This problem has remained unsolved because it exceeds the coverage of common assumptions in impulsive systems. To this end, we propose a novel logic-based switching gain approach. Specifically, the well-designed logic-based switching mechanism detects the Lyapunov function in real-time to adjust the candidate gain online such that the gain grows large enough to effectively dominate the strong nonlinearities and serious uncertainties. Interestingly, the proposed approach removes the restriction on impulse frequency (reflected by the average impulsive interval constant) within the lower-triangular structural framework, and executes only one switching action to obtain the upper bound of the required gain within the upper-triangular structural framework. It is shown that the logic-based switching adaptive controller ensures that all the closed-loop signals are bounded and the system states converge to the origin at an exponential rate. Finally, the effectiveness of the presented results is demonstrated by two representative examples.},

To this end, the system is first transformed to a region automaton that is a finite representation of the system&#39;s semantics.

To quantify the resilience of the interconnected system under the action of replay attacks, we derive bounds on the duration of each cyber-attack and the resting time between two consecutive cyber-attacks. Specifically, when each attack duration is smaller than our designed upper bound, the interconnected system controlled by the distributed approximation-based controller remains asymptotically stable. Moreover, if the resting time between two consecutive attacks is larger than the proposed bound, then all signals of the control system are guaranteed to be bounded.

  abstract     = {Studies carried out in real plants have shown that repeated and/or intermittent fault events occur frequently during the operation of a system. Regarding the occurrence of repeated fault events, the problem becomes that of determining the number of occurrences of the fault event, namely, for a given $\kappa \in \mathbb {Z}_+^*$, and based on the observation of events, be sure that the fault event has occurred at least $\kappa$ times ($\kappa$-diagnosability). In this paper, the problem of repeated fault diagnosability is revisited, and a new algorithm that relies on a diagnoser-based automaton is proposed for the verification of $\kappa$-diagnosability. Based on the proposed test automaton, a necessary and sufficient condition for $\kappa$-diagnosability is presented. As a by-product of the proposed method to verify $\kappa$-diagnosability, a diagnoser that can be used for online diagnosis is also developed.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the consensus problem of multiple Euler-Lagrange (EL) systems with time-varying asymmetric full-state constraints under a directed graph is investigated in a fully distributed way, where the global information dependence is removed. First, to prevent the violation of the full-state constraints of each EL system, a nonlinear state-dependent transformation (NSDT) is adopted for both the leader and followers, where the constraints will not be violated as long as the transformed states remain finite. Then, a constrained nonlinear fully distributed observer is constructed using only neighbors&#39; states, and an adaptive gain is designed to eliminate the dependence of the global information. The theoretical analysis is completed via constructing a novel integration-based Lyapunov function using a graph-based diagonal matrix, ensuring the achievement of consensus. Using the observed state, an adaptive back-stepping state tracking control protocol is developed such that the position of each EL system can track the leader within a tolerable bounded region. Thus, the leader-following consensus of multiple EL systems with time-varying asymmetric full-state constraints is achieved. Simulation results are illustrated to show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

A novel distributed Nash equilibrium (NE) seeking algorithm is adapted for this problem tackling two main difficulties. First, the presence of the unbalanced digraph disrupts some essential properties of the Laplacian matrix. To overcome this limitation, a compensation mechanism based on output feedback is introduced. Second, to ensure players&#39; actions meet the constraints, an adaptive penalty technique is introduced. This technique effectively uses the information obtained from the intrinsic nature of the constraints and fulfills the quantitative estimation of penalty parameters, where the penalty parameters are able to vary along with the degree of constraint violation. To reduce unnecessary communication among players, a novel distributed NE seeking algorithm with a bivariate dynamic event-triggered mechanism is employed, which ensures exponential NE seeking while avoiding the Zeno behavior. Finally, a connectivity control game is given to evaluate the effectiveness of the results.},

To expedite the optimization process, we amalgamate the heavy ball and Nesterov&#39;s accelerated method with distributed aggregative gradient tracking, resulting in the proposal of two innovative algorithms, aimed at resolving the distributed aggregative optimization problem. Our analysis demonstrates that the proposed algorithms can converge to an optimal solution at a global linear convergence rate when the objective function is strongly convex with the Lipschitz-continuous gradient, and when the parameters (e.g., step size and momentum coefficients) are chosen within specific ranges. Additionally, we present several numerical experiments to verify the effectiveness, robustness and superiority of our proposed algorithms.},

  abstract = {Under the context of the increasing social demand for fine-grained sentiment analysis (SA), implicit sentiment analysis (ISA) poses a significant challenge owing to the absence of salient cue words in expressions. Thus, reliable reasoning is required to understand how sentiment is evoked, enabling the identification of implicit sentiments. In the era of large language models (LLMs), encoder-decoder (ED) LLMs have emerged as popular backbone models for SA applications, given their impressive text comprehension and reasoning capabilities across diverse tasks. In comparison, decoder-only (DO) LLMs exhibit superior natural language generation and in-context learning capabilities. However, their responses may contain misleading or inaccurate information. To accurately identify implicit sentiments with reliable reasoning, this study introduces a two-stage reasoning framework named Reasoning and Verification for Implicit Sentiment Analysis (RVISA), which leverages the generation ability of DO LLMs and reasoning ability of ED LLMs to train an enhanced reasoner. The framework involves three-hop reasoning prompting to explicitly furnish sentiment elements as cues. The generated rationales are then used to fine-tune an ED LLM into a skilled reasoner. Additionally, we develop a straightforward yet effective answer-based verification mechanism to ensure the reliability of reasoning learning. Evaluation of the proposed method on two benchmark datasets demonstrates that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in ISA.},

  abstract = {Speech Depression Detection (SDD) has garnered attention from researchers due to its low cost and convenience. However, current algorithms lack methods for extracting interpretable acoustic features based on clinical manifestations. In addition, effectively fusing these features to overcome individual heterogeneity remains a challenge. This study proposes a decoupled multi-perspective fusion (DMPF) model. The model extracts five key features of voiceprint, emotion, pause, energy, and tremor based on the multi-perspective clinical manifestations. These features are then decoupled into common and private features, which fused through graph attention network to obtain the comprehensive depression representation. Notably, this study has collected a depression speech dataset, which includes standardized and comprehensive tasks along with diagnostic labels provided by psychologists. Extensive subject-independent experiments were conducted on the DAIC-WOZ, MODMA and MPSC datasets. The voiceprint features can automatically cluster the depressed and non-depressed populations. Furthermore, DMPF can effectively fuse common and private features from different perspectives, achieving AUC of 84.20%, 85.34%, 86.13% on three datasets. The results illustrate the interpretability of multi-perspective features and demonstrate that the combination of speech manifestations can enhance the detection ability, which can provide a multi-perspective observational tool for physicians and clinical practice.

This is particularly relevant when the robot&#39;s actions may interfere with or intrude on people&#39;s activities, creating discomfort and possible rejection. We believe that people&#39;s acceptance of a robot may vary depending on the activities they are involved in. In this study, we investigate the impact of a robot&#39;s actions on people&#39;s engagement in an activity while the robot has the task of monitoring them. We observed the behaviours of 18 older adults with respect to the robot while they were carrying out tasks that require different cognitive workloads (e.g., working at the PC, talking on the phone). We used subjective and objective metrics, such as social cues, to evaluate people&#39;s engagement in the robot and their disengagement in their own tasks. We observed that people were distracted by the robot&#39;s behaviours based on the cognitive loads required by their activity. Our results show that variation in people&#39;s engagement in the robot and the task is affected by their perception of the usefulness of and trust in the robot, and by individuals&#39; personality traits and acceptance of the robot. People with higher trust in the robot, and a higher degree of conscientiousness and emotional stability, tend to continue with their task, paying less attention to the robot. We observed, in contrast, that a robot perceived as a social entity caught more easily their attention when people have a higher extroverted personality. Our findings also showed that variations in the affective and emotional demeanour of the participants are a predictor of their distraction to an external observer.},

Existing methods mainly focused on designing sophisticated feature fusion strategies to integrate the separately extracted multimodal representations, ignoring the interference of the information irrelevant to sentiment. In this paper, we propose to disentangle the unimodal representations into sentiment-specific and sentiment-independent features, the former of which are fused for the MSA task. Specifically, we design a novel Sentiment-aware Disentangled Representation Shifting framework, termed SDRS, with two components. Interactive sentiment-aware representation disentanglement aims to extract sentiment-specific feature representations for each nonverbal modality by considering the contextual influence of other modalities with the newly developed cross-attention autoencoder. Attentive cross-modal representation shifting tries to shift the textual representation in a latent token space using the nonverbal sentiment-specific representations after projection. The shifted representation is finally employed to fine-tune a pre-trained language model for multimodal sentiment analysis. Extensive experiments are conducted on three public benchmark datasets, i.e., CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS. The results demonstrate that the proposed SDRS framework not only obtains state-of-the-art results based solely on multimodal labels but also outperforms the methods that additionally require the labels of each modality.},

Each of the models we evaluated is trained and tested with the publicly available AffectiveROAD dataset to estimate three categories of driver-reported stress level. We test three types of modelling approaches: (i) single-frame baselines (Random Forest, SVM, and Convolutional Neural Networks); (ii) Temporal Segment Networks (TSN) and two variants of it, which use learned weights (TSN-w) and LSTM (TSN-LSTM) as consensus functions; and (iii) video classification Transformers. Our experiments reveal that the TSN-w, TSN-LSTM, and Transformer models achieve statistically equivalent performances, all significantly outperforming the other models. Particularly noteworthy is TSN-w, which attains the highest performance observed with an average accuracy of 0.77. We further provide an explainability analysis using Class Activation Mapping and image semantic segmentation to identify the elements of the road scene that contribute the most to high levels of stress. Our results demonstrate that the visible road scene offers significant contextual information for estimating driver-reported stress levels, with potential implications for the design of safer urban road environments.},

  abstract = {Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) is an attractive research that aims to integrate sentiment expressed in textual, visual, and acoustic signals. There are two main problems in the existing methods: 1) the dominant role of the text is underutilization in unaligned multimodal data, and 2) the modality under uncertain missing feature is not sufficiently explored. This paper proposes a Text-guided Reconstruction Network (TgRN) for MSA with uncertain missing modalities in non-aligned sequences. The TgRN network includes three primary modules: Text-guided Extraction Module (TEM), Reconstruction Module (RM) and Text-guided Fusion Module (TFM). First, the TEM consists of the text-guided cross attention units and self-attention units to capture inter-modal features and intra-modal features, respectively. Second, leveraging enhanced attention units and a three-way squeeze-and-excitation block, the RM is designed to learn semantic information from incomplete data and reconstruct missing modality features. Third, the TFM utilizes a progressive modality-mixing adaptation gate to explore the dynamic correlations between nonverbal and verbal modalities, effectively addressing the modality gap issue. Finally, under the supervision of sentiment prediction loss and reconstruction loss, the TgRN effectively processes both uncertain missing-modality conditions and ideal complete modality conditions. Extensive experiments on CMU-MOSI and CH-SIMS demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract = {In the field of human-computer interaction and psychological assessment, speech emotion recognition (SER) plays an important role in deciphering emotional states from speech signals. Despite advancements, challenges persist due to system complexity, feature distinctiveness issues, and noise interference. This paper introduces a new end-to-end (E2E) deep learning multi-resolution framework for SER, addressing these limitations by extracting meaningful representations directly from raw waveform speech signals. By leveraging the properties of the fast discrete wavelet transform (FDWT), including the cascade algorithm, conjugate quadrature filter, and coefficient denoising, our approach introduces a learnable model for both wavelet bases and denoising through deep learning techniques. The framework incorporates an activation function for learnable asymmetric hard thresholding of wavelet coefficients. Our approach exploits the capabilities of wavelets for effective localization in both time and frequency domains. We then combine one-dimensional dilated convolutional neural networks (1D dilated CNN) with a spatial attention layer and bidirectional gated recurrent units (Bi-GRU) with a temporal attention layer to efficiently capture the nuanced spatial and temporal characteristics of emotional features. By handling variable-length speech without segmentation and eliminating the need for pre or post-processing, the proposed model outperformed state-of-the-art methods on IEMOCAP and EMO-DB datasets.

  abstract = {While existing depression prediction methods based on deep learning show promise, their practical application is hindered by the lack of trustworthiness, as these deep models are often deployed as black box models, leaving us uncertain on the confidence of their predictions. For high-risk clinical applications like depression prediction, uncertainty quantification is essential in decision-making. In this paper, we introduce conformal depression prediction (CDP), a depression prediction method with uncertainty quantification based on conformal prediction (CP), giving valid confidence intervals with theoretical coverage guarantees for the model predictions. CDP is a plug-and-play module that requires neither model retraining nor an assumption about the depression data distribution. As CDP provides only an average coverage guarantee across all inputs rather than per-input performance guarantee, we further propose CDP-ACC, an improved conformal prediction with approximate conditional coverage. CDP-ACC firstly estimates the prediction distribution through neighborhood relaxation, and then introduces a conformal score function by constructing nested sequences, so as to provide a tighter prediction interval adaptive to specific input. We empirically demonstrate the application of CDP in uncertainty-aware facial depression prediction, as well as the effectiveness and superiority of CDP-ACC on the AVEC 2013 and AVEC 2014 datasets.

  abstract = {Depression, driven by growing societal pressures, significantly disrupts individuals&#39; physical and mental health. Automatic Depression Recognition (ADR) via facial videos has gained attention to enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. However, extant methods often segment videos, losing long-term behavioral cues and introducing noise, while also exhibiting performance drops across diverse cultural and racial datasets. This study proposes a multimodal ADR approach encompassing three key components: (1) Long-term Depression Behavior Module (LDBM) employing a Transformer to capture extended depression cues, (2) Noisy Information Elimination (NIE) strategy leveraging LDBM attention scores to reduce noise and boost diagnostic precision, and (3) Multimodal Spatio-temporal Routing Feature Ensemble (MSRE) that fuses texture, Facial Action Primitives (FAPs), and Remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) data for improved cross-dataset generalizability. Experiments on AVEC 2013, AVEC 2014, and a newly constructed CMDep dataset of 123 clinically diagnosed participants validate our method, achieving MAE/RMSE scores of 5.38/6.74, 5.09/6.83, and 5.59/8.03, respectively. The CMDep dataset includes facial expression and voice signals, with labels derived from BDI-II scores. Additionally, our method has been integrated into a user-friendly mobile application, providing a tool for real-time self-assessment of depression. This integration broadens the scope of depression detection, making it accessible to diverse populations worldwide. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Amcky/Multimodal-Depression.},

  abstract = {Empathetic response generation, aiming to understand the user&#39;s situation and feelings and respond empathically, is crucial in building human- like dialogue systems. Traditional approaches typically employ maximum likelihood estimation as the optimization objective during training, yet fail to align the empathy levels between generated and target responses. To this end, we propose an empathetic response generation framework using reinforcement learning (EmpRL). The framework develops an effective empathy reward function and generates empathetic responses by maximizing the expected reward through reinforcement learning. EmpRL utilizes the pre-trained T5 model as the generator and further fine-tunes it to initialize the policy. To align the empathy levels between generated and target responses within a given context, an empathy reward function containing three empathy communication mechanisms—emotional reaction, interpretation, and exploration—is constructed using pre-designed and pre-trained empathy identifiers. During reinforcement learning training, the proximal policy optimization algorithm is used to fine-tune the policy, enabling the generation of empathetic responses. Both automatic and human evaluations demonstrate that the proposed EmpRL framework significantly improves the quality of generated responses, enhances the similarity in empathy levels between generated and target responses, and produces empathetic responses covering both affective and cognitive aspects.},

  abstract = {Emotion recognition in conversation (ERC) aims at accurately identifying emotional states expressed in conversational content. Existing ERC methods, although relying on semantic understanding, often encounter challenges when confronted with incomplete or misleading semantic information. In addition, when dealing with the interaction between emotional and semantic information, existing methods are often difficult to effectively distinguish the complex relationship between the two, which affects the accuracy of emotion recognition. To address the problems of semantic misdirection and emotional cross-talk encountered by traditional models when confronted with complex conversational data, we propose a semantic and emotional dual channel (SEDC) strategy for emotion recognition in conversations to process emotional and semantic information independently. Under this strategy, emotion information provides an auxiliary recognition function when the semantics are unclear or lacking, enhancing the accuracy of the model. Our model consists of two modules: the emotion processing module accurately captures the emotional features of each utterance through contrastive learning, and then constructs a dialogue emotion propagation map to simulate the emotional information conveyed in the dialogue; the semantic processing module combines an external knowledge base to enhance the semantic expression of the dialogue through knowledge enhancement strategies. This divide-and-conquer approach allows us to more deeply analyze the emotional and semantic dimensions of complex dialogues. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP, EmoryNLP, MELD, and DailyDialog datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms existing techniques and effectively improves the accuracy of dialogue emotion recognition.

  abstract = {Self-taught learning (STL) is a promising solution that reduces the performance gap between weakly supervised and fully supervised learning for easily accessible, label-free images. The success of traditional STL solutions relies on the assumption that the target appearance is completely visible and well-defined. In real-world facial expression recognition scenarios, however, saliency regions are often partially occluded, which significantly hampers the generalization capability of STL methods. Nevertheless, few studies have investigated the impact of occlusion on STL. In this paper, we propose an interweaved autoencoder network for weakly supervised facial expression recognition in occlusion scenarios. The key innovation of our network lies in the Residual Connection Union (RCU) blocks that can integrate the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Transformer layers into a multi-scale structure. The RCU enables a progressive masking strategy to accurately identify and focus on contributive yet often overlooked image patches by analyzing the relationships among region-level target representations. In addition, we introduce a self-knowledge distillation module for the effective training of the proposed autoencoder network. Extensive experiments are conducted on four public datasets to demonstrate the superiority of our method over related works.},

  abstract = {Facial Action Units (AUs) are essential for conveying psychological states and emotional expressions. While automatic AU detection systems leveraging deep learning have progressed, they often overfit to specific datasets and individual features, limiting their cross-domain applicability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a doubly adaptive dropout approach for cross-domain AU detection, which enhances the robustness of convolutional feature maps and spatial tokens against domain shifts. This approach includes a Channel Drop Unit (CD-Unit) and a Token Drop Unit (TD-Unit), which work together to reduce domain-specific noise at both the channel and token levels. The CD-Unit preserves domain-agnostic local patterns in feature maps, while the TD-Unit helps the model identify AU relationships generalizable across domains. An auxiliary domain classifier, integrated at each layer, guides the selective omission of domain-sensitive features. To prevent excessive feature dropout, a progressive training strategy is used, allowing for selective exclusion of sensitive features at any model layer. Our method consistently outperforms existing techniques in cross-domain AU detection, as demonstrated by extensive experimental evaluations. Visualizations of attention maps also highlight clear and meaningful patterns related to both individual and combined AUs, further validating the approach&#39;s effectiveness.},

To address this embarrassment, we pioneer a new task called “fake face recognition”, which seeks to discover the identity of the source face based on the fake face. Besides, we design a hybrid and dynamic learning strategy for fake face recognition. Specifically, we hybridize the existing real face recognition dataset with the fake face dataset. Based on the popular margin-based face recognition approach, we achieve dynamic learning by adjusting the margin for the fake face samples. The deep network is guided to first focus on real samples and then explore the identity implicit commonalities between real and fake samples. To verify the performance of the fake face recognition model, we further organize the existing fake face datasets into face pairs. Extensive experiments on the fake face datasets show that our proposed hybrid and dynamic learning strategy achieves superior average accuracy (98.46%) compared to benchmark studies.},

To address this gap, we propose a novel Recursive Ensemble Feature Selection (REFS) framework that explicitly incorporates diversity into the aggregation phase to improve both robustness and accuracy. The framework comprises three key components: (1) a randomization-based feature mapping strategy to generate diverse base feature selectors optimized for performance; (2) a quantitative diversity metric to evaluate the complementarity of these selectors; and (3) a fuzzy aggregation method that leverages order statistics, rank scores, and weight information to effectively integrate multiple ranked feature lists. Experimental evaluations on fifteen real-world datasets demonstrate that REFS consistently outperforms competitive methods in terms of classification accuracy and resilience to parameter variations. By explicitly integrating diversity into the aggregation process, REFS provides a more comprehensive and effective approach to feature selection, paving the way for improved predictive performance across diverse applications.},

  abstract     = {As an important component of robot localization and navigation, visual place recognition (VPR) has made significant improvements in the past few decades. Most existing state-of-the-art VPR methods face the following challenges: 1) Aiming only for performance with ideal conditions while overlooking real-world conditions; 2) The existing VPR paradigm, struggling to reconcile the transfer gap between upstream pre-training and downstream fine-tuning; 3) Deeper networks produce high-dimensional parameters in the model training that results in lower efficient of models. To address those problems, we propose a high-performance visual place recognition framework for robot navigation tasks. Concretely, our framework is composed of three major modules: 1) based on vision transformer (ViT), we design a siamese Cross-weight Pyramid Transformer (CWPFormer) backbone for image feature extraction. First, we integrate feature reconstruction and content cognition by inserting a feature pyramid phase into pre-training. Second, we establish weight correlation and sharing between feature downsampling and upsampling that offers multi-stage supervision to fine-tuning. 2) We found that the attention map has high similarity between heads, and the high-dimensional data processing based on the ViT leads to computational redundancy. To cope with this problem, we present a cascaded hash attention (CHA) module to feed the hash attention head with different complete feature splits, which not only saves the computational cost but also improves the attention diversity. 3) Besides, we adopt a Bayesian learning scheme with a dynamically constructed similarity matrix to learn one-dimensional compact hash codes to improve recognition accuracy. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed VPR approach on datasets and real-world environments. Our code is available: https://github.com/CV4RA/CWPFormer.},

However, the distributed computational nature of FL creates the necessity to develop a mechanism that can remotely trigger any network agents, track their activities, and prevent threats to the overall process posed by malicious participants. Particularly, the FL paradigm may become vulnerable due to an active attack from the network participants, called a poisonous attack. In such an attack, the malicious participant acts as a benign agent capable of affecting the global model quality by uploading an obfuscated poisoned local model update to the server. This paper presents a cross-device FL model that ensures trustworthiness, fairness, and authenticity in the underlying FL training process. We leverage trustworthiness by constructing a reputation-based trust model based on agents’ contributions toward model convergence. We ensure fairness by identifying and removing malicious agents from the training process through an outlier detection technique. Additionally, we establish authenticity by generating a token for each participating device through a distributed sensing mechanism and storing that unique token in a blockchain smart contract. Further, we insert the trust scores of all agents into a blockchain and validate their reputations using various consensus mechanisms that consider the computational task.},

Moreover, the simple sum aggregation is not aware of the probability distribution differences of substructures across graphs. These drawbacks cause inaccurate graph similarity. To resolve these problems, we propose a new method called the Distribution-Aware Simple-Path (DASP) graph kernel. The neural language models are employed to capture the probability distribution of substructures (specifically, simple paths) in each graph. A new metric called Probabilistic Minkowski Distance is developed to capture the probability distribution differences of simple paths across graphs. To further improve the performance, the label alphabet is expanded to enlarge the corpus of simple paths for the neural language models and DASP.

To tackle this challenge, we revisit its bilevel objective from the novel perspective of continuous dynamics and then solve the whole HO problem with the adjoint state theory. The proposed HO framework, termed Adjoint Diff, is naturally scalable to a very deep neural network with high-dimensional hyperparameters because it only requires constant memory cost in training. Adjoint Diff is in fact, a general framework that some existing gradient-based HO algorithms are well interpreted by it with simple algebra. In addition, we further offer the Adjoint Diff+ framework by incorporating the prevalent momentum learning concept into the basic Adjoint Diff for enhanced convergence. Experimental results show that our Adjoint Diff frameworks outperform several state-of-the-art approaches on three high-dimensional HO instances including designing loss function for imbalanced data, selecting samples from noisy labels and learning auxiliary tasks for fine-grained classification.},

In this paper, we introduce an innovative method, called PARE, which fully leverages relation paths to enhance the few-shot representation by simultaneously incorporating both neighborhood and relation path information. Inspired by the principles of information transmission, PARE directly models relation paths between entities and parameterizes the information interference within different relation paths. Through parameter learning, PARE effectively captures information propagation along relation paths while mitigating the influence of relation dependency. To preserve neighborhood information, we employ a two-step neighborhood aggregator to resolve few-shot neighbors’ ambiguity and develop a reconstruction module. By integrating the representations of relation paths and contextual neighborhoods, we achieve a comprehensive fewshot representation for two given entities. We utilize a matching processor for knowledge triplet evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our PARE model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on widely-used benchmark datasets.},

  abstract     = {Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer an effective approach to solving constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) by leveraging their temporal, event-driven dynamics. Moreover, neuromorphic hardware platforms provide the potential for achieving significant energy efficiency in implementing such models. Building upon these foundations, we present an enhanced, fully spiking pipeline for solving CSPs on the SpiNNaker neuromorphic hardware platform. Focusing on the use case of Sudoku puzzles, we demonstrate that the adoption of a constraint stabilization strategy, coupled with a neuron idling mechanism and a built-in validation process, enables this application to be realized through a series of additional layers of neurons capable of performing control logic operations, verifying solutions, and memorizing the network’s state. Simulations conducted in the GPU-enhanced Neuronal Networks (GeNN) environment validate the contributions of each pipeline component before deployment on SpiNNaker. This approach offers three key advantages: i) Improved success rates for solving CSPs, particularly for challenging instances from the hard class, surpassing state-of-the-art SNN-based solvers. ii) Reduced data transmission overhead by transmitting only the final activity state from SpiNNaker instead of all generated spikes. iii) Substantially decreased spike extraction time. Compared to previous work focused on the same use case, our approach achieves a significant reduction in the number of extracted spikes (54.63% to 99.98%) and extraction time (88.56% to 96.41%).},

  abstract     = {Anomalies are usually regarded as data errors or novel patterns previously unseen, which are quite different from most observed data. Accurate detection of anomalies is crucial in various application scenarios. This paper focuses on unsupervised anomaly detection from Multivariate Time Series (MTS), as real-world data collected from sources such as wearable devices, medical equipment and industrial machines typically manifest as MTS and are often unlabeled. Anomaly detection in MTS represents a data-driven challenge that traditionally requires substantial centralized data for training models. However, in practice, data are frequently distributed among multiple institutions, with privacy concerns restricting unrestricted access. To address these issues, we introduce Feature Decoupling Federated Learning (FDFL), an approach designed to collaboratively train a representation learning network over multiple clients for unsupervised anomaly detection in MTS. Unlike previous methods that simply integrate MTS anomaly detection algorithms with federated learning strategies, FDFL specifically addresses heterogeneity among clients by decoupling the representation network into shared and private branches through a contrastive learning mechanism. This method aggregates shared parameters during each federated round while maintaining client-specific private parameters locally. Additionally, we develop a self-attention block that integrates the representations derived from both shared and private parameters to reconstruct MTS and identify anomalies based on reconstruction errors. Extensive experiments conducted on three publicly available datasets demonstrate that FDFL outperforms existing algorithms in most cases, highlighting the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method in MTS anomaly detection.},

  abstract     = {The emerging field of Federated Learning (FL) is reshaping privacy-preserved data analysis and decision support mechanisms within several critical infrastructure (CIs) sectors such as autonomous transportation, energy, and healthcare. To shield sensitive operational and client data from privacy attackers, Differential Privacy (DP) has been proposed to integrate on top of the FL process. Yet, we identify that integrating Gaussian noise for achieving DP guarantee can inadvertently create a new vector for differential model poisoning attacks in FL. Moreover, exploiting the variance in Gaussian noise enables attackers to camouflage their activities within the legitimate noise of the system, a significant yet largely overlooked security flaw in the differentially private federated learning (DPFL) framework. Addressing this research gap, we introduce a novel adaptive model poisoning through episodic loss memorization (α-MPELM) technique. This method enables attackers to dynamically inject adversarial noise into the differentially private local model parameters. The technique has a dual purpose: hindering the optimal convergence of the global FL model and simultaneously avoiding detection by the anomaly detectors. Our evaluation of the α-MPELM attack reveals its capability to deceive Norm, Accuracy, and Mix anomaly detection algorithms, surpassing the conventional random malicious device (RMD) attacks with attack accuracy improvements of 6.8%, 12.6%, and 13.8%, respectively. Additionally, we introduce a reinforcement learning-based DP level selection strategy, rDP, as an effective countermeasure against α-MPELM attack. Our empirical findings confirm that this defense mechanism steadily progresses to an optimal policy.},

Although machine learning and deep learning have shown great potential in early cancer prediction, the accuracy of detection and prediction still needs to be improved due to the different scales of lesion areas. Therefore, we propose an adaptive multi-particle swarm neural architecture search method to automatically explore an efficient deep neural network architecture for high-incidence cancer prediction. Firstly, the multi-particle swarm strategy is used to initialize the high-quality architecture in the scale adaptive search space to enhance multi-scale perception. Then, the improved weighted average method is combined with classification accuracy, parameters and floating-point operations to adaptively update the particle swarm architecture to avoid falling into local optimum. In addition, a method based on weight sharing is used to improve the efficiency of architecture search. The experimental results show that comparing with the manual design network and the existing neural architecture search method, the proposed algorithm achieves average increments of 26.33%, 33.99%, 8.98%, 37.41%, 35.1% and 51.76% in classification accuracy, F1-Score, Cohen’s kappa, AUC, exponential balance accuracy and search efficiency, respectively.},

In this paper, we propose an innovative framework featuring the Latent Age Attribute Module (LAAM), which maps age attributes to a structured latent space that facilitates efficient sampling for precisely age attribute modeling. We further introduce the Age-AdaIN Fusion Module (AFM), which seamlessly integrates age features from LAAM with facial content features, enabling the generation of images that exhibit smooth, continuous age transitions. This framework excels in capturing fine-grained aging details, particularly for elderly individuals. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating realistic age-progressed facial images, with a notable improvement in elderly aging accuracy and detail.},

Deep learning techniques offer promising avenues for analyzing physiological signals in this domain. Despite numerous studies on emotion recognition using various physiological signals, challenges persist in classifying multimodal physiological signals due to data scarcity. Current research lacks focus on addressing data insufficiency for multimodal physiological signals. This paper proposes an innovative method to address this issue and improve the effect of emotion recognition using multimodal physiological signal data. Our model comprises a physiological signal encoder, a multimodal data generator, and a multimodal emotion recognizer. Specifically, we introduce a customized ConvNeXt-Attention fusion model (CNXAF) to fuse diverse physiological signals, generating fused multimodal data. The multimodal data generator employs a conditional Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Network (c-SAGAN) to synthesize additional data across different categories, augmenting original datasets. Finally, the multimodal emotion recognizer utilizes the ConvNeXt-t classifier for emotion recognition on the extended dataset. Through extensive experimentation, our model achieves accuracies of 96.06% on the DEAP dataset and 95.70% on the WESAD dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in accurately recognizing emotions. Experimental results underscore the superior performance of our method compared to existing approaches in multimodal emotion recognition research.

ContentDM defines the layout diffusion process through random perturbations applied to both the position and type of layout elements. During the denoising training phase, the content-aware layout generator is trained to reconstruct samples from these perturbed layouts. This process enables the model to learn the correct arrangement patterns within the layout elements, thereby enhancing the rationality of generated layouts. Moreover, we develop an iterative layout inference strategy to enable the layout generator to refine the generated layouts progressively, thereby enhancing the overall quality of the generation results.

With the introduction of ChatGPT in November 2022 by OpenAI, people can now ask a bot to generate comprehensive writeups in seconds. This new transformative technology also introduces ethical, safety, and other general concerns. It is important to harness the power of AI to understand whether a body of text is generated by AI or whether it is organically human. In this paper, we create and curate a medium-sized dataset of 10,000 records containing both human and machine-generated text and utilize it to train a reliable model to accurately distinguish between the two. First, we use DistilGPT-2 with various inputs to generate machine text. Then, we acquire an equal sample size of human-generated text. All the text is cleaned, explored, and visualized using the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) dimensionality reduction technique. Finally, the text is transformed into vectors using several techniques, including BoW, TF-IDF, BERT, and neural network-based embeddings. Machine learning experiments are then performed with traditional models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, as well as deep learning models like LSTM, CNN, and CNN-LSTM. Across all vectorization strategies and machine learning algorithms, we measure accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores. We also time each exercise. Each model completes its training within an hour, and we observe scores above 90%. We then use the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) package on machine learning models to explore if and how we can explain the model to further validate results. Lastly, we deploy our TF-IDF Random Forest model to a user-friendly web application using the Streamlit framework, allowing users without coding expertise to interact with the model.},

As a result, clustering of shape data becomes increasingly important. However, few studies still perform applicable clustering in various cases because some studies rely on their specific shape representations. Thus, we apply a simple and widely recognized representation and generative model to shape. A configuration matrix of the point coordinates is used for the representation, and it is the simplest and most well-accepted representation in conventional shape analysis. As a generative model, we consider the mixture density function, a well-known model in statistics for expressing a population density function, which is a linear combination of subpopulation density functions. The aim of this paper is to present a mixture density-based model that will be useful for clustering shape data. The clustering of shapes involves estimating the parameters of the model, and this estimation is derived using an EM algorithm based on the model. As examples of promising shape-data applications, the computational analyses of ape skulls, American football formations, and baseball pitches were performed. In addition, we evaluated the performance of the EM algorithm by comparing it with other typical clustering methods. The theoretical results not only contribute to statistical estimation for shape data but also extend the clustering of non-vector shape data. The experimental results show that the derived EM algorithm performs well in shape clustering.},

Firstly, we design two spectral-based filters to fully mine the similarity and relevance information of items, thereby achieving effective discrimination between the two types of relationships.

The generalisability of Scene Graph Generation (SGG) methods is crucial for reliable reasoning and real-world applicability. However, imbalanced training datasets limit this, underrepresenting meaningful visual relationships. Current SGG methods using external knowledge sources face limitations due to these imbalances or restricted relationship coverage, impacting their reasoning and generalisation capabilities. We propose a novel neurosymbolic approach that integrates data-driven object detection with heterogeneous knowledge graph-based object refinement and zero-shot relationship retrieval, highlighting the loosely coupled synergy between neural and symbolic components. This combination addresses the limitations of imbalanced training datasets in scene graph generation and enables effective prediction of unseen visual relationships. Objects are detected using a region-based deep neural network and refined based on their positional and structural similarity, followed by retrieval of pairwise visual relationships using a heterogeneous knowledge graph. The redundant and irrelevant visual relationships are discarded based on the similarity of relationship labels and node embeddings. Finally, the visual relationships are interlinked to generate the scene graph. The employed heterogeneous knowledge graph combines diverse knowledge sources, offering rich common sense knowledge about objects and their interactions in the world. Our method, evaluated using the benchmark Visual Genome dataset and zero-shot recall (zR@K) metric, shows a 59.96% improvement over existing state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its effectiveness in generalised SGG. The object refinement step effectively improved the object detection performance by 57.1%. Additional evaluation using the GQA dataset confirms the cross-dataset generalisability of our method. We also compared various knowledge sources and embedding models to determine an optimal combination for zero-shot SGG. The source code is available at https://github.com/jaleedkhan/zsrr-sgg.},

This paper introduces LaBINet, a technique that leverages advanced deep learning methodologies to localize existing advertisements and utilizes image registration techniques for seamless integration of new ads. The process begins with generating a probabilistic map using AdSegNet to obtain transformed coordinates. Next, seamless integration is performed using the Poisson equation combined with Laplace matrices. To address the challenge of evaluating image quality in the absence of a reference image, we propose an evaluation method that correlates and statistically verifies subjective and objective scores. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques in integrating billboards under various lighting conditions, achieving strong subjective preference scores (76% to 95%) and low distortion scores (median values ranging from 21.817 to 22.529), indicating superior image quality.},

However, the inherent flexibility of FPGAs introduces significant security vulnerabilities, particularly in the hardware description languages (HDLs) used to program them. This paper introduces SecureLLAMA, an enhanced version of the LLAMA2 model, specifically designed to detect and mitigate FPGA vulnerabilities. Leveraging a novel dataset “FPGAvul” which includes both real-world examples and synthetically generated vulnerabilities. Our dataset FPGAvul addresses vulnerabilities such as initialization errors, clock domain crossing issues, insecure state machines, resource sharing conflicts, and buffer overflows. SecureLLAMA demonstrates superior accuracy in identifying and addressing security flaws in FPGA configurations. Comprehensive evaluation shows that SecureLLAMA significantly improves the detection of vulnerabilities, providing a robust solution for securing FPGAs in embedded systems. The findings of this research have the potential to advance FPGA security practices, ensuring their safe integration in critical environments where reliability is essential.},

  abstract     = {Neural network pruning is a popular and promising approach aiming at reducing heavy networks to lightweight ones by removing redundancies. Most existing methods adopt a three-stage pipeline, including pre-training, pruning, and fine-tuning. However, it is time-consuming to train a large and redundant network in the pre-training process. In this work, we propose a new minimal pre-training pruning method, GSFP (Gradient Similarity Frequency-based Pruning), which prunes a given network only using few-shot pre-training before training. Instead of pre-training a fully-trained over-parameterized model, our method only uses one epoch to obtain the ranked list of convolution filters to be pruned according to their gradient similarity frequency, and determines the redundant convolution filters that should be removed. Then the obtained sparse network is trained in the standard way without the need to fine-tune the inherited weights from the full model. Finally, a series of experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness on CIFAR10/100 and ImageNet. The results show that our method can achieve remarkable results on some popular networks, such as VGG, ResNet, and DenseNet. Importantly, the proposed pruning approach never requires pre-training the over-parameterized model, thus offering a promising prospect of application and spreading for limited computational resources.},

However, state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms perform suboptimally when confronted with limited data confined to specific regions within the state space. Performance degradation is attributed to the inability of offline RL algorithms to learn appropriate actions for rare or unseen observations. This paper proposes a heuristic rule-based regularization technique and adaptively refines the initial knowledge from heuristics to considerably boost performance in limited data with partially omitted states. The key insight is that the regularization term mitigates erroneous actions for sparse samples and unobserved states covered by domain knowledge. Empirical evaluations on standard offline RL datasets demonstrate a substantial average performance increase compared to ensemble of domain knowledge and existing offline RL algorithms operating on limited data.},

Generating artificial data and performing a transfer learning task is a common solution to overcome these limitations. Recently, deep generative models have become one of the leading solutions for modeling a given source domain. The main hindrance to using those machine learning approaches is the lack of interpretability. Therefore, we present a novel variational autoencoder approach to generate time series data on a probabilistic latent feature representation and enhance interpretability within the generative model and the output trajectory. We sample selective and parameter values for certain continuous function candidates to assemble the synthetic time series. The sparse design of the generative model enables direct interpretability and matches an estimated posterior distribution of the detected components in the source domain. Through residual stacking, conditionality, and a mixture of prior distributions, we derive a stacked version of the evidence lower bound to learn our network. Tests on synthetic and real industrial datasets underline the performance and interpretability of our generative model. Depending on the model and function candidates, the user can define a trade-off between flexibility and interpretability. Overall, this work presents an innovative interpretable representation of the latent space and further developed evidence lower bound criterion driven by the designed architecture.},

In recent years, preserving data privacy has gained significant attention due to increasing incidents of data abuse and data leakage, however, most existing methods do not consider the problem of protecting data privacy when calculating causal effects. Thus in this paper, we propose a FedECE (Federated Estimation of Causal Effect) framework for causal effect estimation in a federated setting using causal graphical modelling, which comprises two modules: a federated causal structure learning (FedCSL) module and a federated causal effect (FedCE) module. We first instantiate the FedECE framework with a basic FedECE algorithm, called FedECE-B. FedECE-B presents a layer-wise cooperative optimization strategy to learn a global skeleton by the consideration of preserving data privacy. In addition, a distributed optimal consensus strategy for V-structure identification is proposed to orient edges in the learned global skeleton. To tackle the CPDAG problem in the learned causal structure, FedECE-B presents a progressively integrated multiset strategy for federated causal effect computation. To further improve the computational efficiency and accuracy of FedECE-B, we also propose the FedECE-L and FedECE-O algorithms. The extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

Adaptive selection of suitable operators to the characteristics of different optimization stages is an important task that owns promising potential to improve the performance of a meta-heuristic algorithm. A variety of adaptive operator selection methods have been proposed in last decades, from the machine learning and optimization communities. However, the existing studies have not been systematically reviewed so far. To fill the gap, this paper provides a comprehensive survey of adaptive operator selection for meta-heuristics. According to the information required for selection, adaptive operator selection methods are classified into two categories: (i) stateless methods and (ii) state-based methods. Each category is further summarized into several key components. The strategies of each component belonging to the two categories are reviewed respectively. The motivation, strengths and weaknesses of the proposed strategies are also discussed. Furthermore, studied meta-heuristics and optimization problems in the literature are summarized. The effects from the difference of meta-heuristics and problems to the specific design of methods are discussed, together with the guidance of selecting the suitable method in different application scenarios.

In this work, we introduce a graph construction method that incorporates a new fairness definition—Edge Disparate Impact—into the edge relationships, aiming to produce a fair graph. This approach modifies the optimization process of automated graph construction to account for fairness, resulting in a more equitable graph. Extensive experiments were conducted to compare our method with the latest graph construction techniques and fair spectral clustering algorithms. The results prove that, by using a fair graph for spectral clustering, fairness is improved in the resulting clusters.

In order to do so, we first generate synthetic signal reception data of 15 modulation types, used for training and testing small variants of these models, chosen such that throughput is maximized and latency minimized, since we consider the context of a time-sensitive application. Given enough training compute, and in the single-component case, all convolutional models obtain an accuracy of 95% or more when signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is at least 0 dB, and one variant obtains 90% accuracy at -3 dB. In the dual-component case, convolutional models manage upwards of 95% when SNR is at least 12 dB, and more than 90% when SNR is at least 6 dB. Finally, we also measure their throughput and latency as a function of batch size (important parameters for applications such as radar and communication systems), with a convolutional model variant yielding the highest throughput at 14432 samples per second. Based on the obtained results, our work paves the way towards the classification of modern complex modulation schemes and provides selection rules for the most appropriate algorithm depending on the performance feature to be optimized (such as throughput and size).},

Traditional analytical models often struggle when capturing real-world complexities due to challenges in system nonlinearity representation and model parameter determination. Data-driven models, such as deep neural networks (DNNs), offer better accuracy and generalization but require large quantities of high-quality data. The present paper introduces a novel method called the Synthesized-Data Neural Network (SDNN), which integrates analytical models, which represent physics, with DNNs to enhance the dynamic model. The main steps of the present method are as follows: The first three degrees of freedom (DOF) of a Kinova Gen3 Lite manipulator are formulated using the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion. The experimental data are recorded from the manipulator. Simulated data from the analytical model are combined with experimental data to train the neural network. The model’s performance is evaluated using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) in real-time experiments with the Kinova Gen3 Lite manipulator. Training datasets represent 14 trajectories, with the MSE calculated for four testing trajectories. The obtained results have led to the following conclusions: The SDNN model has shown improved performance in predicting joint torques when compared to the purely analytical model or the purely data-driven model. The SDNN, when trained with Synthesized data from 14 trajectories (SDNN-14) achieved the lowest MSE of 2.14, outperforming the analytical model (MSE of 2.81) and the neural network trained solely on experimental data (MSE of 3.05).},

Conventional fine-grained FIR methods design complex attention modules to enhance attribute-aware feature discrimination. However, they often ignore the multi-view characteristics of real-world fashion data, leading to diminished model accuracy. Furthermore, our empirical analysis revealed that the straightforward application of standard contrastive learning methods to fine-grained FIR often yields suboptimal results. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel weak geometrical distortion-based contrastive learning (GeoDCL) strategy. Specifically, GeoDCL incorporates both a novel positive pair design and a novel contrastive loss. GeoDCL can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art (SOTA) fine-grained FIR methods during the training stage to enhance performance during inference. When GeoDCL is applied, the model structures of SOTA methods require no modifications. Additionally, GeoDCL is not utilized during inference, ensuring no increase in inference time. Experiments on the FashionAI, DeepFashion, and Zappos50K datasets verified GeoDCL’s effectiveness in consistently improving SOTA models. In particular, GeoDCL drastically improved ASENet_V2 from 60.76% to 66.48% in mAP on the FashionAI dataset.},

To this end, in this study, we evaluate the performance of ChatGPT/GPT-4 on a radiology natural language inference (NLI) task and compare it to other models fine-tuned specifically on task-related data samples. We also conduct a comprehensive investigation on ChatGPT/GPT-4&#39;s reasoning ability by introducing varying levels of inference difficulty. Our results show that 1) ChatGPT and GPT-4 outperform other LLMs in the radiology NLI task; 2) other specifically fine-tuned Bert-based models require significant amounts of data samples to achieve comparable performance to ChatGPT/GPT-4. These findings not only demonstrate the feasibility and promise of constructing a generic model capable of addressing various tasks across different domains, but also highlight several key factors crucial for developing a unified model, particularly in a medical context, paving the way for future artificial general intelligence (AGI) systems. We release our code and data to the research community$^\ddagger$.},

  abstract = {Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively learn a shared model without sharing their individual data. Concerns about utility, privacy, and training efficiency in FL have garnered significant research attention. Differential privacy has emerged as a prevalent technique in FL, safeguarding the privacy of individual user data while impacting utility and training efficiency. Within Differential Privacy Federated Learning (DPFL), previous studies have primarily focused on the utility-privacy trade-off, neglecting training efficiency, which is crucial for timely completion. Moreover, differential privacy achieves privacy by introducing controlled randomness (noise) on selected clients in each communication round. Previous work has mainly examined the impact of noise level (σ) and communication rounds (T) on the privacy-utility dynamic, overlooking other influential factors like the sample ratio (q, the proportion of selected clients). This paper systematically formulates an efficiency-constrained utility-privacy bi-objective optimization problem in DPFL, focusing on σ, T, and q. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis, yielding analytical solutions for the Pareto front. Extensive empirical experiments verify the validity and efficacy of our analysis, offering valuable guidance for low-cost parameter design in DPFL.},

In order to approximate the global optimum in modularity optimization, an improved nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithm is proposed as optimization strategy. In addition, by comprehensively utilizing motif-based (higher-order) and edge-based (lower-order) structural information, a neighbor community modification operation and a local search operation are also designed to improve the quality of individuals and promote the convergence of MOMCD. Experimental results show that MOMCD is promising and competitive in identifying motif-based communities from synthetic and real-life networks, which outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of quality and accuracy, and deepens our understanding of network structural and functional characteristics.},

  abstract = {Traffic flow forecasting task plays an essential role in intelligent transportation systems. Accurately capturing the intricate spatio-temporal dependencies in traffic network signals is the core of precise prediction. Recently, a paradigm that models spatio-temporal dependencies through graph neural networks and time series models has become one of the most promising methods to solve this problem. However, existing methods still have limitations due to ineffectively modeling dynamic spatial dependencies and high time and space complexity. To address these issues, we propose a simplifying and powerful general spatio-temporal traffic flow forecasting model called LightST. Specifically, LightST first embeds temporal covariates and spatial position information to enhance the spatio-temporal modeling capabilities. Then, stacked temporal linear layers are introduced to capture temporal dependencies efficiently. Finally,we propose a concise adaptive spatio-temporal embedding graph convolution method to extract implicit spatial dependencies over time via dynamic graph convolution with adaptive spatio-temporal embedding graph generation. Extensive experiment results on four public traffic flow datasets demonstrate the superiority of our LightST concerning computational efficiency and prediction performance.},

However, existing reasoning methods tend to suffer from poor interpretability which is not consistent with human commonsense. The trustworthiness and reliability of the knowledge discover outcomes thus decreased as a result. Inspired by the process of human decision-making, we propose a commonsense-aware hierarchical framework called HDLH, which incorporates commonsense knowledge into hierarchical knowledge graph reasoning process with deep reinforcement learning. HDLH implements hierarchical reasoning process through exploration and exploitation sequentially by applying multi-agent reinforcement learning. Multiple agents in HDLH simulate the multi-level decision-making ability of humans, and reason hierarchically and reasonably to maintain its efficiency and interpretability. Moreover, commonsense knowledge is incorporated by means of the reward-shaping function, ultimately guiding the agent to reason more consistently with human perceptions and reduce the huge search space. We evaluated HDLH with various tasks on five real-world datasets. The experimental results reveal that HDLH achieves better performance compared with state-of-the-art baseline models.},

  abstract     = {Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) has rapidly evolved in response to the emergence of quantum computers, with the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) selecting four finalist algorithms for PQC standardization in 2022, including the Falcon digital signature scheme. Hawk is currently the only lattice-based candidate in NIST Round 2 additional signatures. Falcon and Hawk are based on the NTRU lattice, offering compact signatures, fast generation, and verification suitable for deployment on resource-constrained Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. Despite the popularity of ML-DSA and ML-KEM, research on NTRU-based schemes has been limited due to their complex algorithms and operations. Falcon and Hawk’s performance remains constrained by the lack of parallel execution in crucial operations like the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), with data dependency being a significant bottleneck. This paper enhances NTRU-based schemes Falcon and Hawk through hardware/software codesign on a customized Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data (SIMD) processor, proposing new SIMD hardware units and instructions to expedite these schemes along with software optimizations to boost performance. Our NTT optimization includes a novel layer merging technique for SIMD architecture to reduce memory accesses, and the use of modular algorithms (Signed Montgomery and Improved Plantard) targets various modulus data widths to enhance performance. We explore applying layer merging to accelerate fixed-point FFT at the SIMD instruction level and devise a dual-issue parser to streamline assembly code organization to maximize dual-issue utilization. A System-on-chip (SoC) architecture is devised to improve the practical application of the processor in real-world scenarios. Evaluation on 28 nm technology and FPGA platform shows that our design and optimizations can increase the performance of Hawk signature generation and verification by over 7×.},

Most existing SMR protocols are leader-based requiring a leader to order requests and coordinate the protocol. This design places a disproportionately high load on the leader, inevitably impairing the scalability. If the leader fails, a complex and bug-prone fail-over protocol is needed to switch to a new leader. An adversary can also exploit the fail-over protocol to slow down the protocol. In this paper, we propose a crash-fault tolerant SMR named Aurora, with the following properties: •Leaderless: it does not require a leader, hence completely get rid of the fail-over protocol. •Scalable: it can scale up to 11 replicas. •Robust: it behaves well even under a poor network connection. We provide a full-fledged implementation of Aurora and systematically evaluate its performance. Our benchmark results show that Aurora achieves a throughput of around two million Transactions Per Second (TPS), up to 8.7× higher than the state-of-the-art leaderless SMR.},

  abstract     = {Physical phenomena such as bond breaking and phase transitions require molecular dynamics (MD) with ab initio accuracy, involving up to billions of atoms and over nanosecond timescales. Previous state-of-the-art work has demonstrated that neural network molecular dynamics (NNMD) like deep potential molecular dynamics (DeePMD), can successfully extend the temporal and spatial scales of MD with ab initio accuracy on both ARM and GPU platforms. However, the DeePMD-kit package is currently unable to fully exploit the computational potential of the new Sunway supercomputer due to its unique many-core architecture, memory hierarchy, and low precision capability. In this paper, we re-design the DeePMD-kit to harness the massive computing power of the new Sunway, enabling the MD with over ten billion atoms. We first design a large-scale parallelization scheme to exploit the massive parallelism of the new Sunway. Then we devise specialized optimizations for the time-consuming operators. Finally, we design a novel mixed precision method for DeePMD-kit customized operators to leverage the low precision computing power of the new Sunway. The optimized DeePMD-kit achieves 67.6 / 56.5 × speedup for water / copper systems on the new Sunway. Meanwhile, it can perform 29 billion atoms simulation for the water system on 35 million cores (i.e., 90,000 computing nodes, around 84% of the whole supercomputer) with a peak performance of 57.1 PFLOPs, which is 7.9× bigger and 1.2× faster than state-of-the-art results.

To overcome the issue, we propose an orthogonal gradient learning (OGL) guided supernet training paradigm, where the novelty lies in the fact that the weights of the overlapped structures of current architecture are updated in the orthogonal direction to the gradient space of these overlapped structures of all previously trained architectures. Moreover, a new approach of calculating the projection is designed to effectively find the base vectors of the gradient space to acquire the orthogonal direction. We have theoretically and experimentally proved the effectiveness of the proposed paradigm in overcoming the multi-model forgetting. Besides, we apply the proposed paradigm to two one-shot NAS baselines, and experimental results demonstrate that our approach is able to mitigate the multi-model forgetting and enhance the predictive ability of the supernet with remarkable efficiency on popular test datasets.},

  abstract     = {Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have set a new standard in computer vision (CV), showing unparalleled image processing performance. However, their substantial computational requirements hinder practical deployment, especially on resource-limited devices common in CV applications. Token merging has emerged as a solution, condensing tokens with similar features to cut computational and memory demands. Yet, existing applications on ViTs often miss the mark in token compression, with rigid merging strategies and a lack of in-depth analysis of ViT merging characteristics. To overcome these issues, this paper introduces Adaptive Token Merging (AToM), a comprehensive algorithm-architecture co-design for accelerating ViTs. The AToM algorithm employs an image-adaptive, fine-grained merging strategy, significantly boosting computational efficiency. We also optimize the merging and unmerging processes to minimize overhead, employing techniques like First-Come-First-Merge mapping and Linear Distance Calculation. On the hardware side, the AToM architecture is tailor-made to exploit the AToM algorithm’s benefits, with specialized engines for efficient merge and unmerge operations. Our pipeline architecture ensures end-to-end ViT processing, minimizing latency and memory overhead from the AToM algorithm. Across various hardware platforms including CPU, EdgeGPU, and GPU, AToM achieves average end-to-end speedups of 10.9×, 7.7×, and 5.4×, alongside energy savings of 24.9×, 1.8×, and 16.7×.

Therefore, we propose a blockchain-based integrity audit scheme supporting data deduplication. It protects file tag privacy during deduplication of ciphertexts and authentication tags, safeguards audit proof privacy, and effectively protects user file ownership privacy. To reduce key management costs, we introduce identity-based broadcast encryption (IBBE) that does not require interaction with key servers, eliminating additional communication costs.

In this paper, we propose Trident, a low-rate DoS attack mitigation scheme based on port and traffic state in SDN. Specifically, we design a multi-step strategy to monitor switch states. First, Trident identifies switches suspected of suffering from low-rate DoS attacks through port state detection. Then, it monitors the traffic state of switches with abnormal port states. Once a switch is identified as suffering from an attack, Trident analyzes the flow information to pinpoint the malicious flow. Finally, Trident issues rules to the switch’s flow table to block the malicious flow, effectively mitigating the attack. We prototype Trident on the Mininet platform and conduct experiments using a real-world topology to evaluate its performance. The experiments show that Trident can accurately and robustly detect low-rate DoS attacks, respond quickly to mitigate them, and maintain low overhead.},

To address these challenges, we propose a Knowledge-Defined Networking (KDN)-based Adaptive Edge Resource Allocation Optimization (KARO) architecture, facilitating real-time data collection and analysis of environmental conditions. Additionally, we implement an environmental resource change perception module in the KARO to assess current and future resource utilization trends.

This algorithm adapts to the environmental resource urgency, autonomously balancing UE satisfaction and task execution cost.

We present a hyperdimensional computing (HDC)-based graph ML framework called RelHDx that aggregates node features and graph structure, along with representing node and edge information in high-dimensional space. RelHDx enables single-pass training and inference with simple arithmetic operations, resulting in the efficient design of graph-based ML tasks: node classification and link prediction. We accelerate RelHDx using scalable processing in-memory (PIM) architecture based on emerging ferroelectric FET (FeFET) technology. Our accelerator uses a data allocation optimization and operation scheduler to address the irregularity of the graph and maximize the performance. Evaluation results show that RelHDx offers comparable accuracy to popular GNN-based algorithms while achieving up to 63.8× faster speed on GPU.

  abstract     = {Permissioned blockchains play a significant role in various application scenarios. Applications built on heterogeneous permissioned blockchains need to migrate data from one chain to another, aiming to keep their competitiveness and security. Thus, data migration across heterogeneous chains is a building block of permissioned blockchains. However, existing data migration protocols across heterogeneous chains are rarely used in practice since data migration technologies are insecure. To this end, we propose a data migration protocol across permissioned blockchains, named DataFly. We design a peg consensus mechanism, which provides consistent data-migration functionality between any two permissioned blockchains. To preserve the confidentiality of data, we invoke two classical cryptographic methods, i.e., i) ECDSA feature and ii) the integrated signature and public key encryption scheme. Through combining those two methods, data can be securely migrated from one permissioned blockchain to another without exposing the migrated data to anyone except associated parties. To demonstrate the practicality of DataFly, we implement a prototype of DataFly using existing popular permissioned blockchains, i.e., Hyperledger Fabric and private enterprise Ethereum. Measurement results demonstrate that DataFly outperforms related works in terms of transaction latency and gas costs.},

This paper proposes a comprehensive open-source benchmark suite, ETBench, to allow power-efficiency, performance and accuracy assessment for state-of-the-art (SOTA) hybrid models across 11 most widely-used DL engines deployed on diverse edge devices. After building ETBench that satisfies 6 design requirements proposed in our work, we conduct extensive experiments on 14 devices including 19 CPUs, 11 GPUs and 5 NPUs, and obtain benchmark results from all deployment scenarios (combinations of models, quantization formats, software engines, and hardware platforms). Valuable observations and insightful implications are finally summarized. For example, within current DL engines, the INT8 quantization is significantly underperformed in terms of accuracy and speed against FP16 for hybrid models. Overall, ETBench serves as a collaborative platform that assists model architects in better evaluating their models and makes it possible for future co-optimizations of DL engines and hardware accelerators.},

The untrustworthiness of these providers may lead to privacy breaches, compromising the overall security of such DApp environments. To address this challenge, we model the interaction data in the DApp environments as dynamic graphs and propose a dynamic graph publication method named HMG (Hidden Markov Model for Dynamic Graphs). HMG estimates the interaction probabilities between users by extracting the temporal information from historically collected data and constructs an optimized model to generate synthetic graphs. The synthetic graphs can preserve the dynamic topological characteristics of the interaction processes within DApp environments while effectively protecting user privacy, thus assisting external service providers in performing effective analyses. Finally, we evaluate the performance of HMG using real-world datasets and benchmark it against commonly used graph metrics. The results demonstrate that the synthetic graphs preserve essential features, making them suitable for analysis by service providers.},

Hence an automated, powerful, and scalable debugging approach is needed. Therefore, this paper proposes a scalable approach for localizing multiple bugs in Register-Transfer level (RTL) designs by using neural networks. The main idea is that hit-statements which are covered by failed test-vectors are more suspicious than those covered by passed test-vectors. We use coverage data as samples of our data set, label these samples, and tune the neural network model. Then we encode hit-statements and give them to the tuned model as new samples. The model classifies hit-statements. Hit-statements that take the failed labels, labels related to the failed test-vectors, are more suspicious of containing bugs. The results demonstrate that the proposed methodology outperforms recent approaches Tarsel and CirFix by localizing 80% of bugs at Top-1. The results also imply that our methodology increases the F1-score metric by 1.13× in comparison with existing RTL debugging techniques, which are prediction-based.},

Although their outputs are accurate within 1 ulp (unit in the last place) in fixed-point format, they are far from meeting the accuracy requirement of 1 ulp in floating-point format when the output is close to 0. However, normalized floating-point output that is accurate to within 1-3 ulp is needed in many math libraries (for example, OpenCL, NVIDIA CUDA, and AMD AOCL). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to propose a hardware implementation of binary logarithmic computation for floating-point numbers with a normalized output that is accurate to within 1 ulp. Instead of calculating log2(1 + fi) (where fi is the fractional part of the floating-point number) directly, the proposed methodology uses two novel objective functions for the polynomial approximation method. The novel objective functions make the significant bits of the outputs move forward to eliminate the necessity for high precision near zero. Compared with the designs of fixed-point binary logarithmic converters, the proposed hardware implementation achieves greater accuracy to meet the requirement of 1 ulp of floating-point format with a 21% extra area consumption.},

Hashed Page Tables (HPTs) have gained attention for ideally facilitating a single memory access per translation. However, current HPTs increase minor page fault latency, thereby impeding its superiority over conventional multi-level page table design. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of HPTs regarding minor page fault latency concerning memory management subsystems. In particular, we demonstrate how feasibility issues in memory management with HPTs can escalate minor page fault latency. We observe that different page types in HPTs (anon pages and page caches) exhibit distinct behaviors on the occurrence of minor page faults, indicating a significant correlation between page types and minor page faults. To address these challenges, we propose HashScape, a scheme that harmonizes with memory management using tailored HPTs per segment and size-tailored allocation via Virtual Memory Areas. Our evaluation demonstrates that HashScape significantly improves the insertion latency, with average, 95th, and 99th percentiles improving by 1.8×, 1.9×, and 2.2×, respectively, resulting in an overall 10% reduction in minor page fault latency compared to a state-of-the-art HPT design.},

During compilation, numerous auxiliary quantum gates are inserted, but a circuit with too many is unreliable, necessitating gate minimization. This requirement gives rise to the qubit mapping problem (QMP), an NP-hard optimization problem that is critical in quantum computing. This work proposes a novel and effective local search algorithm dubbed EffectiveQM. First, EffectiveQM proposes a new mode-aware search strategy to alleviate the challenge of being trapped in local optima, where local search typically suffers. Moreover, EffectiveQM introduces a novel potential-guided scoring function, which can thoroughly quantify the actual benefit brought by an operation of inserting auxiliary gates. By incorporating the potential-guided scoring function, EffectiveQM can effectively determine the appropriate operation to be performed. Extensive experiments on a diverse collection of logical circuits and 6 NISQ devices demonstrate that EffectiveQM can generate physical circuits with significantly fewer inserted auxiliary gates than current state-of-the-art QMP algorithms, indicating that EffectiveQM greatly advances the state of the art in QMP solving.},

In centralized solutions, a single blockchain node possessing the trapdoor conducts redaction operations. However, they suffer from the issue of single point of failure. In decentralized solutions, redaction operations are performed by numerous blockchain nodes cooperatively. But there also exists the issue of inefficiency or requiring a trusted party in these solutions. Subsequently, Jia et al. proposed a redactable blockchain solution from a decentralized chameleon hash function (DCH) they designed, which supports the threshold redaction, traceability and consistency check. Nevertheless, after carefully analyzing their solution, we find that it fails to achieve the security they claimed by presenting a concrete attack. To resolve this security issue, we propose a novel chameleon hash function scheme that achieves strong collision-resistant security while maintaining simple and efficient as the building block. Based on it, we then present an improved DCH scheme with sufficient security, so that the redactable blockchain from it can resist the presented attack. Theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that improved DCH achieves efficiency comparable to DCH.},

In this paper, we present a novel path-based method to tackle the fault diagnosis problems in various networks according to the PMC and MM models. Firstly, we introduce the algorithm for partitioning the path into subpaths based on these models. To ensure that at least one subpath is diagnosed as fault-free, we derive the relationship between the fault bound T and the path length N.

As a lightweight alternative to deep neural networks, HDC offers smaller model sizes, reduced computation, and memory-centric processing. However, deploying HDC in safety-critical applications, such as healthcare and robotics, is challenged by hardware-induced errors. This paper investigates HDC’s robustness to memory errors via extensive bit-flip injection experiments on item and associative memories. Results reveal that certain bit-flips severely degrade accuracy. To address this, we introduce the Hyperdimensional Bit-Flip Search (HD-BFS), a similarity-guided method for identifying vulnerabilities and crafting efficient attacks, where flipping just 6 critical bits—3.9% of random bit-flips—reduces accuracy to chance levels. We further propose Hyperdimensional Accelerated Bit-Flip Search (HD-ABFS), which narrows the search space by targeting critical dimensions and most significant bits (MSBs), achieving up to 282× speedup over HD-BFS. Finally, we develop an effective protection mechanism to enhance model safety. These insights highlight HDC’s resilience to random errors, offer robust defenses against targeted attacks, and advance the security and reliability of HDC systems.},

For optimizing the first stage, we leverage the parallel random access feature of multi-bank SRAM to eliminate overheads caused by memory divergences and use the Aggregate Table (AT) to reduce bank conflicts. For optimizing the second stage, we convert control divergences into memory divergences and utilize the Accumulate ScratchPad Memory (AccSPM) for executing reduction operations while eliminating overheads caused by memory divergences.

  abstract     = {Sparse Matrix-Vector multiplication (SpMV) is a widely used kernel in scientific or engineering applications and it is commonly implemented in FPGAs for acceleration. Existing works on FPGA usually pre-process the sparse matrix for data compression from the software perspective, and then design a unified architecture from the hardware perspective. However, as different SpMV kernels expose different levels of data parallelism after software processing, a unified architecture may not efficiently tap the underlying parallelism exposed in a specific kernel, leading to poor bandwidth utilization (BU) or poor resource utilization. To this end, this paper proposes an agile software and hardware co-design framework, CoSpMV, that employs design space exploration on both software and hardware for a specific kernel. Specifically, by providing a scalable compressed data format and a highly pipelined hardware template, CoSpMV can select the most suitable software and hardware configurations for different kernels and generate the accelerator instantly. The experimental results show that CoSpMV can achieve 3.91× speedup on GFLOPs, and 1.31× speedup on BU compared to the state-of-the-art work.},

  abstract     = {Federated Learning (FL) is typically deployed in a client-server architecture, which makes the Edge-Cloud architecture an ideal backbone for FL. A significant challenge in this setup arises from the diverse data feature distributions across different edge locations (i.e., non-IID data). In response, Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) approaches have been developed. Network segmentation-based PFL is an important approach to achieving PFL, in which the training network is divided into a global segment for server aggregation and a local segment maintained client-side. Existing methods determine the segmentation before the training, and the segmentation remains fixed throughout the PFL training. However, our investigation reveals that model representations vary as PFL progresses and the fixed segmentation may not deliver best performance across various training settings. To address this, we propose PFed-NS, a PFL framework based on adaptive network segmentation. This adaptive segmentation technique is composed of two elements: a mechanism for assessing divergence of clients’ probability density functions constructed from network layers’ outputs, and a model for dynamically establishing divergence thresholds, beyond which server aggregation is deemed detrimental. Further optimization strategies are proposed to reduce the computation and communication costs incurred by divergence modeling. Moreover, we propose a divergence-based BN strategy to optimize BN performance for network segmentation-based PFL. Extensive experiments have been conducted to compare PFed-NS against recent PFL models. The results demonstrate its superiority in enhancing model accuracy and accelerating convergence.},

  abstract     = {Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as an effective paradigm allowing multiple parties to collaboratively train a global model while protecting their private data. However, it is observed that the performance of FL approaches tends to degrade significantly when data are sparsely distributed across clients with small datasets. This is referred to as the sparse-and-scarce challenge, where data held by each client is both sparse (does not contain examples to all classes) and scarce (small dataset). Sparse-and-scarce data diminishes the generalizability of clients’ data, leading to intensive over-fitting and massive domain shifts in the local models and, ultimately, decreasing the aggregated model’s performance. Interestingly, while this scenario is a specific manifestation of the well-known non-IID11This refers to the generic situation where local data distributions are not identical and independently distributed challenge in FL, it has not been distinctly addressed. Our empirical investigation highlights that generic approaches to the non-IID challenge often prove inadequate in mitigating the sparse-and-scarce issue. To bridge this gap, we develop SAFA, a novel FL algorithm that specifically addresses the sparse-and-scarce challenge via a novel continual model iteration procedure. SAFA maximally exposes local models to the inter-client diversity of data with minimal effects of catastrophic forgetting. Our experiments show that SAFA outperforms existing FL solutions, up to 17.86%, compared to the prominent baseline. The code is accessible via https://github.com/HungNguyen20/SAFA.},

  abstract     = {Public key authenticated encryption with keyword search (PAEKS) has been widely studied in cloud storage systems, which allows the cloud server to search encrypted data while safeguarding against insider keyword guessing attacks (IKGAs). Most PAEKS schemes are based on the discrete logarithm (DL) hardness. However, this assumption becomes insecure when it comes to quantum attacks. To address this concern, there have been studies on post-quantum PAEKS based on lattice. But to our best knowledge, current lattice-based PAEKS exhibit limited applicability and security, such as only supporting single user scenarios, or encountering secret key leakage problem. In this paper, we propose FS-MUAEKS, the forward-secure multi-user authenticated searchable encryption, mitigating the secret key exposure problem and further supporting multi-user scenarios in a quantum setting. Additionally, we formalize the security models of FS-MUAEKS and prove its security in the random oracle model (ROM). Ultimately, the comprehensive performance evaluation indicates that our scheme is computationally efficient and surpasses other state-of-the-art PAEKS schemes. The ciphertext generation overhead of our scheme is only 0.27 times of others in the best case. The communication overhead of our FS-MUAEKS algorithm is constant at 1.75MB under different security parameter settings.},

Due to the limitation of computation and storage capacity, IIoT devices choose to outsource the collected data to remote cloud servers. Unfortunately, the cloud storage service is not as reliable as it claims, whilst the loss of physical control over the cloud data makes it a significant challenge in ensuring the integrity of the data. Existing schemes are designed to check the data integrity in the cloud. However, it is still an open problem since IIoT devices have to devote lots of computation resources in existing schemes, which are especially not friendly to resource-constrained IIoT devices. In this paper, we propose an efficient storage verification approach for cloud-assisted industrial IoT platform by adopting a homomorphic hash function combined with polynomial commitment. The proposed approach can efficiently generate verification tags and verify the integrity of data in the industrial cloud platform for IIoT devices. Moreover, the proposed scheme can be extended to support privacy-enhanced verification and dynamic updates. We prove the security of the proposed approach under the random oracle model.

This paper introduces an innovative two-layer game framework that captures independent self-interested competition among MDs and ESs, providing a more accurate reflection of multi-vendor environments. Additionally, the framework explores the influence of cloud-edge collaboration on ES competition, offering new insights into these dynamics. The proposed model extends previous research by developing algorithms that optimize task offloading and resource allocation strategies for both MDs and ESs, ensuring the convergence to Nash equilibrium in both layers.

  abstract     = {We consider a Network Operator (NO) that owns Edge Computing (EC) resources, virtualizes them and lets third party Service Providers (SPs) run their services, using the allocated slice of resources. We focus on one specific resource, i.e., cache space, and on the problem of how to allocate it among several SPs in order to minimize the backhaul traffic. Due to confidentiality guarantees, the NO cannot observe the nature of the traffic of SPs, which is encrypted. Allocation decisions are thus challenging, since they must be taken solely based on observed monitoring information. Another challenge is that not all the traffic is cacheable. We propose a data-driven cache allocation strategy, based on Reinforcement Learning (RL). Unlike most RL applications, in which the decision policy is learned offline on a simulator, we assume no previous knowledge is available to build such a simulator. We thus apply RL in an online fashion, i.e., the model and the policy are learned by directly perturbing and monitoring the actual system. Since perturbations generate spurious traffic, we thus need to limit perturbations. This requires learning to be extremely efficient. To this aim, we devise a strategy that learns an approximation of the cost function, while interacting with the system. We then use such an approximation in a Model-Based RL (MB-RL) to speed up convergence. We prove analytically that our strategy brings cache allocation boundedly close to the optimum and stably remains in such an allocation. We show in simulations that such convergence is obtained within few minutes. We also study its fairness, its sensitivity to several scenario characteristics and compare it with a method from the state-of-the-art.},

  abstract     = {Stream processing is integral to edge computing due to its low-latency attributes. Nevertheless, variability in user group sizes and disparate computing capabilities of edge devices necessitate frequent operator migrations within the stream. Moreover, intricate dependencies among stream operators often obscure the detection of potential bottleneck operators until an identified bottleneck is migrated in the stream. To address this, we propose a Cost-Aware Operator Migration (CAOM) scheme. The CAOM scheme incorporates a bottleneck operator detection mechanism that directly identifies all bottleneck operators based on task running metrics. This approach avoids multiple consecutive operator migrations in complex tasks, reducing the number of task interruptions caused by operator migration. Moreover, CAOM takes into account the temporal variance in operator migration costs. By factoring in the fluctuating data generation rate from data sources at different time intervals, CAOM selects the optimal start time for operator migration to minimize the amount of accumulated data during task interruptions. Finally, we implemented CAOM on Apache Flink and evaluated its performance using the WordCount and Nexmark applications. Our experiments show that CAOM effectively reduces the number of necessary operator migrations in tasks with complex topologies and decreases the latency overhead associated with operator migration compared to state-of-the-art schemes.},

In reality, clients near each other often tend to have similar data distributions. In this work, we train the personalized edge-based model in the client-edge-server FL. While considering the differences in data distribution, we fully utilize the limited bandwidth resources. To make training efficient and accurate at the same time, An intuitive idea is to learn as much useful knowledge as possible from other edges and reduce the accuracy loss incurred by non-IID data. Therefore, we devise Grouping Hierarchical Personalized Federated Learning (GHPFL).

  abstract     = {The development of cloud computing needs to continuously improve and perfect the privacy-preserving techniques for the user&#39;s confidential data. Multi-user join query, as an important method of data sharing, allows multiple legitimate data users to perform join query over the data owner&#39;s encrypted database. However, some existing join query protocols may face some challenges in the practical application, such as practicality, security, and efficiency. In this paper, we put forward a dynamic and secure join query protocol in the multi-user environment. Compared with some existing protocols, the proposed protocol has the following advantages. On the one hand, we utilize the dynamic oblivious cross tags structure to realize an efficient join query with forward and backward security. On the other hand, we combine the randomizable distributed key-homomorphic pseudo-random functions with join query to support multiple data users, which can provide resilience against the single user&#39;s key leakage and resist collusion attacks between the cloud server and a subset of data users. We formally define and prove the security of proposed protocol. In addition, we give a detailed analysis of computation and communication overheads to demonstrate the efficiency of proposed protocol. Finally, we carry out some experimental evaluations to further demonstrate the superiority of functionality and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Cloud-of-clouds storage systems are widely used in online applications, where user data are encrypted, encoded, and stored in multiple clouds. When some cloud nodes fail, the storage systems can reconstruct the lost data and store it in the substitute nodes. It is a challenge to reduce the latency of data recovery to ensure data reliability. In this paper, we adopt a Reinforcement Learning-based Data Recovery (RLDR) approach to reduce the regeneration time. By employing the Monte-Carlo method, our approach can construct the tree-topology-based regeneration process, a.k.a. regeneration tree, to effectively reduce the regeneration time. Through rigorous analysis, we apply the information flow graph to optimize the inter-cloud traffic for a given regeneration tree. To verify the merit of RLDR, We conduct extensive experiments on real-world traces. Experiments demonstrate that RLDR can significantly accelerate the regeneration process. Specifically, RLDR can reduce the regeneration time by up to 92% and increase the throughput by up to twelve-fold, compared to the prior art.},

  abstract     = {Driver drowsiness detection is a crucial technology for enhancing road safety and preventing accidents caused by fatigue. This paper proposes a method for analyzing electroencephalogram (EEG) signals during driving tasks to assess the driver’s mental state. Due to the nonstationary nature of EEG, the conventional Fourier spectrum is not well suited for spectral estimation of EEG. To address this, the study employs a multivariate iterative filtering (MIF) technique to decompose multichannel EEG signals into narrowband amplitude-frequency modulated components. The instantaneous amplitude and frequency are estimated using the discrete energy separation algorithm (DESA), and a joint time-frequency representation (JTFR) based on DESA is applied to estimate the spectral content of multichannel EEG. Mental states associated with drowsiness are identified using the joint marginal spectrum and an artificial neural network classifier. The proposed MIF-based framework was validated on two EEG datasets, achieving classification accuracies of 95.03±1.08% and 98.33±1.51%, respectively. These results demonstrate the potential of the method in preventing accidents caused by drowsy or distracted driving.},

  abstract     = {Motor imagery-based brain-computer interface (MI-BCI) technology establishes a connection between human intention and external devices in active rehabilitation. However, obtaining a mass of labeled EEG data is often difficult due to the strict requirement of experimental environment and the necessity for highly cooperative subjects, which makes the application of few-shot learning of EEG classification particularly important. Therefore, we propose a method that combines few-shot learning with triplet metric learning, aiming to maintain strong generalization capabilities of the model with limited samples. Firstly, we pretrain a base model using large auxiliary dataset, and then fine-tune it with a small number of labeled samples from the test subjects to obtain a specific model. During the training process, metric learning between anchor samples and positive/negative samples are employed to gradually converge similar samples, creating clearer class boundaries. Then the feature information of the samples is enhanced through an attention mechanism to obtain their essential features. The proposed framework was evaluated using two publicly available datasets and obtained classification accuracies of 68.29% and 84.40%, respectively, representing enhancements of 1.04% and 1.28% over existing state-of-the-art methods. In conclusion, experimental results indicate that our proposed approach can improve the effectiveness of MI-BCI rehabilitation training.},

Existing embodied learning methods primarily rely on Reinforcement Learning (RL) exploration policy to collect inaccurate perceptual result samples for improving perceptual capabilities. However, RL-based exploration policies encounter several challenges such as the need for substantial data for training and the struggle to keep the diversity of the collected samples. In this paper, we propose an embodied learning method that employs Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as task planners, code planners, and path planners. Specifically, our method employs layout knowledge of the VLMs to decompose the embodied learning task into multiple sub-tasks, and then convert each sub-task into executable code which will be executed to guide the agent to explore and collect the diverse samples in different types of rooms. Additionally, VLMs incorporate an external database to identify regions that enhance perceptual capabilities, and the agent will explore these poor perception regions to collect samples that can improve the perception performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach without the need for additional training.},

In this paper, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach to develop a viable strategy for underwater cooperative pursuit. Initially, considering the hydrodynamic model and motion characteristics of robotic fish, we construct a specific simulation environment with multiple fish-like agents, which provides a highly realistic state transition model. Next, we develop a MARL-based strategy learning framework that incorporates appropriate reward functions and agent actions for policy learning. Finally, a series of comprehensive simulations and practical experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and confirm its successful application in underwater pursuit scenarios.

Existing solutions often focus solely on extracting more effective state representations in the representation learning stage and overlook how to better utilize these state representations in the policy learning stage. To address this, a simple and sample-efficient visual reinforcement learning method based on multi-view optimization aggregation (MVOA-VRL) is proposed for pixel-based off-policy reinforcement learning frameworks. This method enables the agent to concurrently focus on learning and utilizing state representations. Specifically, MVOA-VRL acquires multiple views of samples through random crop and adaptive intensity adjustment. It then introduces optimization aggregation methods separately in the representation learning and reinforcement learning modules to aggregate the similarities, actions, and state values of multiple samples from different views. MVOA-VRL aims to promote the agent’s learning of effective representations and stable policies. Experimental results on continuous control tasks in the DMControl environment show that, compared with state-of-the-art methods, MVOA-VRL achieves higher scores and significantly improves sample efficiency.},

  abstract     = {In modern speech applications, achieving both low power consumption and noise robustness is critically essential. A well-designed Voice Activity Detection (VAD) front-end minimizes processing demands. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), a cutting-edge paradigm in brain-inspired computing, excel in energy efficiency due to their spike-based processing mechanisms. This makes them a promising solution for developing more efficient VAD models. In recent years, researchers have achieved notable advancements in applying SNNs to VAD, particularly in energy efficiency and performance. However, current SNN-based VAD models still struggle to achieve sufficient robustness and fail to fully exploit the low-power potential of SNNs. To address this challenge, we propose an energy-efficient and highly robust spike-based VAD model, called Spike-VAD. Spike-VAD leverages an energy-saving resonate-and-fire frequency (RF-FRE) spike encoding scheme, eliminating the need for computation-intensive Fourier Transform (FT) operations. Inspired by the human auditory frequency preference, a spike-based attention module is designed to refine the encoded spike features and enhance robustness. Furthermore, an Adaptive Memory Modulation Strategy (AMMS) is introduced to dynamically modulate historical information from the audio, facilitating more effective decision-making. Experiments on the QUT-NOISE-TIMIT dataset indicate that compared with previous SNN-based VAD models, our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both robustness and energy consumption.},

In this paper, to achieve higher precision trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance for dual-arm humanoid robots, the barrier offset varying-parameter dynamic learning neural (BOVDL) network method is proposed and applied to dual-arm humanoid behavior generation scheme. To do so, a dual-arms humanoid robot model is set up, and transformed into a constrained time-varying quadratic programming (TVQP) problem. Secondly, by using lagrangian multiplier method and Karush-Kuhn-Tuchker condition, the inequality constrained TVQP is converted as a time-varying equation with a barrier parameter. Thirdly, a varying-parameter dynamic learning network is presented to solve the time-varying equation with a barrier parameter. Computer simulation experiments are conducted to verify the feasibility, accuracy, and safety of the proposed BOVDL network method. Experimental results show that all 14 joints of the humanoid robot’s arms are within the motion range of each real human arm’s physical constraints. The maximum position error and velocity error between the desired trajectory and the actual trajectory of the end effector are less than 10–6m magnitude and 10–7m magnitude, respectively, representing a reduction of 5 orders of magnitude compared to the traditional varying-parameter convergent-differential neural network. Furthermore, the proposed method also enables the dual-arm humanoid robot to avoid collisions with obstacles while performing tasks, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed BOVDL network scheme.},

The PAM modifies the rate of the formation of the LAM, and the LAM, in turn, affects the strength of the PAM, which are two interactions in sequential associative memory, called transfer and retroaction. In addition, the magnitudes of transfer and retroaction are determined by the similarity of the conditioned stimuli.

  abstract     = {Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a precursor to dementia and poses significant health and economic challenges. Early detection of MCI can slow disease progression and ease the burden on patients and caregivers. This study aimed to explore sensory-perception deficits and fluctuations in MCI using auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) from a prefrontal two-channel EEG device. The study involved 573 MCI patients and 1,295 cognitively normal (CN) individuals, with cognitive decline assessed through the Seoul Neuropsychological Screening Battery (SNSB) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). This study analyzed ERPs and trial-to-trial variability using the response variance curve (RVC) in neural responses to eight auditory sounds. While no significant differences were observed in ERP amplitudes and area under the curves (AUCs) for sensory (N1) and perception (P2) processing between MCI and CN groups, MCI patients showed notable differences in trial-to-trial variability, particularly in those aged 70 to 79 years. This variability remained significant even after adjusting for factors like age, sex, years of education, and MMSE scores. The study suggests that MCI is associated with instability in pre-attentive auditory detection and higher-order perceptual processing. The findings highlight that people in their 70s may be in a transitional phase associating these sensory-perceptual variabilities with cognitive impairment. Given the large sample size and limitations of current neuropsychological tests, the study underscores the potential of sensory ERP measures as a supplementary tool for MCI screening.},

To address these challenges, we propose RoboGPT11For more details, please refer to our project page https://github.com/Cwb0106/RoboGPT., an embodied agent specifically designed to make long-term decisions for instruction following tasks. RoboGPT integrates three key modules: 1) RoboPlanner, an LLM-based planning module equipped with 67K embodied planning data, breaks down tasks into logical subgoals. We compile a new robotic dataset using a template feedback-based self-instruction method to fine-tune the Llama model. RoboPlanner with strong generalization can plan hundreds of instruction following tasks; 2) RoboSkill, customized for each subgoal to improve navigation and manipulation capabilities; 3) Re-Plan, a module that dynamically adjusts the subgoals based on real-time environmental feedback. By utilizing the precise semantic map generated by RoboSkill, the target objects can be replaced by calculating the similarity between subgoals and the objects present in the environment. Experimental results demonstrate that RoboGPT exceeds the performance of other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, particularly LLM-based methods, in terms of task planning rationality for hundreds of unseen daily tasks and even tasks from other domains.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we propose a multitask reinforcement learning algorithm for foundational policy acquisition to generate novel motor skills. Learning the rich representation of the multitask policy is a challenge in dynamic movement generation tasks because the policy needs to cope with changes in goals or environments with different reward functions or physical parameters. Inspired by human sensorimotor adaptation mechanisms, we developed the learning pipeline to construct the encoder-decoder networks and network selection to facilitate foundational policy acquisition under multiple situations. First, we compared the proposed method with previous multitask reinforcement learning methods in the standard multi-locomotion tasks. The results showed that the proposed approach outperformed the baseline methods. Then, we applied the proposed method to the ball heading task using a monopod robot model to evaluate skill generation performance. The results showed that the proposed method was able to adapt to novel target positions or inexperienced ball restitution coefficients but to acquire a foundational policy network, originally learned for heading motion, which can generate an entirely new overhead kicking skill.},

  abstract     = {Multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) holds potential for building general-purpose agents, enabling them to generalize across a variety of tasks. However, MTRL may still be susceptible to conflicts between tasks. A primary reason for this problem is that a universal policy struggles to balance short-term and dense learning signals across various tasks, e.g. , distinct reward functions in reinforcement learning. In social cognitive theory, internalized future goals, as a form of cognitive representations, can effectively mitigate potential short-term conflicts in multitask settings. Considering the benefits of future goals, we propose a novel and general framework called Task-Specific Action Correction (TSAC) from the goal perspective as an orthogonal research to previous MTRL methods. Specifically, to avoid myopia, TSAC introduces goal-oriented sparse rewards and decomposes policy learning into two separate policies: a shared policy (SP) and an action correction policy (ACP). The SP outputs a short-term perspective action based on guiding dense rewards. To alleviate conflicts resulting from excessive focus on specific tasks’ details in SP, the ACP incorporates goal-oriented sparse rewards, enabling an agent to adopt a long-term perspective to output a correction action and achieve generalization across tasks. Finally, the actions output by SP and ACP are combined based on the action correction function to form a final action that interact with the environment. Extensive experiments conducted on Meta-World and multi-task StarCraft II multi-agent scenarios demonstrate that TSAC outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant improvements in sample efficiency, generalization and effective action execution across tasks.},

We outline a multidimensional blueprint for a form of bio-inspired agent leveraging modern Neuroscience principles (including the co-localisation of memory and compute, plasticity, embodiment, active inference, and neurodevelopmental principles). We discuss how combining these core features could theoretically lead to cognitive agents that are aligned to our prosocial values, transparent, explainable, and energy efficient (i.e., “good” robots). In particular, we leverage Marr’s tri-level framework and advocate for an “Implementation Level” consisting of embodied neuromorphic hardware, an “Algorithmic Level” consisting of Active Inference, and a “Computational Level” consisting of prosocial goals (supported by evidence of prosociality catalysing the development of our own complex cognitive abilities). A developmental process scaffolds different prosocial computations over time. Supporting our perspective, we include simulation data demonstrating the transfer of priors between two different prosocial behaviours (Computational Level) via Active Inference (Algorithmic Level), supported by an embodied process (Implementation Level). Agent behaviour is transparent and explainable throughout. We advocate for this blueprint as a guide in creating capable, ethical, and sustainable machine intelligence.},

Although a model performs well with data specific to a certain subject or session, the fluctuations in EEG data can significantly impair the performance on a different subject or session. As a result, current approaches synchronize the original and new subject or session feature distributions. Directly matching EEG data across individuals or sessions may undermine the inherent distinguishability due to the heterogeneity in data distribution. Instead of direct alignment, this work utilizes multi-source structural deep clustering to identify the inherent structural knowledge of the target itself and regularize it through the distribution of source labels. Furthermore, the method was implemented on the intermediate output utilizing high-confidence features to improve pattern identification in the latent feature space. This led to more distinct differentiations across subdomains with varying labels. Comparative analyses were performed with state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on SEED and SEED-IV datasets. The model proposed outperformed other baseline models under the strict leave-one-subject-out strategy, reaching an average accuracy of 88.20%/90.06% in a cross-subject/cross-session experiment on SEED and 71.49%/69.96% in SEED-IV.

In this paper, we propose new models of multiplex network games to capture the different modalities of interactions among strategic agents, and multilayer network games to capture their interactions over multiple action dimensions. We explore how the properties of the constituent networks of a multiplex/multilayer network can undermine or support the existence, uniqueness, and stability of the game&#39;s Nash equilibria. Notably, we highlight that both the largest and smallest eigenvalues of the constituent networks (reflecting their connectivity and two-sidedness, respectively) are instrumental in determining the uniqueness of the multiplex/multilayer network game&#39;s equilibrium. Together, our findings shed light on the reasons for the fragility of equilibria when agents interact over networks of networks, and point out potential interventions to alleviate them.},

  abstract     = {Assuming agents possess sensing capabilities and dynamics relative to their body coordinate frames, this paper addresses a displacement-based strategy for discrete-time formation control through attitude synchronization. Unlike the Eulerian approximation, the first challenge lies in developing discrete-time models that capture both position and attitude motions, thereby complementing existing continuous-time systems with a discretized version. Then, two leader-following control protocols are designed, incorporating a jointly-connected topology to relax the connectivity requirements. The analysis of these systems often relies on the Lyapunov function, the existence of which may be hard to guarantee. Consequently, geometric properties of several polytopes are explored under the dynamic topologies and time-varying parameters. By extending the ergodicity results to leader-following scenarios, these properties are characterized as positively invariant sets. This invariance, which is independent of the existence of the Lyapunov function or the solvability of its associated criteria, provides a beneficial tool for analyzing time-variant systems. Utilizing this invariance and some mathematical techniques, the desired formation shape can be achieved in the cases where the attitudes of the followers synchronize with the leader. Finally, a numerical simulation validates the results.},

Recent literature shows that a specific more hierarchical network structure can effectively inhibit the propagation of line failures across the entire system. In particular, a novel approach named tree partitioning has been proposed, which seeks to bolster the robustness of power networks through strategic alterations in network topology, accomplished via targeted line switching actions. Several tree partitioning problem formulations have been proposed by considering different objectives, among which power flow disruption and network congestion. Furthermore, various heuristic methods based on a two-stage and recursive approach have been proposed. The present work provides a general framework for tree partitioning problems based on mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). In particular, we present a novel MILP formulation to optimally solve tree partitioning problems and also propose a two-stage heuristic based on MILP. We perform extensive numerical experiments to solve two tree partitioning problem variants, demonstrating the excellent performance of our solution methods. Lastly, through exhaustive cascading failure simulations, we compare the effectiveness of various tree partitioning strategies and show that, on average, they can achieve a substantial reduction in lost load compared to the original topologies.},

Attaining the optimal secure formation control policy located at the Nash equilibrium depends on solving the game-associated coupled Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation.

Second, since the attack modes are inaccessible, a controller is constructed based on the observation sequence by virtue of the emission probability to stabilize the system under random attacks. Due to the complexity of the network, the probability that an observer can accurately detect an attack when it occurs is considered unknown. Based on the introduced double-layer stochastic process, a mode-associated Lyapunov function is constructed to facilitate the stability analysis.

To address this problem, we propose a computationally efficient and robust algorithm which builds on a probabilistic technique for stochastic gradient computation, which we believe will be applicable to a wide range of problems in decentralized information processing, learning and control. Specifically, we show that the proposed method achieves an oracle complexity (computational complexity) of $O(1/\epsilon ^{2})$ for smooth and non-convex functions with stochastic gradients, which is known to be sharp for its respective function class, and is an improvement over the computational cost obtained in previous works. Additionally we retain the $O(1/\epsilon ^{3})$ rate for the communication cost, which is at par with the communication cost obtained in previous works. We also show how the proposed algorithm has robust performance in environments with unreliable computational resources. Finally, the theoretical findings are validated via numerical experiments.},

To achieve asymptotic estimation of states and faults, we propose a distributed state-fault observer that leverages the structural information of faults. Notably, this observer operates independently of the choice of control input, thus decoupling it from the controller design. Alongside estimates of states and faults, we develop a cooperative fault-tolerant controller to ensure that the constrained state difference remains within the prescribed range throughout the system&#39;s evolution, ultimately converging to the desired value. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach in the context of cooperative fault-tolerant cruise control for multiple high-speed trains, where we consider simultaneous constraints on train position and velocity.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate cooperative output regulation of heterogeneous linear multi-agent systems subject to an uncertain exosystem over directed communication networks. Compared with existing results, a fully distributed output-based adaptive observer is developed that eliminates the requirement for global information of communication networks and improves practical feasibility. By establishing a sequence of technical lemmas, it is demonstrated that the proposed distributed adaptive observer attains distributed exponential estimation of the unknown parameter and the state of the uncertain exosystem under directed communication networks. Leveraging the certainty equivalence principle, both the distributed state feedback control law and the distributed measurement output feedback control law are proposed to solve the problem. Moreover, two applications, active automotive suspension control under unknown road profiles and cooperative output regulation of multiple LCL coupled inverter-based distributed generation systems, are provided to verify the proposed approach.},

The players can only exchange information with their own direct neighbors. The transmitted information is subject to quantization and packet losses induced by malicious DoS attacks. We propose a quantized distributed NE seeking strategy based on the approach of dynamic quantized consensus. To solve the quantizer saturation problem caused by DoS attacks, the quantization mechanism is equipped to have zooming-in and holding capabilities, in which the holding capability is consistent with the results in quantized consensus under DoS. A sufficient condition on the number of quantizer levels is provided, under which the quantizers are free from saturation under DoS attacks. The proposed distributed quantized NE seeking strategy is shown to have the so-called maximum resilience to DoS attacks. Namely, if the bound characterizing the maximum resilience is violated, an attacker can deny all the transmissions and hence distributed NE seeking is impossible.},

In a centralized setting, variational inference is a fundamental tool to extend the utility of Bayesian estimation, by approximating a parametrized form of an intractable posterior density. Our key contribution is deriving the distributed evidence lower bound (DELBO) from the centralized estimation objective, whose separable structure enables distributed inference with one-hop sensor communication. The DELBO consists of observation likelihood and divergences to prior estimates, and the gap to the measurement evidence is ascribed to consensus and modeling errors. For supervised learning, we design a DELBO-maximizing online distributed algorithm, and specialize it to Gaussian variational densities with non-linear likelihoods. We extend the resulting distributed Gaussian variational inference (DGVI) updates via diagonalized and 1-rank covariance inversions for high-dimensional estimates and apply it to multi-robot probabilistic mapping using indoor LiDAR data.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates impulsive security protocols with the goal of achieving consensus of fractional-order fuzzy multi-agent systems (FOFMASs). In contrast to multi-agent systems characterized by ordinary differential equations, FOFMASs are created using T-S fuzzy rules and fractional-order differential equations, which allow for nonlinearities with parameter uncertainties and also manage memory effects. Due to the potential of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, the topology among nodes may change, and it is necessary to gain insight into the security consensus under topology switching. This paper tackles the security protocol problem by designing a distributed impulsive control for each agent, relying on global delayed communications and topology switching resulting from DoS attacks. Analyzing the stability of impulse-free error systems is a salient problem. Supported by the Lyapunov method and average impulsive interval method, for two cases of self-stabilization or instability of the error system in the absence of impulse, some sufficient conditions are presented to ensure the exponential consensus of FOFMASs under distributed impulsive control with communication delays. Besides, several corollaries are provided to guarantee the consensus under distributed impulsive control without communication delays. Finally, two numerical examples are provided, and some numerical simulations are given to confirm the efficacy of the theoretical findings.},

For a NET-SCS, the propagation of nonlinear statistics of the network communication status brought up by deterministic thresholds makes the precise computation of ACR difficult. Previous work used to over-simplify the computation using a Gaussian distribution without incorporating this nonlinearity, leading to sacrificed precision. This paper proposes a novel approach to calculate the exact ACR for a NET-SCS using a recursive model. We use theoretical analysis and a numerical study to qualitatively evaluate the deviation gap of the conventional approach that ignores the side information. The accuracy of our proposed method, alongside its comparison with the simplified results of the conventional approach, is validated by experimental studies.

This research proposes an IoT and cloud computing framework integrated with a distributed and resilient deep learning (DLRTO) model to optimize system utility and bandwidth allocation for local controller devices (LCDs). The DLRTO model is designed to generate near-optimal offloading decisions for LCDs, edge cloud servers, and central cloud servers, thus maximizing both system utility and bandwidth allocation. Additionally, we introduce the RL-NN integrated round robin-based dynamic task scheduling (RNRRDTS) algorithm on edge and cloud servers to address job scheduling issues, with a focus on renewable energy generation and job migration. Extensive simulations were conducted using real-world IoT application tasks, renewable energy data, and grid electricity pricing data to evaluate the proposed model. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the DLRTO model compared with existing methods.

In this study, we aim to gain insights into the possible mechanisms behind user participation in community sports activities and reveal the role of external incentives on individual engagement. We study the participation behavior of 2,956 members over a 6-year period in a community sports organization, and demonstrate that the participation frequency adheres to a power-law distribution. We then propose a mathematical model called habit formation and behavioral inertia (HFBI), and through experiments, we demonstrate that the data generated by the model shows a robust fit to the distribution of empirical data. We also analyze the effects of different types of activities, and find that periods of high activity participation often begin with rewarded activities, suggesting the importance of incentives to sustain long-term participation. Our study provides a scientific foundation for developing optimized strategies to enhance community sports participation. The HFBI model may also be used to understand data exhibiting power-law distributions beyond the domain of community sports.},

In China, a few logistics companies have plans but only one has initially built a platform for vehicle logistics. This platform has also attracted a considerable number of service providers to join, which has led to competition between service providers and the platform. To promote the platformization of the vehicle logistics industry and attract more customers to use platform-based services, how to leverage the incentive effect of subsidies is a topic of concern for the government. Motivated by the above, this article discusses whether the exogenous subsidies (provided to customers for platform service or providers service) can accelerate the process of the vehicle logistics industry. We explore the role of subsidies by developing a model (a hotelling line) that describes the differentiated competition between the platform and service providers. Our study found that subsidies do not always work as expected. The effectiveness of the subsidy depends on service advantages and customer preferences. Subsidies may even be counterproductive if customers prefer service providers or if platform services lack advantages. This is a reminder for both the government and industry that to accelerate the platformization of the vehicle logistics industry, it is necessary to combine reality and not blindly subsidize.},

By analyzing the maximum Influence of sentiment propagation, we can gain a better understanding of how network group events arise and evolve. Influence maximization (IM) is a critical fundamental issue in the field of informatics, whose purpose is to identify the collection of individuals and maximize the specific information’s influence in real-world social networks, and the sentiments expressed by nodes with the greatest influence can significantly impact the emotions of the entire group. The IM issue has been established to be an NP-hard (nondeterministic polynomial) challenge. Although some methods based on the greedy framework can achieve ideal results, they bring unacceptable computational overhead, while the performance of other methods is unsatisfactory. In this article, we explicate the IM problem and design a local influence evaluation function as the objective function of the IM to estimate the influence spread in the cascade diffusion models. We redefine particle parameters, update rules for IM problems, and introduce learning automata to realize multiple search modes. Then, we propose a multisearch particle Swarm optimization algorithm (MSPSO) to optimize the objective function. This algorithm incorporates a heuristic-based initialization strategy and a local search scheme to expedite MSPSO convergence. Experimental results on five real-world social network datasets consistently demonstrate MSPSO’s superior efficiency and performance compared with baseline algorithms.},

Sentiment in social media comments reflects users’ attitudes and impacts society, making sentiment analysis (SA) crucial. AI driven models, especially deep-learning models, have achieved excellent results in SA tasks. However, most existing models are not interpretable enough. First, deep learning models have numerous parameters, and their transparency is insufficient. People cannot easily understand how the models extract features from input data and make sentiment judgments. Second, most models lack intuitive explanations. They cannot clearly indicate which words or phrases are key for emotion prediction. Moreover, extracting sentiment factors from comments is challenging because a comment often contains multiple sentiment characteristics. To address these issues, we propose a dual-branch combination network (DCN) for SA of social media short comments, achieving both word-level and sentence-level interpretability. The network includes a key word feature extraction network (KWFEN) and a key word order feature extraction network (KWOFEN). KWFEN uses popular emotional words and SHAP for word-level interpretability. KWOFEN employs position embedding and an attention layer to visualize attention weights for sentence-level interpretability. We validated our method on the public dataset weibo2018 and TSATC. The results show that our method effectively extracts positive and negative sentiment factors, establishing a clear mapping between model inputs and outputs, demonstrating good interpretability performance.},

A well extended E-CARGO (EE-CARGO) model is proposed to modeling a social system with emergent properties. The system is abstracted into agent-role level, roles are modeled as a tree structure and role emergence is identified and analyzed at multiple scales. Then we derive that the masses are primary, and the individual agent is secondary to understanding the emergence forming. A case study is accomplished to verify the effectiveness of proposed approach (i.e., the reversed RBC process and EE-CARGO model). The results are revealed that the role emergence fits a cubic curve estimation by time and at a moderate scale, the role emergence happens easily. Role performances at a small scale affect super-role emergence at a large scale statistically, and vice versa.

Many advanced machine learning (ML) models with explanations are used for happiness online assessment while maintaining high accuracy of results. However, expert feedback and sociological theory may be absent from these models, which limits the association between prediction results and the right reasons for why they occurred. Sociological studies have shown that primary and secondary relations are inherent in happiness factors, which can be used as domain knowledge to guide model training. Inspired by such insights, this article attempts to provide new insights into the explanation consistency from an empirical study perspective. Then this article studies how to represent and introduce domain knowledge constraints to make ML models more trustworthy. We achieve this by 1) proving that multiple prediction models with additive factor attributions will have the desirable property of primary and secondary relations consistency; and 2) showing that factor relations with quantity can be represented as an importance distribution for encoding domain knowledge. Factor explanation difference is penalized by the Wasserstein distance among prediction models. Experimental results using two online datasets show that domain knowledge of stable factor relations exists. Using this knowledge not only improves happiness prediction accuracy but also reveals more significant happiness factors for assisting decisions.},

  abstract     = {Interval fuzzy preference relations (IFPRs) offer a concise and intuitive representation of the uncertain cognition of decision makers (DMs). Discussions on consistency and consensus are crucial in group decision-making with IFPRs. Consistency prevents self-contradictory judgments, while consensus restricts the disparities among DM assessments within a predetermined threshold. Both have a significant impact on decision quality. Hence, the Shapley consistency and consensus mechanism (SHAP-CCM), which endows the adjustment to DMs by considering their marginal contributions to the minimum total adjustments of all corresponding coalitions, is introduced. Under each DM’s Shapley consensus adjustment, personalized judgment adjustment strategies are considered due to DMs’ intrinsic characteristic differences. In rare scenarios where the Shapley value may fall below zero, this could result in other DMs bearing a greater adjustment. Thus, we propose the Nash-bargaining consensus adjustment based on max–min marginal contribution. This method effectively addresses the issue associated with SHAP-CCM, enhancing the reliability of the analysis. With these mechanisms, the corresponding group decision methods are given.

  abstract     = {Social fintech integrates financial technology with social networking to enhance financial services’ accessibility and personalization by leveraging social interactions and user data. This approach raises privacy security concerns, particularly in application based on centralized artificial intelligence systems. To address these issues, blockchain-enabled federated learning (BEFL) offers a decentralized solution, improving robustness and privacy but facing challenges such as privacy attacks and heterogeneous crypto system. In response, a novel PKI and identity-based heterogeneous authenticated asymmetric group key agreement (PKI-IB-HAAGKA) protocol was proposed, which resolves crypto system heterogeneity issues. What’s more, a PKI and identity-based heterogeneous batch multisignature (PKI-IB-HBMS) was proposed as a building block of PKI-IB-HAAGKA. This article presents the heterogeneous privacy-preserving blockchain-enabled federated learning (HPP-BEFL) system, designed to enhance privacy, security, and efficiency in social fintech applications. It effectively mitigates man-in-the-middle and inference attacks while improving overall system performance. Through security analysis and experiment results, it is demonstrated that the proposed PKI-IB-HAAGKA, PKI-IB-HBMS, and HPP-BEFL are provably secure and highly efficient, which can be applied to large-scale heterogeneous privacy-preserving model training scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Community detection in signed networks reveals mesoscale structures and sign characteristics, facilitating accurate and realistic understanding of real-life signed networks. Given the complexity of signed community structures and the NP-hard challenge of achieving optimal partitions, modularity optimization using memetic algorithms has emerged as a promising approach. However, the identified signed partitions still face challenges in modularity quality and precision, with many misassigned nodes or being stuck at local optima, particularly in ambiguous and complex structures. To address this issue, this article introduces a new concept: central-node signed motif, a higher order local topological feature that effectively identifies signed communities, providing richer and more efficient topological information. Furthermore, we utilize these central-node signed motifs to improve community detection through a framework named higher order local search assisted memetic modularity (HLSMM). In HLSMM, we design a central-node signed motif-based local search strategy to optimize node assignments and improve modularity quality and structural balance of optimized signed communities. Experimental results from synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the local search strategy in enhancing accuracy and modularity quality. HLSMM exhibits a general advantage in modularity quality over currently representative methods on real-world datasets, particularly in ambiguous and complex community structures.},

The approach introduces a new incentive mechanism designed to enhance both individual and collective profits of agents. Using evolutionary game theory, a three-party model is developed, incorporating interactions among player, enemy, and neutral agents. The model tracks the evolution of strategies to identify stable equilibria across various perceptual conditions.

To fill the gap, we start from the ground truth by empirically studying the breadth and depth of the DAO markets in mainstream public chain ecosystems in this article. We dive into the most widely adoptable DAO launchpad, Snapshot, which covers 95% of the wild DAO projects for data collection and analysis. By integrating extensively enrolled DAOs and corresponding data measurements, we explore statistical resources from Snapshot and analyze data from 581 DAO projects, encompassing 16 246 proposals over the course of 3+ years. Our empirical research has uncovered a multitude of previously unknown facts about DAOs, spanning topics such as their status, features, performance, threats, and ways of improvement. We have distilled these findings into a series of key insights and takeaway messages, emphasizing their significance. Notably, our study is the first of its kind to comprehensively examine the DAO ecosystem with a focus on scale and scope of data, real-time relevance, practical implementations, and comprehensive metrics, addressing critical gaps in the current literature.},

To address this issue, this article proposes a cascade perspective network (CPNet) to uncover reliable disagreement for subjective tasks. Specifically, CPNet learns each annotator’s personalized knowledge from annotation disagreement and stores them in an annotator bank through the personal perspective module for abundant disagreement information. Then, CPNet obtains consistent opinions by referring to all annotators’ opinions from the annotator bank through the comprehensive perspective module to reduce bias caused by noise. CPNet improves decision-making by considering the diversity and comprehensiveness of all annotators’ opinions. Moreover, it performs well in subjective tasks with limited or numerous annotators. The state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on subjective datasets from different domains demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of CPNet.},

However, most existing methods predominantly focus on the user’s psychological state and the causes of user’s emotional problem, neglecting key cues, e.g., topics of conversation and listener’s psychological state. This leads to an incomplete understanding of the user’s situation and ineffective emotional support. This article presents a novel method that utilizes prompt learning with multiperspective cues (PMPC) to generate emotional support responses. Specifically, we extract multiperspective cues from the dialogue history and the causes of user’s emotional problem. To fully utilize the different cues within the ESC system, we categorize them into two groups: semantic enhancement cues and semantic constraint cues. Subsequently, we construct two prompts based on different categories of cues, which are designed to thoroughly understand user’s emotional predicament and generate an engaging support response, respectively. Experimental results on the ESConv dataset demonstrate that our proposed PMPC can surpass other approaches in both automatic and human evaluation metrics, providing compelling evidence of its efficacy and potential impact in real-world applications.},

The initial phase involves preprocessing multimodal movie data to extract features encompassing visual and textual information. Subsequently, a multitasking architecture is employed, simultaneously undertaking classification and regression tasks to acquire user and movie representations. The learned representations are used to make personalized and accurate movie recommendations. Additionally, the Netflix Prize dataset has been augmented to include textual and visual features, rendering it multimodal. We conducted extensive experiments on three real-world multimodal movie datasets (Movielens-100K, MMTF-14K, and Netflix Prize) and compared our approach with several state-of-the-art movie recommendation algorithms. The experimental results illustrate that our approach outperforms the baseline methods in terms of recommendation accuracy and diversity.

Existing methods measure users’ conformity factors to reduce the impact of popularity bias. However, these methods do not consider the differences in users’ conformity behavior in the long-term and short-term. To address this, we propose LSDRec, a novel debiased SR method structured around three key tasks: degree-centrality conformity awareness, dual-scale interest encoding, and adaptive conformity information fusing. The degree-centrality conformity awareness task constructs a multiuser interaction graph, employs a graph convolutional network (GCN) to obtain global user conformity representations, and uses the degree centrality algorithm to compute users’ long-term and short-term conformity factors. The dual-scale interest encoding task models users’ long-term and short-term interests separately, obtaining corresponding interest representations and further enhancing them through the adaptive conformity information fusing task. The adaptive conformity information fusing task contrasts global conformity representations with long-term and short-term interest representations, adaptively integrating conformity factors and dynamically adjusting the degree of conformity information transfer. Together, these three tasks effectively mitigate popularity bias and improve the accuracy of user interest modeling. Our extensive evaluations of four diverse datasets demonstrate LSDRec’s superior performance over current state-of-the-art methods.},

First, the latent diffusion model (L-diffusion) and parametric topological noise reduction network (PTDNet) were introduced as view generators to improve the limited representation ability and mitigate noise. Second, dual-view contrastive learning was constructed to alleviate the limitations of high-quality data in the recommendation system and the problem of model collapse in the training process. Third, a hard negative sampling strategy was proposed to improve the self-supervised signal. We extensively compared our method with 14 popular baselines on four public datasets (Yelp, BeerAdvocate, Gowalla, and LastFM). Experiments show an improvement of recommendation quality (e.g., that on the BeerAdocate dataset, NDCG@40 is improved by 3.6% and Recall@40 is improved by 3.3% on BeerAdvocate dataset).},

Specifically, we introduce a space–frequency fusion module to leverage the deep feature extracted in spatial and frequency domains, so as to exploit subtle inconsistencies and artifacts that are not perceptible in the spatial domain alone. Additionally, we design a global–local attention module to pinpoint the manipulated areas more accurately. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method by significantly outperforming existing techniques in sequential deepfake detection.

Utilizing a hierarchical and-or graph representation, the model employs nodes and edges to encapsulate a broad spectrum of musical elements, including structures, textures, rhythms, and harmonies. This hierarchical approach expands the representability across various scales of music. This representation serves as the foundation for an energy-based model, uniquely tailored to learn musical concepts through a flexible algorithm framework relying on the minimax entropy principle. Utilizing an adapted Metropolis–Hastings sampling technique, the model enables fine-grained control over music generation. Through a comprehensive empirical evaluation, this novel approach demonstrates significant improvements in interpretability and controllability compared to existing methodologies.

Scholars have proposed various effective constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (CMOEAs) for such problems. However, most existing algorithms overlook the differences between different decision variables in influencing the degree of constraint violation and still lack an effective handling mechanism for constraint-sensitive variables. To address this issue, a two-stage cooperation multiobjective evolutionary algorithm guided by constraint-sensitive variables (CV-TCMOEA) is proposed. In the first stage, a relatively simple auxiliary problem with only a few dominant constraints is constructed to approximate the original problem. After obtaining a set of approximate Pareto optimal solutions by dealing with the auxiliary problem, in the second stage, a constraint-sensitive variable-guided multistrategy cooperation search method is developed. In this method, decision variables are divided into two types: 1) constraint-sensitive and 2) constraint-insensitive variables, and a variable-type-guided cooperative individual update strategy is proposed to autonomously select appropriate search strategies for different types of variables. Experimental results on 28 benchmark functions and 10 engineering problems demonstrated the superiority of the CV-TCMOEA over seven state-of-the-art CMOEAs.},

In the past, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise in capturing the non-Euclidean structure of brain networks. However, existing neuroimaging studies focused primarily on spatial functional connectivity, despite temporal dynamics in complex brain networks. To address this gap, we propose a spatio-temporal interactive graph representation framework (STIGR) for dynamic neuroimaging analysis that encompasses different aspects from classification and regression tasks to interpretation tasks. STIGR leverages a dynamic adaptive-neighbor graph convolution network to capture the interrelationships between spatial and temporal dynamics. To address the limited global scope in graph convolutions, a self-attention module based on Transformers is introduced to extract long-term dependencies. Contrastive learning is used to adaptively contrast similarities between adjacent scanning windows, modeling cross-temporal correlations in dynamic graphs. Extensive experiments on six public neuroimaging datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of STIGR across different platforms, achieving state-of-the-art results in classification and regression tasks. The proposed framework enables the detection of remarkable temporal association patterns between regions of interest based on sequential neuroimaging signals, offering medical professionals a versatile and interpretable tool for exploring task-specific neurological patterns.

Since then, in order to further streamline the intricacies of controller design, this work is extended to self-triggered cases to alleviate the need for hardware devices to continuously monitor signals.

Notably, by suitably utilizing self-learning horizon, we can directly evaluate inadmissible policies to reduce the initialization burden. Meanwhile, the inadmissible policy can be rapidly optimized with few learning iterations. Then, several critical conclusions of relaxed optimal control are established by discussing algorithm convergence and system stability. Furthermore, to provide the convincing application potentials, a class of unconventional problems is effectively solved by the relaxed PI algorithm, including the dynamics with external noises and nonzero equilibrium.

  abstract     = {To alleviate data distribution under different operating conditions, domain generalization (DG) has been applied in mechanical diagnosis. Still, its effectiveness is limited when unknown fault states appear in the target domain. Consequently, open set DG (OSDG) has emerged to identify unknown classes in unknown domains. However, data collection costs and safety concerns have resulted in a significant class imbalance in OSDG. This imbalance causes the decision boundary to be skewed toward abundant positive classes, ultimately leading to misclassifying unknown states and increasing security risks. Currently, there is a lack of methods to simultaneously address domain shift and class shift in an imbalanced unknown domain. To tackle this issue, this article proposes a multisource domain-class gradient coordination meta-learning (MDGCML) framework, which can learn the generalized boundaries of all tasks by coordinating gradients between interdomains and interclasses. Based on the MDGCML, a joint learning paradigm involving the sharing of parameters between open-set classifiers and closed-set classifiers is constructed to enable quick adaption of the model to unknown domains.

  abstract     = {In data stream (DS) learning, the system has to extract knowledge from data generated continuously, usually at high speed and in large volumes, making it impossible to store the entire set of data to be processed in batch mode. Hence, machine learning models must be built incrementally by processing the incoming examples, as data arrive, while updating the model to be compatible with the current data. In fuzzy DS clustering, the model can either absorb incoming data into existing clusters or initiate a new cluster. As the volume of data increases, there is a possibility that the clusters will overlap to the point where it is convenient to merge two or more clusters into one. Then, a cluster comparison measure (CM) should be applied, to decide whether such clusters should be combined, also in an incremental manner. This defines an incremental fusion process based on aggregation functions that can aggregate the incoming inputs without storing all the previous inputs. The objective of this article is to solve the fuzzy DS clustering problem of incrementally comparing fuzzy clusters on a formal basis. First, we formalize and operationalize incremental fusion processes of fuzzy clusters by introducing recursively extendable (RE) aggregation functions, studying construction methods and different classes of such functions. Second, we propose two approaches to compare clusters: 1) similarity and 2) overlapping between clusters, based on RE aggregation functions. Finally, we analyze the effect of those incremental CMs on the online and offline phases of the well-known fuzzy clustering algorithm d-FuzzStream, showing that our new approach outperforms the original algorithm and presents better or comparable performance to other state-of-the-art DS clustering algorithms found in the literature.},

Nonetheless, ViTs still face some challenges, such as high computational complexity and the absence of desirable inductive biases. To alleviate these issues, the potential advantages of combining eagle vision with ViTs are explored. A bi-fovea visual interaction (BFVI) structure inspired by the unique physiological and visual characteristics of eagle eyes is introduced. Based on this structural design approach, a novel bi-fovea self-attention (BFSA) mechanism and bi-fovea feedforward network (BFFN) are proposed. These components are employed to mimic the hierarchical and parallel information processing scheme of the biological visual cortex, thereby enabling networks to learn the feature representations of the targets in a coarse-to-fine manner. Furthermore, a bionic eagle vision (BEV) block is designed as the basic building unit based on the BFSA mechanism and the BFFN. By stacking the BEV blocks, a unified and efficient family of pyramid backbone networks called eagle ViTs (EViTs) is developed. Experimental results indicate that the EViTs exhibit highly competitive performance in various computer vision tasks, demonstrating their potential as backbone networks. In terms of computational efficiency and scalability, EViTs show significant advantages compared with other counterparts. The developed code is available at https://github.com/nkusyl/EViT.},

A key challenge in analyzing the SGFTS of such systems lies in the evolving integration methods caused by the impulses. To address this, we dynamically partition the semi-global attraction set (SGAS) and solve the corresponding differential equations within each subset. Additionally, by constructing the transition dynamics of impulse points and iteratively computing these points, we establish the conditions for SGFTS under both stabilizing and destabilizing impulses. For GFTS, the primary difficulty arises from the distinct trajectories and dynamics of points located inside and outside the SGAS. To overcome this, we introduce the concept of the maximum–minimum impulse interval and derive a sufficient condition that ensures the system can enter the SGAS from a distance under a finite number of impulses. Furthermore, we develop a criterion for GFTS under varying impulse degrees and provide convergence time estimation based on the research on SGFTS of NIS. Finally, numerical examples are presented to validate the theoretical results. Notably, in Example 3, a fixed-time impulse controller is designed based on the proposed theoretical framework to achieve global stabilization of complex systems.

Designing an appropriate optimal control strategy based on the identification of operating conditions is crucial for ensuring the safe operation of WWTPs. To effectively deal with the problem of multiple operating conditions in WWTPs, a data-knowledge-driven multiobjective adaptive optimal control (DK-MAOC) strategy is proposed. First, a fuzzy neural network (FNN) is employed as the prediction model to obtain the concentrations of nitrate and total nitrogen. Then, the operating conditions of WWTPs can be determined. Second, an adaptive objective function (AOF) is proposed to dynamically adjust the weights of operating indices to meet the operational requirements of each operating condition. In particular, the AOF integrates operating requirements and tracking errors to simultaneously consider the feasibility of the controller when solving setpoints. Third, due to the differences in data distribution under each operating condition, real-time data during condition changing is insufficient to accurately predict. A data-knowledge-driven model, incorporating operational knowledge into the FNN-based predictive model, is established to predict the future dynamics of WWTPs. Finally, a collaborative gradient descent algorithm is proposed to simultaneously solve for setpoints and control laws. The effectiveness of the proposed DK-MAOC is tested on the Benchmark Simulation Model No. 1. The experimental results indicate that DK-MAOC can effectively avoid the situation of effluent nitrate nitrogen and total nitrogen exceeding the standards while reducing energy consumption of WWTPs. Therefore, the proposed DK-MAOC can guarantee optimal operation of WWTPs.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a policy-iteration-based active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) is proposed for uncertain nonlinear systems to achieve real-time output tracking performance, regardless of the specific relative degree of the system. The approach integrates a partial control input generator with a policy-iteration-based reinforcement learning (RL) agent for degree weight adjustment. The partial control input generator includes each ith order partial control input, which is constructed following the ADRC design framework for an ith order system. The RL agent adjusts the degree weights (its actions) to enhance the dominance of the partial control input corresponding to the unknown relative degree through iterative policy refinement. The RL agent is designed to minimize the quadratic reward as the performance index function while enhancing the influence of the partial control input associated with the correct relative degree via the policy iteration procedure. All signals in the closed-loop system (including the time-varying degree weights) ensure semi-global uniformly ultimately boundness using the Lyapunov stability theorem and the affinely quadratically stable property. Consequently, the degree weight adjustments by the RL agent do not affect the closed-loop stability. The proposed method does not require system dynamics, specific relative degree, external disturbances, and other state variable sensing beyond output sensing. The performance of the proposed method was validated via simulations for two different-order uncertain nonlinear systems and experiments using a permanent magnet synchronous motor testbed.},

  abstract     = {Meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) algorithms extract task information from experienced context in order to reason about new tasks, and facilitate rapid adaptation. The quality of these contextual representations (or embeddings) is therefore crucial for a meta-RL agent to make effective decisions in unknown environments. Current methods predominantly assume the existence of a single underlying task, but using a single contextual embedding may not be expressive enough to fully capture the broader distribution of task variations that an agent might encounter. Decomposing that information into different representations can allow them to capture more relevant features in context space while applying additional structure that aids downstream exploitation. In this article, we develop global–local embeddings for contextual meta-RL (GLOBEX), an off-policy contextual meta-RL algorithm that decomposes the contextual representation into separate global and local embeddings. The learning process maximizes information retained by the embeddings and utilizes a mutual information constraint to encourage decoupling. Illustrative examples show that our method effectively adapts by identifying global task dynamics and exploiting temporally local signals. In addition, GLOBEX outperforms existing state-of-the-art meta-RL algorithms on standard MuJoCo benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {In order to process multiview multilabel, multilabel, and multiview data, current learning algorithms are designed on the basis of data characteristics, correlations, etc. While these algorithms cannot express correlations among different features, instances, labels in within-view, cross-view, and consensus-view representations self-adaptively and relative accurately. To this end, this study takes the classical multiple correlations-based model as the basis and explores some laws of self-adaptive change for those correlations in multiple representations. The proposed algorithm is called multiple self-adaptive correlation-based multiview multilabel learning (MuSC-MVML). Extensive experiments on 38 datasets demonstrate the superiority of MuSC-MVML and some conclusions are addressed. 1) MuSC-MVML outperforms most compared algorithms in statistical in terms of AUC and its performance is also stable; 2) the computational cost of MuSC-MVML is moderate and on most datasets, MuSC-MVML has a relatively fast convergence; and 3) introducing some laws of self-adaptive change for those correlations can improve the ability of MuSC-MVML to process multiview multilabel datasets effectively and express correlations in multiple representations better. Furthermore, this study explains the reason that why we use alternating optimization strategy to optimize the model of MuSC-MVML and provides some suggestions that how to modify the model of MuSC-MVML to process incomplete multiview multilabel datasets with noise.},

Within a zero-sum graphical game framework, secure containment controllers and malicious attackers are regarded as game players, and the attack–defense process is recast as a min-max optimization problem. Acquiring optimal distributed secure control policies requires solving the game-related Hamilton–Jacobi–Isaacs (HJI) equations. Based on the critic-only neural network (NN) structure, the reinforcement learning (RL) method is employed in solving coupled HJI equations. The fixed-time convergence technique is introduced to improve the convergence rate of RL, and the experience replay mechanism is utilized to relax the persistence of excitation condition. The associated NN convergence and closed-loop stability are analyzed. In the attitude loop, the optimal feedback control law is obtained by solving Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equations using the fixed-time convergent RL method.

This area has garnered significant research interest due to its extensive applications in robotics, particularly concerning household robots. Nevertheless, the majority of task planning methodologies exhibit suboptimal performance regarding the success and efficiency of completing household tasks, primarily due to a lack of cognitive capacity of household items and home environments. To address these challenges, we propose an efficiency-driven adaptive task planning approach based on hierarchical item-environment cognition. Initially, we establish a multiple semantic attribute-based priori knowledge (MSAPK) framework to facilitate the attributive representation of household items. Utilizing MSAPK, we develop a long short-term memory (LSTM) based item cognition model that assigns relevant attributes and substitutes to specified household items, thereby enhancing the cognitive capabilities of household robots at the attribute level. Subsequently, we construct an environment cognition model that delineates the relationships between household items and room types, enabling household robots to locate target items more efficiently. Through hierarchical item-environment cognition, we introduce a strategy for adaptive task planning, empowering household robots to execute household tasks with both flexibility and efficiency. The generated plans are evaluated in both virtual and real-world experiments, with promising results affirming the effectiveness of our proposed methodology.},

  abstract     = {Efficient and robust data clustering remains a challenging task in data analysis. Recent efforts have explored the integration of granular-ball (GB) computing with clustering algorithms to address this challenge, yielding promising results. However, existing methods for generating GBs often rely on single indicators to measure GB quality and employ threshold-based or greedy strategies, potentially leading to GBs that do not accurately capture the underlying data distribution. To address these limitations, this article leverages the principle of justifiable granularity (POJG) to measure the quality of a GB for clustering tasks and introduces a novel GB generation method, termed GB-POJG. Specifically, a comprehensive metric integrating the coverage and specificity of a GB is introduced to assess GB quality. Utilizing this quality metric, GB-POJG incorporates a strategy of maximizing overall quality and an anomaly detection method to determine the generated GBs and identify abnormal GBs, respectively. Compared to previous GB generation methods, GB-POJG maximizes the overall quality of generated GBs while ensuring alignment with the data distribution, thereby enhancing the rationality of the generated GBs. Experimental results obtained from both synthetic and publicly available datasets underscore the effectiveness of GB-POJG, showcasing improvements in clustering accuracy and normalized mutual information.

We also define a more general joint necessary condition, whereby each constituent itself is a necessary condition for the TSK-FIS-product model. The first necessary condition indicates that the normalized firing strength must not be indeterminate (i.e., 0/0), i.e., susceptible to the tomato classification problem. The second necessary condition indicates that all restricted consequents of fuzzy if-then rules must be defined. Based on the principle of the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator as well as the concept of increasing orness in OWA and hyperboxes, a general joint sufficient condition for a TSK-FIS-product model to be monotone is derived. Three case studies of the developed methods for undertaking failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) and image processing tasks are presented.

  abstract     = {Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) aims to develop a foundational model capable of detecting anomalies across arbitrary categories without relying on reference images. However, since “abnormality” is inherently defined in relation to “normality” within specific categories, detecting anomalies without reference images describing the corresponding normal context remains a significant challenge. As an alternative to reference images, this study explores the use of widely available product standards to characterize normal contexts and potential abnormal states. Specifically, this study introduces AnomalyVLM, which leverages generalized pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) to interpret these standards and detect anomalies. Given the current limitations of VLMs in comprehending complex textual information, AnomalyVLM generates hybrid prompts—comprising prompts for abnormal regions, symbolic rules, and region numbers—from the standards to facilitate more effective understanding. These hybrid prompts are incorporated into various stages of the anomaly detection process within the selected VLMs, including an anomaly region generator and an anomaly region refiner. By utilizing hybrid prompts, VLMs are personalized as anomaly detectors for specific categories, offering users flexibility and control in detecting anomalies across novel categories without the need for training data. Experimental results on four public industrial anomaly detection datasets, as well as a practical automotive part inspection task, highlight the superior performance and enhanced generalization capability of AnomalyVLM, especially in texture categories.

With this approach, the entire network is globally stabilized onto an objective trajectory by impulsively controlling only a small fraction of oscillators.

  abstract     = {Discovering clusters remains challenging when dealing with complex data structures, including those with varying densities, arbitrary shapes, weak separability, or the presence of noise. In this article, we propose a novel clustering algorithm called representative point-based clustering with neighborhood information (RPC-NI), which highlights the significance of neighborhood information often overlooked by existing clustering methods. The proposed algorithm first introduces a new local centrality metric that integrates both neighborhood density and topological convergence to identify core representative points, effectively capturing the structural characteristics of the data. Subsequently, a density-adaptive distance is defined to evaluate dissimilarities between these core representative points, and such distance is used to construct a minimum spanning tree (MST) over these points. Finally, an MST-based clustering algorithm is employed to yield the desired clusters. Incorporating neighborhood information enables RPC-NI to comprehensively determine representative points, and having multiple representative points per cluster allows RPC-NI to adapt to clusters of arbitrary shapes, varying densities, and different sizes. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets demonstrate that RPC-NI outperforms baseline algorithms in terms of clustering accuracy and robustness. These results provide further evidence for the importance of incorporating neighborhood information discovering clusters with complex structures.},

Recent advances in topology inference provide a better understanding of the behaviors of the systems. Nevertheless, external attackers can exploit such techniques, posing a severe privacy breach, while the challenges to the topology protection problem remain unresolved. This article proposes a distributed collaboration algorithm for MASs to defend against topology inference attacks. The novelties include: 1) Compared with traditional noise-adding methods that inject decaying random inputs, the proposed algorithm constructs a novel noise term to increase the irregularity of the agents’ states in a distributed manner while satisfying the convergence requirements. 2) A weight-selecting strategy is designed to choose the subtopologies to degrade the topology inference accuracy, further improving the topology-protecting performance. Theoretically, we derive the mean-square convergence factor and the nonasymptotic error bounds of our proposed algorithm. Extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in protecting the topology.},

Initially, two new stable systems with fixed-time convergence are developed, and their upper bounds of settling time and convergence regions are thoroughly analyzed. Building on these systems, an enhanced fast nonsingular integral terminal sliding-mode (NITSM) surface and a new virtual control law are designed, respectively. Next, a novel saturated adaptive fuzzy fixed-time NITSM controller is proposed, circumventing the restrictions on uncertainties and input saturation in the existing results. The proposed controller ensures that the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood of the origin within a fixed time. Furthermore, to facilitate the adaptive fixed-time stability analysis, two new inequalities are established and rigorously proved. Using the two inequalities, the fixed-time stability of closed-loop systems is demonstrated by the Lyapunov’s theory. Finally, representative numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

  abstract     = {Developing natural, intuitive, and human-centric input systems for mobile human–machine interaction (HMI) poses significant challenges. Existing gaze or gesture-based interaction systems are often constrained by their dependence on continuous visual engagement, limited interaction surfaces, or cumbersome hardware. To address these challenges, we propose MetaSkin, a novel neurohaptic interface that uniquely integrates neural signals with on-skin interaction for bare-handed, eyes-free interaction by exploiting human’s natural proprioceptive capabilities. To support the interface, we developed a deep learning framework that employs multiscale temporal–spectral feature representation and selective feature attention to effectively decode neural signals generated by on-skin touch and motion gestures. In experiments with 12 participants, our method achieved offline accuracies of 81.95% for touch location discrimination, 71.00% for motion type identification, and 46.08% for 10-class touch–motion classification. In pseudo-online settings, accuracies reached 99.43% for touch onset detection, and 80.34% and 67.02% for classification of touch location and motion type, respectively. Neurophysiological analyses revealed distinct neural activation patterns in the sensorimotor cortex, underscoring the efficacy of our multiscale approach in capturing rich temporal and spectral dynamics. Future work will focus on optimizing the system for diverse user populations and dynamic environments, with a long-term goal of advancing human-centered, neuroadaptive interfaces for next-generation HMI systems. This work represents a significant step toward a paradigm shift in design of brain–computer interfaces, bridging sensory and motor paradigms for building more sophisticated systems.},

Initially, the system under investigation is reformulated into a new system that encompasses both the original system state and the compromised state, enabling the use of compromised states for feedback control. Subsequently, two innovative asymptotic integral barrier Lyapunov functions (IBLFs) are developed by directly imposing constraints on the compromised state, thereby eliminating the necessity to convert state constraints into error constraints as required by traditional BLFs-based methods. Furthermore, controllers designed using relative/switched threshold event-triggered strategies ensure that all signals within the entire closed-loop system remain bounded, that the constant or time-varying full-state constraints are not breached, and that asymptotic stability is attained without Zeno behavior. Ultimately, simulation results validate the efficacy of the proposed strategies through a practical example.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, with the rapid development of the Internet, multisource information fusion has become a forefront issue due to its ability to merge different information. Granular computing (GrC), as a methodology simulating human hierarchical cognition, provides a new approach for multisource information fusion. However, on one hand, the existing information fusion studies in GrC all focus on feature-level fusion and decision-level fusion based on multisource data, neglecting the basic characteristics and advantages of GrC: granulation. On the other hand, the existing methods for fusing the knowledge spaces in GrC suffer from losing the necessary information or artificially adding information. In order to address these issues, a novel information fusion mode from the perspective of GrC is proposed in this article, named knowledge-level fusion. First, by introducing a new step, that is, granulate data to construct the knowledge space, into the multisource information fusion process, the knowledge-level fusion mode is proposed. Second, the optimistic core quotient space is proposed to characterize the information consensus and information gap of multisource knowledge spaces in the static data environment. The pessimistic core quotient space is proposed to characterize the information consensus in the dynamic data environment. Related theorems are given to describe the characteristics of the core quotient spaces. Then, the knowledge-level fusion method driven jointly by the data space and the knowledge space is introduced based on the principle of extracting the core quotient space first and then allocating other objects in the candidate set. On the basis, the superiority of the proposed method over the existing methods is demonstrated through theoretical analysis. Finally, experiments on 12 UCI datasets and three UKB datasets are carried out to verify the promoting effect on classification and clustering algorithms, the effectiveness compared to feature-level and decision-level fusion modes, efficiency and statistical significance of the proposed knowledge-level fusion method and mode.},

This provides finer adjustments in sampling periods and ensures a lower average sampling rate compared with traditional periodic sampling schemes. Moreover, the upper and lower bounds of sampling intervals in different channels are heterogeneous, in which only the lower bounds are constrained by inequalities associated with the coefficients of DoS attacks. The impact of DoS attacks is observed from the viewpoint of the overall communication network topology. Observation of the joint recovery time series, defined as those time instants that the joint union of the sampling-based communication graphs under asynchronous DoS attacks can recover to the original topology graph, measures the effectiveness of the designed sampling scheme in restoring the connectivity of communication network under DoS attacks.

To capture the interactions between these domains, the decision-making system is modeled as a hybrid system consisting of a controlled MDP and autonomous (uncontrolled) continuous dynamics, collectively referred to as the hybrid Markov decision process (HMDP). The design focuses on ensuring safety and optimality by accounting for both discrete and continuous state variables across different levels. With the help of the model predictive control (MPC) concept, a decision-making scheme is developed for the hybrid model, with guarantees for recursive feasibility and stability.

  abstract     = {This article investigates the problem of unified output constraints for a class of uncertain interconnected nonlinear systems, where the measurement of system states is affected by unknown drifts in the powers of the measurement functions. Compared to previous works on output constraints, the main challenge addressed in this article is the unavailability of the true system states during the controller design process and the nondifferentiability of the sensor’s output functions. To achieve the control objectives, the following control scheme is proposed in this study. First, a novel barrier Lyapunov function is introduced, which is specifically designed to handle systems with unknown measurement drifts. This function can be uniformly applied to satisfy both scenarios of systems with or without output constraints. Second, the adding a power integrator (AAPI) technique and dynamic surface control (DSC) techniques are enhanced to effectively handle the unknown measurement drifts and avoid singularity problems in the controller design. The decentralized controller proposed in this article can realize that the outputs are strictly constrained within predefined boundaries and guarantees convergence of all system states to an arbitrarily small neighborhood. Finally, we provide two simulation examples to validate the effectiveness of our proposed control strategy.},

Notably, the FDI attacks modeled here are explicitly malicious, meaning they are designed to cause the system to violate prescribed output constraints. Motivated by the lack of constrained-control studies addressing situations where the reference signal does not meet the constraint, we introduce a new form of tracking error, termed barrier tracking error (BTE). It is valuable that any conventional control scheme can be combined with the BTE idea to deal with output constraints. Subsequently, a nonsingular finite-time controller is developed using the backstepping method and neural networks. It is worth mentioning that the controller employs an event-triggered quantized control strategy, effectively reducing the burden on channels and actuators. Finally, comprehensive stability analysis and simulations are provided.},

Existing methods mainly utilize deep neural network, which is relatively time-consuming due to the complex network structure and back propagation iterations. In this article, co-training broad Siamese-like network (Co-BSLN) is proposed for coupled-view semi-supervised classification. Co-BSLN learns knowledge from two-view data and can be used for multiview data with the help of feature concatenation. Different from existing deep learning methods, Co-BSLN utilizes a simple shallow network based on broad learning system (BLS) to simplify the network structure and reduce training time. It replaces back propagation iterations with a direct pseudo inverse calculation to further reduce time consumption. In Co-BSLN, different views of the same instance are considered as positive pairs due to cross-view consistency. Predictions of views in positive pairs are used to guide the training of each other through a direct logit vector mapping. Such a design is fast and effectively utilizes cross-view consistency to improve the accuracy of semi-supervised learning. Evaluation results demonstrate that Co-BSLN is able to improve accuracy and reduce training time on popular datasets.},

A new filter, called dynamic command filter, is used to construct the gradient of the NNs. By resorting to second-order Lyapunov stability criteria, it is proved that the closed-loop system is practically stable and has predefined damping ratio.

  abstract     = {Zeroing neural network (ZNN), as a special type of recurrent neural network (RNN), is very competitive in solving time-varying linear matrix–vector equations. Recently, various ZNNs with predefined-time convergence (PTC) capabilities have been reported. Such ZNNs with PTC capabilities can achieve the predefined convergence time via explicitly presetting multiple parameters related to the upper bounds of their convergence time. However, obtaining suitable and robust values for these parameters through reasonable adjustments is a challenging task in many engineering applications. To address this problem, we propose a novel arbitrarily predefined-time convergent RNN (APTC-RNN) with a novel nonlinear piecewise activation-function (NPAF). Unlike most existing ZNNs with PTC capabilities, the proposed APTC-RNN, due to its NPAF, can achieve arbitrarily PTC (APTC) without adjusting any upper bound parameters. Furthermore, due to the piecewise computation form of the NPAF, the proposed APTC-RNN can provide a lower computational cost compared to most existing RNNs. The stability and APTC capability of the proposed APTC-RNN are proven by rigorous theoretical analysis and mathematical derivation. Numerical simulations show that APTC-RNN has faster and more accurate PTC capability than three state-of-the-art RNNs, while having less computational time. Finally, the practicality of the APTC-RNN is verified by applying it to the UR3 robotic arm and multiagent systems.},

Inspired by the idea of deep learning, those basic latent variable models have been extended to deep forms, based on which the quality prediction performance has been significantly improved. However, different latent variable models have their own strengths and weaknesses, a model works well under one scenario might not provide satisfactory performance under another. The motivation of this article is based on the viewpoint of information fusion and ensemble learning for heterogeneous latent variable models. Particularly, a collaborative deep learning and model fusion framework is formulated for the purpose of industrial quality prediction. In the first stage of the framework, collaborative layer-by-layer feature extractions are implemented among different latent variable models, through which different patterns of latent variables are identified in different layers of the deep model. Then, in the second stage, an ensemble regression modeling strategy is proposed to fuse the quality prediction results from different latent variable models, which is based on a well-designed data description method. Two real industrial examples are used for performance evaluation of the proposed method, based on which we can observe that information fusions in terms of both collaborative layer-by-layer feature extraction and heterogeneous model ensemble have positive effects in improving prediction accuracy and stability.},

The problem is complicated by random state dropouts occurring in two crucial scenarios: 1) the reception of the target’s state and 2) feedback of the controlled system’s states. Our approach enables the controlled system to infer the target’s cost function and optimal control policy, thereby facilitating effective tracking. Specifically, we develop a model-based IRL algorithm that integrates the Smith predictor for state estimation. Then, we advance a state-dropout-aware inverse Q-learning algorithm that uses solely accessible system data, eliminating the need for system models. The theoretical validity of the proposed algorithms is rigorously established, and their practical effectiveness is validated through numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {Determining the optimal number of clusters in cluster analysis without prior knowledge remains a critical and challenging task. Existing methods often depend on calculating clustering validity indices (CVIs), which increases complexity and may reduce efficiency. Furthermore, different CVIs frequently suggest varying optimal cluster numbers, complicating the selection process. To address these challenges, we propose a novel clustering algorithm, self-regulating possibilistic C-means (PCM) with high-density points (SR-PCM-HDP), which simplifies cluster number determination while improving clustering efficiency. First, the density-based knowledge extraction (DBKE) method is introduced to estimate an appropriate initial cluster number and identify high-density points. DBKE enhances the density peak clustering (DPC) algorithm by removing the need for a predefined density radius. Second, SR-PCM-HDP refines the clustering process by incorporating a parameter to balance the interactions between high-density points and cluster centers, reducing sensitivity to initial configurations and accelerating convergence. Third, the parameter adjustment mechanism in classical PCM is redefined to enable adaptive updates during SR-PCM-HDP iterations. This mechanism facilitates the gradual elimination of obsolete clusters and iterative cluster formation. The theoretical foundations of the SR-PCM-HDP cluster elimination mechanism are rigorously established. Experimental results validate the accuracy and effectiveness of SR-PCM-HDP in determining cluster numbers and ensuring clustering validity, particularly for datasets with overlapping or imbalanced distributions. Comparisons are conducted against 13 state-of-the-art algorithms, including fuzzy clustering, possibilistic clustering, and CVI-based cluster determination methods.},

We design a novel online distributed RL algorithm to approximate the solution of DGAREs without completely knowing system dynamics and initial admissible control policy.

The convergence of the designed RL algorithms is rigorously analyzed. Finally, two inverted pendulum system applications validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

Comparing the optimized results with those under conventional control methods, it has been proved that optimized controller has obvious improvement on the formation performance of MASs.

  abstract     = {The agile Earth observation satellite scheduling problem (AEOSSP) with time-dependent transition time is a combinatorial optimization challenge. Due to its NP-hardness, problem-tailored methods are sensitive to instances and require massive computational overhead. Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) models have shown promise in efficiently addressing the AEOSSP. However, these models may make decision mistakes in specific scenarios due to prioritizing maximizing average reward expectation over individual decision accuracy during DRL training, directly leading to resource wastage. To address these issues, we propose a reconstruction model (RCM), which is a DRL-based two-stage construction model (CM), including a CM and a reconstruction mechanism (RM). RCM constructs solutions initially using a DRL-trained CM, which are subsequently refined by RM. CM utilizes a more efficient network for policy representation to make decisions. RM applies two operators“, repair” and “removal”, with a “repair-removal-repair” solution reconstruction process to identify and rectify decision mistakes from CM, offering a modular component to enhance the stability and solution quality. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RCM outperforms the state-of-the-art AEOSSP iterative search method, achieving such performance within a computational time of 0.1 s. Additionally, CM surpasses the state-of-the-art DRL policy model and RM can effectively rectify decision errors or suboptimalities, underscoring its effectiveness in enhancing DRL outcomes.},

Evolutionary computation (EC) has been widely used in solving FS by modeling it as an expensive wrapper-form optimization task, where a classifier is used to obtain classification accuracy for fitness evaluation (FE). In this article, we propose that the FS problem can be also modeled as a cheap filter-form optimization task, where the FE is based on the relevance and redundancy of the selected features. The wrapper-form optimization task is beneficial for classification accuracy while the filter-form optimization task has the strength of a lighter computational cost. Therefore, different from existing multitask-based FS that uses various wrapper-form optimization tasks, this article uses a multiform optimization technique to model the FS problem as a wrapper-form optimization task and a filter-form optimization task simultaneously. An evolutionary multitask FS (EMTFS) algorithm for parallel tacking these two tasks is proposed followed by, in which a two-channel knowledge transfer strategy is proposed to transfer positive knowledge across the two tasks. Experiments on widely used public datasets show that EMTFS can select as few features as possible on the premise of superior classification accuracy than the compared state-of-the-art FS algorithms.},

However, existing methods for driver status detection rarely use the rich physiological information in EEG to improve detection performance. Moreover, there is currently a lack of EEG datasets for abnormal states of train drivers. To address these gaps, we propose a novel transfer learning model based on a hybrid attention mechanism, named hybrid attention-based transfer learning network (HATNet). We first segment the EEG signals into patches and utilize the hybrid attention module to capture local and global temporal patterns. Then, a channel-wise attention module is introduced to establish spatial representations among EEG channels. Finally, during the training process, we employ a calibration-based transfer learning strategy, which allows for adaptation to the EEG data distribution of new subjects using minimal data. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed model, we conduct a multistimulus oddball experiment to establish a EEG dataset of abnormal states for train drivers. Experimental results on this dataset indicate that: 1) Compared to the state-of-the-art end-to-end models, HATNet achieves the highest classification accuracy in both subject-dependent and subject-independent tasks at 94.26% and 87.03%, respectively, and 2) The proposed hybrid attention module effectively captures the temporal semantic information of EEG data.},

  abstract     = {Approximate computing (AxC) has recently emerged as a successful approach for optimizing energy consumption in error-tolerant applications, such as deep neural networks (DNNs). The enormous model size and high computation cost of DNNs present significant challenges for deployment in energy-efficient and resource-constrained computing systems. Emerging DNN hardware accelerators based on AxC designs selectively approximate the non-critical segments of computation to address these challenges. However, a systematic and principled approach that incorporates domain knowledge and approximate hardware for optimal approximation is still lacking. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic-oriented AxC (PAxC) framework that provides high energy savings with acceptable quality by considering the overall probability effect of approximation. To achieve aggressive approximate designs, we utilize the minimum likelihood error to determine the AxC synergy profile at both application and circuit levels. This enables effective coordination of the trade-off between energy and accuracy. Compared with a baseline design, the power-delay product (PDP) is significantly reduced by up to 83.66% with an acceptable accuracy reduction. Simulation and a case study of the image process validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

However, recent studies have highlighted that transient hardware faults can corrupt the model&#39;s output, leading to high misprediction probabilities. Since traditional reliability strategies, based on modular hardware, software replications, or matrix multiplication checksum impose a high overhead, there is a pressing need for efficient and effective hardening solutions tailored for DNNs. In this paper we present several network design choices and a training procedure that increase the robustness of standard deep models and thoroughly evaluate these strategies with experimental analyses on vision classification tasks. We name DieHardNet the specialized DNN obtained by applying all our hardening techniques that combine knowledge from experimental hardware faults characterization and machine learning studies. We conduct extensive ablation studies to quantify the reliability gain of each hardening component in DieHardNet. We perform over 10,000 instruction-level fault injections to validate our approach and expose DieHardNet executed on GPUs to an accelerated neutron beam equivalent to more than 570,000 years of natural radiation. Our evaluation demonstrates that DieHardNet can reduce the critical error rate (i.e., errors that modify the inference) up to 100 times compared to the unprotected baseline model, without causing any increase in inference time.},

  abstract     = {Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a technique that allows arbitrary computations to be performed on encrypted data without the need for decryption, making it ideal for secure computation outsourcing. However, computation on FHE-encrypted data is significantly slower than that on plain data, primarily due to the explosive increases in data size and computation complexity after encryption. To enable real-world FHE applications, recent research has proposed several custom hardware accelerators that provide orders of magnitude speedup over conventional systems. However, the performance of existing FHE accelerators is severely bounded by memory bandwidth, even with expensive on-chip buffers. Processing In-Memory (PIM) is a promising technology that can accelerate data-intensive workloads with extensive internal bandwidth. Unfortunately, existing PIM accelerators cannot efficiently support FHE due to the limited throughput to support FHE&#39;s complex computing and data movement operations. To tackle such challenges, we propose FHEmem, an FHE accelerator using a novel PIM architecture for high- throughput FHE acceleration. Furthermore, we present an optimized end-to-end processing flow with an automated mapping framework to maximize the hardware utilization of FHEmem. Our evaluation shows that FHEmem achieves at least 4.0× speedup and 6.9× energy-delay-area efficiency improvement over state-of-the-art FHE accelerators on popular FHE applications.},

Our intention is to arm nodes with the ability of learning the access patterns of offloaded data-driven tasks and predict which data should be migrated to the original ‘owners’ of tasks. Naturally, these tasks are linked to the processing of data that are absent at the original hosting nodes indicating the required data assets that need to be accessed directly. To identify these data intervals, we employ an ensemble scheme that combines a statistically oriented model and a machine learning scheme. Hence, we are able not only to detect the density of the requests but also to learn and infer the ‘strong’ data assets. The proposed approach is analyzed in detail by presenting the corresponding formulations being also evaluated and compared against baselines and models found in the respective literature.},

Meanwhile, IMC also shows promising prospects towards high- throughput and energy-efficient processing of cryptographic workloads. This paper presents Block-Cipher-In-Memory (BCIM), a constant-time, high- throughput, bit-serial in-memory cryptography scheme to support versatile Substitution-Permutation and Feistel network based block ciphers, such as standard ciphers like Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), and lightweight block ciphers like RECTANGLE and Simon. In addition, BCIM employs a processor-assisted key loading scheme and prudent memory management strategies to minimize the memory footprint needed for cryptographic algorithms to improve the peak operating frequency and energy efficiency. Built upon these, BCIM can also support alternative block cipher modes of operation like counter mode beyond electronic-codebook. Furthermore, the bit-serial operation of BCIM inherently ensures constant-time execution and exploits column- wise single instruction multiple data (SIMD) processing, thereby providing strong resistance to side-channel timing attacks, and achieves high- throughput encryption and decryption via massively-parallel compact round function implementation. Experimental results suggest that BCIM shows substantial performance and energy improvements over state-of-the-art bit-parallel IMC ciphers. Additionally, BCIM show competitive performance and orders of magnitude energy advantages over the bitsliced software implementations on MCU/CPU platforms.

SDF formats are designed specifically to meet the numeric needs of the computation and are more compact representations of the data. They reduce memory footprint and memory bandwidth requirements without sacrificing accuracy, given that BP for loopy graphs inherently involves algorithmic errors. This paper designs several SDF formats for sum-product BP applications by careful analysis of the computation. Our theoretical analysis leads to the design of 16-bit (half-precision) and 8-bit (mini-precision) widths. We moreover present highly efficient software implementation of the proposed SDF formats which is centered around conversion to hardware-supported single-precision arithmetic hardware. Our solution demonstrates negligible conversion overhead on commercially available CPUs. For Ising grids with sizes from 100×100 to 500×500, the 16- and 8-bit SDF formats along with our conversion module produce equivalent accuracy to double-precision floating-point format but with 2.86× speedups on average on an Intel Xeon processor. Particularly, increasing the grid size results in higher speed-up. For example, the proposed half-precision format with 3-bit exponent and 13-bit mantissa achieved the minimum and maximum speedups of 1.30× and 1.39× over single-precision, and 2.55× and 3.40× over double-precision, by increasing grid size from 100×100 to 500×500.},

Moreover, contrastive learning methods for continuous test-time adaptation consider the aggregation of features from the same class while neglecting the problem of aggregating similar features within the same class. Therefore, we propose “Weighted Contrastive Learning” and apply it to both pre-training and continual test-time adaptation. To address the issue of catastrophic forgetting caused by continual adaptation, previous studies have employed source-domain knowledge to stochastically recover the target-domain model. However, significant domain shifts may cause the source-domain knowledge to behave as noise, thus impacting the model&#39;s adaptability. Therefore, we propose “Domain-aware Pseudo-label Correction” to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation without accessing the original source-domain data while minimizing the impact on model adaptability.

However, DL-based ARB prediction models face a dual challenge: overcoming overfitting to enhance generalization and managing the high labeling costs associated with extensive data requirements. To address the first issue, we utilize the sparse and binary nature of spiking communication in Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which inherently provides brain-inspired regularization to effectively alleviate overfitting. Therefore, we propose a Spiking Convolutional Neural Network (SCNN)-based ARB prediction model along with a training framework that handles the model&#39;s spatial-temporal dynamics and non-differentiable nature. To reduce labeling costs, we introduce a Bio-inspired and Diversity-aware Active Learning framework (BiDAL), which prioritizes highly informative and diverse samples, enabling more efficient usage of the limited labeling budget. This framework incorporates bio-inspired uncertainty to enhance informativeness measurement along with using a diversity-aware selection strategy based on clustering to prevent redundant labeling. Experiments on three ARB datasets show that ARB-SCNN effectively reduces overfitting, improving generalization performance by 6.65% over other DL-based classifiers. Additionally, BiDAL boosts label efficiency for ARB-SCNN training, outperforming four state-of-the-art active learning methods by 4.77% within limited labeling budgets.},

However, RRAM-based DNNs face inherent challenges from manufacturing process variability, which can compromise their performance (classification accuracy) and functional safety. One way to test these DNNs is to apply the exhaustive set of test images to each DNN to ascertain its performance; however, this is expensive and time-consuming. We propose a signature-based predictive testing (SiPT) in which a small subset of test images is applied to each DNN and the classification accuracy of the DNN is predicted directly from observations of the intermediate and final layer outputs of the network. This saves the test cost while allowing binning of RRAM-based DNNs for performance. To further improve the test efficiency of SiPT, we create the optimized compact set of test images, leveraging image filters and enhancements to synthesize images and develop a cascaded test structure, incorporating multiple sets of SiPT modules trained on compact test subsets of varying sizes. Through experimentation across diverse test cases, we demonstrate the viability of our SiPT framework under the RRAM process variations, showing test efficiency improvements up to 48X over testing with the exhaustive image dataset.},

  abstract     = {Script event prediction is the task of predicting the subsequent event given a sequence of events that already took place. It benefits task planning and process scheduling for event-centric systems including enterprise systems, IoT systems, etc. Sequence-based and graph-based learning models have been applied to this task. However, when learning data is limited, especially in a multiple-participant-involved enterprise environment, the performance of such models falls short of expectations as they heavily rely on large-scale training data. To take full advantage of given data, in this paper we propose a new type of knowledge graph (KG) that models not just events but also entities participating in the events, and we design a collaborative event prediction model exploiting such KGs. Our model identifies semantically similar vertices as collaborators to resolve unknown events, applies gated graph neural networks to extract event-wise sequential features, and exploits a heterogeneous attention network to cope with entity-wise influence in event sequences. To verify the effectiveness of our approach, we designed multiple-choice narrative cloze tasks with inadequate knowledge. Our experimental evaluation with three datasets generated from well-known corpora shows our method can successfully defend against such incompleteness of data and outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches for event prediction.},

  abstract     = {In the past few decades, many multiobjective evolutionary optimization algorithms (MOEAs) have been proposed to find a finite set of approximate Pareto solutions for a given problem in a single run. However, in many real-world applications, it could be desirable to have structure constraints on the entire optimal solution set, which define the patterns shared among all solutions. The current population-based MOEAs cannot properly handle such requirements. In this work, we make a first attempt to add structure constraints on the solution set. Specifically, we propose to model such a multiobjective optimization problem as a set optimization problem with structure constraints. The structure constraints define some patterns that all the solutions are required to share. Such patterns can be fixed components shared by all solutions, specific relations among decision variables, and the required shape of the Pareto set. In addition, we develop a simple yet efficient evolutionary stochastic optimization method to learn the set model, which only requires a low computational budget similar to classic MOEAs. With our proposed method, the decision-makers can easily trade off the Pareto optimality with preferred structures, which is not supported by other MOEAs. A set of experiments on benchmark test suites and real-world application problems demonstrates that our proposed method is effective.},

In TSP, it is common to encounter some dynamic events, for example, traffic jam and roadworks in transportation planning. To deal with such Dynamic TSP (DTSP) scenarios, numerous techniques have been designed over decades. In this paper, we take a different perspective to study DTSP. Instead of focusing only on algorithm design for DTSP, we investigate how dynamic events in DTSP affect its fitness landscape (e.g., the location of local optimal solutions and the ruggedness level of search space). We consider three dynamic events, including node addition, node deletion and weight changes, and analyze how they affect the TSP with respect to the overall landscape structure and solution optimality. Experimental results show that the weight change event has great effect on the problem’s fitness landscape, introducing more local optima and reducing the basin of attraction for the global optimum. This may suggest that search algorithms need to have stronger exploration capability when handling weight change dynamic events. Furthermore, our experimental studies also demonstrate that the dynamic solution adaptation strategy on the original global optimum is effective for tracking the new optimum after dynamic changes.},

However, the traditional way of asynchronously handling bi-level optimization problems (BLOPs) ignores the benefits brought by effective upper-and lower-level collaboration. To address this issue, this paper proposes a collaborative multi-objective transformation (MOT)-based evolutionary algorithm (MOTEA-II). In MOTEA-II, the BLOP is handled within a decomposition-based multi-objective optimization paradigm using a two-stage collaborative MOT strategy. The stage-1 MOT focuses on multiple lower-level optimizations and collaboration, while stage-2 collaborates the upper-level optimization with lower-level optimization, which makes simultaneously horizontal and vertical optimization information sharing in bi-level optimization possible. In addition, a dynamic decomposition strategy is further proposed to reconstruct the hierarchy relationship in collaborative multi-objective optimization, facilitating the adaptive and flexible importance control of the upper-level objective optimization and lower-level optimality satisfaction for better bi-level search efficiency. Empirical studies are conducted on two groups of commonly used BLOP benchmark suites and four practical applications. Experimental results show that the proposed collaborative MOTEA-II can achieve performance comparable to that of the previous MOTEA and three other representative EA-based bi-level optimization approaches, but using much fewer computational resources.},

Local search is an effective approach for obtaining a high-quality subset in this problem. However, local search requires high computational cost, especially as the size of the point set and the number of objectives increase. To address this issue, this paper proposes a candidate list strategy for local search in the indicator-based subset selection problem. In the proposed strategy, each point in a given point set has a candidate list. During search, each point is only eligible to swap with unselected points in its associated candidate list. This restriction drastically reduces the number of swaps at each iteration of local search. We consider two types of candidate lists: nearest neighbor and random neighbor lists. This paper investigates the effectiveness of the proposed candidate list strategy on various Pareto fronts. The results show that the proposed strategy with the nearest neighbor list can significantly speed up local search on continuous Pareto fronts without significantly compromising the subset quality. The results also show that the sequential use of the two lists can address the discontinuity of Pareto fronts.},

To address EFJSP-AGV, both exact and approximate methods were developed. The exact method employs a novel mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model, capable of producing optimal Pareto solutions for small-sized instances using the epsilon method. EFJSP-AGV is an NP-hard problem that involves three subproblems: operation sequencing, machine selection, and AGV selection. To overcome these challenges, a novel approximate method called imitation learning (IL)-assisted multi-population evolutionary algorithm (ILMPEA) was proposed. The multi-population evolutionary framework assigns distinct search regions to populations to improve the efficiency of solution space exploration. To further enhance search accuracy, IL is applied to select search operators, guiding the Pareto front toward a better approximation of the true front.

Considering these different solutions can provide users with richer decisions, the search of multiple PSs is crucial when solving MMOPs. To this end, many multimodal multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MMOEAs) often employ intricate mechanisms to maintain the diversity of the offspring in mating selection, but ignore to learn PSs. In this paper, a data-driven evolutionary algorithm based on inductive graph neural networks (DEA-IGNN) is proposed to solve MMOPs, which successfully learns the PSs topology by the graph structure to generate offspring with good performance. Specifically, a graph topology construction method based on Euclidean distance in the decision space is designed. It determines the neighborhood by calculating the Euclidean distance of individuals in the decision space and establishes the topological relationships to construct the graphs representing of population distribution. On this basis, a model based on inductive graph neural networks is constructed to assist offspring reproduction, which can learn unknown nodes by sampling and aggregating existing information. Moreover, a data-driven reproduction strategy is proposed to predict offspring with the good diversity and convergence, which uses the traditional variation operators to generate training data and adopts these data to train the model. The proposed DEA-IGNN is implemented and compared with eleven competitive MMOEAs on three test suites and a practical problem. The experimental results show that DEA-IGNN has good performance.},

This paper addresses the dynamic cascaded flowshop joint scheduling problem, which integrates a distributed permutation flowshop in Phase 1 and a hybrid flowshop in Phase 2. The challenge involves both initial scheduling and dynamic response mechanisms for new job insertions. We propose an evolutionary greedy algorithm (EGA) aimed at minimizing total flowtime. The EGA employs a multi-start cooperative framework tailored to problem characteristics, alternating between a population-based evolutionary greedy algorithm for Phase 1 and an elitist-based greedy algorithm for Phase 2 to generate a robust and complete schedule. Upon new job insertions, three heuristic-driven response strategies enhance solution stability and adaptability. Additionally, phase-specific hybrid local search operators and an adaptive insertion strategy, leveraging knowledge-based problem properties, further improve solution quality and search efficiency. The experimental results indicate that the EGA outperforms five state-of-the-art algorithms, achieving an average improvement of 39% in RPI values across 480 instances. Moreover, the proposed local search mechanisms and dynamic response strategies significantly enhance its performance. Thus, the EGA is well-suited for addressing the studied problem.},

  abstract     = {As a cornerstone in the Evolutionary Computation (EC) domain, Differential Evolution (DE) is known for its simplicity and effectiveness in handling challenging black-box optimization problems. While the advantages of DE are well-recognized, achieving peak performance heavily depends on its hyperparameters such as the mutation factor, crossover probability, and the selection of specific DE strategies. Traditional approaches to this hyperparameter dilemma have leaned towards parameter tuning or adaptive mechanisms. However, identifying the optimal settings tailored for specific problems remains a persistent challenge. In response, we introduce MetaDE, an approach that evolves DE’s intrinsic hyperparameters and strategies using DE itself at a meta-level. A pivotal aspect of MetaDE is a specialized parameterization technique, which endows it with the capability to dynamically modify DE’s parameters and strategies throughout the evolutionary process. To augment computational efficiency, MetaDE incorporates a design that leverages parallel processing through a GPU-accelerated computing framework. Within such a framework, DE is not just a solver but also an optimizer for its own configurations, thus streamlining the process of hyperparameter optimization and problem-solving into a cohesive and automated workflow. Extensive evaluations on the CEC2022 benchmark suite demonstrate MetaDE’s promising performance. Moreover, when applied to robot control via evolutionary reinforcement learning, MetaDE also demonstrates promising performance.

Stacking transfer is able to combine the pretrained source surrogate models and the preliminary target model with a meta-regression algorithm to transfer knowledge from source to target. However, when large-scale source models are involved in the many-problem scenarios, the less correlated sources may hurt the target performance, which is known as negative transfer. In this paper, sparse representation of the coefficients of meta-regression is considered to automatically select the most relevant source models for largely avoiding negative transfer. In the proposed many-problem surrogates, the coefficients of the source and target models are assumed to be sparse under the non-negativity and sum-to-one constraints. Then a sparse transfer stacking model is established with l1-norm of the coefficients. Next, the alternating direction method of multipliers is employed to solve the resulting constrained optimization problem by converting it into several much simpler problems. Most of the previous works assume that the costs for evaluation have no much difference and this assumption rarely holds in the real-world applications. In order to further reduce the total costs, an improved surrogate model with a cost-sensitive measure is designed to estimate the cost and select new solutions for real evaluation based on their estimated fitness, uncertainty and cost. Experimental results on synthetic and practical problems have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed many-problem surrogates.},

Among these techniques, generating grid-based maps is notable for simplifying the path planning process, especially in complex environments. This study introduces a novel optimization approach, the modified ant colony optimization and genetic algorithm (MACOGA), which is tailored for path planning in grid environments. MACOGA combines ant colony optimization (ACO) with genetic algorithm (GA) to efficiently navigate grid spaces. First, ACO identifies potential routes within a grid map, and GA optimizes them to find the optimal route. A key feature of MACOGA is its probabilistic prediction mechanism, which improves node selection by integrating the heuristic factors and probabilistic calculations of feasible potential paths, which significantly increases the likelihood of generating feasible initial paths and attains higher success rates in various environmental tests. The enhanced GA in the MACOGA incorporates ACO’s pheromones and heuristic factors, and introduces adaptive probability crossover and mutation operations. Additionally, a path reconnection operation ensures favorable length and smoothness. To evaluate MACOGA’s effectiveness, six planar models of varying sizes and complexities were studied. Results show MACOGA’s superiority in path length and execution time, achieving the shortest path and planning time in several environments. The shortest path can be optimized to yield an improvement of up to 6%. Regarding runtime, even in the complex scenarios, it executes in just 0.3 seconds, outperforming other comparative algorithms. Furthermore, the success rate can reach 100% in relatively complex environments.},

The DFJSSP involves scheduling jobs in a highly dynamic and uncertain manufacturing environment where new tasks are continually introduced, further complicating the scheduling process. In this study, the DFJSSP is extended to incorporate single crane transportation and sequence-dependent setup times, reflecting real-world manufacturing constraints. To tackle this multifaceted problem, we introduce a novel approach, i.e., a multipopulation-based evolutionary multi-task optimization(EMTO) framework. Additionally, the genetic programming algorithm is employed as a generative hyperheuristic to deal with the dynamic uncertainties in the shop floor. Two components are collaborated to optimize two objectives, i.e., minimizing the maximum completion time and the total tardiness. Furthermore, a dynamic transfer ratio is proposed, allowing the proportion of knowledge transfer to adapt throughout the iteration process, balancing convergence speed with population diversity. The results demonstrate that both the EMTO framework and the dynamic transfer ratio significantly enhance the performance of the algorithm. Compared to well-known constructive heuristics and reinforcement learning algorithm, the proposed approach enables parallel resolution of multiple optimization objectives, leading to enhanced scheduling efficiency and adaptability in dynamic manufacturing environments.},

Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) have shown effective for expensive black-box optimization by relying on inexpensive surrogate models. However, large-scale optimization remains challenging for SAEAs due to the exponentially growing search space and the presence of multiple local optima, resulting in difficulty in training a proper model due to the lack of samples. To address these challenges, we propose constructing an initial surrogate model on randomly selected dimensions and calculating a Gaussian distribution for each sampled dimension. The surrogate then provides predictions when perturbing each sampled dimension by sampling from the distribution, enabling the identification of the most important variables for constructing an active sub-problem to reduce the search space. A secondary surrogate model, built for the active sub-problem, guides the offspring generation and environmental selection for a modified particle swarm optimization algorithm to effectively explores the sub-space while escaping local optima in large-scale problems. Experimental results on CEC’2013 and CEC’2010 benchmark problems show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in addressing large-scale expensive optimization problems. The efficiency of the proposed method is further verified on CEC’2010 benchmark problems extended to 2000 dimensions.},

  abstract     = {Most existing constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (CMOEAs) experience a dramatic performance degradation when solving large-scale constrained multi-objective optimization problems (LSCMOPs), since they converge very slowly and easily get trapped in local optima due to the loss of diversity. To enhance the efficiency of tackling LSCMOPs, this paper proposes an indicator-based evolutionary algorithm, referred to as ILCMO. In ILCMO, two complementary indicators are proposed to assess the contribution of each individual to feasibility, convergence, and diversity. The first is a feasibility-oriented indicator designed to drive the population towards the feasible regions. The second is an infeasibility-assisted dynamic indicator, which comprises two relaxed constraint boundaries. Theoretical studies demonstrate that this dynamic indicator can effectively guide the population to focus on evenly searching the infeasible regions around feasible solutions to enhance local diversity. In addition, a variable grouping-based differential evolution (VGDE) strategy, which includes a group-based intra-learning operator and a group-based inter-learning operator, is devised to improve the quality of reproduction in large-scale search spaces. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated through comprehensive experiments on four benchmarks and a microgrid dispatch problem against seven state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Since not all quality indicators can capture all these properties, we propose to aggregate already-existing indicators into a single measure informing about the algorithm’s performance from a general perspective. To synthesize the desired quality indicators, we build three composite quality indicators (weak, strong, and mixed) based on the reference point approach. This approach enables the use of desirable value ranges for the aggregated quality indicators, defined by aspiration and reservation levels, that allow knowing which algorithms perform better, within, or worse than the desired limits. Each of the composite quality indicators proposed enables a different compensation degree among the aggregated indicators, and their joint use permits a deep insight into the algorithms’ performance. In addition, we show that the weak and mixed composite indicators are Pareto-compliant, and the strong one is weakly Pareto-compliant if at least one of the aggregated indicators is Pareto-compliant. Finally, we demonstrate the benefits of our proposal when comparing many population-based algorithms on three-, five-, and eight-objective optimization problems.},

With the increasing prevalence of multi-label datasets in real-world problems, MLC has become a popular area of research. These datasets frequently contain irrelevant, redundant, or noisy features, highlighting the importance of feature selection in MLC tasks. As a result, numerous multi-label feature selection (MLFS) approaches have been introduced in the literature. Given their effective search capabilities, evolutionary computation (EC) techniques have been adopted to develop MLFS approaches. However, there is a notable absence of a comprehensive survey dedicated to EC-based MLFS approaches to MLC tasks. Although few attempts have been made to address this gap, they do not provide detailed discussions on EC-based approaches. They also tend to overlook the strengths and weaknesses of existing approaches, especially regarding search, optimization, and evaluation processes. This paper aims to fill this gap by presenting a comprehensive survey of EC-based MLFS approaches, focusing on the latest advancements, current challenges, and future directions. To be specific, we categorize EC-based MLFS approaches based on different criteria and provide detailed descriptions for each category.},

However, it is computationally expensive to always consider the constraint caused by the LLOP in a higher priority because heavy evaluation budgets are required for validating the constraint satisfaction. From this aspect, this paper investigates bilevel evolutionary multi-objective optimization with multiple lower-level search modes (BLEMO-MLS). Assisted by self-learning and reinforcement, BLEMO-MLS could adaptively adjust the priority of considering more on the upper-level objective optimization or the constraint caused by the LLOP. In BLEMO-MLS, three lower-level search modes are designed to handle the constraint caused by the LLOP. The former two search modes have higher priorities on the satisfaction of the constraint caused by the LLOP, where lower-level decisions of solutions are optimized by a hybrid lower-level search method, while the last search mode has a higher priority on the upper-level objective optimization with the constraint caused by the LLOP temporarily ignored. Through self-learning and reinforcement, BLEMO-MLS dynamically selects proper lower-level search modes in the bilevel optimization process, aiming to obtain approximate bilevel Pareto-optimal solutions fulfilling the constraint caused by the LLOP as much as possible. Compared with five existing bilevel evolutionary algorithms, BLEMO-MLS could effectively solve bilevel multi-objective optimization problems with function evaluations saved in both levels.},

In this article, a landscape-aware differential evolution (LADE) algorithm is proposed for MMOPs, which utilizes landscape knowledge to maintain sufficient diversity and provide efficient search guidance. In detail, the landscape knowledge is efficiently utilized in the following three aspects. First, a landscape-aware peak exploration helps each individual evolve adaptively to locate a peak and simulates the regions of the found peaks according to search history to avoid an individual re-locating an already found peak. Second, a landscape-aware peak distinction distinguishes whether an individual locates a new global peak, a new local peak, or an already found peak. Accuracy refinement can thus only be conducted on the global peaks to enhance the search efficiency. Third, a landscape-aware reinitialization specifies the initial position of an individual adaptively according to the distribution and distinction of the found peaks, which helps explore more peaks. The experiments are conducted on the widely-used benchmark MMOPs and multimodal nonlinear equation system problems. Experimental results show that LADE obtains generally better or competitive performance compared with seven well-performing recent algorithms and four winner algorithms in the IEEE CEC competitions for multimodal optimization.},

First, the generalized fuzzy hysteresis (GFH) model is novelly proposed to approximate the hysteresis nonlinearity of the MRF damper. Then, the MSAS model with various fault modes is constructed to study the dynamic performance of the MSAS system under different fault modes. Furthermore, the intermediate estimator is adopted to detect the generation of the sensor and actuator faults. Based on the fault estimation, a reinforcement learning-based fault-tolerant (RLF) controller is proposed to improve the dynamic performance of the MSAS system. Moreover, a double wishbone suspension (DWS) is built to examine the effectiveness of the proposed RLF controller. Experimental results show that the dynamic performance of the MSAS system with the proposed RLF controller is improved in comparison with the MSAS system with the model-based controllers and the passive suspension.},

  abstract     = {In reality, the laborious nature of label annotation leads to the widespread existence of limited labeled data. Moreover, multi-scale data have received widespread attention due to its rich knowledge representation. However, current research on multi-scale data primarily focuses on supervised learning environments, while semi-supervised feature selection for multi-scale data with limited labels remains inadequately explored. Meanwhile, existing studies on multi-scale data often emphasize selecting optimal scales and further conducting feature selection, but this strategy may result in losing potentially valuable information from other scales. To overcome these limitations, by adopting a multi-scale fuzzy information fusion mechanism, this article proposes two new semi-supervised feature selection approaches for multi-scale data with limited labels from both global and local perspectives. Initially, by fusing fuzzy information at various scales, a label learning method is proposed to convert the decision of missing labels into a fuzzy decision of label distribution. Subsequently, label-distributed multi-scale fuzzy global and local rough sets are constructed from global and local perspectives, respectively. Based on the two models, two semi-supervised feature selection algorithms are developed based on global and local multi-scale fuzzy information fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to other advanced feature selection algorithms, the two proposed algorithms can effectively handle multi-scale data with limited labels and exhibit superior classification performance, computational efficiency and robustness.},

To address this issue, source-free domain adaptation has been proposed and subsequently developed. However, privacy risks persist due to potential data leaks from model inversion attacks even when using only source models without accessing the source data directly. Alongside this, another underexplored problem is feature heterogeneity across multiple source domains. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy domain adaptation method, FuzHDA, that learns fuzzy rules from heterogeneous teacher models, even when these models are black boxes. The proposed method first trains heterogeneous source models privately on individual devices without sharing any information, including neither data nor model parameters. Then, using a memory bank that stores all target predictions from the pre-trained source models, we apply a self-knowledge distillation approach to train a target model which simulates the predictions from these heterogeneous source teachers. After completing the target model, a cross-modality hybrid model leveraging prompt learning and uncovering causal factors is fine-tuned via self-supervision at the last step to facilitate transfer performance. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed FuzHDA.},

However, MPSTTs are prone to fuzziness owing to coordinate coupled and Gaussian truncation errors. To address these challenges, we propose a high-precision robust tracker that uses divide-and-conquer multiple-importance Kalman filtering (DCMIKF) via a fuzzy measure. Specifically, we designed coupling maneuver models and attached their model-truth probabilities as a fuzzy set. The measurements-to-target data association was then formulated as a fuzzy maxima searching problem with soft spatiotemporal causal constraints. The proposed approach enables the integration of all available information to derive the fuzzy measure, dividing the hybrid state estimation into variable-structure model estimation and model-conditioned filtering. Simultaneously, DCMIKF combines importance prediction with constrained convex measurement updating using KF and fuses the outputs via fuzzy model probability. Besides, it offers a purely mathematical approach for quantifying the average fuzziness yielded from the fuzzy set, thereby smoothing the mismatches between multi-likelihoods, proposal distribution, and target posterior. Simulated and measured results conformed well; compared with the regression Gaussian process motion tracker, DCMIKF overcame the prior hypotheses in machine learning, reducing the problematic cubic complexity in the number of time steps to the linear time complexity; compared to the interacting multiple model minimax particle filter, DCMIKF significantly improves filtering accuracy and tracking robustness.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a hybrid control approach that integrates an adaptive fuzzy mechanism with an event-triggered impulse strategy to address consensus control challenges in nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) with uncertain information, both in leader and leaderless scenarios. Firstly, a fuzzy logic-based adaptive control mechanism is proposed to handle system nonlinearity and uncertainty. This mechanism dynamically adjusts fuzzy control rules in real time, enabling the system to adapt to changing conditions and enhancing its robustness against nonlinear disturbances. Secondly, to alleviate communication overhead and reduce control frequency, an event-triggered impulse strategy is implemented. This strategy activates impulse control only under specific conditions, effectively minimizing control actions while maintaining system consensus. Using Lyapunov stability theory, sufficient conditions for achieving system consensus are established, demonstrating the global consensus and robustness of the MASs under certain criteria. Finally, numerical simulations and experimental evaluations validate the proposed method&#39;s effectiveness and its practical advantages.},

  abstract     = {This study is devoted to the observer-based sliding mode control (SMC) for discrete nonlinear semi-Markov jump models with incomplete sojourn information and application to the quarter-car suspension model. The nonlinear plant with parameter uncertainty is represented by an interval type-2 fuzzy model, where the membership functions of the fuzzy rules are related to the system mode. Since sojourn information is challenging to obtain in practice, the sojourn time probability density function is considered to be incompletely available. The considered system is more general, not only relaxing the traditional assumption that all the sojourn time probability density functions are completely available but also covering completely available sojourn time probability density functions as a special case. The main innovation is that an observer-based SMC scheme is designed, which makes the discrete nonlinear models have better dynamic performance, and realizes the reachability of discrete quasi-sliding mode. By the interval type-2 fuzzy and classical Lyapunov function, the mean-square stability criterion of the semi-Markov jump models is constructed employing additional matrix variables. Then, an observer-based SMC mechanism is constructed to achieve the reachability of the quasi-sliding mode. Ultimately, the proposed method is validated by a two-degree-freedom quarter-car suspension model.},

Consider the nonlinearity and uncertainty of ASSs, the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy theory is applied to address these issues. In order to model various potential operating behaviors of the system, a high-order multi-switching- mode (HOMSM) T-S fuzzy control scheme is constructed, in which a series of free-weighted matrix sets are developed for different switching modes, such that the conservatism of controller design is reduced to a certain extent. By designing the HOMSM control method, a certain level of resistance to randomly activated DoS attacks can be achieved. With the help of homogeneous polynomial technology, several time-varying balance matrices (TVBMs) are constructed for extracting the properties of different switching modes. Then, the exponential stability conditions of ASSs under DoS attacks can be derived, and the $H_{\infty }$ performance criterion is guaranteed.

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a novel extension of the multivariate variational mode decomposition (MVMD) method, termed fuzzy MVMD (FMVMD), designed to enhance alignment information extraction. In contrast to MVMD, FMVMD focuses on capturing finer alignment details by leveraging fuzzy clustering techniques. The proposed FMVMD algorithm proceeds through the following steps: Firstly, FMVMD employs a modified clustering algorithm, termed fuzzy C-means (FCM), to categorize sub-modes within each channel into fuzzy clusters based on their contribution to common center frequencies. Secondly, a variational optimization model is formulated, extending the principles of MVMD to accommodate the fuzzy clustering approach used in FMVMD. Finally, an optimization technique called the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is employed to derive the optimal solution for the FMVMD model. Experimental results show that FMVMD achieves a 41% and 28% improvement in center frequency alignment performance compared to MVMD when using two and three fuzzy clusters, respectively, and a 13% improvement compared to GMVMD with the same number of clusters. Under a 25dB SNR condition, FMVMD demonstrates a noise resistance improvement of 44% and 24% compared to MVMD with two and three fuzzy clusters, respectively, and a 37% improvement compared to GMVMD. Validation using EEG data in the forms of bipolar leads and common average reference confirms the effectiveness of FMVMD, achieving consistently favorable results.},

However, reliably utilizing the minimal point-wise annotations for unlabeled data in complex and large-scale scenes is still challenging, such as only 20 points labeled in 2 million points. To tackle this challenge, we propose a new Uncertainty-aware Superpoint Graph Transformer (UaSGT) framework that utilizes minimal annotations for unlabeled data learning through reliable long-range supervision propagation from labeled superpoints to unlabeled superpoints. First, we propose a superpoint graph transformer to achieve long-range supervision propagation along the attention-based fuzzy subsets defined on superpoints. The attention-based fuzzy subset measures the membership of unlabeled superpoints to clusters centered on labeled superpoints. Second, we employ an uncertainty-aware membership rectification technique on the fuzzy subset to ensure reliable propagation among superpoints within the same category. This technique integrates an uncertainty prediction module to mask the influence of unreliable membership and a spatial prior refinement module to reduce uncertainty in intra-class membership degrees. Finally, experimental results on two large-scale benchmarks S3DIS and ScanNet-V2 demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to the state-of-the-art with at least 90% annotation reduction, and our method also achieves comparable performance to fully supervised methods with less than 0.1% labeled points.

  abstract     = {Broad learning system (BLS) is renowned for its excellent generalization and high efficiency in data classification. However, when confronted with class imbalance problems, BLS treats all samples as equally important, resulting in performance degradation. Additionally, the presence of noise and outliers in imbalanced data further complicates BLS&#39;s ability to handle real-world classification problems. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Graph-Embedding Intuitionistic Fuzzy Adaptive Broad Learning System (GEIB). The graph embedding strategy proposed by GEIB leverages the geometric topology of the data and class-specific information, effectively capturing variability among imbalanced samples and improving class separability. Furthermore, we introduce intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) theory. The BLS integrated with it considers both the homogeneity and heterogeneity of sample neighborhoods, enabling it to address uncertainty and imprecision in the data. It further differentiates clean samples from noisy ones in imbalanced datasets, thereby enhancing model robustness. To further investigate the prior distribution information of imbalanced data, we design an adaptive class-specific penalty mechanism based on global distribution and local density information. This mechanism accounts for both intra- and interclass density information and class global distribution. We verify the superiority of our method by conducting a comparison with current approaches using real-world datasets that include both Gaussian noise and noise-free versions.},

  abstract     = {The secondary membership functions (MFs) of type-2 (T2) fuzzy sets (FSs) are generally assumed to be convex, normal, and upper semicontinuous. Although not explicitly stated, this fact can be detected by taking a look at the $\alpha$-cuts of their join and meet in vertical-slice format. These two operations induce $[0,1]_\mathcal {F}$, i.e., the complete lattice of the convex normal upper semicontinuous FSs on $[0, 1]$ together with the so-called convolution order. In this paper, we deduce the $\alpha$-cut representations of suprema and infima over finite and infinite sets that occur in the inference mechanisms of general type-2 (GT2) fuzzy inference systems (FISs). We continue by developing a complete, albeit not distributive, lattice structure for the class of all convex upper semicontinuous FSs on $[0, 1]$, denoted $\mathcal {F}_{CU}$, that permits designing T2 FISs involving T2 FSs whose secondary MFs are not necessarily normal. Using our formulae of the $\alpha$-cuts of suprema and infima in $[0,1]_\mathcal {F}$ and $\mathcal {F}_{CU}$, whose elements we describe using so-called anti-dilations, we prove that $[0,1]_\mathcal {F}$ is a closed sublattice of $\mathcal {F}_{CU}$. We also expand on the lattice-theoretical relations between $[0,1]_\mathcal {F}$ and the complete lattices of the convex (strictly) normal FSs. In addition, we show that $[0,1]_\mathcal {F}$ and $\mathcal {F}_{CU}$ contain complete sublattices of (extended) interval type-2 (IT2) FSs. With these results at hand, it becomes easy to perform the transitions FISs under the minimm t-norm $\to$ (closed) IT2 FISs $\to$ GT2 FISs currently used in practice $\to$ GT2 FISs having not necessarily normal secondary MFs.},

Firstly, an adaptive event-triggered mechanism (ETM) that utilizes the average filtering error to adaptively adjust the triggered threshold is proposed to mitigate network congestion. In contrast to the existing filtering achievements, the proposed adaptive ETM considers the impact of filtering error on data transmission which can achieve the effect of saving more communication resources. Then, an interval stability theory is applied to adjust the filter gains for achieving the purposes of changing the convergence speed of the FES and improving the $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ performance. Moreover, under the conditions of imperfect communication links, sufficient criteria for designing the $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ filter with adjustable gains are obtained based on the interval stability theory and linear matrix inequalities technique.

Recent research shows that one remote air traffic control officer can safely control up to three low-traffic airports simultaneously.

The main task of the supervisor in such a center is balancing the workload of each air traffic control officer by allocating airports accordingly. This study analyzes the supervisor&#39;s visual attention during interaction with a planning tool for their daily tasks. Five use cases were identified as the main tasks of the supervisor representing a mixture of planned and unplanned events. A mixed methods within-subjects design was used to assess the workload and eye-movement patterns associated with each of these use cases. In total, 15 professional air traffic control officers participated in the study. Workload and eye movement were analyzed independently in relation to the use cases but also in combination with each other. Across all use cases, a small correlation between subjective workload ratings and fixation duration was found, supporting previous findings of fixation duration being associated with information processing. Transitions between areas of interest on the supervisor planning tool provided valuable insights into the layout design of future supervisor planning tools.},

The proposed metric incorporates advanced transformer-based attention mechanisms to assess local similarity and maximum mean discrepancy to evaluate global distributional similarity. To evaluate the performance of GLIPS, we conducted a human study on photorealistic image quality. Comprehensive tests across various generative models demonstrate that GLIPS consistently outperforms existing metrics like FID, structural similarity index measure, and multiscale structural similarity index measure in terms of correlation with human scores. In addition, we introduce the interpolative binning scale, a refined scaling method that enhances the interpretability of metric scores by aligning them more closely with human evaluative standards.

This article presents a novel fuzzy adaptive controller that utilizes a high-dimensional integral-type Lyapunov function for a wearable assistive upper limb exoskeleton. A disturbance observer had been used to tackle uncertainties in the exoskeleton&#39;s dynamic model, thereby enhancing the tracking performance of the joints. The aim of this control scheme was to overcome unknown parameters in the dynamic model. The performance of the adaptive controller was validated through human interactive experiments and periodically repeated reference trajectory tests. The results demonstrated that the proposed fuzzy adaptive controller, with the inclusion of a disturbance observer, could effectively compensate for uncertain disturbances and could achieve efficient tracking of the reference trajectory. The statistical analysis revealed that the fuzzy adaptive controller performed 45% , 44% , and 31% less in average error compared to adaptive conventional controllers. The findings ascertained the potential of the proposed controller in improving the recovery of motor functions of hemiplegic patients.},

  abstract     = {Neural or muscular injuries, such as due to amputation, spinal cord injury, and stroke, can affect hand functions, profoundly impacting independent living. This has motivated the advancement of cutting-edge assistive robotic hands. However, unintuitive myoelectric control of these devices remains challenging, which limits the clinical translation of these devices. Accordingly, we developed a robust motor-intent decoding approach to continuously predict the intended fingertip forces of single and multiple fingers in real time. We used population motor neuron discharge activities (i.e., neural drive from brain to spinal cord) decoded from a high-density surface electromyogram (HD-sEMG) signals as the control signals instead of the conventional global sEMG features. To enable real-time neural-drive prediction, we employed a convolutional neural network model to establish the mapping from global HD-sEMG features to finger-specific neural-drive signals, which were then employed for continuous and real-time control of three prosthetic fingers (index, middle, and ring). As a result, the neural-drive-based approach can decode the motor intent of single-finger and multifinger forces with significantly lower force estimation errors than that obtained using the global HD-sEMG-amplitude approach. Besides, the force prediction accuracy was consistent over time and demonstrated strong robustness to signal interference. Our network-based decoder can also achieve better finger isolation with minimal forces predicted in unintended fingers. Our work demonstrates that the accurate and robust finger force control could be achieved through this new decoding approach. The outcomes offer an efficient intent prediction approach that allows users to have intuitive control of prosthetic fingertip forces in a dexterous way.},

We conducted HRC experiments where participants performed assembly tasks while the robot&#39;s behavior was systematically varied. Participants&#39; subjective responses (including surprise, anxiety, boredom, calmness, and comfortability ratings) were collected alongside physiological signals, including electrocardiogram, galvanic skin response, and pupillometry data. We propose two novel approaches for estimating CI/UnCI: an adaptation of the emotion circumplex model that maps comfort levels to the arousal–valence space, and a kernel density estimation model trained on physiological data. Time-domain features were extracted from the physiological signals and used to train machine learning models for real-time comfort levels estimation. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approaches can effectively estimate human comfort levels from physiological signals alone, with the circumplex model showing particular promise in detecting high discomfort states. This work enables real-time measurement of human comfort during HRC, providing a foundation for developing more adaptive and human-aware collaborative robots.},

  abstract     = {Ecological environment and natural resource issues are becoming more and more prominent, which promotes the recycling of waste products for green economy. Disassembly plays a key role in the remanufacturing and reuse of waste products. However, with the rapid development of production automation, designers tend to ignore the fact that manual operation is more flexible. It is of great importance to consider human factors in a disassembly process. This work considers two human disassembly postures, namely standing and sitting. The multiobjective disassembly line balancing problem considering human posture changes is studied. A mathematical model with the objective functions of maximizing profit, minimizing the number of posture changes at a workstation, and minimizing the difference of maximum posture changes between any two workstations is established. The model is solved through a newly proposed Pareto-based discrete harmony search algorithm. Three neighborhood structures are designed to enlarge the search space for better solutions. Furthermore, an elite reserve strategy is used to improve the global optimization ability of the proposed algorithm. Finally, the proposed model and algorithm are applied to cases of different scales of complexities, and the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm is verified in comparison with four competitive algorithms.},

  abstract     = {This article introduces a novel prescribed time-based method for analyzing the convergence of evolutionary game dynamics in an information lossy network. Traditional game theory limits players to two choices, i.e., either cooperation or defection. However, player behavior in real-world scenarios is often multidimensional and complex; therefore, this work employs a continuous action iterated dilemma that allows players to choose a wider range of strategies. Moreover, traditional convergence analysis often relies on Jacobian matrices, which entail complex derivations. In contrast, the proposed strategy employs a time generator-based protocol that achieves agreement between all the players at a prescribed time, explicitly set by the user through a time parameter within the protocol. A comprehensive Lyapunov analysis affirms the prescribed time convergence even when the network is exposed to information loss during data transfer. Numerical simulations illustrate that the proposed scheme leads to a faster agreement at the preassigned time and with a better resilience performance compared to existing methods.},

Monthly clinical visits were scheduled to monitor workers’ health. Effectiveness, usability and acceptance metrics were collected at the beginning of the study and after six months. No side effects were found in clinical metrics during the study. Significant reductions, consistent overtime, were observed in shoulder muscle activity (up to 30%) and in effort perception-related metrics (up to 2.4 out of 10 points). Usage time settled around 10% of the monthly work-shift and gradually decreased possibly due to external factors (e.g., social, motivational, and seasonal factors) beyond researchers&#39; control.

We determined that wearing exoskeletons reduced the biomechanical efforts of workers measured by joint kinematics and electromyography as well as the estimated shoulder joint reaction forces and torques derived from simulation. These quantitatively measured variables were statistically associated with subjective measures collected through satisfaction questionnaires. We specifically found that participants increased the shoulder flexion and abduction angles as well as the shoulder range of motion while wearing exoskeletons. Participants also reduced muscle activities, joint torques for shoulder flexion, and reaction forces exerted on the shoulder joints while wearing exoskeletons. Interestingly, our analysis also found that the increased shoulder movement while wearing the device was negatively associated with the satisfaction level. This indicates that although the assistance provided by the device allows users to perform a wider range of arm lifting movements, the deviation from their original movement with the device may lead to decreases in satisfaction levels. This integrative approach using biomechanics and ergonomics suggests that we can potentially predict the subjective scale of satisfaction based on biomechanical variables and preliminarily evaluate the usability and comfort while wearing exoskeletons in real-world settings.},

  abstract     = {Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in Wi-Fi-based gesture recognition. However, existing works have predominantly focused on closed-set paradigms, where all testing gestures are predefined during training. This poses a significant challenge in real-world applications, as unseen gestures might be misclassified as known class during testing. To address this issue, we propose WiOpen, a robust Wi-Fi-based open-set gesture recognition (OSGR) framework. Implementing OSGR requires addressing challenges caused by the unique uncertainty in Wi-Fi sensing. This uncertainty, resulting from noise and domains, leads to widely scattered and irregular data distributions in collected Wi-Fi sensing data. Consequently, data ambiguity between classes and challenges in defining appropriate decision boundaries to identify unknowns arise. To tackle these challenges, WiOpen adopts a twofold approach to eliminate uncertainty and define precise decision boundaries. Initially, it addresses uncertainty induced by noise during data preprocessing by utilizing the channel state information (CSI) ratio. Next, it designs the OSGR network based on an uncertainty quantification method. Throughout the learning process, this network effectively mitigates uncertainty stemming from domains. Ultimately, the network leverages relationships among samples&#39; neighbors to dynamically define open-set decision boundaries, successfully realizing OSGR. Comprehensive experiments on publicly accessible datasets confirm WiOpen&#39;s effectiveness.},

Therefore, this article proposes a miner mental state evaluation scheme with decision-level fusion based on multidomain EEG information. First, in the comprehensive lab for coal-related programs of Xi&#39;an University of Science and Technology, the coal mine environment is simulated, and a realistic EEG dataset is constructed. Second, the multidomain features are extracted to represent abundant information in time, frequency, time-frequency, and space domain. These features with low dimension are classified adopting support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (kNN), and back propagation (BP) network to obtain the optimal evaluation submodel (four domains corresponding to four submodels). Finally, based on the state probabilities provided by the optimal evaluation submodel, we adopt stack fusion and an improved Yager rule to fuse four submodels in order to find the most suitable fusion algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that the average accuracy can reach 93.19% on the self-built dataset when utilizing the improved Yager rule with weight, and it realizes a better evaluation accuracy.},

Then, the information granule can be constructed based on the time domain information, which completes complexity information. Together with the support vector machine algorithm, the proposed granulation method outperformed the existing classification methods in accuracy. It is utilized by classifying three motor imaginary EEG signals. Two of them are binary-class datasets, i.e., one dataset includes two-hand actions, and another includes hand and foot actions. The third dataset is multiclass, including two hands and two feet actions.

To tackle the problems, we present ISCMVD, an Instruction Stream-augmented CFG-based Malware Variant Detection scheme, melding control flow structures with machine semantic information from instruction streams within blocks to build a comprehensive functional representation for variants’ basic and detailed behaviors. Leveraging a global-enhanced attentive graph neural network to integrate local and global functional features, we significantly boost the capture of representative stable primary behaviors’ similarity from variants within the same family identifying variants generated under attackers’ code rewriting, module modification, and other transformation means. Additionally, through cross-family associative analysis, we eliminate classification interference of variants’ logic similarities stemming from the same organization generating. Evaluation results on public and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority and robustness of ISCMVD with an average of 99.29% in AC and 99.25% in F1 and perform well even in few-shot cases. What’s more important, we achieve a breakthrough in two special sample sets including variants related to MaaS and APT group, and outperform state-of-the-art methods under the current variant generation mechanism, proving its suitability for future trends.},

As a result, functional encryption (FE) is introduced into the field of privacy-preserving FL (PPFL) for boosting efficiency and enhancing security. Nevertheless, existing FE-based PPFL frameworks that support dynamic participation either required a trusted third party that may lead to single-point failure, or require multiple rounds of interaction that inevitably incur large communication overhead. Therefore, we propose PrivLDFL, a lightweight and dynamic PPFL framework for resource-constrained devices. Technically, we formalize dynamic decentralized multi-client FE and give instantiations, then present efficiency optimizations via designing a vector compression funnel based on Chinese Remainder Theorem, and finally achieve client dropouts via a client partitioning strategy. Besides formal security analysis on PrivLDFL, we implement it and state-of-the-art solutions on Raspberry Pi to conduct extensive experiments, confirming the practical performance of PrivLDFL on best-known public datasets.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach for collaboratively training machine learning models while preserving data privacy. Due to its decentralized nature, FL is vulnerable to poisoning attacks, where malicious clients compromise the global model through altered data or updates. Identifying such malicious clients is crucial for ensuring the integrity of FL systems. This task becomes particularly challenging under privacy-enhancing protocols such as secure aggregation, creating a fundamental trade-off between privacy and security. In this work, we propose FedGT, a novel framework designed to identify malicious clients in FL with secure aggregation while preserving privacy. Drawing inspiration from group testing, FedGT leverages overlapping groups of clients to identify the presence of malicious clients via a decoding operation. The clients identified as malicious are then removed from the model training, which is performed over the remaining clients. By choosing the size, number, and overlap between groups, FedGT strikes a balance between privacy and security. Specifically, the server learns the aggregated model of the clients in each group—vanilla federated learning and secure aggregation correspond to the extreme cases of FedGT with group size equal to one and the total number of clients, respectively. The effectiveness of FedGT is demonstrated through extensive experiments on three datasets in a cross-silo setting under different data-poisoning attacks. These experiments showcase FedGT’s ability to identify malicious clients, resulting in high model utility. We further show that FedGT significantly outperforms the private robust aggregation approach based on the geometric median recently proposed by Pillutla et al. and the robust aggregation technique Multi-Krum in multiple settings.},

To protect privacy, plenty of methods have been proposed to change identity in the face, thus blocking malicious face recognition. However, these methods fail to satisfy authentication requirements for special application scenarios, e.g., face authentication in surveillance capture. In this paper, we propose a novel face privacy protection model, which supports robust image authentication via information-conditional identity transformation. Specifically, we first introduce a basic face manipulation model (FMM), which can preserve identity-irrelevant attributes when manipulating identity. Based on FMM, we further design a lightweight protector called AIDPro, outputting a transformed identity which is different from the original one and is embedded a message presenting authentication information. Benefiting from the semantic robustness, our model does not require noise layers to achieve accurate message extraction after various image distortions. In addition, the message can be the condition to guide the identity transformation for privacy protection, which avoids extra resource consumption from supporting image authentication. Extensive experimental results demonstrate our model has comparable privacy protection performance, superior attribute preservation performance, and robust authentication performance especially in JPEG compression and screen shooting.

  abstract     = {In privacy-preserving machine learning with vertically distributed data, private entity alignment methods are used to securely match and utilize features of the same samples. However, existing methods not only risk exposing sample intersections and introducing unnecessary samples but also face a gap in adapting to multi-party scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose PEAFOWL, a novel multi-party private entity alignment protocol. PEAFOWL achieves entity alignment among multiple parties through a mapping from original datasets to intersections, termed permutation. This method mitigates intersection disclosure and sample redundancy concerns by avoiding direct use of the intersection. The proposed protocol leverages a cloud server that utilizes secret-shared shuffle to protect the privacy of the permutation, in case of colluding data providers reconstructing intersections. Further, by integrating a seed homomorphic pseudorandom generator, PEAFOWL avoids the intensive communication of secret sharing and achieves superior runtime performance. Additionally, an offline/online variant is introduced to ensure a linear growth in communication and computation complexity relative to the dataset size by pre-computing permutation calculations. Implemented on a real PPML framework, the protocol demonstrates practical efficiency in various multi-party settings. Experimental results indicate that PEAFOWL’s overhead is less than 1% of the total training cost, while the offline/online variant achieves approximately a 50% reduction in online runtime. Overall, PEAFOWL offers an efficient and straightforward solution for multi-party PPML, making it an attractive option for implementation and future improvements.},

As a case study, we design, implement, and evaluate masked DES cores. We focus on first-order secure Boolean masking and do not aim for provable security. Our goal is a practically relevant trade-off between area, latency, randomness cost, and security. We provide two low-cost solutions. Our first solution focuses on strong security while simultaneously aiming for low implementation costs. The resulting DES engine shows no evidence of first-order leakage in a non-specific leakage assessment with 50M traces. Our second solution follows the opposite approach: we focus on lowering implementation costs, latency to be specific, while not sacrificing much on security. Our low-latency DES engine exhibits signs of first-order leakage only after approximately 15M traces.},

  abstract     = {Federated Learning (FL) is an alternative approach that facilitates training machine learning models on distributed users’ data while preserving privacy. However, clients have different local model structures and most local data are non-independent and identically distributed, so that FL encounters heterogeneity and catastrophic forgetting issues when clients continuously accumulate new knowledge. In this work, we propose a scheme called MUFTI (Multi-Domain Distillation-based Heterogeneous Federated ConTInuous Learning). On one hand, we have extended domain adaptation to FL via extracting features to obtain feature representations on unlabeled public datasets for collaborative training, narrowing the distance between feature outputs of different models under the same sample. On the other hand, we propose a combining knowledge distillation method to solve the catastrophic forgetting issue. Within a single task, dual-domain distillation is used to avoid data forgetting between different domains; for cross task learning in task flow, the logits output of the previous model is used as the teacher to avoid forgetting old tasks. The experiment results showed that MUFTI had a better performance in accuracy and robustness comparing to state-of-the-art methods. The evaluation also demonstrated that MUFTI could perform well in handling task increment issues, reducing catastrophic forgetting, and achieving trade-offs between multiple objectives.},

  abstract     = {Visible-infrared person re-identification (V-I ReID) seeks to retrieve images of the same individual captured over a distributed network of RGB and IR sensors. Several V-I ReID approaches directly integrate the V and I modalities to represent images within a shared space. However, given the significant gap in the data distributions between V and I modalities, cross-modal V-I ReID remains challenging. A solution is to involve a privileged intermediate space to bridge between modalities, but in practice, such data is not available and requires selecting or creating effective mechanisms for informative intermediate domains. This paper introduces the Adaptive Generation of Privileged Intermediate Information (AGPI2) training approach to adapt and generate a virtual domain that bridges discriminative information between the V and I modalities. AGPI2 enhances the training of a deep V-I ReID backbone by generating and then leveraging bridging privileged information without modifying the model in the inference phase. This information captures shared discriminative attributes that are not easily ascertainable for the model within individual V or I modalities. Towards this goal, a non-linear generative module is trained with adversarial objectives, transforming V attributes into intermediate spaces that also contain I features. This domain exhibits less domain shift relative to the I domain compared to the V domain. Meanwhile, the embedding module within AGPI2 aims to extract discriminative modality-invariant features for both modalities by leveraging modality-free descriptors from generated images, making them a bridge between the main modalities. Experiments conducted on challenging V-I ReID datasets indicate that AGPI2 consistently increases matching accuracy without additional computational resources during inference.},

The improvement of SKG rate is quite a huge challenge, especially in scenarios with untrusted internal helpers or eavesdroppers that aim to wiretap the negotiated secret keys between legitimate parties. In this paper, we propose a token-based SKG scheme to deal with the problem of information leakage with internal eavesdropping attacks. The basic idea is to cover random pilots with protective tokens to confuse eavesdroppers. Three scenarios including passive external eavesdropping, active internal eavesdropping with a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted untrusted helper, and active internal eavesdropping with an untrusted relay are considered and analyzed to evaluate the performance of the proposed anti-eavesdropping scheme. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed token-based SKG scheme can perfectly secure the key negotiation, achieving zero information leakage even in the untrusted relaying scenario without a direct link between Alice and Bob. Moreover, closed-form expressions for secret key capacity (SKC) are obtained. Finally, numerical results indicate that the proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Using a token-generation mapping function with greater diversity in amplitude and phase, our approach achieves enhanced SKC performance across various scenarios, including those with a passive eavesdropper, a RIS-assisted untrusted helper, and an untrusted relay.},

Consequently, Hamster achieves linear throughput gains as the number of nodes increases, surpassing Sync HotStuff. Additionally, with minor modifications, Hamster can operate effectively in mobile sluggish environments, further reducing its dependency on strict synchrony. We implement Hamster, and experimental results highlight its performance advantages. Specifically, Hamster achieves 2.5× the throughput of Sync HotStuff in a network of 9 nodes, with this gain growing to 10× as the network scales to 65 nodes.

  abstract     = {UAV surveillance offers a unique aerial perspective, enabling the monitoring of large areas and capturing targets from angles that fixed ground cameras cannot achieve. UAV-based object re-identification (ReID) differs from the extensively studied city camera scenarios, as it involves identifying specific objects in aerial images captured from a dynamic bird’s-eye view. The challenge lies in the significant variation in object perspectives and the often uncertain rotational changes captured by UAVs. Existing ReID methods designed for city cameras struggle to adapt to these rotational variations. To address these challenges, we propose a Transformer-based learnable rotation generalization enhancement method specifically for UAV-based ReID. To improve the model’s adaptability to uncertain rotational changes, we introduce a learnable feature-level rotation simulation technique that generates multiple rotated features. Building on this, we design a rotation diversification loss to decorrelate different rotated features, ensuring a rich feature representation. Additionally, to mitigate the negative effects of image-level rotation augmentation, we propose instance-level and distribution-level rotation invariance regularization. This approach establishes explicit associations between images and their rotated counterparts, facilitating the learning of visually consistent rotation-invariant features. Instance-level constraints ensure that detailed features remain consistent during rotation, while distribution-level constraints maintain the model’s semantic understanding. Notably, our method demonstrates strong versatility, covering a wide range of objects, including persons, vehicles, and various animals. Evaluations on multiple UAV-collected person and vehicle ReID datasets, as well as several animal datasets, consistently show outstanding performance, underscoring its robustness and adaptability to the unique challenges posed by UAV-based ReID.},

However, a few efforts have been made to adequately utilize these features for mining identity information. To address this issue, we propose a Region-Specific Network (RSNet) for contactless palm vein authentication. Our RSNet is a dual-branch structure for global and local feature extraction. Firstly, a Region-based Local feature Enhancement Block (RLEB) is proposed at the local branch to extract region-specific features. In the RLEB, the intermediate feature maps are divided into three asymmetrical patches based on the physiological characteristics of palm vein and palm shape for extracting diversified features, enhancing the local feature representation. Then, a Multi-scale Aggregation Block (MAB) is proposed that efficiently aggregates multi-scale features at a more granular level. Furthermore, to guide the global and local branches in learning complementary feature aspects, a difference loss is introduced to apply a soft subspace orthogonality constraint between the global and local vectors during training. The global branch is designed to assist the learning process of local features, without being adopted for inference. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of our method, and the RSNet achieves new State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) authentication performance on seven public contactless palm vein databases in the open-set scenario.},

Therefore, many research lines on functional encryption have been suggested and studied on how to calculate the maximum similarity while ensure the privacy of users’ data. Unfortunately, all of them will divulge some intermediate results to the web platform server when processing this issue. In this paper we present a new functional encryption scheme supporting privacy-preserving maximum similarity, which enables the web service platforms to figure out the maximum similarity without learning anything else about their data. Moreover, we provide a formal analysis to prove the security of the proposed scheme, followed by some experimental evaluations and comprehensive comparisons with the related works.

While traditional encryption methods offer protection for data at rest and in transit, they fall short when it comes to where it matters the most, i.e., during data processing. To address this limitation, we present HELM, a framework for privacy-preserving data processing using homomorphic encryption. HELM automatically transforms arbitrary programs expressed in a Hardware Description Language (HDL), such as Verilog, into equivalent homomorphic circuits, which can then be efficiently evaluated using encrypted inputs. HELM features three modes of encrypted evaluation: a) a gate mode that consists of Boolean gates, b) a small-precision lookup table mode which significantly reduces the size of the circuit by combining multiple gates into lookup tables, and c) a high-precision lookup table mode tuned for multibit arithmetic evaluations. Finally, HELM introduces a scheduler that leverages the parallelism inherent in arithmetic and Boolean circuits to efficiently evaluate encrypted programs. We evaluate HELM with the ISCAS’85 and ISCAS’89 benchmark suites, as well as real-world applications such as image filtering and neural network inference. In our experimental results, we report that HELM can outperform prior works by up to 65×.},

This paper delves into an unexplored security threat concerning applying similarity metrics, such as the L2 norm, Euclidean distance, and cosine similarity, in protecting FL. We first uncover the deficiencies of similarity metrics that high-dimensional local models, including benign and poisoned models, may be evaluated to have the same similarity while being significantly different in the parameter values. We then leverage this finding to devise a novel untargeted model poisoning attack, Faker, which launches the attack by simultaneously maximizing the evaluated similarity of the poisoned local model and the difference in the parameter values. Experimental results based on seven datasets and eight defenses show that Faker outperforms the state-of-the-art benchmark attacks by 1.1-9.0X in reducing accuracy and 1.2-8.0X in saving time cost, which even holds for the case of a single malicious client with limited knowledge about the FL system. Moreover, Faker can degrade the performance of the global model by attacking only once. We also preliminarily explore extending Faker to other attacks, such as backdoor attacks and Sybil attacks. Lastly, we provide a model evaluation strategy, called the similarity of partial parameters (SPP), to defend against Faker. Given that numerous mechanisms in FL utilize similarity metrics to assess local models, this work suggests that we should be vigilant regarding the potential risks of using these metrics.},

The rollup, a well-known Layer 2 scaling protocol, uses an aggregate signature scheme based on the succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge (SNARG) to package transactions. The further promotion of rollup faces the challenge of balancing computation efficiency and communication costs. In addition, with the continuous development of quantum computing, a transition to post-quantum cryptography is considered crucial for long-term security. Our main contribution is an aggregate Falcon signature scheme for post-quantum rollup based on a novel SNARG scheme. The proposed SNARG is based on the Plonkish circuit with enhanced custom gates, referred to as the ECG circuit, and a post-quantum multilinear polynomial commitment scheme (PolyCom). The former can represent more complex operations while also controlling the witness scale. The latter realizes quantum-resistant security for the proposed SNARG and the aggregate signature. In comparison to the aggregate signature based on Orion, our scheme achieves lower aggregation and communication costs. Performance analysis indicates a 38% decrease in aggregation time and a 88% decrease in communication costs. As an additional contribution, we introduce a novel polynomial interactive oracle proof (PolyIOP) protocol for the ECG circuit, which can combine with a multilinear PolyCom scheme to form a SNARG protocol with lower computation and communication overhead compared to existing schemes.},

Our proposed architecture combines four cryptography-based defense mechanisms: Nonce-Based Process Authentication (NBPA), Hash-Based Field Integrity (HBFI), Hash-Based Field Availability (HBFA), and Hash-Based Row Availability (HBRA). This novel architecture is designed to detect a predefined comprehensive attack model on server-side data tailored for an HSM-based architecture. The implementation results show that the throughput decrease is mostly manageable (14% for NBPA, 30-50% for HBFI, 25% for HBFA, and 43.74% for the combination of all mechanisms), with the indication that some mechanisms are more or less appropriate depending on the situation. Moreover, the HBRA mechanism performed well regarding the attack detection time (5 minutes for a database of 1000 entries).},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the fundamental limits of covert communications covered by randomly activated overt users in both single-frame and multi-frame transmission scenarios. While traditional covert communications mainly consider concealing signal power characteristics, the existence of overt users provides opportunities such that covert communications can be achieved through the confusion between the users. This benefit is first revealed in single-frame transmission scenario. The major obstacle in analyzing performance limits is that the conventional Kullback-Leibler divergence based covertness measurement becomes infinite. To overcome the intractability, a tighter upper bound of the total variation distance (TVD) is then developed using a novel recursive-iterative approximation. On this basis, the collapse effect of the TVD is derived, which shows that the TVD is strictly less than 1 if the covert user sets the transmit power to be an integer multiple of that of the overt users. Then, we find that O(N)-bit information can be transmitted over N channel uses under the above setting, which breaks the well-known square root law. If the above setting is violated, the TVD instantly approaches 1 as N → ∞, and only O(√N)-bit information can be covertly transmitted. To prove this, the detection method of the warden is modified to cope with the random activation of overt users. These conclusions also hold for the transmission with uncertain powers or in fading channels, which resembles realistic wireless transmissions. In multi-frame transmission scenario, however, the access characteristics of overt users can be exposed from a statistical perspective, such that the rate gain disappears and the covert transmission rate drops to O(√N) bits per frame. To obtain a positive covert transmission rate, we propose a ratesplitting based covert transmission scheme that introduces an opportunistic access branch to bring randomness, through which the covert user can transmit up to O(NL)-bit information over L frames.},

  abstract     = {In the reversible data hiding (RDH) community, both prediction and mapping strategies are vital for reducing distortion. With high prediction performance, small prediction errors can be generated to reduce the embedding distortion. Besides, the efficient mapping strategy can improve the practicality. In this paper, we propose a new RDH method for color images by using convolution neural networks (CNNs) for prediction and an efficient 3D mapping strategy for embedding. At first, each color image is elaborately divided into three isolated image sets so that the proposed deep prediction network (DPN) can exploit more neighboring pixels in the current channel and the correlation between three channels. Then, an efficient 3D mapping strategy is luminously designed by using the symmetry of the 3D prediction error histogram (PEH). The symmetry of 3D PEH has been analyzed in statistical and experimental ways. Based on the proposed deep prediction network and efficient 3D mapping strategy (DPEM), we construct an efficient RDH method for color images. The performance of the proposed DPN is evaluated by comparing it with several predictors on different image datasets. The embedding performance has been demonstrated by hiding information in color images, e.g., the average PSNR value of the Kodak dataset is 63.63 dB with an embedding capacity of 50,000 bits. Furthermore, the experimental results on the ImageNet and PASCAL VOC2012 datasets have shown the proposed RDH method is superior to several state-of-the-art RDH methods. With the introduction of deep learning, the development of the RDH method for color images can be promoted.},

Using this technique, we present a numerically-derived upper bound for the achievable secrecy rate in the finite blocklength regime that is tighter than traditional infinite blocklength bounds. We also propose a secrecy coding technique that outperforms random binning codes. When there is one overhead bit, this coding technique is optimum and achieves the newly derived bound. For cases with additional bits of overhead, our coding scheme can achieve equivocation rates close to the new bound. Furthermore, we explore the patterns of the generator matrix and the parity-check matrix for linear codes and we present binning techniques for both linear and nonlinear codes using two different approaches: recursive and non-recursive. To our knowledge, this is the first optimization solution for secrecy coding obtained through linear programming. Our new bounds and codes mark a significant breakthrough towards understanding fundamental limits of performance (and how to achieve them in some instances) for the binary symmetric wiretap channel with real finite blocklength coding constructions. Our techniques are especially useful for codes of small to medium blocklength, such as those that may be required by applications with small payloads, such as the Internet of Things.},

Specifically, the residual generated by any linear observer is indistinguishable under attack and normal operation at steady-state, making BIAs detectable only during transients. To address this, we propose a principled method based on Kullback-Liebler divergence to design a residual generator that significantly increases the signal-to-noise ratio against BIAs. For systems without integrator vulnerability, our method also enables a trade-off between transient and steady-state detectability. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through numerical comparisons with three state-of-the-art residual generators.},

Moreover, most existing schemes cannot achieve efficient queries and updates while preserving the access pattern. In this paper, we propose an efficient MRQ scheme for hiding volume and access patterns. We first design a joint data index using Order-Revealing Encryption (ORE) and Pseudo-random functions (PRFs) to realize volume-hiding range queries. Then, we combine the private set intersection (PSI) and hardware Software Guard Extensions (SGX) to compute each attribute’s intersection of query results. In addition, we preserve access patterns during queries by designing a batch refresh algorithm and an update protocol.

Furthermore, unlike traditional DSSs, the heterogeneous DSSs face eavesdropper with diverse operating patterns, complicating the secrecy models. In this paper, we aim to investigate the secrecy capacity and code constructions for clustered DSSs (CDSSs), a type of heterogeneous DSSs in which the system is divided into clusters with an equal number of nodes and different repair bandwidths for intra-cluster and cross-cluster against two types of eavesdroppers: the occupying-type eavesdropper and the osmotic-type eavesdropper. We construct two CDSS secrecy models tailored to these aforementioned eavesdroppers, derive the upper bounds on adjustable secrecy capacities, and explore the relationships between the upper bounds of perfect secrecy capacities and the number of compromised nodes. Notably, the upper bounds obtained in this paper generalize those of the traditional DSS model. Additionally, we propose three repair-by-transfer code constructions that achieve the secrecy capacity under both eavesdropper scenarios. These codes are based on nested MDS code and represent a generalized form of the minimum bandwidth regenerating (MBR) codes in traditional DSSs.},

  abstract     = {Cloud-edge computing has been widely-adopted for large-scale data sharing and processing. In practical data sharing systems, data are very sensitive and typically encrypted, such as health records. Unauthorized users may attempt to decrypt ciphertexts to recover the data. Due to mistakes or malice, some users might try to share sensitive information with others who do not have access. Clearly, strong access control should be employed to restrict the read and write privilege of users. There was a rich literature on mandatory fine-grained information flow control for such scenarios, but three important issues remain. First, payload privacy was often neglected. Most of the known solutions focused on the protection ciphertext header, but ignored the payload, i.e. encrypted data, which may leak information by a malicious sender. Second, no guarantee of the encrypted data. Ill-formed ciphertexts, e.g. encrypted garbage data, can pass the global policy check, causing decryption failures or disseminating bad information, hence are incapable of content distribution. Finally, the heavy computation cost of sender authentication impedes the practical deployment. In this work, we introduce Hodor, a robust fine-grained information flow control scheme that not only guards the transmission channel with mandatory fine-grained access control for massive data, but also protects whole data traffic, checks ciphertext well-formedness, and efficiently authenticates the sender. In particular, Hodor considers full data traffic protection of both the ciphertext header and encrypted payload to resist information leakage, completely verifies the consistency between the claimed access structure and the actual access structure, and achieves efficient sender authentication with a succinct challenge-response protocol. We present a formal model and give detailed proofs. We also implement and evaluate Hodor using various optimization techniques to boost its performance. The results demonstrate the efficiency and practicality of Hodor for cloud-edge data sharing.},

  abstract     = {Recently intrusion detection technology has been deployed in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), which is an efficacious approach to enhancing security. However, identifying previously unseen and unknown attacks, referred to as the open-set problem, has become increasingly difficult due to the openness of IoT architecture and the continuous evolution of attack patterns. Moreover, existing open-set intrusion detection solutions are challenging to be applied directly to IIoT because of their unique characteristics, such as limited computational and storage capabilities, long detection times, and the inability to continuously learn. In this paper, we propose an efficient, lightweight, and dynamic open-set intrusion detection scheme for IIoT. It consists of three stages: the known attack classification stage focuses on extracting features from known data to efficiently classify normal data and known attacks; the unknown attack recognition stage analyzes the distribution of reconstruction errors to effectively distinguish between known data and unknown attacks; and the dynamic update detection stage introduces a lightweight detection architecture for unknown attacks detection, significantly reducing the computational overhead and storage requirements of IIoT devices. Simultaneously, it learns from and updates with newly detected unknown attacks to further optimize detection capabilities. We conduct experiments on four widely used datasets to evaluate the performance of open-set intrusion detection for IIoT. The experimental results delineate the superiority of our proposed method over four state-of-the-art approaches in open-set intrusion detection. Meanwhile, our proposed lightweight model updating method significantly reduces detection time by over 65% and memory overhead by over 80% compared to retraining methods, while achieving an average detection accuracy of 96%.},

  abstract     = {Federated Learning (FL) allows collaborative training of a Machine Learning (ML) model while preserving data privacy across participating clients. Most existing studies consider FL clients to be proactive and completely honest in their participation. However, in reality, clients might lack the motivation to participate, and malicious behavior among some clients could negatively impact the interests of others. For these reasons, ensuring trust and fairness among FL clients is paramount but remains challenging due to limitations in FL consensus mechanisms and incentive strategies. To address these challenges, we introduce a Trustworthy and Fair FL (TFFL) framework that develops a reputation-based consensus mechanism called Dynamic Reputation Consensus (DRC), where clients’ reputations are dynamically assessed based on subjective opinions by evaluating real-time client behavior. We also incorporate time decay and temporal discounting of TFFL interactions along with the weighted measures of clients’ data quality, performance, and reliability to accurately reflect the evolving nature of client behavior over time. By adaptively adjusting clients’ incentives based on reputations and a cooperative game theory, DRC incentivizes honest participation and discourages malicious intent. In addition, we utilize blockchain and smart contracts to provide decentralized, regularized, and secure reputation management that is resistant to tampering and non-repudiation. Theoretical analysis and empirical results on widely used datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100) demonstrate the effectiveness of DRC in enhancing trust and fairness, improving performance, and providing robust security in FL settings. Results further exhibit that DRC offers superior performance in local model validation, consensus decision, and convergence time compared to related research approaches across various experimental settings.},

However, existing methods exhibit an inefficiency in handling the continual emergence of new generative models. To address this issue, we formulate the detection of AI-generated images in an extensible manner using an adapter-based domain incremental learning framework. Specifically, we first investigate the global consistency property of generation artifacts and design a content-agnostic adapter equipped on a vision transformer to extract common forensic features, where a token-level shuffling strategy is constructed for the dual-stream comparison to mitigate the fitting to specific image content. Then, motivated by the compactness of real images and the diversity of fake images due to their inherent generation processes, an asymmetric category-aware domain alignment method is designed to reduce the domain shift arisen from different generators. Finally, a multi-view knowledge distillation module, considering both point-to-point and structure-to-structure forensic knowledge, is devised to alleviate catastrophic forgetting. Experiments are conducted on several protocols using various image generators, and experimental results verify the superiority of our method compared to state-of-the-art methods for extensible detection.},

  abstract     = {The latest pandemic COVID-19 brought governments worldwide to use various containment measures to control its spread, such as contact tracing, social distance regulations, and curfews. Epidemiological simulations are commonly used to assess the impact of those policies before they are implemented. Unfortunately, the scarcity of relevant empirical data, specifically detailed social contact graphs, hampered their predictive accuracy. As this data is inherently privacy-critical, a method is urgently needed to perform powerful epidemiological simulations on real-world contact graphs without disclosing any sensitive information. In this work, we present RIPPLE, a privacy-preserving epidemiological modeling framework enabling standard models for infectious disease on a population’s real contact graph while keeping all contact information locally on the participants’ devices. As a building block of independent interest, we present PIR-SUM, a novel extension to private information retrieval for secure download of element sums from a database. Our protocols are supported by a proof-of-concept implementation, demonstrating a 2-week simulation over half a million participants completed in 7 minutes, with each participant communicating less than 50 KB.},

However, current gradient inversion attacks are employed to progressively reconstruct private data from gradients, and they have shown successful in extracting private training data. Nonetheless, our observations reveal that these methods exhibit suboptimal performance in face reconstruction and result in the loss of numerous facial details. In this paper, we propose DFLeak, an effective approach to boost face leakage from gradients using residual optimization and thwart the privacy of facial applications in collaborative learning. In particular, we first introduce a superior initialization method to stabilize the inversion process. Second, we propose to integrate blind face restoration results into the gradient inversion optimization process in a residual manner, which enriches facial details. We further design a pixel update schedule to mitigate the adverse effects of image regularization terms and preserve fine facial details. Comprehensive experimentation demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in achieving more realistic and higher-quality facial image reconstructions, surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art gradient inversion attacks.},

  abstract     = {Deep reinforcement learning-based object detection approaches center around a pivotal concept: hierarchically scaling image segments that harbor more intricate details. Compared with the traditional object detection approaches, this approach significantly curbs the quantity of region proposals. This reduction holds paramount significance in curtailing the computational overhead. However, common deep reinforcement learning-based approaches suffer from a significant defect in terms of precision. This issue arises from inadequacies in representing image states appropriately and the unstable learning ability exhibited by the agent. To address these issues, we present the LHAR-RLD. First, we design the Low-dimensional RepVGG(LDR) feature extractor to reduce memory consumption and to reduce the difficulty of fitting downstream networks. Second, we propose the Hybrid DQN(HDQN) to enhance the agent’s ability to determine the state-action of images in complex environments. Then, the Adaptive Dynamic Reward Function(ADR) is crafted to dynamically adjust the reward based on shifts within the agent’s exploration environment. Finally, the ROI Align-based bounding box regression network (RABRNet) is proposed, which aims at further regressing the localization results of reinforcement learning to improve the detection precision. Our method accomplishes 74.4% mAP on the VOC2007, 76.2% mAP on the COCO2017, 75.2% Precision on the SF dataset, with 1.43G FLOPs. The precision outperforms the advanced deep reinforcement learning approaches and the computational cost is far less than them and mainstream object detection methods. This method facilitates highly accurate object localization with minimal computational demands, which means it has notable applications on resource-constrained devices.},

This article introduces decisive disparity diffusion (D3Stereo), marking the first exploration of dense deep feature matching that adapts pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) to previously unseen road scenarios. A pyramid of cost volumes is initially created using various levels of learned representations. Subsequently, a novel recursive bilateral filtering algorithm is employed to aggregate these costs. A key innovation of D3Stereo lies in its alternating decisive disparity diffusion strategy, wherein intra-scale diffusion is employed to complete sparse disparity images, while inter-scale inheritance provides valuable prior information for higher resolutions. Extensive experiments conducted on our created UDTIRI-Stereo and Stereo-Road datasets underscore the effectiveness of D3Stereo strategy in adapting pre-trained DCNNs and its superior performance compared to all other explicit programming-based algorithms designed specifically for road surface 3D reconstruction. Additional experiments conducted on the Middlebury dataset with backbone DCNNs pre-trained on the ImageNet database further validate the versatility of D3Stereo strategy in tackling general stereo matching problems.

  abstract     = {Point cloud primitive instance segmentation is critical for understanding the geometric shapes of man-made objects. Existing learning-based methods mainly focus on learning high-dimensional feature representations of points and further perform clustering or region growing to obtain corresponding primitive instances. However, these features generally cannot accurately represent the discriminability between instances, especially near the boundaries or in regions with small differences in geometric properties. This limitation often leads to over- or under-segmentation of geometric primitives. On the other hand, the boundaries of different primitives are the direct features that distinguish them and thus utilizing boundary information to guide feature learning and clustering is crucial for this task. In this paper, we propose a novel framework BGPSeg for point cloud primitive instance segmentation that utilizes boundary-guided feature extraction and clustering. Specifically, we first introduce a boundary-guided feature extractor with the additional input of a boundary probability map, which utilizes boundary-guided sampling and a boundary transformer to enhance feature discrimination among points crossing geometric boundaries. Furthermore, we propose a boundary-guided primitive clustering module, which combines boundary clues and geometric feature discrimination for clustering to further improve the segmentation performance. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our BGPSeg with a series of comparison and ablation experiments while achieving the state-of-the-art primitive instance segmentation.

  abstract     = {Change detection (CD) is important for Earth observation, emergency response and time-series understanding. Recently, data availability in various modalities has increased rapidly, and multimodal change detection (MCD) is gaining prominence. Given the scarcity of datasets and labels for MCD, unsupervised approaches are more practical for MCD. However, previous methods typically either merely reduce the gap between multimodal data through transformation or feed the original multimodal data directly into the discriminant network for difference extraction. The former faces challenges in extracting precise difference features. The latter contains the pronounced intrinsic distinction between the original multimodal data; direct extraction and comparison of features usually introduce significant noise, thereby compromising the quality of the resultant difference image. In this article, we proposed the MaCon framework to synergistically distill the common and discrepancy representations. The MaCon framework unifies mask reconstruction (MR) and contrastive learning (CL) self-supervised paradigms, where the MR serves the purpose of transformation while CL focuses on discrimination. Moreover, we presented an optimal sampling strategy in the CL architecture, enabling the CL subnetwork to extract more distinguishable discrepancy representations. Furthermore, we developed an effective silent attention mechanism that not only enhances contrast in output representations but stabilizes the training. Experimental results on both multimodal and monomodal datasets demonstrate that the MaCon framework effectively distills the intrinsic common representations between varied modalities and manifests state-of-the-art performance across both multimodal and monomodal CD. Such findings imply that the MaCon possesses the potential to serve as a unified framework in the CD and relevant fields. Source code will be publicly available once the article is accepted.},

  abstract     = {Who, What and Where (3W) are the three core elements of storytelling, and accurately identifying the 3W semantics is critical to understanding the story in a video. This paper studies the 3W composite-semantics video Instance Search (INS) problem, which aims to find video shots about a specific person doing a concrete action in a particular location. The popular Complete-Decomposition (CD) methods divide a composite-semantics query into multiple single-semantics queries, which are likely to yield inaccurate or incomplete retrieval results due to neglecting important semantic correlations. Recent Non-Decomposition (ND) methods utilize Vision Language Model (VLM) to directly measure the similarity between textual query and video content. However, the accuracy is limited by VLM’s immature capability to recognize fine-grained objects. To address the above challenges, we propose a video structure-aware Partial-Decomposition (PD) method. Its core idea is to partially decompose the 3W INS problem into three semantic-correlated 2W INS problems i.e., person-action INS, action-location INS, and location-person INS. Thereafter, we respectively model the correlations between pairs of semantics at frames, shots and scenes of story videos. With the help of the spatial consistency and temporal continuity contained in the unique hierarchical structure of story videos, we can finally obtain identity-matching, logic-consistent, and content-coherent 3W INS results. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we specifically build three large-scale 3W INS datasets based on three TV series Eastenders, Friends and The Big Bang Theory, totally comprising over 670K video shots spanning 700 hours. Extensive experiments show that the proposed PD method surpasses the current state-of-the-art CD and ND methods for 3W INS in story videos.},

  abstract     = {Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to adapt models learned from a well-annotated source domain to a target domain, where only unlabeled samples are available. To this end, adversarial training is widely used in conventional UDA methods to reduce the discrepancy between source and target domains. Recently, prompt tuning has emerged as an efficient way to adapt large pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP to a variety of downstream tasks. In this paper, we present a novel method named Adversarial DuAl Prompt Tuning (ADAPT) for UDA, which employs text prompts and visual prompts to guide CLIP simultaneously. Rather than simply performing a joint optimization of text prompts and visual prompts, we integrate text prompt tuning and visual prompt tuning into a collaborative framework where they engage in an adversarial game: text prompt tuning focuses on distinguishing between source and target images, whereas visual prompt tuning seeks to align source and target domains. Unlike most existing adversarial training-based UDA approaches, ADAPT does not require explicit domain discriminators for domain alignment. Instead, the objective is effectively achieved at both global and category levels through modeling the joint probability distribution of images on domains and categories. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our ADAPT method for UDA. We have released our code at https://github.com/Liuziyi1999/ADAPT.},

However, recent cross-domain problem assumes that training (source domain) and test datasets (target domain) follow different distributions, which may unexpectedly degrade the performance of LP due to small similarity weights connecting the two domains. To address this problem, we propose an approach called optimal graph learning based label propagation (OGL2P), which optimizes one cross-domain graph and two intra-domain graphs to connect the two domains and preserve domain-specific structures, respectively. During label propagation, the cross-domain graph draws two labels close if they are nearby in feature space and from different domains, while the intra-domain graph pulls two labels close if they are nearby in feature space and from the same domain. This makes label propagation more insensitive to cross-domain problem. During graph embedding, the three graphs bring two samples close in an embedded subspace if they are nearby and from the same class. This makes feature representations of the two domains in the embedded subspace are domain-invariant and locally discriminative. Moreover, we optimize the three graphs using both features and labels in the embedded subspace to make them locally discriminative and robust to feature noise. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on five cross-domain image classification datasets to verify that OGL2P outperforms some state-of-the-art cross-domain approaches.},

  abstract     = {Multi-modal image synthesis is crucial for obtaining complete modalities due to the imaging restrictions in reality. Current methods, primarily CNN-based models, find it challenging to extract global representations because of local inductive bias, leading to synthetic structure deformation or color distortion. Despite the significant global representation ability of transformer in capturing long-range dependencies, its huge parameter size requires considerable training data. Multi-modal synthesis solely based on one of the two structures makes it hard to extract comprehensive information from each modality with limited data. To tackle this dilemma, we propose a simple yet effective Recursive TransFusion (RTF) framework for multi-modal image synthesis. Specifically, we develop a TransFusion unit to integrate local knowledge extracted from the individual modality by connecting a CNN-based local representation block (LRB) and a transformer-based global fusion block (GFB) via a feature translating gate (FTG). Considering the numerous parameters introduced by the transformer, we further unfold a TransFusion unit with recursive constraint repeatedly, forming recursive TransFusion (RTF), which progressively extracts multi-modal information at different depths. Our RTF remarkably reduces network parameters while maintaining superior performance. Extensive experiments validate our superiority against the competing methods on multiple benchmarks.

  abstract     = {Open-Set Domain Adaptation (OSDA) aims at adapting a model trained on a labelled source domain, to an unlabeled target domain that is corrupted with unknown classes. The key challenge inherent to this open-set setting is therefore how best to avoid the negative transfer incurred by unknown classes during model adaptation. Most existing works tackle this challenge by simply pushing the entire unknown classes away. In this paper, we take a different stance – instead of addressing these unknown classes as a single entity, we &quot;reserve&quot; in-between spaces for their subsets in the learned embedding. Our key finding is that the inter-class relations learned off the source domain, can help to enforce class separations in the target domain – thereby reserving spaces for unknown classes. More specifically, we first prep the &quot;reservation&quot; by tightening the known-class representations while enlarging their inter-class margin. We then learn soft-label prototypes in the source domain to facilitate the discrimination of known and unknown samples in the target domain. It follows that these two steps are iterated at each epoch in a mutually beneficial manner – better discrimination of unknown samples helps with space reservation, and vice versa. We show state-of-the-art results on four standard OSDA datasets, Office-31, Office-Home, VisDA and ImageCLEF, and conduct further analysis to help understand our method.

Specifically, we construct an anchor graph factorization model from the perspective of transition probabilities, while simultaneously learning transition probability matrices from samples to clusters and from anchor points to clusters, serving as soft label matrices for samples and anchor points, respectively. This model enables one-step label acquisition and provides the model with a sound probability interpretation. Moreover, since the clusters of samples and anchor points should be consistent across all views, we employ Schatten p-norm regularization on the two matrices, effectively mining the complementary information distributed among the views, thereby aligning the labels across views more consistently.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a novel visual relation detection task, named Group Visual Relation Detection (GVRD), for detecting visual relations whose subjects and/or objects are groups (GVRs), inspired by the observation that groups are common in image semantic representation. GVRD can be deemed as an evolution over the existing visual relation detection task that limits both subjects and objects of visual relations as individuals. We propose a Simultaneous Group Relation Prediction (SGRP) method that can simultaneously predict groups and predicates to address GVRD. SGRP contains an Entity Construction (EC) module, a Feature Extraction (FE) module, and a Group Relation Prediction (GRP) module. Specifically, the EC module constructs instances, group candidates, and phrase candidates; the FE module extracts visual, location and semantic features for these entities; and the GRP module simultaneously predicts groups and predicates, and generates the GVRs. Moreover, we construct a new dataset, named COCO-GVR, to facilitate solutions to GVRD task, which consists of 9,570 images from COCO dataset and 31,855 manually labeled GVRs. We test and validate the performance of SGRP by extensive experiments on COCO-GVR dataset. It shows that SGRP outperforms the baselines generated from the state-of-the-art visual relation detection and scene graph generation methods.},

  abstract     = {The last decade has witnessed significant advances in semantic segmentation brought about by deep learning. However, existing methods only fit the data-label correspondence in a data-driven manner and do not fully conform to the abstraction and structuralization characteristics of the human visual cognition process, which limits the upper bounds of their performance. To this end, a multi-grained logical prototype (MGLP) method is proposed to rethink semantic segmentation based on these two key characteristics. Its novel design can be summarized as follows. (1) For abstraction, prototypes of the same class at different grain levels are established: a label generation method is proposed to automatically generate a multi-grained label space, which can guide the learning of the multi-grained prototypes for each class. (2) For structuralization, the intrinsic logical structure across different semantic levels is explicitly modeled: the horizontal metric relationships are established via metric relation operations on prototypes at the same grain level, to improve the discriminability between classes while taking the vertical semantic hierarchy into account. Moveover, the vertical logical relationships are established as the sub-to-super positive and super-to-sub negative constraints, to strengthen the semantic dependencies among prototypes at different grain levels. (3) MGLP is plug-and-play and can be directly combined with existing segmentation methods. Extensive experimental results indicate that MGLP can significantly improve the segmentation performance of existing methods, which opens up a new avenue for future research.},

As such, it has great promise in applications to material science problems; specifically, for trend filtering relatively stable atom-shaped objects in image sequences, such as bright-field Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) videos. Standard analysis of TEM videos is limited to frame-by-frame object recognition. We instead harness temporal correlation across frames through simultaneous analysis of long image sequences, specified as a spatio-temporal image tensor. We define new ridge detection algorithms to non-parametrically estimate explicit trajectories of atomic-level object locations as a continuous function of time. Our approach is specially tailored to handle temporal analysis of objects that seemingly stochastically disappear and subsequently reappear throughout a sequence. We demonstrate that the proposed method is highly effective in simulation scenarios, and delivers notable performance improvements in TEM experiments compared to other material science benchmarks.},

Recent approaches typically establish one-to-one correspondences between image pixels and 3D object surface vertices. However, the utilization of one-to-one correspondences introduces ambiguity for symmetric objects. To address this, we propose SymCode, a symmetry-aware surface encoding that encodes the object surface vertices based on one-to-many correspondences, eliminating the problem of one-to-one correspondence ambiguity. We also introduce SymNet, a fast end-to-end network that directly regresses the 6D pose parameters without solving a PnP problem. We demonstrate faster runtime and comparable accuracy achieved by our method on the T-LESS and IC-BIN benchmarks of mostly symmetric objects.

  abstract     = {Single-image 3D shape reconstruction has attracted significant attention with the advance of generative models. Recent studies have utilized diffusion models to achieve unprecedented shape reconstruction quality. However, these methods, in each sampling step, perform denoising in a single forward pass, leading to cumulative errors that severely impact the geometric consistency of the generated shapes with the input targets and face difficulties in reconstructing rich details of complex 3D shapes. Moreover, the performance of current works suffers significant degradation due to limited information when only a single image is used as input during testing, further affecting the quality of 3D shape generation. In this paper, we present a recurrent diffusion framework, aiming to improve generation performance during single image-to-shape inference. Diverging from denoising in a single forward pass, we recursively refine the noise prediction in a self-rectified manner with the explicit guidance of the input target, thereby markedly suppressing cumulative errors and improving detail modeling. To enhance the geometric perception ability of the network during single-image inference, we further introduce a multi-view training scheme equipped with a view-robust conditional generation mechanism, which effectively promotes generation quality even when only a single image is available during inference. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through extensive evaluations on two public 3D shape datasets, where it surpasses state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.},

However, most current pruning methods are designed for highlevel vision tasks, with few developed for low-level vision tasks. We observed that the norm-based pruning criterion, originally designed for high-level vision tasks, is highly unsuitable for low-level image denoising networks. This difference arises because image denoising networks pursue distinct feature granularities and goals compared to typical high-level vision tasks. To address this issue, we propose a novel filter evaluation method, termed High-Frequency Components Pruning (HFCP), specifically tailored for image denoising network pruning. HFCP assesses filter importance based on high-frequency components. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first pruning method designed specifically for image denoising tasks, straightforward and applicable to various types of noise. Furthermore, HFCP enhances the pruned model’s high-frequency information content with high reliability and interpretability. This facilitates the network’s ability to distinguish high-frequency signals from noise. We comprehensively analyzed multiple image denoising networks and validated HFCP’s effectiveness across four mainstream networks.},

  abstract     = {Fundamental limits on the error probabilities of a family of decentralized detection algorithms (eg., the social learning rule proposed by Lalitha et al. [2]) over directed graphs are investigated. In decentralized detection, a network of nodes locally exchanging information about the samples they observe with their neighbors to collectively infer the underlying unknown hypothesis. Each node in the network weighs the messages received from its neighbors to form its private belief and only requires knowledge of the data generating distribution of its observation. In this work, it is first shown that while the original social learning rule of Lalitha et al. [2] achieves asymptotically vanishing error probabilities as the number of samples tends to infinity, it suffers a gap in the achievable error exponent compared to the centralized case. The gap is due to the network imbalance caused by the local weights that each node chooses to weigh the messages received from its neighbors. To close this gap, a modified learning rule is proposed and shown to achieve error exponents as large as those in the centralized setup. This implies that there is essentially no first-order penalty caused by decentralization in the exponentially decaying rate of error probabilities. To elucidate the price of decentralization, further analysis on the higher-order asymptotics of the error probability is conducted. It turns out that the price is at most a constant multiplicative factor in the error probability, equivalent to an o(1/t) additive gap in the error exponent, where t is the number of samples observed by each agent in the network and the number of rounds of information exchange. This constant depends on the network connectivity and captures the level of network imbalance. Results of simulation on the error probability supporting our learning rule are shown. Further discussions and extensions of results are also presented.},

Here, the null hypothesis is composed of states having the quantum system is correlated to the classical system in an arbitrarily varying form. The second problem is the problem of reliable communication over classical-quantum arbitrarily varying multiple access channels (CQ-AVMAC) and establishing its capacity region by giving multiple achievability techniques. We prove that each of these techniques is optimal by proving a converse. Further, for both these techniques, the decoder designed is a universal decoder and can achieve any rate pair in the capacity region without time sharing and also these decoders do not depend on the channel and therefore they are universal. Our result covers the case when the channel parameter is continuous, which has not been studied even in the classical case. Further, both these techniques can be easily generalized to the case when there are T(T &gt; 2) senders. The design of each of these decoders is based on the study of multiple independence testing. This approach allows us to study the problem of reliable communication over CQ-AVMAC from the point of view of hypothesis testing.

We show that, compared with the existing methods based on MA algorithms, our I-FDMA algorithm can effectively reduce the decoding complexity of RS codes when e &lt; t.

Charlie uses local and pairwise shared randomness to compute a bivariate function of the measurement outcomes. The objective of three agents is to faithfully simulate the given distributed quantum measurement acting on the given quantum state while minimizing the communication and shared randomness rates. We demonstrate a new inner bound to the rate region using random structured POVMs based on asymptotically good algebraic codes, and characterize the performance limit using single-letter quantum mutual information quantities. This new bound subsumes the largest known inner bound and improves upon it strictly for identified examples. One of the challenges in analyzing these structured POVMs is that they exhibit only pairwise independence and induce only uniform single-letter distributions.

  abstract     = {We consider unsourced random access (uRA) in a cell-free (CF) user-centric wireless network, where a large number of potential users compete for a random access slot, while only a finite subset is active. The random access users transmit codewords of length L symbols from a shared codebook, which are received by B geographically distributed radio units (RUs), each equipped with M antennas. Our goal is to devise and analyze a centralized decoder to detect the transmitted messages (without prior knowledge of the active users) and estimate the corresponding channel state information. A specific challenge lies in the fact that, due to the geographically distributed nature of the CF network, there is no fixed correspondence between codewords and large-scale fading coefficients (LSFCs). This makes current activity detection approaches which make use of this fixed LSFC-codeword association not directly applicable. To overcome this problem, we propose a scheme where the access codebook is partitioned in location-based subcodes, such that users in a particular location make use of the corresponding subcode. The joint message detection and channel estimation is obtained via a novel Approximated Message Passing (AMP) algorithm for a linear superposition of matrix-valued sources corrupted by noise. The statistical asymmetry in the fading profile and message activity leads to different statistics for the matrix sources, which distinguishes the AMP formulation from previous cases. In the regime where the codebook size scales linearly with L, while B and M are fixed, we present a rigorous high-dimensional (but finite-sample) analysis of the proposed AMP algorithm. Exploiting this, we then present a precise (and rigorous) large-system analysis of the message missed-detection and false-alarm rates, as well as the channel estimation mean-square error. The resulting system allows the seamless formation of user-centric clusters and very low latency beamformed uplink-downlink communication without explicit user-RU association, pilot allocation, and power control. This makes the proposed scheme highly appealing for low-latency random access communications in CF networks.},

  abstract     = {The goal of the trace reconstruction problem is to recover a string x ϵ {0, 1}n given many independent traces of x, where a trace is a subsequence obtained from deleting bits of x independently with some given probability p ϵ [0; 1): A recent result of Chase (STOC 2021) shows how x can be determined (in exponential time) from exp(O(n1/5)log5 n) traces. This is the state-of-the-art result on the sample complexity of trace reconstruction. In this paper we consider two kinds of algorithms for the trace reconstruction problem. We first observe that the bound of Chase, which is based on statistics of arbitrary length-k subsequences, can also be obtained by considering the “k-mer statistics”, i.e., statistics regarding occurrences of contiguous k-bit strings (a.k.a, k-mers) in the initial string x, for k = 2n1/5. Mazooji and Shomorony (arXiv.2210.10917) show that such statistics (called k-mer density map) can be estimated within ε accuracy from poly(n, 2k, 1/ε) traces. We call an algorithm to be k-mer-based if it reconstructs x given estimates of the k-mer density map. Such algorithms essentially capture all the analyses in the worst-case and smoothed-complexity models of the trace reconstruction problem we know of so far. Our first, and technically more involved, result shows that any k-mer-based algorithm for trace reconstruction must use exp(Ω(n1/5√log n)) traces, thus establishing the optimality of this number of traces. The analysis of this result also shows that the analysis technique used by Chase (STOC 2021) is essentially tight, and hence new techniques are needed in order to improve the worst-case upper bound. This result is shown by considering an appropriate class of real polynomials, that have been previously studied in the context of trace estimation (De, O’Donnell, Servedio. Annals of Probability 2019; Nazarov, Peres. STOC 2017), and proving that two of these polynomials are very close to each other on an arc in the complex plane. Our proof of the proximity of such polynomials uses new technical ingredients that allow us to focus on just a few coefficients of these polynomials. Our second, simple, result considers the performance of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE), which specifically picks the source string that has the maximum likelihood to generate the samples (traces). We show that the MLE algorithm uses a nearly optimal number of traces, i.e., up to a factor of n in the number of samples needed for an optimal algorithm, and show that this factor of n loss may be necessary under general “model estimation” settings.},

  abstract     = {In order to explore how blind interference alignment (BIA) schemes may take advantage of side-information in computation tasks, we study the degrees of freedom (DoF) of a K user wireless network setting that arises in full-duplex wireless MapReduce applications. In this setting the receivers are assumed to have reconfigurable antennas and channel knowledge, while the transmitters have neither, i.e., the transmitters lack channel knowledge and are only equipped with conventional antennas. The central ingredient of the problem formulation is the message structure arising out of the Shuffle phase of MapReduce, whereby each transmitter has a subset of messages that need to be delivered to various receivers, and each receiver has a subset of messages available to it in advance as side-information. We approach this problem by decomposing it into distinctive stages that help identify key ingredients of the overall solution. The novel elements that emerge from the first stage, called broadcast with groupcast messages, include an outer maximum distance separable (MDS) code structure at the transmitter, and an algorithm for iteratively determining groupcast-optimal reconfigurable antenna switching patterns at the receiver to achieve intra-message (among the symbols of the same message) alignment. The next stage, called unicast with side-information, reveals optimal inter-message (among symbols of different messages) alignment patterns to exploit side-information, and by a relabeling of messages, connects to the desired MapReduce setting.},

  abstract     = {This paper explores Bayesian lower bounds on the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) that belong to the wellknown Ziv-Zakai family. The Ziv-Zakai technique relies on connecting the bound to an M-ary hypothesis testing problem. There are three versions of the Ziv-Zakai bound (ZZB): the first version relies on the so-called valley-filling function, the second one is a relaxation of the first bound which omits the valleyfilling function, and the third one, namely the single-point ZZB (SZZB), replaces the integration present in the first two bounds with a single point maximization. The first part of this paper focuses on providing the most general version of the bounds. It is shown that these bounds hold without any assumption on the distribution of the estimand. This makes the bounds applicable to discrete and mixed distributions. Then, the SZZB is extended to an M-ary setting and a version of it that holds for the multivariate setting is provided. In the second part, general properties of these bounds are provided. First, unlike the Bayesian Cramér-Rao bound, it is shown that all the versions of the ZZB tensorize. Second, a characterization of the high-noise asymptotic is provided, which is used to argue about the tightness of the bounds. Third, a complete low-noise asymptotic is provided under the assumptions of mixedinput distributions and Gaussian additive noise channels. In the low-noise, it is shown that the ZZB is generally tight, but there are examples for which the SZZB is not tight. In the third part, the tightness of the bounds is evaluated. First, it is shown that in the low-noise regime the ZZB without the valley-filling function, and, therefore, also the ZZB with the valley-filling function, are tight for mixed-input distributions and Gaussian additive noise channels. Second, for discrete inputs it is shown that the ZZB with the valley-filling function is always sub-optimal, and equal to zero without the valley-filling function. Third, unlike for the ZZB, an example is shown for which the SZZB is tight to the MMSE for discrete inputs. Fourth, sufficient and necessary conditions for the tightness of the bounds are provided. Finally, some examples are provided in which the bounds in the Ziv-Zakai family outperform other well-known Bayesian lower bounds, namely the Cramér-Rao bound and the maximum entropy bound.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present a class of codes, referred to as random staircase generator matrix codes (SGMCs), which have staircase-like generator matrices. In the infinite-length region, we prove that the random SGMC is capacity-achieving over binary-input output-symmetric (BIOS) channels. In the finite-length region, we propose the generalized representative ordered statistics decoding with local constraints (LC-ROSD) algorithm for the SGMCs. The most distinguished feature of the SGMCs with LC-ROSD is that the staircase-like matrices enable parallel implementation of the Gaussian elimination (GE), avoiding the serial GE of conventional OSD and supporting a potential low decoding latency, as implied from simulations. To analyze the performance of random SGMCs in the finite-length region, we derive the ensemble weight spectrum and invoke the conventional union bound. We also derive a partially random coding union (RCU) bound, which is tighter than the conventional one and is used as a criterion to design the SGMCs. Staircase-like generator matrices allow us to derive a series of (tighter and tighter) lower bounds based on the second-order Bonferroni inequality with the incremental number of codewords. The numerical results show that the decoding performance can match well with the proposed partially RCU bound for different code rates and different profiles. The numerical results also show that the tailored SGMCs with the LC-ROSD algorithm can approach the finite-length performance bound, outperforming the 5G low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, 5G polar codes, and Reed-Muller (RM) codes.},

Our second-order achievability bound is an improvement of Polyanskiy et al.’s (2011) achievability bound. We also develop a universal VLF code that does not rely on the knowledge of the underlying channel parameters. Our universal VLF code employs the empirical mutual information as its decoding metric and universalizes the code by Polyanskiy et al. (2011). We derive a second-order achievability bound for universal VLF codes. Our results for both VLF and universal VLF codes are extended to the additive white Gaussian noise channel with an average power constraint. The former yields an improvement over Truong and Tan’s (2017) achievability bound.

Some functions of these distributed values (but not the values themselves) need to be conveyed to the receiver, subject to a fidelity criterion such as mean squared error (MSE) or a certain maximum error with given confidence. For the case in which the computed function for the analog transmitters is a sum of values in –[1, 1], we derive inner and outer bounds for the tradeoff of digital and analog rates of communication under peak and average power constraints for digital transmitters and a peak power constraint for analog transmitters. We then extend the achievability result to a class of functions that includes all linear and some non-linear functions. This extended scheme works over fading channels as long as full channel state information is available at the transmitter. The practicality of our proposed communication scheme is shown in channel simulations that use a version of the scheme based on low density parity check (LDPC) coding.

Over-parametrized deep neural network estimates are defined which are based on a special network topology, which use a special random initialization and where all the weights are learned by the gradient descent. It is shown that the expected L2 error of these estimates converges to zero with the rate close to n−1/(1+d) in case that the regression function is Hölder smooth with Hölder exponent p ∈ [1/2, 1]. In case of an interaction model where the regression function is assumed to be a sum of Hölder smooth functions where each of the functions depends only on d* of of d components of the design variable, it is shown that these estimates achieve the corresponding d*-dimensional rate of convergence.},

We first establish an entropic, quantum central limit theorem (q-CLT), where the rate of convergence is bounded by the magic gap. We also introduce a new quantum divergence based on quantum convolution, called the quantum Ruzsa divergence, to study the stabilizer structure of quantum states. We conjecture a “convolutional strong subadditivity” inequality, which leads to the triangle inequality for the quantum Ruzsa divergence. In addition, we propose two new magic measures, the quantum Ruzsa divergence of magic and quantum-doubling constant, to quantify the amount of magic in quantum states. Finally, by using the quantum convolution, we extend the classical, inverse sumset theory to the quantum case. These results shed new insight into the study of the stabilizer and magic states in quantum information theory.},

  abstract     = {We study the Distributed Wireless Link Scheduling (DWLS) problem: there is a set of n autonomous stations, called senders, each with a message to be delivered to some other station, called receiver. The names and locations of all stations are arbitrarily selected and unknown to each other, to mirror an arbitrary scenario that may occur in mobile communication. Each pair ((sender,receiver),message) is called a request, and the event of successfully delivering the message is called the realization of the request. In the DWLS problem, the requests are realized through wireless communication links (which is a conceptual notion of two nodes being capable of direct wireless delivery of a message) between the stations. The decision to transmit a message is made locally by each station. We consider networks where communication links may interfere with each other, where the interference is an arbitrary input function of each pair of links, customarily called affectance; if the total affectance of other links whose senders are currently transmitting is above a given threshold, the considered transmission is not successful. In the above context, we study the impact of the number of truly random bits used by each link/sender, on the length of the transmission schedules. Specifically, for any set L of n requests with maximum average affectance A(L), we present a deterministic algorithm (i.e., 0 random bits) and a randomized algorithm using O(log A(L) log n) random bits per link. (In this abstract we present formulas in simplified forms, for brevity.) The lengths of their transmission schedules are O(A(L)2 log3 n) and O(A(L) log n), respectively. We then combine both approaches to get a randomized solution using O(log W log n) truly random bits per station with schedules of length O(A(L)2/W log n), for any W ≤ A(L). To the best of our knowledge, our study is a first step towards understanding the trade-offs between randomness and time complexity of Link Scheduling under arbitrary interference. It is particularly important as currently used (in practice) wireless protocols are either deterministic or use a very small random seed of (truly) random bits.},

Previous works propose the use of MDS codes to treat the responses from malicious workers as errors and correct them using the error-correction properties of the code. This comes at the expense of increasing the replication, i.e., the number of workers each partial gradient is computed by. In this work, we propose a way to reduce the replication to s+1 instead of 2s + 1 in the presence of s malicious workers. Our method detects erroneous inputs from the malicious workers, transforming them into erasures. This comes at the expense of s additional local computations at the main node and additional rounds of light communication between the main node and the workers. We define a general framework and give fundamental limits for fractional repetition data allocations. Our scheme is optimal in terms of replication and local computation and incurs a communication cost that is asymptotically, in the size of the dataset, a multiplicative factor away from the derived bound. We furthermore show how additional redundancy can be exploited to reduce the number of local computations and communication cost, or, alternatively, tolerate straggling workers.},

In the non-coherent case, where the CSI is unknown but remains constant during T symbol periods, we first obtain the exact asymptotic capacity for T ≤ 3. Then, we propose a scheme involving uniform signaling in the covariance space and derive a non-asymptotic lower bound on the capacity for an arbitrary block size T. Furthermore, we propose a genie-aided upper bound where the channel is revealed to the receiver. We show that the upper and lower bounds coincide when T is large.

First, we derive the parallel Welch–Berlekamp (PWB) algorithm in a constructive manner based on the properties of solutions to the rational interpolation problem. The algorithm features the simultaneously performed discrepancy computation and polynomial update. Second, we explore the early-termination mechanism of the PWB algorithm for decoding of Reed–Solomon (RS) codes. By introducing the concept of incomplete error locator polynomial, we show that if e ≤ t (where e is the number of errors and t is the error correction capability), the PWB algorithm can be terminated at latest at the completion of the (t + e)-th iteration. This leads to the early-terminating PWB (EPWB) algorithm. Finally, we develop frequency-domain versions of the PWB and EPWB algorithms, namely, FPWB and FEPWB. The key point toward the two algorithms is to replace the update of polynomial coefficients with the update of polynomial evaluations. It is worth noting that the FEPWB algorithm applies only to shortened RS codes. Furthermore, an efficient systolic architecture for the FPWB algorithm is designed, which is easily adapted for the FEPWB algorithm.},

Private Inference has been extensively explored in recent years, mainly from a cryptographic standpoint via techniques like homomorphic encryption and multiparty computation. These approaches often come with high computational overhead and may degrade the accuracy of the model. In our work, we take a different approach inspired by the Private Information Retrieval literature. We view private inference as the task of retrieving inner products of parameter vectors with the data, a fundamental operation in many machine learning models. We introduce schemes that enable such retrieval of inner products for models with quantized (i.e., restricted to a finite set) weights; such models are extensively used in practice due to a wide range of benefits. In addition, our schemes uncover a fundamental tradeoff between user and server privacy. Our information-theoretic approach is applicable to a wide range of problems and robust in privacy guarantees for both the user and the server.},

We demonstrate one possible realization of these codes, obtaining powerful, high-rate, low-error-floor, and low-complexity coding schemes based on simple iterative syndrome-domain decoding of coupled Hamming component codes. We anticipate that the proposed codes could improve performance–complexity–latency tradeoffs in high-throughput communications applications, most notably fiber-optic, in which classical staircase codes and zipper codes have been applied. We consider the construction of difference triangle sets having minimum scope and sum-of-lengths, which lead to memory-optimal realizations of higher-order staircase codes.

Not only does this determine the ultimate performance of entanglement testing, but it also establishes the reversibility of all quantum resource theories under asymptotically resource non-generating operations, with the regularised relative entropy of resource governing the asymptotic transformation rate between any two quantum states. As a by-product, we prove that the same Stein exponent can also be achieved when the null hypothesis is only approximately i.i.d., in the sense that it can be modelled by an ‘almost power state’. To solve the problem we introduce two techniques. The first is a procedure that we call ‘blurring’, which, informally, transforms a permutationally symmetric state by making it more evenly spread across nearby type classes. Blurring alone suffices to prove the generalised Stein’s lemma in the fully classical case, but not in the quantum case. Our second technical innovation, therefore, is to perform a second quantisation step to lift the problem to an infinite-dimensional bosonic quantum system; we then solve it there by using techniques from continuous-variable quantum information. Rather remarkably, the second-quantised action of the blurring map corresponds to a pure loss channel. A careful examination of this second quantisation step is the core of our quantum solution.},

We do so in the highly general setting in which the interarrival times pertaining to the tagged stream can have any distribution, and also the service times of both the tagged stream and the background stream are generally distributed. The packet arrival times of the background process are assumed to constitute a Poisson process, which is justified by the fact that it typically is a superposition of many relatively homogeneous streams. The first main contribution is that we derive an expression for the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the AoI in the resulting GI+M/GI+GI/1 model. Second, we use stochastic ordering techniques to identify tight stochastic bounds on the AoI, leading to an explicit lower and upper bound on the mean AoI. In addition, when approximating the tagged stream’s inter-generation times through a phase-type distribution (which can be done at any precision), we present a computational algorithm for the mean AoI. As illustrated through a sequence of numerical experiments, the analysis enables us to assess the impact of background traffic on the AoI of the tagged stream. It turns out that the upper bound on the mean AoI is remarkably close to its true value, which yields an explicit expression (in terms of the model parameters) for an accurate proxy of the AoI-minimizing generation rate.},

Our main upper bound is a spherepacking bound obtained by solving a linear programming (LP) problem. It improves upon previous results for cases when the distance d or the alphabet size q is large. Our first lower bound is derived from a connection between insdel codes and matchings in special hypergraphs. This lower bound, together with our upper bound, shows that for fixed block length n and edit distance d, when q is sufficiently large, the maximum size of insdel codes is qn-d/2 + 1/(dn/2 - 1)(1 ± o(1)). The second lower bound refines Alon et al.’s recent logarithmic improvement on Levenshtein’s GV-type bound and extends its applicability to large q and d.},

  abstract     = {Due to the non-convex nature of training Deep Neural Network (DNN) models, their effectiveness relies on the use of non-convex optimization heuristics. Traditional methods for training DNNs often require costly empirical methods to produce successful models and do not have a clear theoretical foundation. In this study, we examine the use of convex optimization theory and sparse recovery models to refine the training process of neural networks and provide a better interpretation of their optimal weights. We focus on training two-layer neural networks with piecewise linear activations and demonstrate that they can be formulated as a finite-dimensional convex program. These programs include a regularization term that promotes sparsity, which constitutes a variant of group Lasso. We first utilize semi-infinite programming theory to prove strong duality for finite width neural networks and then we express these architectures equivalently as high dimensional convex sparse recovery models. Remarkably, the worst-case complexity to solve the convex program is polynomial in the number of samples and number of neurons when the rank of the data matrix is bounded, which is the case in convolutional networks. To extend our method to training data of arbitrary rank, we develop a novel polynomial-time approximation scheme based on zonotope subsampling that comes with a guaranteed approximation ratio. We also show that all the stationary points of the nonconvex training objective can be characterized as the global optimum of a subsampled convex program. Our convex models can be trained using standard convex solvers without resorting to heuristics or extensive hyper-parameter tuning unlike non-convex methods. Due to the convexity, optimizer hyperparameters such as initialization, batch sizes, and step size schedules have no effect on the final model. Through extensive numerical experiments, we show that convex models can outperform traditional non-convex methods and are not sensitive to optimizer hyperparameters. The code for our experiments is available at https://github.com/pilancilab/convex_nn.},

  abstract     = {The maximum distance separable (MDS) codes are the optimal codes to achieve Singleton bound, providing maximum error tolerance under a given number of parity nodes. Ye and Barg (IEEE TIT, 2017) leveraged permutation matrices and Reed-Solomon type codes to devise 7 explicit constructions for constructing MDS array codes with optimal repair property (as known as MSR codes) or even optimal access property. Drawing inspiration from these explicit constructions, we provide two generic constructions for constructing MSR codes from high-rate MDS codes or MDS array codes. In this paper, we introduce the concepts of s-pairwise MDS codes sets and s-pairwise MDS array codes sets. Two generic constructions (Generic Constructions I and II) for constructing the MSR code using the s-pairwise MDS codes sets or the s-pairwise MDS array codes sets are given. Constructions 1 to 3 proposed by Ye and Barg can be regarded as some special cases of Generic Construction I, and Constructions 1 to 3 proposed by Li et al. (IEEE TCOM, 2024) can be regarded as some special cases of Generic Construction II. It is worth mentioning that Generic Construction II can be applied to any finite field, including the binary field. We also demonstrate how to obtain the s-pairwise MDS code sets and the s-pairwise MDS array code sets from a high-rate MDS code or MDS array code over Fq. We obtain a novel class of MSR codes by utilizing the MDS array codes provided by Lv et al. (IEEE TIT, 2023) as component codes according to Generic Construction II. As a byproduct of Constructions 4 to 7 in (IEEE TIT, 2017), we obtain a new class of MSR codes with optimal access property. Using two types of sets Γ1 and Γ2 with the property that matrices commute, we present several new constructions for MSR codes with the optimal access property over any finite field. In this paper, compared with the constructions over binary field proposed by Li et al. (IEEE TCOM, 2024), the sub-packetization of our constructions applicable to the binary field is significantly reduced.},

The goal is to recover n latent permutations from their noisy and incomplete pairwise measurements. In recent years, spectral methods have gained increasing popularity thanks to their simplicity and computational efficiency. Spectral methods utilize the leading eigenspace U of the data matrix and its block submatrices U1,U2, . . . ,Un to recover the permutations. In this paper, we propose a novel and statistically optimal spectral algorithm. Unlike the existing methods which use {UjU1⊤}j≥2, ours constructs an anchor matrix M by aggregating useful information from all of the block submatrices and estimates the latent permutations through {UjM⊤}j≥1. This modification overcomes a crucial limitation of the existing methods caused by the repetitive use of U1 and leads to an improved numerical performance. To establish the optimality of the proposed method, we carry out a fine-grained spectral analysis and obtain a sharp exponential error bound that matches the minimax rate.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the capacity of finite-state channels (FSCs) with feedback. We derive an upper bound on the feedback capacity of FSCs by extending the duality upper bound method from mutual information to the case of directed information. The upper bound is expressed as a multi-letter expression that depends on a test distribution on the sequence of channel outputs. For any FSC, we show that if the test distribution is structured on a Q-graph, the upper bound can be formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) whose state being a belief on the channel state. In the case of FSCs and states that are either unifilar or have a finite memory, the MDP state simplifies to take values in a finite set. Consequently, the MDP consists of a finite number of states, actions, and disturbances. This finite nature of the MDP is of significant importance, as it ensures that dynamic programming algorithms can solve the associated Bellman equation to establish analytical upper bounds, even for channels with large alphabets. We demonstrate the simplicity of computing bounds by establishing the capacity of a broad family of Noisy Output is the State (NOST) channels as a simple closed-form analytical expression. Furthermore, we introduce novel, nearly optimal analytical upper bounds on the capacity of the Noisy Ising channel.},

  abstract     = {For a multi-source multi-terminal noiseless network, the multicast key-dissemination problem, here called the key-cast problem, involves the task of multicasting a (secret) key K from the network sources to its terminals. Unlike traditional communication, where messages must be delivered from source to destination(s) unchanged, key-cast is more flexible since key-cast need not require source reconstruction at destination nodes. Instead, the distributed key can be a mixture of sources from which the sources themselves may be unrecoverable. Key-cast (also known as secret key agreement) in memoryless networks has seen significant studies over the past decades. This work initiates the study of key-cast in noiseless networks, i.e., network coding, and addresses the similarities and differences between traditional forms of communication that require source reconstruction and the less constrained form of communication in the key-cast task. The study varies according to three criteria. The setting can be secure, in which case the shared key is not revealed to an eavesdropper (whose capabilities we constrain), or non-secure, in which case the key need not be hidden. The setting can have one or multiple source nodes capable of generating independent randomness to be used in the key generation process. And the setting can have one or multiple terminal sets, where the latter case is referred to as multiple key-cast. In multiple key-cast, one requires that terminals in each terminal set decode a different shared key. In the given settings, this work derives combinatorial conditions for key-cast and multiple key-cast and designs corresponding communication schemes. In addition, the study compares the key-cast rate with and without the restriction of source reconstruction that is needed in traditional forms of communication. Key-cast achieves a strict advantage in rate when source reconstruction is relaxed.},

Our coding scheme is similar yet distinct from prior art. The main differences are: 1) Guard-bands are placed in almost all polarization levels; 2) Trellis decoding is applied to the whole received word, and not to segments of it. As before, the scheme is capacity-achieving. The price we pay for this improvement is a higher decoding complexity, which is nonetheless still polynomial, O(Λ4).},

The first problem is the distillation of a conference key when the source state is shared between a number of legal players and an eavesdropper; the eavesdropper, apart from starting off with this quantum side information, also observes the public communication between the players. The second is the distillation of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states by means of local operations and classical communication (LOCC) from the given mixed state. These problem settings extend our previous paper [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 68(2):976-988, 2022], and we generalise its results: using a quantum version of the task of communication for omniscience, we derive novel lower bounds on the distillable conference key from any multipartite quantum state by means of non-interacting communication protocols. Secondly, we establish novel lower bounds on the yield of GHZ states from multipartite mixed states. Namely, we present two methods to produce bipartite entanglement between sufficiently many nodes so as to produce GHZ states. Next, we show that the conference key agreement protocol can be made coherent under certain conditions, enabling the direct generation of multipartite GHZ states.},

To this aim, several asymmetric quantum codes have been proposed. These include variants of surface codes like the XZZX and ZZZY surface codes, tailored to preserve quantum information in the presence of error asymmetries. In this work, we propose two classes of Calderbank, Shor and Steane (CSS) topological codes, referred to as cylindrical and Möbius codes, particular cases of the fiber bundle family. Cylindrical codes maintain a fully planar structure, while Möbius codes are quasi-planar, with minimal non-local qubit interactions. We construct these codes employing the algebraic chain complexes formalism, providing theoretical upper bounds for the logical error rate.

  abstract     = {The platoon technology is gradually applied in the intelligent transportation systems to improve the safety, efficiency, energy saving, and emission reduction of vehicles during driving. However, in contrast to the traditional ramp merging scenario that consists of individual vehicles, the existing platoons from the upstream bring new challenges to the merging problem on ramps. Without an effective coordination strategy, the unnecessary congestion and disintegration of the existing platoons will lead to an increase in driving costs and safety risk. Therefore, this paper optimizes the merging strategy of vehicle sequences involving platoons on highway ramps. A merging strategy, based on an adaptive headway threshold, is first proposed, where the comprehensive economic benefit is considered as its optimization objective while taking into account the decrements of the time, fuel, and carbon emission costs. The vehicle sequence merging is then modeled as a Markov decision process to derive the optimal threshold, where the action set includes three actions: accelerating, decelerating, and maintaining the constant cruising speed. Afterwards, the constraints are brought to the decision-making to ensure the safety of the merging process. The calculation of the action value, combining the derived optimal threshold and constraint, is then detailed. Finally, the results of the simulation are evaluated, and a comparison between the proposed strategy and other existing methods is conducted, which demonstrates that the proposed approach improves the comprehensive economic benefits.},

  abstract     = {Recently, graph reinforcement learning (GRL)-based methods have demonstrated superior performance in solving decision-making issues. However, existing GRL-based methods encounter challenges in adequately integrating driving environment information and accurately capturing vehicular interactions. Resolving these issues is crucial for enhancing the safety and efficiency of intelligent transportation systems. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel multi-modal failure-aware graph representation (MM-FA-GR) approach. The objective is to enhance the completeness and stability of graph representation techniques in the GRL-based setting, thereby improving the decision-making performance of CAVs operating in mixed autonomy traffic. Initially, a risk assessment invariant feature extractor (RA-IFE) is introduced to efficiently and selectively aggregate vehicle driving features into the node feature matrix. Subsequently, a multi-modal interaction model (MIM) is developed to comprehensively represent the mutual effects among vehicles and construct a multi-dimensional adjacency matrix. Moreover, a dynamic failure model (DFM) is incorporated to assess the sensing and communication failures of CAVs, enhancing the model’s robustness in non-ideal driving environments. Finally, a GRL model is established to solve the optimized driving strategies for CAVs. The proposed MM-FA-GR method has large potential to advance the graph representation technology, thereby enhancing decision-making performance in mixed autonomy traffic and improving robustness in non-ideal driving conditions. Comprehensive experiments are conducted with three typical traffic scenarios. Results show that our proposed MM-FA-GR method outperforms several baselines regarding safety, efficiency, and stability, highlighting the effectiveness of the core components within the proposed method.

  abstract     = {Technological advancements focus on developing comfortable and acceptable driving characteristics in autonomous vehicles. Present driving functions predominantly possess predefined parameters, and there is no universally accepted driving style for autonomous vehicles. While driving may be technically safe and the likelihood of road accidents is reduced, passengers may still feel insecure due to a mismatch in driving styles between the human and the autonomous system. Incorporating driving style preferences into automated vehicles enhances acceptance, reduces uncertainty, and poses the opportunity to expedite their adoption. Despite the increased research focus on driving styles, there remains a need for comprehensive studies investigating how variations in the driving context impact the assessment of automated driving functions. Therefore, this work evaluates lateral driving style preferences for autonomous vehicles on rural roads, considering different weather and traffic situations. A controlled study was conducted with a variety of German participants utilizing a high-fidelity driving simulator. The participants experienced four different driving styles, including mimicking of their own driving behavior under two weather conditions. A notable preference for a more passive driving style became evident based on statistical analyses of participants’ responses during and after the drives. This study could not confirm the hypothesis that people prefer to be driven by mimicking their own driving behavior. Furthermore, the study illustrated that weather conditions and oncoming traffic substantially influence the perceived comfort during autonomous rides. The gathered dataset is openly accessible at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jhaselberger/idcld-subject-study-on-driving-style-preferences.},

Through a driving simulator experiment, this study thoroughly investigated the relationship between participants’ eye movement behaviors and subjective perceptions. 37 participants each experienced 48 different automated lane changes in the experiment. Their subjective feedback on situational trust and system aggressiveness was collected through questionnaires, and eye movements related to gaze, blink, saccade, fixation, pupil diameter, and eyelid opening were monitored. The analysis identified 25 significant eye movement features. The experimental results show that lower situational trust during automated lane changes correlated with increased attention to side mirrors, decreased attention to the front vehicle in the original lane, reduced blink frequency and suppressed saccade amplitude which increased the duration of effective visual information acquisition, smaller pupil diameter and greater fluctuations indicating increased cognitive load. The extracted features proved effective in building predictive models for drivers’ subjective evaluations. This study provides practical recommendations for selecting eye movement features and implementing personalized automated lane-change systems through eye movement monitoring. Future research will focus on expanding the dataset, improving predictive model performance, and exploring the application of these models.},

  abstract     = {Safety is of vital importance to transportation cyber-physical systems (T-CPS). With the deeper integration of automated vehicles (AVs) in road traffic, safe control algorithms for AVs have become a crucial demand for maintaining the overall safety of T-CPS. One of the major concerns with respect to the DRL-based cyber systems of AVs is the lack of safety guarantees, which may cause physical collisions. Safe reinforcement learning (SRL) is a promising way to enhance the safety performance of traditional DRL. However, current SRL methods are designed in a time-triggered (TT) paradigm, where the controller is uniformly triggered in the time domain. Despite the safety enhancement, this TT-SRL paradigm lacks data efficiency in safety-critical scenarios, and most importantly, still cannot guarantee safety during the intervals between time steps. The main objective of this paper is to address the safety issue of the existing TT-SRL methods while improving the data efficiency by proposing an event-triggered SRL (ET-SRL) framework. In the proposed method, safety is guaranteed by designing an additional safe controller to correct the unsafe actions generated by DRL. Event-triggered control barrier functions (CBFs) are used to provide safety constraints in a discrete manner. A state and dynamics synchronization module is also designed to estimate model uncertainties considering both the state dynamics and the input dynamics. The proposed method is trained and applied in simulated car-following experiments. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by comparison to both DRL-based and model-based baselines in both artificial safety-critical scenarios and a real trajectory dataset.},

With the advent of quantum computing, there are concerns regarding the vulnerability of this architecture against attack algorithms implemented in a quantum computer. In this study, a potential threat is investigated in a blockchain-based VANET with an impersonation attack utilizing Shor’s algorithm implemented in a quantum computer. Specifically, the impersonation attack using Shor’s algorithm is created by compromising the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) encrypted digital signatures of VANET, and thus a threat to the trust-based blockchain scheme of VANET is successfully established. We implemented an integrated simulation platform combining OMNET++, vehicles-in-network simulation (VEINS), and simulation of urban mobility (SUMO) traffic simulator. In addition, we incorporated vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication in OMNET++ using the extended INET library. An impersonation attack on a blockchain-based VANET is implemented using IBM Qiskit, which is an open-source quantum software development kit. The findings reveal that an impersonation attack is feasible on the Blockchain-based VANET, which compromises the trust chain of a blockchain-based VANET.

  abstract     = {Binocular stereo matching is a crucial task in autonomous driving for accurately estimating the depth information of objects and scenes. This task, however, is challenging due to various ill-posed regions within binocular image pairs, such as repeated textures and weak textures which present complex correspondences between the points. Existing methods extract features from binocular input images mainly by relying on deep convolutional neural networks with a substantial number of convolutional layers, which may incur high memory and computation costs, thus making it hard to deploy in real-world applications. Additionally, previous methods do not consider the correlation between view unary features during the construction of the cost volume, thus leading to inferior results. To address these issues, a novel lightweight binocular-separated feature extraction module is proposed that includes a view-shared multi-dilation fusion module and a view-specific feature extractor. Our method leverages a shallow neural network with a multi-dilation modeling module to provide similar receptive fields as deep neural networks but with fewer parameters and better computational efficiency. Furthermore, we propose incorporating the correlations of view-shared features to dynamically select view-specific features during the construction of the cost volume. Extensive experiments conducted on two public benchmark datasets show that our proposed method outperforms the deep model-based baseline method (i.e., 13.6% improvement on Scene Flow and 2.0% on KITTI 2015) while using 29.7% fewer parameters. Ablation experiments show that our method achieves superior matching performance in weak texture and edge regions. The source code will be made publicly available.},

  abstract     = {Deep graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have shown promising performance in traffic prediction tasks, but their practical deployment on resource-constrained devices faces challenges. First, few models consider the potential influence of historical and future auxiliary information, such as weather and holidays, on complex traffic patterns. Second, the computational complexity of dynamic graph convolution operations grows quadratically with the number of traffic nodes, limiting model scalability. To address these challenges, this study proposes a deep encoder-decoder model named AIMSAN, which comprises an auxiliary information-aware module (AIM) and a sparse cross-attention-based graph convolutional network (SAN). From historical or future perspectives, AIM prunes multi-attribute auxiliary data into diverse time frames, and embeds them into one tensor. SAN employs a cross-attention mechanism to merge traffic data with historical embedded data in each encoder layer, forming dynamic adjacency matrices. Subsequently, it applies diffusion GCN to capture rich spatial-temporal dynamics from the traffic data. Additionally, AIMSAN utilizes the spatial sparsity of traffic nodes as a mask to mitigate the quadratic computational complexity of SAN, thereby improving overall computational efficiency. In the decoder layer, future embedded data are fused with feed-forward traffic data to generate prediction results. Experimental evaluations on three public traffic datasets demonstrate that AIMSAN achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, while reducing GPU memory consumption by 41.24%, training time by 62.09%, and validation time by 65.17% on average.},

This paper introduces a Digital Twin (DT)-based collaboration architecture for resource management in UAV swarms, connecting realistic task crowdsourcing and virtual traffic flow scheduling to achieve a complementary multi-UAV swarm allocation. We propose an intelligent dynamic task crowdsourcing scheme that manages the swarm scale and membership configuration of multiple UAV swarms based on theoretical evaluation results. The architecture constructs DTs of UAV swarms and shifts the scheduling of traffic flow paths to the virtual world, thereby sidestepping the overhead of routing configuration and network reorganisation. With the aid of a traffic flow allocation algorithm based on Stochastic Network Calculus (SNC), the virtual swarm pre-schedules traffic flows and assesses end-to-end delay theoretically, so as to achieve a collaborative deployment of sensing, computational, and communication resources within the swarm. The simulation results substantiate that our architecture can uphold a 90% achievement ratio for task requirements while keeping UAV costs comparable to other algorithms.},

To address the challenge above, this paper proposes a game theory-based harmonious decision-making (GTHD) algorithm considering nuance of driving styles of HDVs, achieving human-like performance in interactions with HDVs. Technically, a game theoretic model of the GTHD uses predictions of the opposing vehicle’s motion and the information from preplanned trajectories. Besides, a prior estimation for driving styles is obtained utilizing clustering of historical data, and refined in real time through Bayesian estimation. Then, the driving style estimation is utilized to modify the game theoretic model. The modified model provides a closer depiction of the opponent’s preferences, meanwhile adjusts self-preferences to adapt to the opponent. The efficacy of GTHD is validated using a hardware and human in loop simulator and datasets in MLC scenarios. It is shown that the GTHD achieves human-like performance with 91.50%-98.50% accuracy compared with human bus driver under different conditions, better than several lane change models based on data driven methods.

  abstract     = {We will apply dual three-phase permanent magnet synchronous motors (DTP-PMSM) to the road sensing unit of the steer-by-wire system to improve redundancy and fault tolerance performance, meeting the requirements of intelligent transportation systems. However, open circuit faults inevitably lead to periodic torque ripple, parameter mismatch, and current harmonics, which pose a huge threat to drivers and traffic participants. Therefore, this article proposes a dynamic balancing strategy that can operate stably under both motor health and fault conditions. Firstly, this strategy does not require diagnostic fault information, thereby fundamentally avoiding performance degradation caused by diagnostic accuracy, time, model reconstruction, and strategy switching. The torque control module (TCM) is based on adaptive iterative learning control with a forgetting factor, which achieves torque tracking and suppression of periodic ripple after faults. The current control module (CCM) is based on ultra local model free predictive current control and extended state observer to track current and suppress the effects of parameter mismatch and current harmonics. Based on the multi-variable multi-objective sliding mode extreme value search strategy, the internal parameters and external weights of the two modules are dynamically adjusted to achieve dynamic balance between health and fault operation of TCM and CCM. The experimental results show that this strategy effectively improves the robustness of the system in a healthy state and the fault tolerance performance in a faulty state, effectively suppressing the periodic torque ripple and current harmonics caused by faults. Compared with the dynamic balancing strategy based on NSGA-II, this strategy increases the THD of torque by 13.45% and reduces the THD of current harmonics by 9.83%.},

  abstract     = {Electric Vehicles (EVs) have become popular in the domain of Intelligent Transportation Systems for their ability to mitigate increasing environmental concerns by reducing carbon footprints and conserving fossil fuels. Due to the scarcity of static charging stations, Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) charge sharing can facilitate the on-demand charging requirement of EVs. However, most of the V2V charge-sharing solutions are either centralized or semi-centralized, causing long waiting times, huge message overhead, and high infrastructural costs. For a large network, assigning a suitable donor EV for an acceptor EV as well as maximizing the matching cardinality in a distributed environment is a challenging problem. In this paper, the problem of V2V matching for charge sharing is mapped to the classical stable matching problem in bipartite graphs. The problem is formulated using integer linear programming that considers flexible decision making for EVs based on multiple charging criteria and constraints. However, as EVs have limited communication ranges, an EV can’t possess knowledge about the entire vehicular network. So we propose two sets of distributed heuristics under the name of Vehicle to Vehicle Distributed Charge Sharing (V2VDisCS), which yield a sub-optimal solution with lower computational and message complexities compared to existing distributed solutions. We analyze the average case matching probabilities and prove the sub-optimality of our approach. Simulation studies show that our heuristics outperform the existing distributed approaches in terms of message overhead and matching percentage. They show a comparable result for matching preference with respect to the standard centralized stable matching algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Headway regularity is an essential indicator of transit reliability, directly influencing passenger waiting time and transit service quality. In this paper, we employ multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to develop a Cooperative Transit signal priority strategy with Variable phase for Headway adherence (CTVH) under a multi-intersection network. Each signalized intersection is controlled by an RL agent, which determines the next step’s signal, adapting to real-time traffic dynamics of transits and non-transits and promoting transit headway adherence. The proposed approach considers four critical aspects, i.e., complicated states with multiple conflicting bus requests, rational actions constrained by domain knowledge, comprehensive rewards balancing buses and cars, and a collaborative training scheme among agents. They are correspondingly addressed by proper state representation with estimated bus headway deviations, irrational actions masking, reward functions formulated by general traffic queue and transit headway deviation, and appropriate MARL approach with synchronous action processing. Our method also takes into account the phase transition loss by setting yellow and all-red time. Simulation results compared with the coordinated fixed-time signal (CFT) and bus holding (BH) strategy verify the merits of the proposed method in terms of improvements in transit headway adherence and influence on general traffic. Based on the results, we further discuss the BH method’s limitations due to bus bay length and various holding lines and the CTVH method’s benefits in the three-intersection environment and the entire-line network. The proposed method has a promising application in practice to improve transit reliability.},

The intensity of LiDAR returns offers valuable information about the reflected laser signals, which facilitates crucial tasks such as object detection, classification, and segmentation. However, current physics-based LiDAR simulations fail to produce realistic intensity data. This research addresses this issue by using learning-based methods for realistic LiDAR intensity simulation. We propose a hybrid approach that incorporates novel physics-based modalities, specifically incidence angle and material reflectance, into the learning model to generate more realistic intensity data. We test this methodology across two architectures: (i) U-NET (Convolutional Neural Network) and (ii) Pix2Pix (Generative Adversarial Network), using the SemanticKITTI and VoxelScape datasets. The experiments compare the simulated intensity data generated by our method with state-of-the-art approaches through both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, and assessments of its effectiveness in improving the downstream tasks. The results demonstrate consistent improvements after the inclusion of the physics-based modalities.},

  abstract     = {High-performance vision-based decision-making networks are often limited by hardware capabilities in practical applications. To address this challenge, this study proposes lightweight optimization strategies for decision-making models from the aspects of parameter size, training memory usage, and inference speed. Specifically, an innovative solution is proposed to achieve lightweight parameters. The Video Swin Transformer is employed to simultaneously extract temporal and spatial features, with the network trained using a Prioritized Replay Deep Q-Network (PRDQN) that incorporates risk assessment. To further reduce training memory usage, the Q-target network in PRDQN is removed, and the mellowmax operator is integrated to enhance the training process, resulting in the PRDeepMellow Swin Transformer. After analyzing the inference speed problems encountered by the algorithm in practical applications, the vanilla self-attention is replaced by a linear self-attention based on double softmax, namely Double Softmax Linear Video Swin Transformer (DSLVS Transformer) which improves the inference speed for long sequences. The proposed methods were evaluated across three high-speed lane change scenarios (a static scenario, a dynamic scenario, and a randomly changing scenario). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods can still maintain excellent decision performance after the corresponding lightweight optimizations.},

  abstract     = {The digitalization of traffic networks has spurred the development of intelligent transportation systems. By utilizing reinforcement learning for dynamic traffic optimization, it efficiently handles real-world traffic complexities. However, as the demand for real-time, high-efficiency tasks increases, relying solely on reinforcement learning struggles to meet both goals. Integrating reinforcement learning with mobile communication technology offers a promising solution for efficient, low-overhead traffic networks. As an important physical layer technology for Integrated Sensing and Communications Systems, Spectrally Efficient Frequency Division Multiplexing (SEFDM) addresses the communication overhead challenge in reinforcement learning-enabled optimization. However, the main challenge of SEFDM is eliminating the inter-carrier interference (ICI) caused by non-orthogonal modulation. Considering that existing post-interference cancellation methods fail due to the ill-conditioning of the generalized channel matrix, which cannot be directly inverted, we propose a nonlinear precoding algorithm at the transmitter, instead of post-cancellation, that effectively eliminates interference and improves transmission reliability. We firstly use a nonlinear feedback structure to avoid power boost and error propagation. Besides that, Geometric Mean Decomposition (GMD) based interference matrix decomposition algorithm is used in the proposed precoding scheme to avoid matrix singularity and obtain diversity gain. Finally, the numerical results show that the proposed precoding method can achieve higher order QAM SEFDM signaling with higher spectral efficiency and get comparative BER performance.},

  abstract     = {In urban areas, roads with dedicated cycle lanes play a vital role in cyclist safety. However, accidents can still occur when vehicles cross the cycle lane at intersections. Accidents mostly occur due to failure of the driver to see a cyclist on the cycle lane, particularly when the cyclist is going straight through the intersection, and the vehicle is turning. For safe driving, it is critical that the drivers visually scan the area in the vicinity of the junction and the car, particularly using the wing-mirror, prior to making turns. This paper describes results from a set of test drives using in-vehicle non-invasive eye-tracking and in-vehicle CAN bus sensors to determine driver behaviour. In total, 20 drivers were monitored through 5 different intersections with cycle lanes. The study found that approximately 83% of drivers did not check their wing mirror prior to, or during their turning manoeuvre, potentially putting pedestrian, cyclists, scooter and hoverboard users in danger. An algorithm was developed to analyse driver gaze during the turning manoeuvre to identify cases where they failed to look at the wing mirror. The gaze pattern and gaze concentration on the mirror helps to identify safe and unsafe driving behaviour. This information can then be used to improve Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) to create a safer environment for all road users.},

  abstract     = {Ensuring the smooth operation of road traffic is a momentous target in Intelligent Transportation Systems, which can be expedited by a secure and reliable Internet of Vehicles (IoV). As prominent carriers of the IoV, intelligent vehicles (IVs), that bear the promising potential for alleviating traffic congestion, have become the core road traffic participants. However, the mixed-traffic environment escalates the risk of IVs, as the discretionary lane change behaviors of nearby human-driven vehicles may result in collisions with IVs, compromising the robust performance of the IoV. Recent studies have utilized advanced deep learning techniques to achieve proactive lane change intention prediction, including Recurrent Neural Networks and Transformer. Although attaining reasonable prediction performance, they adopt the data-driven paradigm, which excessively focuses on learning from data while neglecting the domain knowledge. Against this background, we propose to employ the knowledge-driven paradigm and design KLEP, a knowledge-driven lane change prediction framework. KLEP incorporates driving knowledge into lane change modeling, presenting the top-down hierarchical cognitive process of drivers when performing lane change maneuvers. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world natural driving datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of KLEP. Compared to state-of-the-art lane change prediction baselines, KLEP consistently outperforms them and achieves average improvements of 6.2-7.1% and 53.0-67.2% on intention classification and intention forecast tasks across different datasets, respectively. We also validate that KLEP has strong interpretability that aligns with real-world physical laws in lane change scenarios and is lightweight enough to fulfill online prediction.},

  abstract     = {Discriminative correlation filter (DCF)-based tracking algorithms continue to advance in the field of UAV tracking due to their computational efficiency. The idea of integrating the advantages of historical information and response adjustments into the CF tracking framework is continuously being developed. However, maintaining the stability of mobile video tracking in highly dynamic environments is extremely challenging. This difficulty arises from frequent changes in targets and backgrounds, as well as the stochastic noise generated by the photon-counting process in sensors. In addition, the inconsistent rates of these changes are often overlooked and require further scrutiny. In this paper, we propose a dynamic sensitivity enhanced correlation filter with adaptive second-order difference spatial regularization to address the issue of inconsistent motion rates in dynamic videos. We use the non-local means algorithm to denoise template images before feature extraction, improving the discriminative power of target contours. Then, we incorporate the proposed dynamic-sensitivity error method into CF learning and employ a novel adaptive second-order difference spatial regularization to simultaneously optimize the filter coefficients and spatial regularization weights. This regularization effectively works in synergy with the dynamic-sensitivity error strategy. Furthermore, an additional ADMM optimizer is introduced to derive the solution, thereby improving the convergence and computational efficiency of the algorithm. This algorithm supports the adjustment of filter updates in dynamic environments by balancing consistency with previous filter templates and flexibility to accommodate rapid target changes. By conducting extensive experiments on three challenging UAV tracking databases, we compare the proposed model with existing models. The experimental results demonstrate our superior performance.

This study introduces a novel approach, specifically a dynamic control authority allocation method, for implementing shared control in autonomous vehicles. Unlike conventional mixed-initiative control techniques that blend human and vehicle inputs with weights determined by predefined index, the proposed method utilizes optimization-based techniques to obtain an optimal dynamic allocation for human and vehicle inputs that satisfies safety constraints. Specifically, a convex quadratic programm (QP) is constructed incorporating control barrier functions (CBF) for safety and control Lyapunov functions (CLF) for satisfying automated control objectives. The cost function of the QP is designed such that human weight increases with the magnitude of human input. A smooth control authority transition is obtained by optimizing over the change rate of the weight instead of the weight itself. The proposed method is verified in lane-changing scenarios with human-in-the-loop (HmIL) and hardware-in-the-loop (HdIL) experiments. Results show that the proposed method outperforms index-based control authority allocation method in terms of agility, safety and comfort.},

In this paper, we consider it is crucial to learn node-specific parameters and adaptive graphs with complete edge information. To show this, we design a model based on graph structure that decouples nodes and edges into two modules. Each module extracts temporal and spatial features simultaneously. The adaptive node optimization module is used to learn the specific parameter patterns of all nodes, and the adaptive edge optimization module aims to mine the interdependencies among different nodes. Then we propose a Decoupled Adaptive Graph Convolution Attention Network for Traffic Forecasting (DAGCAN), which relies on the above two modules to dynamically capture the fine-grained spatio-temporal relationships in traffic data.

In particular, vehicles’ authentication information is synchronized to target RSUs in advance for accelerating authentication, and lightweight cryptographic operations (i.e., hash function, hash-based message authentication, physical unclonable function, fuzzy extractor and symmetric encryption) are employed to ensure the high efficiency of AKA in terms of computation and communication overheads. The system efficiency and privacy are balanced through modeling the relationship between the frequency of pseudonym updates and the unlinkability of the vehicles’ new and old pseudonyms. Security analysis shows that LWAKA not only achieves anonymity, conditional privacy, pseudonym unlinkability, key escrow freeness, and physical security, but also resists against most known attacks. Comparative experimental results demonstrate that LWAKA outperforms existing schemes in terms of lightweight design.},

  abstract     = {Map matching is crucial to facilitating location-based services, and recent advancements in map matching have demonstrated excellent performance with high-quality data. However, the use of low-precision devices often introduces high measurement noise, and the slow update rate of maps may result in errors in digital maps. Consequently, multiple types of noise significantly impact the performance of map matching algorithms. To tackle this issue, this paper presents a novel multi-noise perception framework, named MPF, aiming to enhance the performance and robustness of existing map matching algorithms. The main challenge lies in detecting anomalies during map matching, identifying the root causes, and devising appropriate solutions. Firstly, we propose a matching quality assessment (MQA) method that assesses abnormal variance in matching probability. Secondly, we introduce a multiple noise discrimination (MND) mechanism to effectively differentiate between measurement noise and map errors. Thirdly, we present a missing segment generation (MSG) scheme that dynamically fills in map gaps to prevent significant detours. To validate the effectiveness of MPF, we conduct experiments using real-world taxi trajectories from four cities, covering a total distance of 79,670.6 km. MPF is compare with seven online map matching algorithms and is used to optimize their performance. The experiments show that MPF outperforms the top baselines by 15.6%-26.9% and enhances their performance by 18.7%-38.2%.},

  abstract     = {Conducting real-world train crash experiments is the most straightforward and effective method to research the train’s crashworthiness and enhance passive safety protection. As a non-contact measurement method, high-speed camera can efficiently capture the evolving motion patterns of trains under the high-speed states. Traditional data extraction methods rely on expert-based manual annotations, which are susceptible to factors such as illumination changes, scale variance, and shock debris. Inspired by the tremendous success of Deep Neural Networks in the computer vision community, we firstly collect 75 real-world train crash scenes and manually annotated them to form the Crash2024 dataset, enriching the community’s data resources. Moreover, we propose a novel Gradient-guided Joint representation loss with Adaptive neck Detection network (GJADet). At the macro level, we embed the adaptive module into the Path Aggregation Feature Pyramid Network, which combines multiple self-attention mechanisms to achieve scale-awareness, spatial-awareness, and task-awareness, improving the detector’s representation ability and alleviating the dense-small characteristics of the ‘point’ class without significant computational overhead. At the micro level, due to the extreme imbalance of ‘point’ class compared to other classes, we propose a gradient-guided joint representation classification loss to mitigate the long-tailed detection issue. Moreover, the classification and regression are joint representation to maintain consistency between training and inference phase. On the Crash2024, GJADet achieves the performance improvement of 3.5AP and significantly alleviate the accuracy loss problem for rare categories.

After a disaster, to quickly and optimally restore the damaged things, including physical systems (e.g., transport networks) and the environment, needs decision makers to own sufficient data/information. Unmanned vehicle detection systems (UVDS) are undoubtedly feasible tools in collecting such data in a harsh environment. The most important challenges in UVDS management are on modeling the UVDS data layer and multi-stage recovery strategies, which have received little research. To address such problems, this paper proposes a multi-stage control strategy for UVDS based on Internet of Things (IoT). The optimal decision is decided by utilizing four indicators: performance recovery efficiency, normal detection probability, operation cost, and economic benefit cost, respectively. The simulation results show that the proposed strategy improves the performance recovery efficiency by 12.1% and the normal detection probability by 3.9%, the operation cost declines by 58.4%, and the economic benefit cost by 75.9% compared with the general control strategy.},

By enhancing the perceptual capabilities of the model to accurately anticipate the actions of vulnerable road users, the overall driving experience can be significantly improved, ensuring higher levels of safety. Existing research efforts focusing on the prediction of pedestrians’ crossing intentions have predominantly relied on vision-based deep learning models. However, these models continue to exhibit shortcomings in terms of robustness when faced with adverse weather conditions and domain adaptation challenges. Furthermore, little attention has been given to evaluating the real-time performance of these models. To address these aforementioned limitations, this study introduces an innovative framework for pedestrian crossing intention prediction. The framework incorporates an image enhancement pipeline, which enables the detection and rectification of various defects that may arise during unfavorable weather conditions. Subsequently, a transformer-based network, featuring a self-attention mechanism, is employed to predict the crossing intentions of target pedestrians. This augmentation enhances the model’s resilience and accuracy in classification tasks. Through evaluation on the Joint Attention in Autonomous Driving (JAAD) dataset, our framework attains state-of-the-art performance while maintaining a notably low inference time. Moreover, a deployment environment is established to assess the real-time performance of the model. The results of this evaluation demonstrate that our approach exhibits the shortest model inference time and the lowest end-to-end prediction time, accounting for the processing duration of the selected inputs.},

Current techniques fail to account for vehicle interactions and trajectory data temporal dependencies; hence this research proposes a multi-model fusion-based lane-changing intention recognition framework for intelligent transportation. Using actual vehicle trajectory data from a dataset, the suggested model is verified and contrasted with several well used baseline models. According to the experimental findings, the lane change intention detection technique can greatly increase prediction accuracy by fusing attention processes, reinforcement learning-based CRF, and vehicle interaction data. The system’s main components are input processing and lane-changing intention recognition. Vehicle trajectory data is cleaned, labelled, sliced, and one-hot encoded during input processing BiLSTM-F model detects driver lane-change intent, enhanced by incorporating attention mechanism to the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network, the model may give changing weights to input processing section output. This lets the model focus on lane-changing intention-affecting factors. Finally, a Reinforcement Learning-based Conditional Random Field (CRF) efficiently determines the globally optimal lane-changing intention. This field fully represents input data temporal interdependence. The model was trained and tested on the public NGSIM dataset. Validation results show it can achieve up to 97.19% accuracy and predict a vehicle’s lane change intention with 94.16% accuracy, two seconds before the actual maneuver occurs. The suggested model outperforms baseline lane-changing intention recognition models in terms of accuracy, loss performance, F1 score, and stability.},

Therefore, this paper proposes a watermarking that can verify the integrity of copyright in response to the needs of ITS, termed ITSmark. ITSmark focuses on functions such as extracting watermarks, verifying permission, and tracing tampered locations. The scheme uses the copyright information to build the multi-bit space and divides this space into multiple segments. These segments will be assigned to tokens. Thus, the next token is determined by its segment which contains the copyright. In this way, the obtained data contains the custom watermark. To ensure the authorization, key parameters are encrypted during copyright embedding to obtain cipher data. Only by possessing the correct cipher data and private key, can the user entirely extract the watermark. Experiments show that ITSmark surpasses baseline performances in data quality, extraction accuracy, and unforgeability. It also shows unique capabilities of permission verification and tampered location tracing, which ensures the security of extraction and the reliability of copyright verification. Furthermore, ITSmark can also customize the watermark embedding position and proportion according to user needs, making embedding more flexible.},

Traditional methods for detecting abnormal ship behavior often suffer from inadequate feature extraction capabilities, leading to ineffective and inaccurate anomaly detection. To address this issue, this paper introduces a Transformer-GSA encoder detection model. This model enhances ship information data through BCE-GAN, extracts multi-layer convolutional features, and utilizes the Transformer-GSA module to capture the dependencies between trajectory features and time-series data, thereby effectively identifying abnormal ship behaviors.

These results confirm the model’s efficacy and superiority in detecting abnormal ship trajectories, contributing to the reduction of maritime accidents and illegal activities, alleviating the management burden on duty personnel, and enhancing the quality of intelligent ship traffic services and port operation efficiency under the maritime Internet of Things architecture.},

To detect real-time driving goals using AI for providing effective decision aids, this research introduces the Framework of Adaptive Driving (FAD), which considers cognitive activities and action strategies. We have outlined five driving goals to elucidate the connections between Situation Awareness (SA), and intentions. The study involved 31 participants and 573 driving simulation events, during which we collected both eye-tracking and kinetic data. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) identified 8 factors, categorized into SA and maneuver-related factors. Statistical and qualitative analysis follow up to specify the varying requirements among the driving foals defined. Generally, factor ‘Cognitive load’ can reflect cognitive activities, while ‘Saccade on the surroundings’ and ‘Saccade movement’ can indicate action strategies. For the goals where emerging risks are not a concern‘, Active acceleration’ signifies drivers’ intention to enhance driving efficiency. However, the diverse features in ‘Saccade on the surroundings’ imply varying driving considerations. Goals for routine tasks focus on internal vehicle operations, while goals for driving benefits management highlight adjacent surroundings. Conversely, for goals addressing emerging risks‘, Deceleration’ prevails. Furthermore‘, Steering strategy’ implies a preference for steering when SA is adequate. In this context, SA-related factors like ‘Front observation’, ‘Saccade movement’, and ‘Cognitive load’ signify efforts to enhance SA under time constraints. However, for the driving goals under extreme urgency, the factor ‘Lateral movement’ replaces ‘Steering strategy’, implying severe steering without adequate SA.},

  abstract     = {Effective multi-intersection collaboration is crucial for mitigating urban traffic congestion through reinforcement learning (RL)-based traffic signal control (TSC). Existing work mainly considers scenarios involving a single vehicle type, where cooperation is typically limited to neighboring intersections. However, in urban traffic scenarios where high priority vehicles coexist with ordinary vehicles, considering only a limited number of neighboring nodes may be insufficient to ensure the swift passage of high priority vehicles while minimizing the impact on overall traffic efficiency. Therefore, we formulate the multiple intersections’ decision-making process in urban scenarios as a Markov game and propose a novel centralized cooperative RL framework called MATLIT to solve the game. Specifically, we adopt a multi-agent transformer (MAT)-based architecture that facilitates efficient global cooperation among intersections. The attention mechanism and auto-regressive process of the MAT effectively mitigate the curse of the dimensionality problem, which guarantees MATLIT to tackle large-scale traffic scenarios. Meanwhile, the stability and sequence action generation capacity of the MAT-based architecture is further enhanced by incorporating MAT with a gated mechanism. Furthermore, considering the inherent topological constraints in urban traffic scenarios, we utilize graph attention networks (GATs) to capture graph-structured mutual influences. Additionally, in response to the urban traffic scenarios with various types of high priority vehicles that have time-varying priorities, we integrate the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm to enhance the exploration capabilities of our framework, allowing it to learn robust strategies in heterogeneous traffic conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed MATLIT framework outperforms all baselines and can reduce high priority vehicles’ waiting time by 24.57% while reducing the average waiting time of all vehicles by 18.51% in realistic urban scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Travel data containing personal identification information needs to be anonymized before being shared and analyzed for privacy considerations. While this approach protects personal privacy, it makes it difficult for researchers and planners to identify the same traveler from different databases and to construct complete multi-modal trips, which greatly reduces the value of data. To address this challenge, this paper develops TBLink, a method to match individual travelers between different modes. The underlying idea is that if a traveler makes a transfer, the spatiotemporal signatures of the previous and next trips will be similar and must satisfy certain conditions. When this pattern occurs for two travelers in the two datasets repeatedly, we can infer that the two travelers are actually the same person. The matching of travelers is regarded as a stable matching problem, and the Gale-Shapley algorithm is used to solve the problem. TBLink is demonstrated using metro and bus trip data from Chengdu City between January and March 2021. The results show that the precision, recall, and recovery rate of user matching are 80.83%, 92.82%, and 10.56% respectively, and the matching is more reliable as the dataset increases. Sensitivity analysis is performed to study the effect of several model parameters on the matching performance.},

  abstract     = {In the past decade, deep learning has been widely applied across various fields. However, its applicability in open-world scenarios is often limited due to the lack of quantifying uncertainty in both data and models. In recent years, a multitude of uncertainty quantification (UQ) approaches for neural networks have emerged and found applications in safety-critical domains such as autonomous vehicles and medical analysis. This paper aims to review the latest advancements in UQ methods and investigate their application specifically in the field of computer vision and autonomous vehicles. Initially, we identify several key qualifications, namely practicability, robustness, accuracy, scalability, and efficiency (referred to as PRASE), and employ them as evaluation criteria throughout this study. By considering these criteria as uniform measurements, we meticulously evaluate and compare the performance of different types of UQ methods, including Bayesian methods, ensemble methods, and single deterministic methods. Furthermore, we delve into the discussion of their application in diverse tasks within the autonomous vehicle domain, such as semantic segmentation, object detection, depth estimation, and end-to-end control. Through comprehensive analysis and comparison, we identify a range of challenges and propose future research directions in this field. Our findings shed light on the importance of addressing uncertainty quantification in deep learning models and provide insights into enhancing the reliability and performance of autonomous vehicles in real-world scenarios.},

This study proposes a BiGRU-Transformer model optimized with Beluga Whale Optimization (BWO) and combined with the Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF) for road surface unevenness recognition in intelligent transportation systems. The model addresses the limitations of existing methods in time series data processing and nonlinear state estimation. It uses BiGRU to model short-term vehicle vibration dependencies and incorporates the Transformer’s self-attention mechanism to capture long-term and global dynamics. BWO optimizes the global hyperparameters of the model, avoiding local optima and improving accuracy. CKF updates the noise matrix in real-time, enhancing prediction and generalization through recursive nonlinear state estimation. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in performance, including recognition accuracy, noise immunity, and convergence speed, when applied to real road datasets. The proposed model outperforms existing methods, offering enhanced road condition identification and providing effective real-time decision support for intelligent transportation systems, thereby improving management efficiency and responsiveness.},

Different from vehicle based trajectory recovery, it suffers from the heterogeneity and sparsity issues arising from the insufficient data labelled for distinct transportation modes (e.g., obtaining limited individual trajectories from modes like walking or cycling due to privacy concerns while obtaining rich vehicle trajectories from the mode like driving). To alleviate this, we develop a novel Cross-trAnsportation-mode Knowledge transfEr method with meta learning, coined as Cake, to first learn generalized parameters from source modes (i.e., the relatively dense modes) and then share the meta knowledge with the targets (i.e., more sparse modes), which significantly improve the recovery performance for the sparse. To achieve this, we first develop an efficient fine-GRAined Personalized trajectory rEcovery model called Grape, to incorporate the cross-granularity features with coarse-centered and fine-centered subgraph learning and learn the intrinsic characteristics of transportation modes with auto-correlation efficiently. Then we design a personalized memory to store distinct parameters for diverse interests of individual groups and read the memory for predictor’s input features according to the previous learnt features. At last, we employ the feature reuse strategy based on meta learning to iteratively make adaptions from the source to the target. Extensive experimental results on real-world dataset demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-arts for the sparse modes.},

  abstract     = {Vision-based intelligent systems are extensively used in autonomous driving, traffic monitoring, and transportation surveillance due to their high performance, low cost, and ease of installation. However, their effectiveness is often compromised by adverse conditions such as haze, fog, low light, motion blur, and low resolution, leading to reduced visibility and increased safety risks. Additionally, the prevalence of high-definition imaging in embedded and mobile devices presents challenges related to the conflict between large image sizes and limited computing resources. To address these issues and enhance visual perception for intelligent systems operating under adverse conditions, this study proposes an all-in-one isomorphic dual-branch (IDB) framework consisting of two branches with identical structures for different functions, a loss-attention (LA) learning strategy, and feature fusion super-resolution (FFSR) module. The versatile IDB network employs a simple and effective encoder-decoder structure as the backbone for both branches, which can be replaced with task-specific tailored backbones. The plug-in LA strategy differentiates the functions of the two branches, adapting them to various tasks without increasing computational demands during inference. The FFSR module concatenates multi-scale features and restores details progressively in downsampled images, producing outputs with improved visibility, brightness, edge sharpness, and color fidelity. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms several state-of-the-art methods for image dehazing, low-light enhancement, image deblurring, and super-resolution image reconstruction while maintaining low computational overhead.

  abstract     = {In the intelligent transportation system, the collected traffic data are usually incomplete. The low-rank completion models are effective in processing missing traffic data (MTD) imputation. However, the existing low-rank completion models encounter the following challenges: 1) Incorporating spatio-temporal information of traffic data often leads to significant time overhead; 2) To reduce the time overhead, some models based on the low-rank completion only embed the temporal information and discard the spatial information, thereby resulting in low imputation accuracy; 3) Missing traffic data carries complex spatio-temporal information, requiring multi-faceted analysis to extract valuable insights. To address these issues, we propose an efficient fourth-order dimension preserved tensor completion (FDPTC) with temporal constraint model. It works based on our proposed fourth-order dimension preserved (FDP) tensor decomposition model to capture the spatio-temporal information of traffic data from a high-dimensional perspective by extending dimensions. Additionally, we embed a temporal constraint into FDP tensor decomposition model to ensure consistency of MTD and introduce a non-negative constraint to accelerate convergence speed. By constructing this model, we successfully avoid direct operations on the extra information matrix/tensor, thereby optimizing efficiency. Experimental results on four real traffic datasets demonstrate that our proposed model achieves significantly higher imputation accuracy at an affordable computational burden compared with state-of-the-art models.},

In this study, we propose an innovative unified multimodal LiDAR segmentation network, named Align and Blend (A2Blend for short), which skillfully integrates three representative forms of point clouds: point view, voxel view, and range view. The core innovation of A2Blend lies in addressing two primary tasks: Align and Blend. For the “Align” task, we have carefully designed a learnable cross-modal association module, whose core is a unique “Cross-Modal Triplet Alignment Loss” mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of such a mechanism in the field of LiDAR segmentation. This mechanism applies principles from contrastive learning, promoting the tight clustering of similar semantic groups both within and across modalities, while increasing the separation between dissimilar groups by expanding the distance between similar and dissimilar sample clusters in the feature space. This significantly enhances the discriminative power and representational capacity of the feature embeddings. For the “Blend” task, we propose a fusion strategy that integrates intragroup self-attention within modalities and intergroup self-attention across modalities. This approach combines key concepts from standard self-attention and cross-self-attention mechanisms to achieve more comprehensive multimodal fusion. The segmentation performance on two large-scale outdoor datasets and one indoor dataset surpasses that of most state-of-the-art algorithms.},

To solve the above challenges, we contrive Discrete Cosine Transform Network(DCTNet), in which the discrete cosine transform boundary representation method is proposed to convert the scene text boundary in the spatial domain to the frequency domain, and then generate the exact scene text boundary through the inverse discrete cosine transformation, thus solving the geometric representation and overlapping problems of arbitrary shape boundaries. The backbone is designed based on Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training(CLIP) to extract refined features. At the same time, the combined Deformable Convolutional Networks(DCN) in the detection head of DCTNet adaptively perceives categories and edge features. DCTNet has achieved SOTA performances on Total-Text and MSRA-TD500, corresponding to F1 of 90.8% and 89.6%, respectively.

This work studies the optimal real-time bidding strategy for an EV aggregator. Since the charging process of EVs is time-coupled, it is necessary for EV aggregators to consider future operational conditions (e.g., future EV arrivals) when deciding the current bidding strategy. However, accurately forecasting future operational conditions is challenging under the inherent uncertainties. Hence, there demands a real-time bidding strategy based solely on the up-to-date information, which is the main goal of this work. We start by developing an online optimal EV charging management algorithm for the EV aggregator via Lyapunov optimization. Based on this, an optimal real-time bidding strategy (bidding function and bounds) for the aggregator is derived. Then, an efficient yet practical algorithm is proposed to obtain the bidding strategy. It shows that the cost of the aggregator is nearly offline optimal with the proposed bidding strategy. Moreover, the wholesale electricity market clearing result aligns with the individual aggregator’s optimal charging strategy given the prices. Case studies against several benchmarks are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.},

However, substantial differences between CAVs and the prior knowledge can significantly diminish the evaluation efficiency. In response to this issue, existing studies predominantly concentrate on the adaptive design of testing scenarios during the CAV testing process. Yet, these methods have limitations in their applicability to high-dimensional scenarios. To overcome this challenge, we develop an adaptive testing environment that bolsters evaluation robustness by incorporating multiple surrogate models and optimizing the combination coefficients of these surrogate models to enhance evaluation efficiency. We formulate the optimization problem as a regression task utilizing quadratic programming. To efficiently obtain the regression target via reinforcement learning, we propose the dense reinforcement learning method and devise a new adaptive policy with high sample efficiency. Essentially, our approach centers on learning the values of critical scenes displaying substantial surrogate-to-real gaps. The effectiveness of our method is validated in high-dimensional overtaking scenarios, demonstrating that our approach achieves notable evaluation efficiency.},

Especially for thin and irregular cracks with random and expansive topologies, the loss functions used in current deep learning-based crack segmentation models are sensitive to single pixels, which tends to cause the model to overfit the training data, diminishing its generalization ability in real-world scenarios. Therefore, we take the loss function as a starting point and explore the introduction of proactive fault tolerance mechanisms into the training process of the crack segmentation model, which is called Proactive Fault Tolerance Loss (PFT Loss), to enhance the generalization capability of model in actual applications. Specifically, the PFT Loss function establishes correlations between the segmentation prediction pixels and the corresponding labeled pixels within the neighborhood window using Markov Random Fields (MRFs). The correlation is used as a reference for predicting relative shifts in segmented pixels. Proactive Fault Tolerance is performed on the loss between labeling and prediction to achieve a more natural and adaptive training method for crack segmentation. Full experiments are conducted on five public crack datasets and one self-constructed dataset. The experimental results indicate that the model trained with PFT Loss has better segmentation performance compared to other loss functions.},

In OPRSP, customer orders are reorganized into multiple order batches, each allocated to a picking station and treated as an aggregated order. A multi-station visit policy is employed to allow one rack carried by a robot to visit multiple picking stations. A variable neighborhood search-based algorithm is proposed to solve OPRSP. Seven neighborhood structures are specifically devised for OPRSP. Some heuristic algorithms, including order batching algorithm, rack selection algorithm, order batch allocation algorithm, robot task assignment algorithm, and robot scheduling algorithm, are newly devised for initial solution generation and neighborhood structures. The superior performance of the proposed method is validated through a series of experiments and comparisons with other approaches.

Presently, the methods employed to protect the location privacy of source nodes within UASNs face challenges such as limited network security duration, high node energy consumption, and prolonged data transmission delays. Additionally, security research has predominantly focused on passive attacks, with insufficient provisions against active threats. To address these issues, this study proposes a polygonal phantom source position privacy protection algorithm based on a secure zone (PPSZ) in autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)-aided UASNs. First, a polygonal secure zone is defined with the source node at its center. Phantom nodes are strategically selected from nodes situated outside this zone, leveraging the relative angles between nodes to deter passive attacks while mitigating data transmission delays. Next, the selection of relay nodes is optimized using the Q-learning algorithm, where each node adjusts its selection strategy based on real-time feedback, further lowering node energy consumption. Finally, auxiliary nodes are deployed using a nonuniform clustering strategy to collectively transmit interference signals, effectively disrupt active attacks, and ensure the secure transmission of source data. Simulation results demonstrate that the PPSZ algorithm can better balance the relationships among safety time, node energy consumption, and data transmission delays.},

  abstract     = {Traffic signs recognition (TSR) plays an essential role in assistant driving and intelligent transportation system. However, the noise of complex environment may lead to motion-blur or occlusion problems, which raise the tough challenge to real-time recognition with high accuracy and robust. In this article, we propose IECES-network which with improved encoders and Siamese net. The three-stage approach of our method includes Efficient-CNN based encoders, Siamese backbone and the fully-connected layers. We firstly use convolutional encoders to extract and encode the traffic sign features of augmented training samples and standard images. Then, we design the Siamese neural network with Efficient-CNN based encoder and contrastive loss function, which can be trained to improve the robustness of TSR problem when facing the samples of motion-blur and occlusion by computing the distance between inputs and templates. Additionally, the template branch of the proposed network can be stopped when executing the recognition tasks after training to raise the process speed of our real-time model, and alleviate the computational resource and parameter scale. Finally, we recombined the feature code and a fully-connected layer with SoftMax function to classify the codes of samples and recognize the category of traffic signs.

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a novel multi-agent federated deep reinforcement learning (MA-FDRL) framework designed to minimize vehicular task offloading latency in electrified road (eROAD) environments. The solution integrates inductive coil-based wireless power transfer (WPT) systems with full duplex multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) vehicular networks, enabling continuous charging and reducing computational delays for electric vehicles (EVs) on eROADs. The MA-FDRL framework optimizes the offloading of vehicular tasks, with support from base stations (BS), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and satellites, while ensuring data privacy through differential privacy techniques. By intelligently distributing resources across these supporting entities, the framework enhances the efficiency of task processing. Key challenges such as dynamic wireless charging, intermittent BS coverage, and privacy-preserving task offloading are addressed using a comprehensive WPT framework, a mobility model, and a differential privacy-enhanced MA-FDRL algorithm. The proposed MA-FDRL solution effectively reduces the latency of vehicle task offloading by 17.05% over proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm, ensures balanced task distribution between edge servers, and offers a scalable and privacy-preserving approach for future autonomous electric vehicles and connected wireless environments.},

  abstract     = {Railway object intrusion poses a significant threat to railway safety, so it is vital to monitor the obstacles within the track area in real-time to prevent accidents, which can be achieved by vision-based technologies. However, most existing vision-based railway obstacle detection algorithms are limited to stationary cameras, which restricts the monitoring range. In contrast, onboard approaches enable full-line monitoring but face more challenges in achieving high accuracy and real-time performance. To address these challenges, we developed an onboard end-to-end multitask perception model (MTP-Rail), which includes variants of different scales (S, M, L) to realize railway obstacle detection in real-time with high accuracy. Our model consists of two decoders, which can simultaneously implement the tasks of object of interest detection and track segmentation. In addition, we designed a post-processing scheme to analyze the relationship between the detected object and the track and assess the obstacle risk level. Experiments on our dataset show that one of the proposed model MTP-rail-M achieved an 89.6% classification accuracy of obstacle risk level and 54.3% on mAP, 78.6% on mPA and 64.9% on mIoU with an inference speed of 181 FPS at an input size of $640\times640$ on RTX 3060Ti. Our model is easy to install and deploy, highlighting its potential in engineering applications. The code is available on https://github.com/ccl-1/obstacle_detection.},

First, by analyzing the effects of nonlinear tire dynamics on path tracking performance, the tire cornering stiffnesses are treated as unknown parameters in the modeling process, which contributes to improving the robustness of the vehicle control system. Second, to handle the unknown tire cornering stiffness in system matrices and control coefficients, an adaptive fixed-time path tracking control strategy with high-gain observer-based output feedback is developed. Different from the existing methods, the lower bounds of unknown control coefficients are incorporated into the Lyapunov function to effectively eliminate the requirement of tire cornering stiffness and their bounds information. Moreover, the full state constraints, formulated based on the vehicle stability margins, are taken into account to enhance the dynamic stability of the vehicle. Based on the barrier Lyapunov stability theory, it is proven that the designed adaptive backstepping controller guarantees the fixed-time stability of the closed-loop system, and that all vehicle states remain within the constraints of stability region. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is demonstrated through simulation and comparison results.},

  abstract     = {We propose a robust control method for vehicle platoons based on a unified spacing policy, which can be customized for different vehicles within the platoon. This spacing policy integrates the constant time headway (CTH) and constant spacing (CS) policies into a single framework with some modifications. The policy can be adjusted to resemble either a CTH-like or CS-like approach by simply tuning a weighting factor for each vehicle. To increase road throughput, the velocity difference between the current vehicle’s velocity and the preceding vehicle’s low-pass filtered velocity is introduced to the proposed policy. A second-order low-pass filter is used for the preceding vehicle’s velocity. As a result, the sliding variable for each vehicle’s spacing error only requires the current vehicle’s position, velocity, acceleration, and the preceding vehicle’s position and velocity, all of which can be measured by onboard sensors. This design reduces the platoon’s reliance on inter-vehicle communication. A predefined-time modification is introduced to eliminate nonzero initial conditions in spacing and velocity errors, thereby improving transient performance. The local controller for each vehicle is based on a third-order nonlinear system model that accounts for nonlinear disturbances and engine lag. A smoothed sliding mode robust controller is then designed for each vehicle to stabilize its spacing error. The input-to-state stability (ISS) property of the spacing error is established through rigorous theoretical analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical strong frequency domain string stability (PSFSS) of the entire vehicle platoon, focusing on signal oscillations along the platoon. Finally, extensive numerical studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Although many existing studies have made efforts to reconstruct OD flow from passenger counts at each station, few of them tracked individual passengers because it is still infeasible in practice to monitor all onboard passengers throughout their entire journeys. This study proposes a passenger reidentification method for estimating route-level bus passenger OD flow using video images at bus doors. All boarding and alighting passengers are identified and their appearance features are extracted from video images. Boarding passengers at upstream stations and alighting passengers at downstream stations are matched considering not only the similarities of their appearance features but also historical alighting probabilities. Reliable passenger matches are filtered out by a matching probability threshold. The corresponding accurate OD samples, together with the boarding and alighting counts at each station, are utilized to estimate OD flow between bus stations. A comprehensive case study was carried out on an operational bus route in Shanghai, China during morning and evening peak hours over 15 weekdays. Results of the case study showed that the proposed method is capable of generating accurate OD estimates, with cosine similarities remaining above 0.9, root mean square errors within 0.5 person, and mean absolute percentage errors of approximately 12%. The error metrics were decreased by nearly half compared to the traditional method that only uses the boarding and alighting counts.},

  abstract     = {Timely detection and treatment of road cracks are crucial to prevent further deterioration of pavement. An accurate road crack detection algorithm can significantly reduce the human resources required for pavement maintenance. However, existing CNN-based object detectors, such as the You Only Look Once (YOLO) series of algorithms, face challenges such as receptive field fixation and information loss during feature extraction, resulting in lower accuracy in road crack detection. Therefore, we propose the Selective Dynamic Feature Compensation-YOLO (SDFC-YOLO) algorithm for pavement distress detection. Firstly, we introduce the Dynamic Downsampling Module (DDM), which adaptively adjusts the sampling positions of the convolutional kernel during the feature extraction process, addressing the issue of a fixed receptive field. Secondly, we propose a novel feature fusion method compensating for lost feature information in the path aggregation network. Lastly, we design a multi-scale weight selection module based on the above feature fusion method. It aims to utilize the channel weights of high-level features to guide bottom-level features and select more important features for compensation, thereby further enhancing detection accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to the benchmark model YOLOv8s, our method improves Precision (P), Recall (R), mean Average Precision@0.5 (mAP@0.5), and F1 score on the UAPD dataset by 6.8%, 2.4%, 5.3%, and 4.3%, respectively. Similarly, on the UAV-PDD2023 dataset, the aforementioned metrics are enhanced by 3.1%, 4.4%, 2.7%, and 3.8%, respectively. Furthermore, our method takes only 10.53ms to process a 1280 $\times$ 1280 resolution image, which fully meets the requirement of real-time detection.},

  abstract     = {The accuracy and stability of motion prediction are crucial for the safe planning of autonomous driving systems. The widely used attention mechanisms effectively improve prediction accuracy. However, their computational cost grows quadratically with sequence length, presenting challenges for handling complex, large-scale scenarios. The attention patterns of motion prediction tasks exhibit significant data-related sparsity, indicating that not all scene elements are worth interaction. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel motion prediction framework that enhances the efficiency and stability of interaction fusion while achieving promising prediction accuracy. Firstly, an adaptive self-distillation attention module based on sparse interaction graph is designed. This module adaptively filters high-value sequences for each target to achieve sparse attention calculation and balance scene scale. Due to the lack of interaction labels in the original dataset, a self-distillation strategy is employed for model training. Secondly, a multi-stage dynamic anchor decoder is introduced that leverages the information filtering and aggregation capabilities of the sparse attention mechanism to improve prediction accuracy. The decoder dynamically updates the target anchor representations as the prediction progresses, ensuring consistency between interaction states and the prediction process in long-term forecasting. This approach effectively focuses attention calculation on the most relevant scene context fusion and trajectory decoding at each prediction stage. Validation results on Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive accuracy while effectively reducing computational resource consumption. The proposed method can also serve as a plug-in that can be seamlessly incorporated into standard motion prediction pipelines to optimize scene interaction, making it more friendly to low-cost devices.},

Recent research has focused on vision-based deep neural networks for this task, but challenges remain. First, current methods suffer from low efficiency in multi-feature fusion and unreliable predictions under challenging conditions. Additionally, real-time performance is essential in practical applications, so the efficiency of the algorithm is crucial. To address these issues, we propose a novel architecture, Dual-STGAT, which uses a dual-level spatio-temporal graph network to extract pedestrian pose and scene interaction features, reducing information loss and improving feature fusion efficiency. The model captures key features of pedestrian behavior and the surrounding environment through two modules: the Pedestrian Module and the Scene Module. The Pedestrian Module extracts pedestrian motion features using a spatio-temporal graph attention network, while the Scene Module models interactions between pedestrians and surrounding objects by integrating visual, semantic, and motion information through a graph network. Extensive experiments conducted on the PIE and JAAD datasets show that Dual-STGAT achieves over 90% accuracy in pedestrian crossing intention prediction, with inference latency close to 5ms, making it well-suited for large-scale production autonomous driving systems that demand both performance and computational efficiency.},

In the B5G era, energy efficiency will be a prominent feature of Radio Access Network (RAN) slicing for achieving sustainable networks and lowering operational costs while multiplexing users with heterogeneous Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements. Considering the importance of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) within the realm of B5G applications, in this paper, we propose the LazyRAN framework as an energy-efficient Radio Resource Block (RRB) allocation approach for multi-policy RAN slicing in B5G ITS edge networks. Initially, we focus on resource utilization efficiency and define Lazy Skip Markov Decision Process (LS-MDP) formulation for spectrum agents to individually perform fine and coarse stochastic control depending on performance requirements incorporating varying levels of laziness. Followingly, we propose LazyRAN framework that uses Bayesian Optimization (BO) based Offline Policy Selection (OPS) for optimality calculations in case of multiple slicing policies. Our framework enables efficient multi-policy evaluation employing both exploration and exploitation in the agent policy space. The OPS method utilizes a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate function combining logged data with online agent interactions before searching for the best slicing policy with BO. Using an energy-aware approach, hybrid QoS reward per energy consumption (HQEC), we compare the performance of LazyRAN framework in centralized and decentralized settings considering diverse agent policies. Our results show that the proposed scheme can significantly improve energy utilization with greater HQEC and higher throughput measurements while satisfying hybrid QoS demands.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle detection at night is a crucial task in Intelligent Transportation Systems. Due to the complex lighting environment, vehicle detection at night remains a challenging task. Headlights and taillights are essential cues to identify vehicles at night. However, existing methods struggle to effectively utilize the light information of the vehicle. This paper proposes a novel highlight-guided framework to identify vehicles, named HighlightNet, by utilizing both the illumination data from the vehicle lights and the reflective properties of vehicles. The framework combines vehicle detection and highlight area recognition via dual-branch joint learning. To ensure that both branches focus on the highlighted regions, Feature Similarity Awareness Attention (FSAA) is introduced to capture the common attention regions of different branches. Highlight Region Perception (HRP) is proposed to exclude streetlights and other reflective illuminations from the FSAA output, which generates a mask map capable of differentiating the foreground from the background of highlighted areas. It improves the allocation of feature weights and adaptively modifies the distribution within the dual-branch configuration. Furthermore, to address the severe pixel imbalance between the highlighted area and the background, Adaptive Spatial Balance (ASB) loss is introduced to allocate the attention towards prospective vehicle regions while diminishing the emphasis on background regions. Extensive experiments conducted on the BDD100K-Night dataset and a newly acquired dataset specifically designed for nighttime surveillance, called the NightVehicle dataset, demonstrate that HighlightNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for nighttime vehicle detection.},

  abstract     = {The escalating complexity of urban transportation systems, increased by traffic congestion, diverse transportation modalities, and shifting commuter preferences, necessitates developing more sophisticated analytical frameworks. Traditional computational approaches often struggle with the voluminous datasets generated by real-time sensor networks, and they generally lack the precision needed for accurate traffic prediction and efficient system optimization. Therefore, we integrate quantum computing techniques to enhance Vehicle Road Cooperation Systems (VRCS). By leveraging quantum algorithms, specifically $UU^{\dagger}$ and variational $UU^{\dagger}$, in conjunction with quantum image encoding methods such as Flexible Representation of Quantum Images (FRQI) and Novel Enhanced Quantum Representation (NEQR), we propose an optimized Quantum Neural Network (QNN). The QNN features adjustments in its entangled layer structure and training duration to handle traffic data processing complexities better. Empirical evaluations on two traffic datasets show that our model achieves superior classification accuracies of 97.42% and 84.08% and demonstrates remarkable robustness in various noise conditions. Our study underscores the potential of quantum-enhanced 6G solutions in streamlining complex transportation systems, highlighting the pivotal role of quantum technologies in advancing intelligent transportation solutions.},

  abstract     = {Driving an Autonomous Vehicle (AV) in dynamic traffic is a critical task, as the overtaking maneuver being considered one of the most complex due to involvement of several sub-maneuvers. Recent advances in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) have resulted in AVs exhibiting exceptional performance in addressing overtaking-related challenges. However, the intricate nature of the overtaking presents difficulties for a RL agent to proficiently handle all its sub-maneuvers that include left lane change, right lane change and straight drive. Furthermore, the dynamic traffic restricts the RL agents to execute the sub-maneuvers at critical checkpoints involved in overtaking. To address this, we propose an approach inspired by semi-Markov options, called Dynamic Option Policy enabled Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning (DOP-HDRL). This innovative approach allows the selection of sub-maneuver agents using a single dynamic option policy, while employing individual DRL agents specifically trained for each sub-maneuver to perform tasks during overtaking in dynamic environments. By breaking down overtaking maneuvers into several sub-maneuvers and controlling them using a single policy, the DOP-HDRL approach reduces training time and computational load compared to classical DRL agents. Moreover, DOP-HDRL easily integrates basic traffic safety rules into overtaking maneuvers to offer more robust solutions. The DOP-HDRL approach is rigorously evaluated through multiple overtaking and non-overtaking scenarios inspired by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) pre-crash scenarios in the CARLA simulator. On an average, the DOP-HDRL approach shows 100% completion rate, 14% least collision rate, 25% optimal clearance distance, and 7% more average speed compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Traffic forecasting is the foundation of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). In recent, graph neural networks (GNNs) have successfully captured spatial-temporal dependencies to forecast traffic conditions by transforming traffic data in the graph domain. Nevertheless, the existing methods focus only on learning informative graph representations and fail to model informative graph structures, which hinders the capture of dynamic spatial-temporal dependencies caused by dynamic factors such as weather, accidents, and special events. In this paper, we propose a novel task-oriented Spatial Graph Structure Learning (SGSL) method, which aims to capture dynamic dependencies by jointly learning graph structures and graph representations. Compared to methods that use spectral graph representations, we exploit a learnable spatial graph to effectively model dynamic dependencies in traffic data. Moreover, we directly define graph convolutions on spatial relations to specify different edge weights when aggregating the information of spatial neighbours. Thus, the graph structure alterations, i.e., the relation changes, and the time-varying weights of relations can be encapsulated, thereby effectively representing dynamic dependencies. The gradient descent strategy is introduced to periodically learn a spatial graph through joint optimization with a newly designed deep graph learning model named GAT-nLSTM. In this manner, the intrinsic behaviours of nodes are learned to capture correlations across periods. Notably, the optimization process is performed under the traffic forecasting constraint to ensure that the learned spatial graph is specific to this task. Compared with those of state-of-the-art baselines, the experimental results obtained on real-world traffic datasets show significant improvement, which verifies the superiority of the proposed SGSL.},

This paper focuses on leveraging RIS to address the key obstacles encountered in vehicle communication.

The basic system model consists of a radio frequency (RF) transmitter and an RIS, both serving as the transmission source. The signal is transmitted to a relay, which subsequently forwards it to multi-antenna-equipped vehicles via an amplify-and-forward (AF) scheme. We provide a thorough performance analysis of the system, deriving expressions for the outage probability and the average channel capacity.

  abstract     = {Detecting small objects in optical images and videos is a significant challenge in numerous intelligent transportation and autonomous systems. State-of-the-art generic object detection methods fail to accurately localize and identify such small objects (e.g., pedestrians, small vehicles, obstacles). Because small objects occupy only a small area in the input image (e.g., 32×32 pixels or less), the information extracted from such a small area is not always rich enough to support decision-making. Multidisciplinary strategies are being developed by researchers working at the interface of deep learning and computer vision to enhance the performance of Small Object Detection (SOD). In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of over 160 research papers published between 2017 and 2022 in order to survey this growing subject. This paper summarizes the existing literature and provides a taxonomy that illustrates the broad picture of current research. We further explore methods to boost the performance of small object detection in maritime settings, where enhanced performance is crucial for ensuring safety and managing traffic. Detecting small objects in the maritime environment requires additional considerations and the current survey aims to review the advanced techniques addressing those aspects. In addition, the popular SOD datasets for generic and maritime applications are discussed, and also well-known evaluation metrics for the state-of-the-art methods on some of the datasets are provided.

This article proposes a privacy-preserving traffic signal control strategy based on secure multi-party computation. The design uses multiple computing servers and a secret sharing scheme to encrypt traffic data into several shares, each corresponding to a server. The servers then securely compute the green time plans, working directly on the encrypted data. The proposed method protects traffic data from curious computing servers and external eavesdroppers, preventing the adversaries from gaining the required information to launch a complex attack. Additionally, a detection and recovery procedure from false data injection attacks on green time signals is presented using secret reconstruction from different server combinations. Simulation results for various scenarios demonstrate the proposed method’s effectiveness in maintaining data confidentiality while achieving the same performance as an unprotected control strategy, with a reasonable addition to computation time. It also depicts a significant reduction in vulnerability against falsified green time signal attacks in terms of total travel time in the network.},

  abstract     = {Human-driven Vehicles (HVs) and Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) will inevitably coexist in the future, resulting in mixed traffic conditions. Modeling car-following behavior in such mixed traffic is crucial for better understanding the differences in driving behavior between AVs and HVs, thereby facilitating the development of AV driving strategies to enhance traffic safety. In such mixed traffic, the car-following modes typically include AVs following HVs, HVs following HVs and HVs following AVs. Previous studies have compared the driving behavior of HVs following HVs and HVs following AVs, but few have considered the driving behavior of AVs following HVs in the comparison. To bridge this gap, this paper first decomposes car-following events in mixed traffic extracted from a Lyft level-5 dataset into driving primitives using the Hidden Markov Model with Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM-HMM). Then, the Latent Dirichlet Allocation with GMM (GMM-LDA) is introduced to cluster the driving primitives into different car-following behavior patterns. Based on the identified patterns, the differences across the three car-following modes are further explored. The results show that the driving behavior under three car-following modes differs from each other. Specifically, compared to the HVs following HVs mode, in the AVs following HVs mode, AVs tend to maintain car-following behavior patterns with a longer distance gap and adopt a lower speed to ensure safety. This study offers a comprehensive understanding of car-following behavior in mixed traffic, which will facilitate the development of human-like driving strategies for AVs and enhance the safety of mixed traffic.},

However, existing array self-position determination methods show decrease in performance under multipath environments. To deal with this problem, we propose an array self-position determination method based on orthogonal grid matching with the spatial differencing method. Specifically, the direction of arrival (DOA) of direct path and multipath signals are respectively estimated by array spatial differencing method. The matching accuracy is enhanced by utilizing the prior information of direct path signal. After calculating correlation coefficients of different sources, estimated angles with high correlation are then classified into the same set. Then, the noise subspace of each angle set is reconstructed and the position is estimated by grid matching with the orthogonal property between the noise subspaces and the characteristic steering vectors. The matching results of redundant angle sets are removed as non-matching items, thus averting positioning deviations. The simulation results demonstrate that the computational complexity of the proposed method is comparable to that of the signal subspace fitting (SSF). Moreover, in terms of positioning precision, the proposed method outperforms multiple signal classification with enhanced spatial smoothing (ESSMUSIC), initial signal fitting (ISF), and SSF.},

Previous attempts to enhance security, such as dynamic anonymization and trusted key management, have introduced new challenges, including complex authentication processes, high resource demands, and inadequate privacy protection. To overcome these issues, we propose a lightweight and efficient authentication scheme that enhances vehicle privacy and security through a combination of signatures, pseudonyms, batch verification, and flexible certificate management. Our approach also employs Bloom filters to improve authentication efficiency, addressing the limitations of traditional certificate management systems that suffer from large lists and slow query times. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme ensures comprehensive security by providing two-way authentication and guaranteeing anonymity. It effectively prevents replay attacks, DoS attacks, and other potential threats. Moreover, the scheme significantly reduces both communication and computational overhead, offering an efficient and secure solution for V2R communication in VANET.},

  abstract     = {Accurate environmental perception is essential for the effective operation of autonomous vehicles. However, visual images captured in dynamic environments or adverse weather conditions often suffer from various degradations. Image restoration focuses on reconstructing clear and sharp images by eliminating undesired degradations from corrupted inputs. These degradations typically vary in size and severity, making it crucial to employ robust multi-scale representation learning techniques. In this paper, we propose Multi-Scale Feature Modulation (MSFM), a novel deep convolutional architecture for image restoration. MSFM modulates multi-scale features in both frequency and spatial domains to make features sharper and closer to that of clean images. Specifically, our multi-scale frequency attention module transforms features into multiple scales and then modulates each scale in the implicit frequency domain using pooling and attention. Moreover, we develop a multi-scale spatial modulation module to refine pixels with the guidance of local features. The proposed frequency and spatial modules enable MSFM to better handle degradations of different sizes. Experimental results demonstrate that MSFM achieves state-of-the-art performance on 12 datasets for a range of image restoration tasks, i.e., image dehazing, image defocus/motion deblurring, and image desnowing. Furthermore, the restored images significantly improve the environmental perception of autonomous vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Ship dangerous situations result from the fact that some ships encounter complex conditions in confined waters and, therefore, ship collision risk assessment is important to support maritime traffic monitoring and control tasks at Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) centres. This paper proposes a ship collision risk assessment method using radar sequential images in inland waterways or congested coastal areas. Specifically, ship targets are separated from radar images using a background subtraction algorithm, as radar echoes have limited colour, texture, and shape features. The ship trajectory is then obtained by predicting and matching the ship’s position in two adjacent frames, which provides the ship’s spatial-temporal dynamic information for collision risk assessment. The ship collision risk is quantified by integrating the Distance and Time at the Closest Point of Approach (DCPA/TCPA) indicators, and the safe and prohibited velocity space of every ship is presented to assist VTS operators in evaluating the traffic conditions and support their decisions for safe navigation. The proposed ship collision risk assessment and visualisation method is tested and verified using radar sequential images collected in the Yangtze River.},

  abstract     = {Assessing driver stress can enhance Autonomous Vehicles’ (AVs) ability to recognize potential hazards in human-machine cooperative driving. In this study, we use a scene graph technique from the driver’s perspective as an intermediate representation for stress assessment, effectively modeling the complexity of real driving scenarios. We develop a dynamic scene graph readout model based on Global Context-Aware Attention (GCAA) to capture the spatiotemporal variability of the environment. Our approach integrates a Multi-Relational Graph Convolution Network (MR-GCN) and a Long-Short Term Memory Network (LSTM) to evaluate driver stress using field data from Nanjing, China. Results show that our model significantly improves driver stress classification, particularly for critical stress levels, with a 65.3% increase in balanced accuracy and a 38% rise in F-score compared to the baseline. The addition of GCAA enhances accuracy further, with an average improvement of 51.7%. This demonstrates our model’s superior ability to understand the contextual relationships within driving scenarios, making it highly effective for AVs to assess driver status in complex situations and interact more efficiently with human drivers. Furthermore, our model achieves a balance between accuracy and inference speed, making it suitable for real-time assessment tasks.},

The HMPC framework we introduce leverages centralized edge computing for efficient merge decision optimization through a dynamic-programming approach and decentralized mobile computing for distributed trajectory planning through three different optimization algorithms. Simulation results show that compared to open-loop control, the proposed framework can ensure system efficient ramp-merging control, and exhibits robustness in the presence of uncertainty caused by the stochastic driving behaviors of HVs. In addition, it is found that mobile-edge hybrid framework can reduce the computational time to the millisecond-level, potentially meeting real-time computational requirements.},

  abstract     = {In complex traffic scenarios, several factors including lighting, weather, the size of the traffic participants, the distance between the traffic participants and the camera, and occlusions impact the features of the traffic participants. The impact of these factors is a huge challenge, especially for vision-based instance segmentation networks. To this end, this paper proposes an enhanced version of the RTMDet to promote the overall performance of instance segmentation in complex traffic scenarios. Firstly, an extended CSP-style backbone with large kernel convolutions of different kernel sizes is used to enhance the robustness of feature extraction capability, which contributes to obtaining more information about traffic objects of different scales. Secondly, a plugin pre-fusion module is designed to enhance the network’s robustness to multi-scale changes caused by distance changes. Additionally, instance kernel distinguish module is proposed to further highlight and distinguish different instance objects under poor lighting or weather and occlusion situations. Finally, the existing advanced image generation technology is used to expand the BDD100k dataset, enriching the dataset with severe scenarios. With an input resolution of $\mathbf{1280}\times\mathbf{720}$ on the expanded BDD100K dataset, the proposed RTMDet-R achieves an accuracy of 25.4% mAP on the instance mask and 27.8% mAP on the instance box. This surpasses other similar models in terms of accuracy. Additionally, it maintains a good inference speed of 23.1 FPS, achieving the trade-off between accuracy and speed.

However, in some unstructured environments, the point cloud registration cannot constrain the poses of the LiDAR due to its sparse geometric features, which leads to the degeneracy of multi-sensor fusion accuracy. To address this problem, we propose a novel real-time approach to sense and compensate for the degeneracy of LiDAR. Firstly, this paper introduces the degeneracy factor with clear meaning, which can measure the degeneracy of LiDAR. Then, the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) clustering method adaptively perceives the degeneracy with better environmental generalization. Finally, the degeneracy perception results are utilized to fuse LiDAR and IMU, thus effectively resisting degeneracy effects. Experiments on our dataset show the method’s high accuracy and robustness and validate our algorithm’s adaptability to different environments and LiDAR scanning modalities.},

While ensuring that each follower USV can quickly form a formation and follow the virtual leader on the desired trajectory, it reduces the execution frequency of the controller, decreases the control amplitude, and saves communication resources. Firstly, a distributed event-triggered extended state observer (ESO) is designed to observe the virtual leader’s position information, and another ESO is used to estimate the quantized state information of each USV and the uncertainty terms existing in the model. Subsequently, the kinematic guidance law and the kinetic control laws based on a time-varying threshold event-triggered mechanism are proposed in quantized environment using the hierarchical design approach. In addition, the linear splitting of the input quantization makes the designed controller no longer require a priori information on the quantization parameters. Finally, the stability of the designed distributed USV formation tracking control system with input and state quantization based on the time-varying threshold event-triggered mechanism is demonstrated by input-to-state stability theory, and the absence of Zeno behavior in the proposed control strategy is also verified. Three sets of simulation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and scientific validity of the proposed method.},

To mitigate these undesirable consequences, modern railway locomotives are equipped with on-board anti-slip control systems. In this study, three different anti-slip controller models, comprising the traditional re-adhesion anti-slip controller and PID-based anti-slip controller with fixed threshold and with optimal threshold, are established. The wheel/rail rolling-slipping performances subjected to different anti-slip control algorithms under changing wheel/rail friction conditions are compared based on train-track interaction simulations. The results demonstrate that the PID-based anti-slip controller with an optimal threshold achieves the maximum utilization of wheel/rail adhesion in the presence of low-friction conditions, outperforming the other two types of anti-slip controllers. Additionally, the adoption of an anti-slip controller with a lower control threshold can effectively reduce the tread wear of locomotive wheels.

A distributed intelligent trust management strategy (ITMS), is presented to mitigate potential internal attackers and false messages in VTCPS. Given the attributes of VTCPS, the system assesses the trustworthiness of vehicle nodes within the network with an enhanced subjective logic model that integrates both direct and indirect trust, thereby building trust connections among nodes based on their contact histories. The reliability of communications is assessed based on node trust and inter-node distance, while deceptive messages and malevolent nodes inside the network are detected according to the trust evaluation outcomes. To assess the efficacy of the proposed method, four distinct assault scenarios were devised, and comparative experiments were executed on the Veins vehicular network simulation platform to evaluate the performance of the ITMS scheme under diverse attack conditions. The experimental findings indicate that the ITMS scheme can proficiently counteract diverse attacks in VTCPS and can still detect the majority of fraudulent messages and malevolent nodes, even with a 40% ratio of malicious nodes. Furthermore, the efficacy of the ITMS scheme markedly surpasses that of the baseline scheme, which consists of a subjective logic model and a distance-based weighted voting mechanism.},

  abstract     = {Spatialtemporal traffic data are collected by a wide array of data collection devices deployed in intelligent transportation systems, which play crucial roles in data-driven intelligent transportation systems. However, hardware malfunctions or software system errors can lead to the inability to collect accurate data. Incomplete data in intelligent transportation systems can cause difficulties for subsequent applications, such as traffic flow anomaly detection and forecasting. Recently, low-rank tensor-based methods that characterize the global correlation of high-dimensional data have achieved superior performance. However, the majority of tensor-based approaches primarily account for the global correlation within the target traffic data, which is not sufficient to recover some challenging missing scenarios, such as fiber missing and slice missing that often occur in real situations. In this manuscript, we suggest a flexible method to explore the global correlation, local smoothness, and nonlocal self-similar redundancy in traffic data to improve recovery accuracy. Specifically, we utilize the multidimensional tensor nuclear norm to characterize the correlation structure, the multidimensional total variation to maintain smoothness detail, and the plug-and-play term to promote nonlocal self-similarity. The primary merits of this model lie in the fact that these priors characterize data features from different perspectives and complement each other. We develop an alternating direction method of multipliers to achieve efficient optimization for each variable. The proposed method is comprehensively evaluated through experiments across seven missing scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the suggested method with the aid of different priors outperforms many state-of-the-art approaches, especially structured missing scenarios.},

First, a special CBF-based argument term is developed and embedded into the reward function to characterize environmental feedback regarding the risk of violating constraints, which enables the controller to confine enclosing errors within declared boundaries with minimal intervention. Second, a critic-only neural network is utilized to synthesize the optimal control policy, where a novel fixed-time updating law is presented to accelerate the weight convergence to ideal values within a fixed settling time, thereby enhancing the online learning ability and further improving control performance. Theoretical outcomes related to learning convergence, safety, stability, and robustness are rigorously verified. Simulations reveal that the proposed strategy outperforms the previously designed enclosing controllers based on the non-RL and RL ways in terms of complying with prescribed safety constraints and optimizing long-term performance.},

To estimate the unknown system dynamics, an unknown system dynamic estimator (USDE) is designed, where the unknown system dynamic can be accurately estimated by using the input-output information, this is helpful for controller design. Then, a RL based optimal control method is developed, where the prescribed performance function (PPF) is applied, the system states can be effectively defined within a certain range.

  abstract     = {The gradual advancement of Internet-connected vehicles has transformed roads and highways into an intelligent ecosystem. This advancement has led to a widespread adoption of vehicular networks, driven by the enhanced capabilities of automobiles. However, managing mobility-aware computations, ensuring network security amidst instability, and overcoming resource constraints pose significant challenges in heterogeneous vehicular network applications within Fog computing. Moreover, the latency overhead remains a critical issue for tasks sensitive to latency and deadlines. The objective of this research is to develop a Mobility-aware Secured offloading and Scheduling (M-SOS) technique for a Dew-enabled vehicular Fog-Cloud computing system. This technique aims to address the issues outlined above by moving the computations closer to the edge of the network. Initially, a Dew-facilitated vehicular Fog network is proposed, leveraging heterogeneous computing nodes to handle diverse vehicular requests efficiently and ensuring uninterrupted services within the vehicular network. Further, task management is optimized using a Fuzzy logic that categorizes tasks based on their specific requirements and identifies the target layers for offloading. Besides, a cryptographic algorithm known as SHA-256 RSA enhances security. Moreover, a novel Linear Weight-based JAYA scheduling algorithm is introduced to assign tasks to appropriate computing nodes. The proposed algorithm surpasses the comparable algorithms by 23% in terms of AWT, 18% in terms of latency rate, 14% and 23% in terms of meeting the hard-deadline (H_d) and soft-deadline (S_d), and 35% in terms of average system cost, respectively.},

This integration facilitates real-time road condition monitoring, accurate traffic forecasting, and efficient traffic management to reduce congestion and enhance safety. However, relying on public channels for data transmission in T-CPS exposes it to numerous security threats. Addressing these challenges, this paper proposes an intelligence blockchain-based lightweight authentication protocol to enhance the security and trustworthiness of Intelligent Transportation System. The protocol is designed to resist common attacks, such as capture attacks and insider privileged personnel attacks, ensuring secure vehicle communication. Through rigorous Real-Or-Random model formal proofs, the security properties of the protocol are validated. Furthermore, the efficiency of the protocol is demonstrated, showing its lightweight nature and security robustness. This work represents a significant step toward secure, reliable, and efficient communication in vehicular networks, paving the way for more robust T-CPS applications, including autonomous driving and real-time traffic management.},

  abstract     = {In the context of transportation cyber-physical systems (T-CPS), backdoor attacks leveraging traffic images have emerged as a significant security threat. As T-CPS increasingly relies on visual information, such as real-time images captured by traffic cameras, for tasks like traffic sign recognition and autonomous driving, the risk of image-based backdoor attacks has grown substantially. Although various detection-based defense techniques have shown some success in identifying backdoored models, they often fail to fully eliminate backdoor effects, leaving residual security risks. To address this challenge, we propose a Frequency-Domain Hybrid Distillation (FDHD) method for backdoor defense, which effectively weakens the association between backdoor triggers and target labels by combining distillation mechanisms in both the frequency and pixel domains. Furthermore, we design a loss function that integrates feature reconstruction with adaptive alignment, enhancing the student network’s ability to mimic the teacher network and thereby bolstering the backdoor defense capability. Extensive experiments conducted by FDHD on multiple benchmark datasets against the five latest attacks demonstrate that our proposed defense method effectively reduces backdoor threats while maintaining high accuracy in predicting clean samples. This approach will protect against image-based backdoor attacks in T-CPS and lay the foundation for enhancing future traffic safety.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular cooperative perception (VCP) facilitates the exchange of sensing data among vehicles through vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, significantly increasing the sensing range and precision of individual autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, efficiently managing the sharing and processing of large volumes of sensing data presents challenges due to restricted communication and computation resources. This study introduces an integrated sensing, communication, and computation (ISCC)-based task offloading and resource allocation (ITORA) framework, which optimizes cooperative perception by determining what data to share, which vehicles to involve, and how to process the data effectively. We develop an information value function to evaluate the data quality for each vehicle. Subsequently, we design strategies for sensing task allocation, task offloading, and resource allocation to enable value-driven data selection at a subregion level, facilitating collaborative computing among edge servers and vehicles. Additionally, we formulate an optimization problem aimed at maximizing information value while minimizing delay and energy consumption, subject to constraints on a full region of interest (RoI) coverage, delay, wireless bandwidth, and computational resources. We decompose the mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem into two subproblems, devising a sensing task allocation algorithm and a proximal policy optimization (PPO)-based task offloading and resource allocation (PTORA) algorithm to address them. Comprehensive simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed PTORA in optimizing information value, reducing task execution delay, and minimizing energy consumption.},

  abstract     = {In real-world scenes, vehicles and pedestrians on the road often exhibit consistency in their overall motion, forming the traffic flow we observe. Exploring this global collective motion consistency to aid in 3D multi-object tracking (MOT) tasks is an under-investigated issue in existing research. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have been introduced to model interactions between targets in 3D tracking problems, achieving remarkable performance. However, existing GNN based methods usually employ neighborhood-based approaches to construct graphs which are unable to fully exploit collective relations in traffic flow. In this paper, we propose a GNN based 3D MOT method which effectively utilizes the collective motion consistency in traffic flow. Collective motion is modeled with a densely connected intra-flow graph within the collective group, allowing information to flow quickly. To build the intra-flow graph, we propose an effective collinearity condition to distinguish potential collective groups from the detected objects. For reasoning on the graph, we propose a progressive serial message-passing solver which enables the network to learn complex group movement relationships based on a thorough understanding of simple neighborhood relations. Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on public datasets: NuScenes and KITTI tracking benchmark. We have conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the comprehensive performance of our proposed method which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

We present an outdoor navigation assistive system that collaborates with infrastructure to address these limitations. Our system includes an RGB-D inertial sensor, GPS sensor, Jetson Orin NX 16GB, and bone-conduction headphones. It improves localization accuracy through semantic segmentation, depth map enhancement (Depth-Decoder), and a prior map. The proposed semantic segmentation convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed to operate on low-compute devices, achieving competitive performance with 71.2 mean Intersection of Union (mIoU) on the Cityscapes and 74.46 mIoU on the Camvid. It operates at 209 frames per second (fps) with 480×848 image resolution on the GTX 1080 desktop and 50 fps on the low-compute Jetson. Additionally, our Depth-Decoder enhances raw depth maps using geometrical loss with semantic segmentation constraints and structure-from-motion. Depth-Decoder demonstrated an average deviation of 0.66m compared to 2.23m from raw depth maps for landmarks within 10m. Notably, the outcomes of both CNNs are inferred from a single RGB image. Two visually impaired individuals assessed the technology. Participant S001 completed 6/8 trials and S002 completed 7/7 trials. Infrastructure collaboration is demonstrated by using existing prior maps and by dynamically adjusting paths based on real-time information from sensing nodes, to avoid collisions with oncoming agents not visible with the wearable camera. This research provides fundamental design principles for future outdoor navigation assistive technologies, offering insights into addressing challenges for people with visual impairment and other vulnerable road users.},

First, the generalization error bound of the Bi-LSTM, which is related to the number of samples and the bounds of the weight matrices, is proved through Rademacher complexity analysis. A Bi-LSTM-based intelligent predictor is designed to predict the position and velocity of UMVs and to estimate external disturbances. Based on this, a threshold-based attack detection and compensation scheme is proposed to determine whether the UMVs are suffering from attacks and to compensate for the compromised transmission signals. Furthermore, considering the bounds of the generalization errors of predictions, a resilient secure controller is designed using the compensation data from the proposed compensation mechanism and a data-driven discrete-time integral sliding mode control method. Compared with the data-driven control scheme, the UMVs with proposed PFDL-DDISMC can exhibit more effective trajectory tracking performance under disturbances and hybrid attacks. Theoretical analysis verifies that the proposed PFDL-DDISMC method ensures the stability of the tracking error system for UMVs subjected to hybrid attacks and external disturbances. Finally, three simulation examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed resilient PFDL-DDISMC scheme and the convergence of the tracking error.},

Along these lines, an RGB-D image based visual SLAM (vSLAM) leveraging semantic Patch-NetVLAD loop closure detection for autonomous driving vehicles in semi-static scenes is proposed. First, the lightweight SeaFormer is utilized to perform semantic segmentation on the input RGB image, and an ORB feature point extraction method based on lighting invariance is designed to obtain a high-confidence static feature point set. Then, a “coarse-to-fine” high-quality keyframe selection strategy is developed, ensuring the efficiency and real-time performance of the system for long-term operation. Further, a high-performance screening strategy of closed-loop candidate keyframes is constructed by combining structural similarity (SSIM) and cosine similarity. On this basis, a high-precision loop closure detection strategy combining semantics and patch-based multi-scale fusion of vector of locally aggregated descriptors (Patch-NetVLAD) is constructed, which effectively eliminates the closed-loop mismatching due to dynamic and invalid matching. Finally, a global semantic octree map that can be used for navigation is generated using keyframes and semantic masks.

This study introduces an unsupervised learning algorithm for detecting risky driving behaviors on expressways within Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) environments, employing deep clustering techniques to analyze individual driving patterns from Probe Vehicle Data (PVD). Utilizing data from 116 vehicles, including buses and heavy trucks, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based autoencoder was employed to extract latent hierarchical features, facilitating the clustering of similar driving patterns. Elementary Driving Behaviors (EDBs) were identified for different vehicle types and driving statuses, serving as a foundation for detecting risky driving behaviors against the proposed criteria. The research revealed a clear positive correlation between detected risky driving behaviors and traffic crashes across the vehicle types. Furthermore, when comparing our model’s criteria with traditional safety indexes, our proposed model demonstrated stronger correlations with traffic crashes, indicating its effectiveness in expressway driving environments. This research not only introduces a novel method for identifying risky driving behaviors but also underscores the importance of tailored traffic safety interventions in enhancing C-ITS environments.},

Unmanned tunnel data collection is vital for intelligent construction; additionally, semantic segmentation aids in understanding the environment. However, complex tunnel terrains are challenging for three-dimensional (3D) laser scanning, and diverse interior structures and nontunnel elements complicate accurate segmentation by subsequent networks. Therefore, this paper proposed a tunnel mobile 3D mapping system (TMMS) for complex terrain in construction tunnels using a quadruped robot and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Additionally, a deep learning-based semantic segmentation network (TUC-Net) is proposed for analysing 3D point clouds in tunnels under construction. The research presented the neighbourhood feature perception enhancement (NFPE) module to enhance the representation of local features, introduce a self-attention (SA) module and improve the loss function to improve network accuracy. The NFPE module enhances feature aggregation for unstructured objects, and the SA module improves the learning of global features, critical for tunnel point cloud segmentation. The TMMS is used to collect point cloud data from tunnels under construction, leading to the creation of the tunnels under construction point clouds (TUCPC) dataset for training and evaluating the TUC-Net network. Compared to other 3D point cloud semantic segmentation methods, the proposed method demonstrated superior performance, achieving an overall accuracy (OA) of 99.45% and a mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 94.06%, surpassing that of other methods by at least 4.41%.

However, real-world complexities result in challenges for DAS traffic images, including low signal-to-noise ratio, signal missing, and uneven intensity. As DAS traffic applications are still in their early stages, effective solutions to these challenges are yet to be developed. This paper proposes a new deep learning method named DAS High Speed Traffic Trajectory (DAS-HTT) network, which contributes threefold: (i) Multi-Scale Context Extraction Module (MSCE) effectively enlarges the receptive field to capture long-range contextual information comprehensively; (ii) Stripe Convolution Decoder (SCD) acquires remote information along four directions, preventing irrelevant region interference in feature learning; (iii) Hierarchically Hough Transform Fusion Decoder (HHTFD) introduces the structural information of trajectory linearity, reducing the reliance on label data while enhancing trajectory continuity. We conducted experiments on an operating expressway, demonstrating that DAS-HTT outperforms existing methods across seven metrics, providing trajectories that are more consistent with ground truthes.},

To maintain the highest possible service quality during the transition period, the second step introduces stop-skipping and further fine-tunes the train timetable. Both steps are formulated as mixed-integer nonlinear programming models, and the second-step model is heuristically decomposed. For computational tractability, mathematical models are transformed using some linearization techniques and then solved according to the prescribed procedure. Numerical experiments based on a small-scale case and real-world data of the Beijing Yizhuang Metro Line show that the proposed two-step optimization framework can satisfy the real-time requirements and outperform the current rescheduling method employed in the automatic train supervision system. Furthermore, the framework is proven to be applicable to different disturbance durations and locations.},

  abstract     = {The upcoming 6G technology, with its high speed and low latency, is poised to become a foundational technology for intelligent transportation systems. To handle the massive data generated by connected vehicles in 6G environments, federated learning methods are essential. However, traditional centralized federated learning approaches still face challenges related to data and device heterogeneity, which significantly affects training efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose FedCPC, a context-based adaptive pruning clustered federated learning method. Based on the positive correlation between similar data distributions and model representations, we use centralized kernel alignment (CKA) to group clients with similar data distributions, thus reducing the impact of data heterogeneity. Furthermore, we introduce a context-aware random forest multi-armed bandit method to determine appropriate pruning rates based on device capabilities and historical performance which addresses device heterogeneity concerns. Experimental results on open-source datasets demonstrate that FedCPC outperforms traditional FL methods in both learning efficiency and communication effectiveness.},

The proposed technique is comprised of three layers: a behavioral planning layer that employs proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm aims to learn its driving behaviors, which are not necessarily compliant with vehicle dynamics; a motion control layer that adopts model predictive control (MPC) framework to ensure the kinematic feasibility to follow the trajectories with heading angles and velocities provided by the upper layer; and lastly, a control barrier function-guided layer, which is the core innovation of this paper, is implemented. It leverages the forward invariance of control barrier functions to design a safety controller that refines the output of MPC to maintain continuous driving safety. The refined results are then used as objective function, guiding subsequent updates in the learning process. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CBF-guided architecture significantly improves training efficiency and performance, achieving a 60% reduction in training time and 6% increase in success rate compared to standard RL methods.},

  abstract     = {In the evolving landscape of mixed traffic environments, the interaction between Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) and Human-driven Vehicles (HVs) introduces complex dynamics that challenge traditional traffic control paradigms. The Mixed Platoon Hierarchical Control (MPHC) model innovatively addresses these dynamics by integrating advanced control strategies that optimize the coexistence of CAVs and HVs. Specifically, the model introduces two novel approaches: the Incorporate Real-time Changes in Dynamic Headway (IRC_DH), which dynamically adjusts CAV headways by utilizing real-time traffic data and road conditions, enhancing platoon efficiency and reducing headway by up to 24.35%; and the Incorporate Controls to Improve Response Speed (IC_IRS) for HVs, a multi-variable control strategy that considers vehicle states, reducing speed differentials by as much as 53.125%, thereby stabilizing platoon dynamics and significantly lowering collision risks. These strategies distinguish themselves from existing approaches by providing a more precise, adaptable, and robust solution to the dynamic challenges of mixed traffic flow, addressing both efficiency and safety. Simulation results confirm that these strategies significantly improve traffic flow efficiency and safety, providing a scalable and adaptable framework for traffic management in mixed vehicular environments. This work makes a substantial contribution to the field by emphasizing a comprehensive, real-time, and multi-dimensional approach to managing mixed traffic environments, thereby advancing the state-of-the-art in CAV-HV integration.},

Meanwhile, the impact of order splitting and delivery on customer satisfaction was analyzed from the perspective of consumers. Based on the above analysis, a multi-objective optimization model was established with the objectives of minimizing costs and maximizing customer satisfaction. Then, an improved NSGA-II algorithm was proposed to solve the model. In this algorithm, K-means and ant colony algorithm were used to obtain the optimal paths for two objectives, respectively. Then, the customer satisfaction problem caused by splitting was quantified using the information entropy TOPSIS method. Subsequently, the improved VNS algorithm was used to expand the solution sets of the two optimal paths for dual objective optimization.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate the problem of enhancing cooperative LiDAR-based perception accuracy in vehicular edge networks. The key to solving this problem is the selection of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) that can collectively provide maximum perception performance. In specific, extensive motivating experiments on an open benchmark dataset are conducted, which reveal that the cooperative perception accuracy is a submodular combination of selected CAVs, and such selection is non-trivial due to high vehicular mobility as well as unstable vehicular network conditions. Then, we develop an Edge coordinated COoperative Perception (ECOP) framework, taking into account both cooperative vehicle selection and adaptive bandwidth allocation. The novelty of the ECOP design is threefold. First, a new metric named perceptual gain is designed, which properly quantifies the individual perception contributions of each CAV without incurring additional computational overhead. Secondly, an online vehicle selection strategy, which utilizes continual learning to assess the perceptual gain of each CAV, is devised. Theoretical analysis indicates that the proposed vehicle selection strategy can achieve asymptotically diminishing learning regret, highlighting its effectiveness in adapting to vehicular mobility. Finally, an optimal bandwidth allocation method is proposed, which can adapt to heterogeneous and unstable vehicular network conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared with other benchmarks, ECOP can select vehicle sets with the highest cooperative perception accuracy and ensure real-time perception in the presence of fluctuating bandwidth. Furthermore, a case study is presented to visualize the effectiveness of the proposed ECOP framework.},

  abstract     = {The effectiveness of transportation systems is significantly influenced by the field of view (FOV) of cameras, with larger FOVs yielding more reliable performance. Conventional cameras with restricted FOV face difficulties in scenarios characterized by field-of-view shake or low-texture imaging areas, complicating feature extraction and matching tracking. Conversely, 360∘ panoramic cameras, which provide an expansive field of view and high pixel density, are emerging as promising alternatives. While many studies have explored motion calculation based on panoramic vision, most resort to conventional image processing methods for panoramic images, leading to inefficiencies and reduced accuracy. This article proposes a novel approach to panoramic vision motion estimation and reconstruction. The method involves projecting the panoramic image onto a fitting sphere and establishing a mapping relationship between a uniform spherical grid and the pixels of the panoramic image. This enables distortion-free mapping imaging for the entire panorama, addressing issues with matching consecutive frame images caused by distortion in the polar regions. Going beyond conventional epipolar constraints, this paper introduces a geometric constraint of epipolarity within a three-dimensional sphere and derives pose-solving equations tailored for panoramic vision, enabling motion estimation between frames. Additionally, it derives the polar arc equation of panoramic images, accelerating three-dimensional reconstruction of dense point clouds. The sliding window estimation method is used for iterative algorithm optimization, along with an optimization mechanism aligned with the panoramic camera model. Validation on public datasets and hardware experimental platforms demonstrates the proposed method’s significantly improved accuracy compared to existing optimal algorithms.},

To meet the ever-increasing charging demands of EVs, an efficient dynamic spatio-temporal allocation strategy of charging stations (CSs) is necessary. With newly allocated CSs, additional distributed generators (DGs) are required to compensate for the load increase. Given a budget to be allocated over a certain time horizon, we formulate the joint spatio-temporal CSs and DGs planning problem as a multi-objective optimization problem. During each planning period, the allocation strategy aims at minimizing the total power generation costs and CSs/DGs installation costs while satisfying budgetary and power constraints and ensuring a minimum level for the charging requests satisfaction rate. In this regard, we first predict the future power demand of EVs using a graph convolutional neural network (GCNN). Then, using the power demand forecast, we obtain the optimal number and locations of CSs and DGs at each time stage using reinforcement learning. A case study of the proposed allocation strategy over 6 time stages for the 2000-bus power grid of Texas coupled with 720 initially existing CSs is presented to illustrate the performance of the planning strategy.},

The model incorporates a streamlined network built upon the YOLOv8n model and introduces an innovative lightweight fusion structure, SGC2f, which uses grouped convolutions and linear operations to reduce model weight and complexity markedly. Additionally, the proposed Efficient Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (EBiFPN) optimizes output channel utilization within the feature network, enhancing the model’s capacity to detect targets at multiple scales. Furthermore, the Efficient Multi-Scale Attention (EMA) module in the model’s backbone layer is designed to reduce redundant data and improve the extraction of relevant features. Experimental results demonstrate that the LEE-YOLO model outperforms YOLOv8n, achieving a 4.3% higher precision and a 4.0% improvement in mean average precision (mAP). Importantly, it achieves a 43.5% reduction in weight and a 39.5% decrease in computational demand, effectively balancing performance and efficiency.

In this regard, the present study proposes a methodology to explore the driving styles of Indian drivers, using both the magnitude and variation exhibited in the short-term driving decisions. The real-time driving profiles of 47 professional car drivers were collected and segmented into maneuvers based on the respective driving regimes. The performance features representative of each maneuver are extracted, defining 12 measures of driving volatility. The K-means clustering was performed on the event dataset at two-levels, which resulted in four patterns of driving styles under acceleration and braking regimes. The results showed that, a driver can exhibit speedy and aggressive maneuvers in a stable as well as in a highly volatile pattern. The generated driving style profiles at individual-level highlight the behavioral changes in drivers pertained to external influencing factors, and helps to identify the aberrations performed in each trip.},

To tackle this challenge, a finite-time model predictive control (MPC) algorithm with a specialized feedback control law is proposed. A constraint set of the state error is designed and based on this, a decision-making scheme is established to allow the on-ramp vehicle to assess the feasibility of the merging operation at the beginning under the designed MPC strategy. If the merging is feasible, the proposed MPC strategy will be applied to drive the on-ramp vehicle towards a small neighborhood around the desired state on the basis of platoon’s velocity and position within a finite time step before joining the platoon. Furthermore, asymptotic convergence towards the desired state is achieved by a co-designed feedback control law. Otherwise, the MPC strategy will not be triggered, instead an alternative method such as slowing down the on-ramp vehicle to create space and allow the vehicles on the main road to proceed ahead. Under the proposed method, the recursive feasibility of the MPC optimization problem is achieved at all time steps and the finite time convergence to the small neighborhood of the desired state can be proved under the MPC algorithm. An upper bound on the convergence time step is also derived, which is used to prove the effectiveness of the decision-making mechanism. In addition, the closed-loop constraints satisfaction and asymptotic stability of the on-ramp vehicle are also guaranteed.

However, the maritime industry, crucial to global trade and logistics, has lagged in DT implementation. This paper aims to bridge this gap by systematically surveying DT applications in the automotive and aviation industries and exploring how this knowledge can be transferred to the maritime industry. By analyzing existing literature, identifying key trends, and summarizing best practices, a comprehensive roadmap is provided for maritime industry adoption of DT technology. The surveyed papers are selected systematically following the PRISMA statement and categorized based on characteristics such as single vs. multiple systems, modeling methods (model-driven, data-driven, and hybrid), and life-cycle phases. We introduce DT models using a five-dimensional framework and analyze their characteristics in terms of research object, subsystem application, and modeling method. Additionally, DT applications from a product life-cycle perspective, covering design, manufacturing, operation, and maintenance phases are examined. Knowledge transfer from the automotive and aviation industries to the maritime industry is summarized. In the automotive industry, DTs enhance vehicle efficiency and safety, particularly for autonomous and electric vehicles. Aviation DT research focuses on predictive maintenance, pilot training, and real-time monitoring to improve operational efficiency and safety. The maritime industry faces data challenges and operational complexity but has significant potential for DTs to enhance ship performance, safety, and predictive maintenance.},

  abstract     = {Curb detection is a crucial function in intelligent driving, essential for determining drivable areas on the road. However, the complexity of road environments makes curb detection challenging. This paper introduces CurbNet, a novel framework for curb detection utilizing point cloud segmentation. To address the lack of comprehensive curb datasets with 3D annotations, we have developed the 3D-Curb dataset based on SemanticKITTI, currently the largest and most diverse collection of curb point clouds. Recognizing that the primary characteristic of curbs is height variation, our approach leverages spatially rich 3D point clouds for training. To tackle the challenges posed by the uneven distribution of curb features on the xy-plane and their dependence on high-frequency features along the z-axis, we introduce the Multi-Scale and Channel Attention (MSCA) module, a customized solution designed to optimize detection performance. Additionally, we propose an adaptive weighted loss function group specifically formulated to counteract the imbalance in the distribution of curb point clouds relative to other categories. Extensive experiments conducted on 2 major datasets demonstrate that our method surpasses existing benchmarks set by leading curb detection and point cloud segmentation models. Through the post-processing refinement of the detection results, we have significantly reduced noise in curb detection, thereby improving precision by 4.5 points. Similarly, our tolerance experiments also achieve state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, real-world experiments and dataset analyses mutually validate each other, reinforcing CurbNet’s superior detection capability and robust generalizability.

  abstract     = {How to effectively explore semantic feature, especially the traffic semantics, is vital for Low-light image enhancement (LLE) in intelligent transportation systems. Existing methods usually utilize the semantic feature that is only drawn from the output produced by high-level semantic segmentation (SS) network. However, if the output is not accurately estimated, it would affect the high-level semantic feature (HSF) extraction, which accordingly interferes with LLE. To this end, we develop a simple and effective semantic-aware LLE network (SLLEN) composed of a LLE main-network (LLEmN) and a SS auxiliary-network (SSaN). In SLLEN, LLEmN integrates the random intermediate embedding feature (IEF), i.e., the information extracted from the intermediate layer of SSaN, together with the HSF into a unified framework for better LLE. SSaN is designed to act as a SS role to provide HSF and IEF. Moreover, thanks to a shared encoder between LLEmN and SSaN, we further propose an alternating training mechanism to facilitate the collaboration between them. Unlike currently available approaches, the proposed SLLEN is able to fully lever the semantic information, e.g., IEF, HSF, and SS dataset, to assist LLE, thereby leading to a more promising enhancement performance. Additionally, the proposed SLLEN can be applied into intelligent transportation system (ITS). The images enhanced by SLLEN are not only visually clear, but also can be better recognized by subsequent traffic semantics. Comparisons between the proposed SLLEN and other state-of-the-art techniques demonstrate the superiority of SLLEN with respect to LLE quality over all the comparable alternatives.},

Conventional approaches typically struggle with issues such as limited accuracy, slow convergence, and high computational costs. These methods often fail to capture the complex temporal and spatial patterns inherent in multimodal physiological signals, such as EEG and EOG, leading to suboptimal performance in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that leverages Depthwise Separable Convolutional Neural Networks (DSCNNs) for driver fatigue detection. Our method integrates electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrooculogram (EOG) signals through an innovative feature extraction and fusion process, enhancing the system’s ability to detect fatigue with high accuracy and efficiency. The DSCNN model is designed to overcome the limitations of traditional methods by utilizing depthwise separable convolutions, which reduce computational complexity while maintaining robust performance. We validate our approach using the SEED-VIG dataset and the NTHU drowsy driver dataset, which encompasses a range of driving conditions. The DSCNN model outperforms conventional models in both accuracy and computational efficiency. Specifically, DSCNN achieves the highest F1 score and the lowest time per epoch, making it highly suitable for real-time applications in T-CPS. This advancement represents a significant improvement in driver safety by providing more timely and reliable fatigue warnings, thus advancing the capabilities of intelligent transportation systems.},

  abstract     = {Traffic accidents remain a significant concern due to their potential severity and impact on society. The rapid and accurate detection of car damage is increasingly crucial. Manual assessment of car damage usually relies on multi-view car images taken at the scene, which can provide richer information for damage assessment. However, most car damage algorithms are based on single-view datasets, and it is hard to fully leverage the complementary information and alignment information between distant view and close-up images. In this paper, we propose the Multi-View Car Damage Detection model (MVA-CDD), comprising three key modules: Feature Split (FS), Feature Fusion (FF), and Image Alignment (IA). The FS module extracts global and detailed information from distant-view and close-up images separately, which are then combined by the FF module. The IA module effectively aligns car damage information in distant-view and close-up images to correct errors and biases. Meanwhile, we created the new Car Damage Detection Multi-view dataset (CDDM), which has a significant advantage in both image quantity and diversity across categories, addressing the shortcomings of existing multi-view datasets. Our proposed MVA-CDD outperforms the state-of-the-art single-view and multi-view models with the dataset. Results from ablation studies further confirm the efficiency of MVA-CDD. This study contributes to optimizing the car damage detection and claims adjudication process, leading to significant labor and material cost savings.

To achieve this, an analytical solution is derived for the average achievable rate from the lead vehicle to follower vehicles over Rician fading channels. Leveraging this analytical solution, the Gauss-Chebyshev integration is employed to obtain the approximate solution. Then, we formulate a problem of maximizing the sum of secure rates by optimizing the trajectory and spectrum allocation. The formulated problem is constrained by the security requirement and imperfect channel state information. Addressing the NP-hard nature of this problem, an iterative optimization algorithm is developed, incorporating Q-learning and the graph theory to alternately adjust the trajectory and spectrum allocation. Finally, the simulation results show that the approximate solution matches well with the analytical solution, and the gap is less than 6%.

  abstract     = {In mixed-autonomy traffic environments, accurately predicting the lane change behavior of human-driven vehicles is critical for ensuring the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicle decision-making. However, existing approaches face two major challenges: 1) they tend to represent the relationships between the target vehicle and surrounding vehicles using parameters like relative position and speed. This approach either requires a fixed number of surrounding vehicles or introduces significant noise by relying on virtual vehicles; and 2) they often fail to fully exploit the vast amount of available vehicle trajectory data, leaving the complexities of vehicular interactions underexplored. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel lane change prediction framework using Transformer-based transfer learning. Our design aims to leverage inter-vehicle interactions learned from trajectory data to improve lane-change prediction accuracy. Specifically, pre-trained trajectory prediction models are used to adapt dynamically to the varying number of surrounding vehicles and to capture interaction context from large sets of trajectory data. We then refine the Transformer model to integrate this context and predict the target vehicle’s lane change intentions. The Transformer encoder transforms trajectory interaction context into a lane-change-oriented context using aggregated multi-head attention. The Transformer decoder, in turn, utilizes this context alongside the target vehicle’s states through relation-aware multi-head attention to forecast lane change behavior. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and robustness.},

However, using existing communication cables rather than specially laid sensing cables as the DAS sensing medium, while offering ultra-low deployment and maintenance cost advantages, poses significant challenges for detecting lightweight, low-speed vehicles that are far from the fiber cable. The quasi-static strain generated by such vehicles are low and easily overwhelmed by environmental noise and DAS fading noise. In this paper, we analyze the causes of weak vehicle quasi-static signals and propose a Unet image segmentation network, trained to recognize these weak signals using a large window with a small step size for data input.

  abstract     = {3D object detection is a fundamental yet critical task for autonomous driving. In this paper, we investigate a novel self-distilling paradigm by proposing Self-distilling Introspective Data (SID) to boost the accuracy of 3D object detection in both LiDAR-based and LiDAR-Camera-based scenarios. The proposed SID significantly improves the applicability of the distillation approach since it does not require extra training data or complex teacher network design. Specifically, we first employ an introspective data augmentation method to enrich object-aware information in sparse point clouds through geometric or semantic injection. We then utilize this enhanced data to train a robust teacher model. In contrast to traditional distillation that relies on larger models to enhance the representations of smaller ones, the teacher model in SID shares the same architecture as the student model but exhibits exceptionally high discriminative ability. This enables the effective transfer of rich feature representations to the student model. Rooted on such a scheme, when conducting LiDAR-based detectors, SID significantly enhances the semantic representation capabilities of sparse point clouds. Additionally, in the LiDAR-Camera-based setting, SID also effectively supervises the fusion of the two modalities at the feature level, ensuring more reasonable cross-modal learning. Extensive experiments show the proposed SID improves a variety of detectors. For the LiDAR-based detector, the SID gains 2.31% mAP improvements for the hard objects in KITTI, while 1.76% NDS improvements on nuScenes. For the LiDAR-Camera-based detectors, the SID boosts the detection accuracy significantly, with 1.5% mAP promotion on KITTI and 2.15% NDS improvements on the nuScenes benchmark.},

  abstract     = {The communication security and covertness of legitimate vehicles in the sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication intelligent automatic transportation systems (IATS) face significant challenges, as the communication equipment and wireless signals are complex and susceptible to information leakage. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a novel IATS that integrates simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) with rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA). Concurrently, an eavesdropping vehicle, capable of monitoring and eavesdropping information from legitimate vehicles, is introduced to explore the joint security and covertness performance. A roadside device is also introduced to improve security and covertness performance by transmitting artificial noise. The closed-form expressions for outage probability (OP), detection error probability (DEP), and intercept probability (IP) are derived to characterize the reliability, covertness, and security of the proposed system. The impact of various system parameters on system performance has also been extensively conducted, including transmitted signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), interference power, the power allocation coefficients, and the number of elements in STAR-RIS. The simulation results reveal several key insights: 1) The OPs and IPs of the RSMA-IATS network gradually decrease and increase with the transmitted SNR, respectively; 2) Achieving an optimal balance in power allocation between monitoring and eavesdropping proves essential for effective eavesdropper management; 3) The energy efficiency (EE) of the proposed system exhibits dual peaks at higher STAR-RIS element numbers, contrasting with a single peak at lower element counts, underscoring the strategic deployment of STAR-RIS technology in RSMA-IATS network.},

  abstract     = {In the context of rapidly growing city road networks, understanding complex traffic patterns and implementing effective safety monitoring through advanced Transportation Cyber-Physical Systems (T-CPS) has become increasingly challenging. This involves understanding spatial relationships and non-linear temporal associations. Accurately predicting traffic in such scenarios, particularly for long-term sequences, is challenging due to the complexity of the data. Traditional ways of predicting traffic flow use a single fixed graph structure based on location. This structure does not consider possible correlations and cannot fully capture long-term temporal relationships among traffic flow data, thereby limiting the system ability to ensure safety and reliability. To address this challenge, we propose a novel traffic prediction framework called Attention-based Spatio-temporal Multi-scale Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (ASTMGCNet). This study introduces a novel framework designed to improve prediction accuracy in dynamic urban traffic systems by effectively capturing complex spatio-temporal correlations through multi-scale feature extraction and attention mechanisms. ASTMGCNet records changing features of space and time by combining Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN). Its design incorporates multi-scale feature extraction and dual attention mechanisms, effectively capturing informative patterns at different levels of detail. This strategic design allows ASTMGCNet to effectively capture complex spatio-temporal correlations within traffic sequences, enhancing prediction accuracy. We have tested this method on two different real-world datasets and found that ASTMGCNet predicts significantly better than other methods, demonstrating its potential to advance traffic flow prediction and improve safety and reliability in T-CPS applications.},

  abstract     = {The integration of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) within the smart grid has significantly enhanced the reliability, efficiency, and security of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) services over the past decade, leading to increased research interest in this technology. Charging stations (CSs) utilize electric vehicles (EVs) to manage demand response and provide sustainable energy solutions. However, the transmission of information between EVs and CSs via public channels causes critical security vulnerabilities. Although much effort has been made to overcome the challenge of protecting security and privacy in V2G environments, these efforts have either been proposed based on a centralized architecture or do not ensure essential security requirements, such as self-sovereignty, reliable, and blockchain scalability. Furthermore, in decentralized network, it is difficult to provide reliable energy distribution because a malicious participant can easily try to inflate trading volumes and manipulate energy prices. In this paper, we propose a new blockchain-enabled, reliable, privacy-preserving scheme using decentralized identifiers (DIDs) for preventing energy wash trading in V2G networks called BAPS-DITS. BAPS-DITS guarantees to tackle the above challenges without a trusted third-party intervention. Additionally, we use informal and formal (mathematical) analysis to prove the security of BAPS-DITS and conduct a comparative analysis comparing the security properties, computational cost, and communication cost of BAPS-DITS to previous studies. Furthermore, we implement BAPS-DITS on a practical Ethereum network, demonstrating its efficiency and feasibility, showing that BAPS-DITS provides self-sovereignty, accountability, and blockchain scalability; thus, it is suitable for actual V2G environments.},

  abstract     = {3D scene flow represents the 3D motion of each point in the point cloud, which is a base 3D perception task for autonomous driving, like optical flow for 2D images. As non-learning methods are often inefficient or struggled to learn accurate correspondence in complex 3D real world, recent works turn to supervised learning methods, which require ground truth labels. However, acquiring the ground truth of 3D scene flow is challenging mainly due to the lack of sensors capable of capturing point-level motion and the complexity of accurately tracking each point in real-world environments. Therefore, it is important to resort to self-supervised methods, which do not require ground truth labels. In this paper, a novel unsupervised learning method of scene flow with LiDAR odometry is proposed, which enables the scene flow network can be trained directly on real-world LiDAR data without scene flow labels. In this structure, supervised odometry provides a more accurate shared cost volume for the interframe association of 3D scene flow. In addition, because static and occluded points are more suitable for using the pose transform while dynamic and non-occluded points are more suitable for using the scene flow transform, a static mask and an occlusion mask are designed to classify the states of points and a mask-weighted warp layer is proposed to transform source points in a divide-and-conquer manner. The experiments demonstrate that the divide-and-conquer strategy makes the predicted scene flow more accurate. The experiment results compared to other methods also show the application ability of our proposed method to real-world data. Our source codes are released at: https://github.com/IRMVLab/PSFNet.},

  abstract     = {Highway on-ramps are typical bottlenecks for the deployment of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). However, few studies have considered time-varying traffic volume and dynamic uncertainties in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes an adaptive robust formation control strategy (ARFC) for CAVs to address these challenges. The ARFC consists of two stages: 1) In the tactical stage, the constraint-oriented platoon formation algorithm classifies approaching CAVs into multiple local virtual platoons (LVP), assigns the collision-free merging sequences and driving modes, thereby enabling the strategy to adapt to time-varying traffic volume. Unified spatial-dependent constraints are formulated to construct this geometry topology, where the spatial dependence ensures collision avoidance in the merging conflict zone. 2) In the operational stage, an adaptive robust control scheme is designed based on the Lyapunov min-max approach, rendering uniform boundedness, uniform ultimate boundedness performance of tracking errors, and string stability of LVP, regardless of time-varying uncertainties. Comprehensive validations demonstrate that the proposed strategy performs effectively under different traffic demands, and improves ride comfort and fuel economy compared to baseline methods.},

  abstract     = {Accurately estimating the position and attitude of vehicles is essential for intelligent transportation systems. The GNSS/INS integrated system offers precise navigation information. However, the system’s positioning errors may accumulate rapidly in challenging GNSS signal conditions. Odometer (ODO) and nonholonomic constraints (NHC) are commonly employed to mitigate the rapid accumulation of INS errors. Compensating for the mounting angles of INS and the scale factor of the odometer is necessary to fully exploit the potential of ODO/NHC. However, many studies employ Kalman filters with small mounting angle assumption, which limits their applicability for large mounting angles in practice. To accurately estimate the mounting angle of INS with any installation attitude, we propose a new algorithm called Fast Estimation of Mounting Angle and Scale Factor (FEMASF). FEMASF employs Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to obtain a closed-form solution for the parameters. It also incorporates an enhanced Sage-Husa scheme, enhancing overall estimation accuracy by reducing the weight of outlier data through a forgetting factor. Extensive simulation experimental results demonstrate that our proposed FEMASF algorithm outperforms filter-based methods in terms of accuracy and convergence speed for large mounting angles. Specifically, for the -90∘ mounting angle, FEMASF achieves 0.45∘ angle error, while the velocity-based Kalman filter (VKF) fails to converge and the position-based Kalman filter (PKF) yields about 4∘ error. Furthermore, neither VKF nor PKF converges for the 120∘ mounting angle, whereas FEMASF exhibits only about 3.2∘ estimation error.},

  abstract     = {In autonomous driving (AD) tasks, data-driven deep reinforcement learning (DRL) outperforms rule-based methods in terms of continuous decision-making and adaptability. However, traditional DRL relies on hand-crafted reward functions, which introduce objective alignment challenges and reward loopholes. Moreover, the black-box structure makes it difficult to explain the decision-making process, which has a direct impact on DRL performance in complex driving situations. To address these shortcomings, a preference-based decomposable proximal policy optimization algorithm (PDPPO) is proposed for reliable interactive urban AD. The framework deconstructs the federated reinforcement learning (FRL) algorithm from various perspectives using a rule-based preference model, resulting in high-availability algorithmic performance for AD. PDPPO employs a data-rule fusion-driven hybrid vision transformer to overcome the objective alignment and high-dimensional state-space representation challenges of traditional DRL in complex urban traffic environments. Furthermore, to address the issue of algorithmic trustworthiness, PDPPO models the multi-agent FRL co-optimization process as an interpretable self-organized group collaboration process. This approach enables the algorithm to strike a balance between model robustness and sample efficiency using preference-heuristic parameter aggregation. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PDPPO algorithmic framework can implement interpretable single-agent decision control and multi-agent co-optimization processes. Furthermore, it exhibits competitive performance on various benchmark tests.},

  abstract     = {Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has shown considerable promise in enhancing the efficiency of adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) systems. However, existing MARL approaches primarily focus on optimizing overall traffic flow, often overlooking the issue of fairness in vehicle waiting times. Considering that there is no need to strive for the ultimate fairness, this paper models the ATSC problem as a Constrained Partially Observable Markov Game (CPOMG), where fairness is modeled as a constraint on the maximum waiting time of vehicles on lanes of intersections instead of a reward term that pursues maximization. CPOMG aims to find a cooperative control policy with optimal traffic efficiency within the constrained solution space by multiple agents. On this basis, this paper proposes a new centralized training and decentralized execution cooperative MARL method, i.e, vehicle-level fairness multi-agent proximity policy optimization (VF-MAPPO) VF-MAPPO leverages a centralized trained global Critic Network to estimate the average vehicle traffic efficiency and vehicle maximum waiting time, and an Actor Network shared by all intersections for decentralized execution, which converts the optimization problem with constraints to an unconstrained optimization objective through the Lagrange multiplier method and adopts proximity policy optimization during training. Additionally, VF-MAPPO incorporates spatial-temporal graph attention in the Critic network to efficiently extract state representations in multi-intersection environments. We qualitatively analyzed the monotonic improvement guarantee of VF-MAPPO. Extensive experimental validation across two real-world and one synthetic scenarios substantiates that VF-MAPPO enhances vehicle-level fairness and maintains average traffic efficiency, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.},

In complex driving conditions, accurate and fast lane recognition is a challenging issue. In this paper, a vision-based geometric model (VBGM) is proposed for accurate and fast lane recognition in complex conditions. The framework of the VBGM includes an image preprocessing stage and a lane recognition stage. In the image preprocessing stage, the region of interest (ROI) is extracted from the original image, and the original image is transformed into an undistorted greyscale image. In the lane recognition stage, the lane contour is first extracted using the Roberts operator. Then, to accurately and quickly recognize the lane marking, a lane recognition coordinate system (LRCS) and a rotational LRCS (R-LRCS) are constructed. The distracting contours in abnormal regions are padded based on the LRCS using a contextual frames correlation (CFC) strategy, and the midpoints of the lane contour are identified based on the R-LRCS. Finally, an adaptive-order polynomial fitting model is built to fit the lane marking according to the midpoints in the LRCS. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, two state-of-the-art methods are selected for comparison. The comparative results indicate that the proposed method possesses a higher recognition rate and speed for lane recognition in complex conditions.},

Accurate prediction of EV charging demand is essential for transportation system operations, such as real-time traffic management, route optimization, and station utilization planning.

This study introduces Generative Multi-task Self-supervised Learning for Prediction (GenS2-P), a cyberattack-resilient framework designed to ensure reliable charging demand predictions under adversarial conditions. GenS2-P incorporates a Denoising/Reconstruction AutoEncoder (DRAE) and a spatio-temporal prediction model to tackle the dual challenges of data poisoning and DoS attacks. By leveraging generative self-supervised learning and multi-task learning, GenS2-P effectively extracts spatio-temporal patterns to denoise and reconstruct data corrupted by cyberattacks. Experimental evaluations using real-world EV charging data demonstrate that GenS2-P significantly reduces prediction errors and mitigates cyberattack-induced disruptions.

To the best of our knowledge, there are no existing works that focus on this problem. We prove the problem is NP-hard. Then we propose an A*-based exact algorithm to acquire the optimal solution. Due to the expensive computational overhead of the A*-based exact algorithm, we further propose two effective approximation algorithms, i.e., the label setting algorithm and the top-k based network expansion (k-NE) algorithm.

  abstract     = {Street Scene Semantic Understanding (denoted as TriSU) is a complex task for autonomous driving (AD). However, inference model trained from data in a particular geographical region faces poor generalization when applied in other regions due to inter-city data domain-shift. Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) offers a potential solution for improving TriSU model generalization by collaborative privacy-preserving training over distributed datasets from different cities. Unfortunately, it suffers from slow convergence because the data from different cities are with disparate statistical properties. Going beyond existing HFL methods, we propose a Gaussian heterogeneous HFL algorithm (FedGau) to address inter-city data heterogeneity so that convergence can be accelerated. In the proposed FedGau algorithm, both single RGB image and RGB dataset are modelled as Gaussian distributions for aggregation weight design. This approach not only differentiates each RGB image by respective statistical distribution, but also exploits the statistics of dataset from each city in addition to the conventionally considered data volume. With the proposed approach, the convergence is accelerated by 35.5%-40.6% compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) HFL methods. On the other hand, to reduce the involved communication resource, we further introduce a novel performance-aware adaptive resource scheduling (AdapRS) policy. Unlike the traditional static resource scheduling policy that exchanges a fixed number of models between two adjacent aggregations, AdapRS adjusts the number of model aggregation at different levels of HFL so that unnecessary communications are minimized. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AdapRS saves 29.65% communication overhead compared to conventional static resource scheduling policy while maintaining almost the same performance.},

  abstract     = {Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed to prevent collisions, identify the condition of drivers while operating vehicles, and provide additional information to enhance drivers’ awareness of potential hazards on the road. Today, ADAS are capable of predicting drivers’ actions several seconds in advance, preparing for potential future hazards to prevent accidents or reduce injuries to occupants. Most previous works have achieved prediction results by analyzing and processing a vast amount of driving data from multiple drivers, based on the macro intention preferences of multiple drivers and external environmental features, collectively referred to as the generalized intention prediction network. This network utilizes extensive driving data to predict the common driving intentions of the overall driving population, without considering individualized driving styles. However, according to our research, different drivers exhibit distinct latent preferences in real-world driving scenarios. The generalized intention prediction network is influenced by these latent preferences, resulting in poor generalization capabilities and inaccurate predictions across different drivers. In this study, we propose a individualized driver intention prediction network. Based on Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), it extracts individualized driving intention feature preferences that influence driving intentions from the driver’s historical behavior to improve generalized prediction results and achieve individualized driving intention prediction. We demonstrate that preferences vary among different drivers in the driving domain, leading to biases in model predictions. Upon experimental validation, the method we have proposed demonstrates remarkable efficacy on both the Brain4Cars and IESDD datasets, thereby showcasing its enhanced applicability in real-world scenarios.},

However, its performance in railway scenes is hindered by various challenges, including severe weather conditions, low-light situations, tunnel settings, and diverse and dynamic unstructured scenes. To address these challenges, this study proposes WaveCRNet, a novel architecture for real-time semantic segmentation in challenging conditions, simulating wavelet-constrained PID controller in feature and wavelet space. This study first designs an effective wavelet information enhancement algorithm using a differentiable wavelet transform to bridge the gap between the wavelet and feature information domains. Then, the wavelet-guided attention pag module (WAPM) is introduced to guide the learning and fusion of detailed features based on wavelet priors. Moreover, the traditional wavelet transforms are spectral aliasing and shift sensitivity. Inspired by dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT), the DTCWT-based channel reconstruction module (DCRM) is designed to assist the channel-based learning of boundary information from coarse to fine. Finally, the proposed architecture is evaluated by the public dataset RailSem19. The experimental results validate the consistent performance gains between accuracy and inference speed, improving by 63.7% mIoU and 87 FPS, surpassing those of the advanced methods for real-time segmentation.},

  abstract     = {Visual perception, as a core component of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), plays a key role in enhancing safety and efficiency in urban mobility. While single-task visual perception methods have applications in areas like pedestrian detection and traffic sign recognition, the complexity of real-world scenarios necessitates a shift toward multi-task approaches. This paper introduces the Edge-assisted Multi-task Visual Perception (EMVP) system, which is specifically designed to address the computational intensity and dynamic concurrency challenges inherent to multi-task processing in edge environments. EMVP adopts a collaborative architecture that strategically partitions computational tasks between vehicles and Road-Side Units (RSUs). By integrating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), the system achieves a lightweight yet efficient multi-task model for resource-constrained environments. To adapt to the dynamic and concurrent nature of multi-vehicle scenarios, EMVP incorporates a content-aware adaptive inference mechanism based on reinforcement learning, enabling dynamic task scheduling to improve Quality of Service (QoS). Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the single-task baseline model, the multi-task model of EMVP reduces the computational cost by 86.59% on average while achieving a 4.32% improvement in accuracy. Additionally, in dynamic multi-access environments, EMVP’s adaptive scheduling mechanism, which leverages spatiotemporal content awareness, achieves an average QoS improvement of 7.36% over the sub-optimal method.},

  abstract     = {The widespread deployment of wireless communication networks has catalyzed significant advancements in utilizing signal channs to address real-world challenges, such as (), drone trajectory planning, and network optimization. Existing methods primarily utilize () measurements for vehicle localization. However, these methods require specialized decoding receivers capable of deciphering communication protocols, leading to increased application costs. rss, a measure of wireless signal strength, can be recorded by any standard communication device, thus allowing ()-based to benefit from cost-effectiveness. Nevertheless, the inherently noisy and sporadic nature of poses significant challenges for accurately reconstructing vehicle trajectories. This paper aims to utilize RSS measurements to reconstruct vehicle trajectories within a road network. We constrain the trajectories to comply with signal propagation rules and vehicle mobility constraints, thereby mitigating the impact of the noisy and sporadic nature of RSS data on the accuracy of trajectory reconstruction. The primary challenge involves exploiting latent spatial-temporal correlations within the noisy and sporadic data while navigating the complex road network. To overcome these challenges, we develop an ()-based embedding (HRE) technique that utilizes alternating optimization to search for the vehicle trajectory based on measurements. This model effectively captures the spatial-temporal relationships among measurements, while a road graph model ensures compliance with network pathways. Additionally, we introduce a maximum speed-constrained rough trajectory estimation (MSR) method to effectively guide the proposed alternating optimization procedure, ensuring that the proposed HRE method rapidly converges to a favorable local solution. The proposed method is validated using real measurements from 5G NR networks in Chengdu and Shenzhen, China. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, even with limited data.},

First, we explore the challenges faced by AVs in various complex scenes, including the interference of dynamic objects, the precise localization and mapping requirements in large-scale scenes, as well as variable environmental and weather conditions. Subsequently, we delve into the coping strategies and methods of SLAM in these specific scenes. Finally, we compare and summarize the datasets related to SLAM in complex scenes of AD and point out some potential research directions for achieving high-level AD.

Traditional approaches for matching entities from different knowledge bases often struggle with the complexity and diversity of TN data, which varies across systems and sources such as traffic sensors and GPS devices. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel Multi-Objective Genetic Programming assisted Stochastic Deep Reinforcement Learning (MOGP-SDRL) for DKI in TNs. Unlike existing methods, the proposed framework combines SDRL and MOGP to achieve superior efficiency, accuracy and adaptability in handling heterogeneous TN data. First, a novel SDRL framework is designed to automate and optimize the selection of Similarity Features (SFs) for entity matching. This framework incorporates a probabilistic action selection mechanism, which enhances exploration during the SF selection process. Second, a novel MOGP is presented to construct high-quality, diverse SFs by exploring non-dominated feature ensembles, enhancing both accuracy and adaptability in matching results, leading to more accurate and adaptable matching results compared to conventional methods. Lastly, new approximate evaluation metrics are developed to assess alignment quality without relying on predefined entity alignments, guiding the optimization process. Experimental evaluations on OAEI’s knowledge graph (KG) dataset and five pairs of real-world TN dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the MOGP-SDRL framework, which consistently produces high-quality matching results and achieves significant improvements in both accuracy and robustness over existing approaches.},

Our 2MGTCN model utilizes federated transfer learning (FTL) to transfer the model from the source to the target domain, mitigating data scarcity.

Additionally, Grey Relation Analysis (GRA) and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) methods are applied to capture road relationships, and a Federated Parameter Aggregation based on Spatial Similarity (FPASS) algorithm is proposed for ensuring effective parameter aggregation by considering spatial similarity.

The intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is proposed as a solution to configure the propagation channel in a smart radio environment by adjusting phase shifts. However, designing IRS-assisted V-Nets that achieve ultra-reliability in dynamic and noisy communication is challenging due to the passive nature of the IRS and the limitations of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents a computer vision (CV) enabled IRS framework for V-Nets, which combines a convolutional neural network and CV techniques. The framework utilizes real-time visual information to estimate and configure optimal beamforming for IRS-assisted V-Nets. Adapting to real-time network dynamics and intelligently guiding signals, the CV-IRS framework improves prediction accuracy to 95 %, an achievable maximum rate of 11.2 bps/Hz with 100 IRS elements, and resource allocation efficiency of 88 % with 10 vehicles.

  abstract     = {Commercial complex is a compositional scenario that involves pedestrians with different travel purposes such as commuting, shopping and business. Simulation of pedestrian behavior in a commercial complex is difficult due to the heterogeneity of pedestrians and different attractions from various kinds of shops. Inspired from the law of universal gravitation and the pedestrian dynamics theory, we propose an attractive potential based social force framework for pedestrian simulation in commercial complexes. Our framework consists of an attractive potential model and an attractive potential based social force model. The former model evaluates the attractive force of different types of shops towards heterogeneous pedestrians, by associating the attributes of pedestrians with the types of shops. The latter model effectively evaluates the travel direction of pedestrians by incorporating the attractive force with the social force model via a synthesis force criterion. We conduct the simulation experiment based on 600 groups of pedestrian tracking data collected in the China World Mall, Beijing, a typical commercial complex. The simulation results show that the model can effectively simulate not only the trajectory of real pedestrians, but also the behavior of entering shops. Our research significantly improves the authenticity of pedestrian simulation and provides support for travel behavior modeling of heterogeneous pedestrians in the commercial complex.},

However, with the introduction of AAVs, new challenges such as trajectory design and AAV-user association occur. In this paper, we consider a caching AAV-assisted wireless network and formulate a user fairness problem by jointly optimizing AAV-user association, trajectory design, and bandwidth allocation of the AAVs, which is mixed-integer and non-convex. In order to find solutions, we decompose the original problem into three subproblems and propose an iterative algorithm based on block alternating descent and successive convex approximation methods. In addition, computational complexity is analyzed. Finally, simulation results validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, compared to benchmark algorithms.},

  abstract     = {With the acceleration of urbanization, the traffic congestion issue is becoming more and more prominent in large cities. The effective scheduling of urban traffic signals becomes critical. This study proposes three novel prediction and feedback assisted evolutionary algorithms (PFAEAs) to address the urban traffic signal scheduling problem (UTSSP) with minimizing vehicle delays. First, we construct a mathematical model of UTSSP and design an improved evolutionary algorithm (EA) framework that integrates an eight-phase control strategy based on a vehicle movement relationship graph. Then, by combining a back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and meta-heuristics, we improve the prediction accuracy of the vehicle turning rate for generating high-quality initial solutions. Further, 12 problem-specific search operators (PSSOs) are designed to enhance the exploration capability of EA. Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, especially the Q-learning and Sarsa algorithms, are employed to select premium PSSOs dynamically for guiding the search direction of EA. Finally, for 18 cases with different scales, the proposed PFAEAs show significant advantages in reducing vehicle delays compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms. The results validate the competitiveness and practicality of the PFAEAs for UTSSP.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular edge computing (VEC) is a new paradigm in smart cities with the potential to provide and manage resources such as computing and storage closer to resourceconstrained smart vehicles (SV) to support ultra-reliable lowlatency communications and knowledge sharing. However, it is challenging to make optimal resource allocation and offloading decisions due to the mobility, ubiquitous communications, and diverse resource demands of SVs and the dynamic nature of the vehicular network topology. In this paper, we propose an adaptive resource allocation and task offloading scheme for HAPS-assisted Internet of Vehicle networks by exploiting the potential of digital twins (DT), blockchain, and federated multiagent deep reinforcement learning (FMADRL) technologies to address these issues. The DT network is utilized to intelligently monitor and control the demand and supply of resources in the digital representation of the physical operating environment. We adopt a dynamic pricing-based double auction to model the supplies and demands of resource providers and requesters. This enables resource providers and SVs to make adaptive and optimal resource allocation and task offloading decisions. In addition, we deploy a consortium blockchain to enable distributed and secure resource allocation. The resource allocation and task offloading multi-objective optimization problem is formulated as a multiagent extension of the Markov decision process and solved using an FMADRL-based multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (FMADDPG) algorithm. The numerical results show that the proposed scheme archives efficient resource allocation and maximizes the utility function while minimizing costs compared to the baseline schemes.},

Raw sensor data from camera, Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR), and radar are extracted within the bounding box region identified by the black-box detector. The classification is based on the extracted images and point cloud data, with the inclusion of a &#39;fault class&#39; to detect misclassifications by the black-box detectors. This approach also consolidates class labels to improve classification reliability and reduce computational costs. A dataset is built to evaluate the performance of system. The classification performance is analyzed based on different sensor types (camera, LiDAR, radar), machine learning techniques (attention mechanisms), and sensor fusion methods (early, middle, late). The classification result is obtained by probabilistically fusing the outputs of both black-box and fusion-based classifiers. The results demonstrate that this fusion-based approach significantly improves the reliability of the classification, providing a robust solution to safe autonomous driving},

The upgrade of vehicle sensors provides us an opportunity for a better judgement of the driver&#39;s driving style. This paper proposes a new driving style classification method based on the active learning. This method first uses the concept of driving volatility measurement to measure the performance of vehicles in terms of speed and acceleration, and then generates data to reduce the influence of data distribution on learning effect. The proposed method divides drivers&#39; behaviors into aggressive, ordinary and calm styles. It can effectively learn the features related to driving style in driving volatility measurement, and the active learning method itself can reduce the requirement of human expert experience. The effectiveness of the proposed method is proved by the experiments on the UAH-Driveset, and then this paper uses the proposed method to analyze some data from the Security Pilot Model Deployment (SPMD).},

  abstract     = {Large language models (LLMs) as autonomous agents offer a novel avenue for tackling real-world challenges through a knowledge-driven manner. These LLM-enhanced methodologies excel in generalization and interpretability. However, the complexity of driving tasks often necessitates the collaboration of multiple, heterogeneous agents, underscoring the need for such LLM-driven agents to engage in cooperative knowledge sharing and cognitive synergy. Despite the promise of LLMs, current applications predominantly center around single-agent scenarios, which limits their scope in the face of intricate, interconnected tasks. To broaden the horizons of knowledge-driven strategies and bolster the generalization capabilities of autonomous agents, we propose the $\mathsf {KoMA}$ framework consisting of the multi-agent interaction, the multi-step planning, the shared-memory, and the ranking-based reflection modules to enhance multi-agents&#39; decision-making in complex driving scenarios. Based on the framework&#39;s generated text descriptions of driving scenarios, the multi-agent interaction module enables LLM agents to analyze and infer the intentions of surrounding vehicles based on scene information, akin to human cognition. The multi-step planning module enables LLM agents to analyze and obtain final action decisions layer by layer to ensure consistent goals for short-term action decisions. The shared memory module can accumulate collective experience to make superior decisions, and the ranking-based reflection module can evaluate and improve agent behavior with the aim of enhancing driving safety and efficiency. The $\mathsf {KoMA}$ framework not only enhances the robustness and adaptability of autonomous driving agents but also significantly elevates their generalization capabilities across diverse scenarios. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over traditional methods, particularly in its ability to handle complex, unpredictable driving environments without extensive retraining.

CAVs are being rapidly adapted for passenger transportation, delivery of cargo, disaster management and military reconnaissance missions. CAVs for urban transportation are in line with the evolution of “smart cities.” However, as CAVs belong to the family of cyber-physical systems (CPS), they inherit some of the generic cyber vulnerabilities of CPS. Due to the unique features of vehicular networks, establishing secure communication between vehicle to vehicle (V2V) and vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) has remained a challenge for vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) service providers. The vulnerabilities associated with the multitude of sensors and internal connectivity modules increase the threat of cyber-attack on CAVs by many folds. This necessitates clear identification of the potential threats and classify them in terms of attack mechanisms. This classification will help in mapping the existing security solutions and exploration of new defense strategies for CAVs. This article has conducted a comprehensive survey of the cyber-attacks on CAVs and the ongoing research on the defense mechanisms. This work organizes the cyber-attacks based on the attacker strategies, attack surfaces, and attack vectors. The mitigation strategies are categorized based on the underlying defense approaches such as cryptography, intrusion detection, access control, and authentication in relation to their effectiveness in mitigating different attack categories.

To address this issue, this paper introduces a virtual traffic control system called advanced stop point and prior start time (ASP-PST). The ASP-PST leverages vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications between traffic signals and connected and automated heavy trucks. The system guides autonomous heavy trucks on where to stop and when to initiate their movement ahead of the green light. This strategy reduces start-up delays by managing vehicle movement control, enabling trucks to reach sufficient speed before approaching the intersection, thereby ensuring smooth passing and harmonized traffic flow. An analytical solution for the ASP-PST has been developed and validated through microscopic simulation tests at signalized intersections. The results show reductions in travel time of up to 50% in mixed traffic conditions, consisting of both heavy trucks and general cars, and illustrate the formation of well-coordinated platoons with uniform spacing. Demonstrating efficacy across various network environments, the ASP-PST offers a potential solution to enhance traffic flow and reduce congestion caused by heavy trucks at intersections.},

Recently, diffusion models have gained increasing attention as a promising approach for learning multimodal trajectory distribution. However, existing diffusion models for trajectory prediction tasks are mainly based on the modality of trajectory points, which exhibit rapidly increasing uncertainty over the temporal dimension in vehicle prediction. To overcome this limitation, we propose leveraging the bird&#39;s-eye-view (BEV) trajectory grids to represent trajectory in different time horizons. The diffusion on such representation will benefit from its robust context representation capabilities and inherently lower variance disparity among spatial pixel variables. To alleviate systematic errors arising from the limited resolution of rasterized images, Trajectory Refiner is employed to take as input rough trajectories extracted from the denoised BEV images and output accurate trajectory. Our method is rigorously tested on benchmark datasets including ETH/UCY and nuScence, demonstrating superior performance in long-term prediction accuracy compared to current diffusion-based trajectory prediction methods. Additionally, our experiments show that diffusion on trajectory grid can accelerate inference process with fewer denoising steps compared with trajectory points},

This paper presents a detailed overview of the new course design, its underlying philosophy, the individual teaching modules, and the modular hardware/software of the F1TENTH platform. This new course was then evaluated with a survey conducted at five universities that have adopted the teaching modules for their semester-long undergraduate and graduate courses.

The proposed system includes a method for ground extraction to remove obstacles and applies Adaptive Smoothing method to generate a continuous and accurate road height profile. Additionally, a bump-dip detection technique is introduced to identify road irregularities directly from the generated profile. We conducted a quantitative analysis of the system&#39;s performance through simulations and proving ground experiments, considering various LiDAR installation configurations and bump-dip environments. The results verify the accuracy and robustness of the proposed algorithm, and real-world vehicle experiments further confirm the reliability of the road height profile estimation.},

  abstract     = {This study introduces a robust Dynamic Population Evacuation (DPE) framework in response to the escalating challenges in wildfire-urban interface regions. The DPE model elevates emergency response strategies by seamlessly integrating traffic simulation, real-time mobility tracking, optimization systems leveraging advanced algorithms, and cloud-based communication. The offline component of the framework focuses on pre-disaster preparation by optimizing the allocation of evacuation shelters and generating initial route plans for impacted populations, incorporating changing on-the-ground hazard conditions and geography. The online phase dynamically reallocates shelters and provides real-time guidance for vehicle navigation. This approach significantly improves the efficiency and safety of evacuation processes by utilizing advanced algorithms and cloud infrastructure. Key innovations include an offline planning phase, optimizing shelter allocation and route plans with a keen eye on evolving hazards and geography. Extensive testing and simulations of the DPE framework, including models of real-world evacuation scenarios such as the Tubbs fire in California, validate the proposed approach and demonstrate significant improvement in efficiency, responsiveness, and safety for populations relative to traditional evacuation planning methods and frameworks. The study further underscores the broader applicability of the DPE model to enhance resilience and outcomes in urban evacuations not only for wildfires but also for other hazards such as floods and earthquakes.},

  abstract     = {Assuring safety of artificial intelligence (AI) applied to safety-critical systems is of paramount importance. Especially since research in the field of automated driving shows that AI is able to outperform classical approaches, to handle higher complexities, and to reach new levels of autonomy. At the same time, the safety assurance required for the use of AI in such safety-critical systems is still not in place. Due to the dynamic and far-reaching nature of the technology, research on safeguarding AI is being conducted in parallel to AI standardization and regulation. The parallel progress necessitates simultaneous consideration in order to carry out targeted research and development of AI systems in the context of automated driving. Therefore, in contrast to existing surveys that focus primarily on research aspects, this paper considers research, standardization and regulation in a concise way. Accordingly, the survey takes into account the interdependencies arising from the triplet of research, standardization and regulation in a forward-looking perspective and anticipates and discusses open questions and possible future directions. In this way, the survey ultimately serves to provide researchers and safety experts with a compact, holistic perspective that discusses the current status, emerging trends, and possible future developments.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely used in reconnaissance missions due to their good maneuverability, low cost and high efficiency. When multiple UAVs complete reconnaissance tasks, they need accurate positioning and cooperation. In the case that some UAVs lack positioning equipment, cooperative reconnaissance of UAV groups in a certain spatial area can be realized. The innovation of this research lies in the proposal of a novel combinatorial metaheuristic optimization method, named Combinatorial Manta Ray Foraging Optimization (CM RFO). This method uniquely combines the Hungarian algorithm from combinatorial optimization with the manta ray foraging optimization from metaheuristic optimization to systematically address collaborative task planning problems for multiple UAVs. According to the requirements of the cooperative reconnaissance task, a model is established that is divided into three stages: estimation of the optimal reconnaissance position of the UAV, estimation of the position of the UAV itself and reconnaissance subtask assignment. In the experiment, through the optimization results of particle swarm optimization, the Harris eagle algorithm and Manta ray foraging optimization in position estimation, the superiority of the Manta ray foraging optimization algorithm is demonstrated, and the Hungarian algorithm is then used to obtain the optimal distribution results of reconnaissance subtasks. We also show the completion process of the multi UAV cooperative reconnaissance task in some scenes where UAVs lack positioning equipment through graphical simulation and verify the proposed multiple unmanned aerial vehicle cooperative reconnaissance model},

The proposed transformer-based model features an encoder-only architecture with efficient multi-head self-attention to process input tokens derived from various biosignals. Our approach includes Fourier-based biosignal tokenization techniques and a perturbation module as a data augmentation layer. Additionally, we employed a hierarchical spatiotemporal embedding framework, using additive absolute position embeddings for temporal encoding and additive learnable tokens for each channel for spatial encoding. Experimental results demonstrate that our model, trained on raw biosignals, outperforms previous methods, highlighting its potential for monitoring DCL using wearable devices. It achieved error rates that were at least 2.4% and up to 20% lower in ternary classification tests when compared to the baseline models. The findings suggest that integrating a pretrained transformer-based architecture with perturbation-based augmentation can significantly enhance the model&#39;s accuracy and robustness.

In this perspective, Sore4PMP, a hierarchical parallel motion planner, is presented as a suitable solution. Based on raw perception data and descriptive prompts, Sore4PMP can first leverage the advanced generative capabilities of Sora to generate virtual OOD events, and then integrate these events into the decision-making process, thereby enhancing the robustness and generalization of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in emergency scenarios. With a comprehensive outlook, this perspective aims to provide a potential direction for the development of foundation models coupled with autonomous driving and finally promote the safety, efficiency, reliability, and sustainability of AVs.},

Building upon data-driven fault-tolerant control theory, a comprehensive framework consisting of adaptive filter, iterative learning, fault diagnosis and identification, and fault-tolerant control modules is presented. The proposed framework is specifically designed to address trigger conditions such as driving environment variations, integration of multiple control systems, performance degradation due to components aging and maintenance. The framework features online driving state supervision, driving risk measurement, and intervention for mitigation of the SOTIF issues.

This article presents the concept of Spatial Symbiotic Intelligence, which refers to the ability of a city to dynamically respond to the needs of its citizens and environment through the integration of data from various sources and the use of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and parallel systems. This letter also discusses the potential benefits and challenges of implementing City 5.0 and highlights some of the ongoing initiatives in this area.},

  abstract     = {Open-terrain field vehicle (OTFV) fleets, including mining trucks, construction machinery, and agricultural machinery, often encounter significantly more intricate scenarios and unique challenges than road vehicles. Enhancing the intelligence level of OTFV fleets can significantly enhance their operational effectiveness and improve energy efficiency. This perspective paper introduces a metaverse-enabled framework to improve the intelligence levels of OTFV fleets. The metaverse-enabled framework consists of the parallel intelligence-based vehicle fleet control and edge computing-based vehicle dynamics control levels. We first delve into the framework&#39;s specifics, covering open-terrain field metaverse, parallel intelligence, edge computing, and human-vehicle cooperation. We further discuss critical issues such as artificial general intelligence (AGI) enabled large control models, vehicle teleoperation, communication privacy, and edge scenario engineering. Additionally, we provide a detailed account of edge computing and integrated domain control within the vehicle dynamics control level, illustrating the interactions among human drivers, domain controllers, vehicle systems and open-terrain field metaverse. Ultimately, the proposed framework can potentially empower intelligence to OTFV fleets and other equipment clusters with complicated system compositions and challenging missions in complex environments.},

  abstract     = {Reducing vehicle exhaust pollution and energy consumption is of great significance for improving the sustainability of social development. Currently, most energy-efficient and regenerative energy recovery methods are from a vehicle control perspective, ignoring the impact on the overall traffic environment. An important reason is that the transportation system&#39;s large scale, complexity and social nature restrict its energy-efficient development. Hence, this letter proposes energy-efficient and regenerative energy recovery schemes for sustainable intelligent transportation system using the Artificial societies, Computational experiments, Parallel execution (ACP) framework. The framework includes three parts: energy-efficient oriented intelligent road infrastructure design, transportation traffic flow and vehicle velocity profile planning co-design, and cloud-based vehicle engine parameter calibration. This letter is the second part of Distributed/Decentralized Hybrid Workshop on Sustainability for Transportation and Logistics (DHW-STL) and aims to enhance the sustainability of transportation system from the energy-efficient perspective.},

At present, the design and validation for AVs predominantly rely on simulation software or real-road testing methodologies. However, these approaches possess inherent limitations, leading to inaccuracy, reduced efficiency, and potential hazards during the development process. This letter reports our first DHW (decentralized and hybrid workshop) on Scenarios Engineering (SE), that aims to calibrate and validate AV modules through advanced scenarios. Specifically, the DHW discusses combining SE with existing simulation software and real-road testing strategies, enabling developers to maximize the advantages of each approach while ensuring the safety and efficacy in the development of autonomous vehicles. Our findings demonstrate the benefits of enhancing realism of simulation scenarios in the aspects of both content and appearance. Furthermore, the use of scenarios engineering is explored in order to enhance the diversity and safety of real-road testing by means of integrating virtual and physical components.},

  abstract     = {With the continuous development of autonomous driving technology, intelligent vehicles represented by autonomous taxis have begun to participate in the transportation system. Improving the sustainability of intelligent vehicles can increase the useful life of vehicles and reduce the overall increase of vehicles in society. This reduction reduces emissions and energy consumption, thereby increasing environmental sustainability. However, most of the current intelligent vehicles are modified from existing vehicles. The initial design of these vehicle does not consider the requirements for autonomous driving, which can easily lead to a mismatch between the control algorithm and the mechanical structure. Moreover, current intelligent vehicles mainly focus on the development of autonomous driving algorithms and ignore sustainable design, which will lead to increased energy consumption and reduced lifespan. This letter proposes a multi-dimensional circular design (MDCD) framework to improve the sustainability of intelligent vehicles from sustainable lifecycle management perspective. The MDCD framework consists of six parts, which are intelligent design, sensing, control, supervision, diagnosis and recycle.

The following is a brief review of the findings from our DHS, DHWs, and Seminars, in particularly about a novel emission regulatory framework for intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and smart cities (SCs) in ERS. Vehicle emissions are one of the main anthropogenic contributors to global warming and atmospheric pollution. However, effective regulation of transportation emissions is still challenging, even in intelligent transportation systems and smart cities. To realize accurate estimations and credible predictions, a parallel framework is proposed in this letter, consisting of a parallel transportation level and a parallel vehicle level. Through low-cost computational experiments and parallel executions, both accurate estimation and emission-aware optimal planning can be achieved. Unlike previous emission models, modern aftertreatment systems (ATS) are considered as a core module in this novel modular integration model (MIM). An application case on $\rm CO_{2}$ emissions is conducted to validate the fundamental function of this framework.},

This letter forms part of a series of reports emanating from the IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles&#39;s Decentralized and Hybrid Workshops (DHW) dedicated to the field of Scenarios Engineering. Our research proposes a scenario engineering-based calibration and validation framework for trajectory prediction of autonomous vehicles to more effectively validate the performance of the method in challenging scenarios. First, Scenarios Engineering (SE) uses OpenSCENARIO and real dataset to generate high-definition maps for challenging driving scenarios. Then, the vectorization approach is employed to extract contextual details from the scene and agent trajectory information from the HD map, and the graph neural network is used to model the high-order interaction to realize the interactive trajectory prediction. Compared with the traditional method, the trajectory prediction can be calibrated through SE so that the prediction process can use more traffic information and attribute characteristics, and improve the evaluation index of prediction. The DHW discusses a practical case to verify the potential of the trajectory prediction framework based on scenarios generation in improving the authenticity and accuracy of trajectory prediction.},

Using and exchanging real-time position and sensor information about Vulnerable Road Users introduces new privacy threats, as the data can reveal, e.g., social relationships or even users&#39; identity. We contribute to these investigations by identifying new, application-specific privacy threats resulting from different architectures. In addition to highlighting attacker models, we show that broadcast-based peer-to-peer architectures are the most privacy-friendly as compared to client-server and hybrid systems. Furthermore, we highlight implementation-dependent threats. We finally provide an overview of potential countermeasures and future research directions.

  abstract     = {In this era of automation, drones have considered to be a key element with its wide applicability in various situations. Additionally, the efficiency of drones can be further improved via collaborated learning techniques such as federated learning (FL). However, the drone-based FL requires a significant amount of communications because the drones share their FL data over wireless channels. Therefore, the unstable channel condition of wireless transmission introduces the low success probability in large-scale parameter transmission. According to quantum computing (QC) advantages, this problem can be tackled due to less parameter utilization in quantum neural network (QNN) training. Therefore, a novel QC-based FL known as the adaptive quantum federated learning (AQFL) is proposed for drone license plate recognition in autonomous surveillance applications. In our proposed AQFL, adaptive QNNs (AQNNs) are used as local models which can control the depths of QNNs by adding measurement computations in the middles of QNN architectures. Thus, our proposed AQFL is robust even in training data non-iidness and large local model variances while maintaining sufficient learning performance. Finally, the evaluation results verify that our proposed AQFL achieves the desired performance improvements.},

  abstract     = {Driving automation offers a great potential for reducing environmental impact of road transports. Automated eco-driving, i.e. adapting vehicle behaviour in order to reduce energy consumption is a way of achieving it. However, for an eco-driving algorithm to be implemented in a commercial vehicle some constraints on drivability, safety and computing power are to be addressed. In this paper, we propose an acceleration maneuver model allowing to explicitly consider drivability constraints. The model is based on many empirical studies on Physiology and Ergonomics and has been verified using real driving recordings. Then we propose an Automated Eco-driving algorithm, allowing to minimize driving energy consumption while meeting drivability and safety constraints. The algorithm is able to adapt to changes in the driving scenario and its architecture is compatible with a real-time implementation.},

However, existing multi-modal methods face two key challenges: 1) difficulty with efficient deployment and realtime execution; and 2) drastic performance degradation under weak calibration between LiDAR and cameras. To address these challenges, we propose CPGNet-LCF, a new multi-modal fusion framework extending the LiDAR-only CPGNet. CPGNet-LCF solves the first challenge by inheriting the easy deployment and real-time capabilities of CPGNet. For the second challenge, we introduce a novel weak calibration knowledge distillation strategy during training to improve the robustness against the weak calibration. CPGNet-LCF achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes and SemanticKITTI benchmarks. Remarkably, it can be easily deployed to run in 20 ms per frame on a single Tesla V100 GPU using TensorRT TF16 mode. Furthermore, we benchmark performance over four weak calibration levels, demonstrating the robustness of our proposed approach. Our code is available at https://github.com/humemarx/CPG-LCF.},

In this sense, the reliability of autonomous vehicles can be guaranteed under noisy conditions, which are potentially caused by uneven road surfaces and sensor inaccuracies. By applying the Taylor expansion theorem, these noises can be represented in polynomial forms for the desired accuracy, providing a unique perspective for handling noise disturbances. Moreover, the robustness and stability of the proposed PNRND model are analyzed using theoretical derivations.

To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel machine learning-based speed bump prediction system that predicts remaining distance to and height of speed bumps using in-vehicle data, which is robust to external environment and represent driving pattern of driver. The proposed system consists of three components: machine learningbased bump predictor, automatic training dataset generator, and cloud-based continuous learning system. The effectiveness of the proposed system was confirmed through tests with varied datasets in different drivers and locations. The prediction of the distance to the speed bump demonstrated a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 6.37 meters, while the height prediction showed an RMSE of 0.9 cm. Additionally, after applying cloud-based continuous learning for driver-specific personalization, the RMSE for the distance prediction improved to 5.96 meters.

However, cameras are not robust against severe weather conditions, lidar sensors are expensive, and the performance of radar-based perception is still inferior to the others. Camera-radar fusion methods have been proposed to address this issue, but these are constrained by the typical sparsity of radar point clouds and often designed for radars without elevation information. We propose a novel camera-radar fusion approach called Dual Perspective Fusion Transformer (DPFT), designed to overcome these limitations. Our method leverages lower-level radar data (the radar cube) instead of the processed point clouds to preserve as much information as possible and employs projections in both the camera and ground planes to effectively use radars with elevation information and simplify the fusion with camera data. As a result, DPFT has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on the K-Radar dataset while showing remarkable robustness against adverse weather conditions and maintaining a low inference time.

Relying solely on single image information or point cloud information is insufficient to overcome tracking challenges in complex scenarios. Currently, multimodal fusion 3D tracking methods still face numerous issues in fusion performance, data association, and trajectory management. Therefore, this paper proposes a dynamic 3D multi-object tracking method based on spatiotemporal features. First, a multi-scale spatial feature embedding fusion network is designed to enhance the weight of critical information within different modal features, thereby improving the prominence of target features. Second, a temporal aggregation embedding module is proposed to address the characteristics of point cloud features and fusion features, enhancing feature alignment when target features are integrated into temporal features, resulting in more robust temporal features. Finally, a multi-stage hybrid affinity dynamic association module and an adaptive dynamic trajectory management module are combined to reduce the impact of similar targets on tracking, which improves the model&#39;s ability to perceive target positions in dense scenes, and enhances the robustness of target association matching. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset have demonstrated that the proposed method achieves better tracking performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods.},

Forty-one participants navigated simulated driving scenarios with various hazards and alert conditions, allowing analysis of response times, physiological responses, and subjective perceptions. The findings showed that higher-intensity alerts significantly reduced reaction times, leading to quicker driver takeovers. Interestingly, engagement in certain secondary tasks sometimes improved driver responsiveness, suggesting that moderate cognitive engagement may enhance alertness. Response times varied across different driving scenarios, indicating the influence of situational context on driver behavior. Physiological measures, including eye-tracking and heart rate monitoring, showed increased cognitive and physiological arousal during takeover events, particularly in response to stronger alerts. Participants reported higher confidence and satisfaction with high-intensity alerts, without reporting increased annoyance, indicating a preference for more assertive alert mechanisms. These outcomes highlight the critical role of adaptive alert mechanisms in ADS design, promoting for context-aware signaling and real-time driver state monitoring to improve takeover performance and ensure vehicular safety. The study suggests that future ADS should integrate dynamic alert systems capable of adjusting intensity based on situational urgency and driver engagement, thereby enhancing overall system reliability and user acceptance.},

  abstract     = {Motion prediction plays an essential role in autonomous driving systems, enabling autonomous vehicles to achieve more accurate local-path planning and driving decisions based on predictions of the surrounding vehicles. However, existing methods neglect the potential missing values caused by object occlusion, perception algorithm failures, etc., which inevitably degrades the trajectory prediction performance in real traffic scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a novel end-to-end framework for incomplete vehicle trajectory prediction, named Multi-scale Temporal Fusion Transformer (MTFT), which consists of the Multi-scale Attention Head (MAH) and the Continuity Representation-guided Multi-scale Fusion (CRMF) module. Specifically, the MAH leverages the multi-head attention mechanism to parallelly capture multi-scale motion representation of trajectory from different temporal granularities, thus mitigating the adverse effect of missing values on prediction. Furthermore, the multi-scale motion representation is input into the CRMF module for multi-scale fusion to obtain the robust temporal feature of the vehicle. During the fusion process, the continuity representation of vehicle motion is first extracted across time steps to guide the fusion, ensuring that the resulting temporal feature incorporates both detailed information and the overall trend of vehicle motion, which facilitates the accurate decoding of future trajectory that is consistent with the vehicle&#39;s motion trend. We evaluate the proposed model on four datasets derived from different traffic scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate its superior performance in the incomplete vehicle trajectory prediction task compared with state-of-the-art models, e.g. , a comprehensive performance improvement of more than 39% on the HighD dataset.

  abstract     = {Link prediction, which aims to predict the existence of a link between two nodes in a network, has various applications ranging from friend recommendation to protein interaction prediction. Recently, Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based link prediction has demonstrated its advantages and achieved the state-of-the-art performance. Typically, GNN-based link prediction can be formulated as a binary classification problem. However, in link prediction, we only have positive data (observed links) and unlabeled data (unobserved links), but no negative data. Therefore, Positive Unlabeled (PU) learning naturally fits the link prediction scenario. Unfortunately, the unknown class prior and data imbalance of networks impede the use of PU learning in link prediction. To deal with these issues, this paper proposes a novel model-agnostic PU learning algorithm for GNN-based link prediction by means of Positive-Unlabeled Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (PU-AUC) optimization. The proposed method is free of class prior estimation and able to handle the data imbalance. Moreover, we propose an accelerated method to reduce the operational complexity of PU-AUC optimization from quadratic to approximately linear. Extensive experiments back up our theoretical analysis and validate that the proposed method is capable of boosting the performance of the state-of-the-art GNN-based link prediction models.},

  abstract     = {In the evolving field of urban development, precise traffic prediction is essential for optimizing traffic and mitigating congestion. While traditional graph learning-based models effectively exploit complex spatial-temporal correlations, their reliance on trivially generated graph structures or deeply intertwined adjacency learning without supervised loss significantly impedes their efficiency. This paper presents Contrastive Learning of spatial-tEmporal trAffic data Representations (CLEAR) framework, a comprehensive approach to spatial-temporal traffic data representation learning aimed at enhancing the accuracy of traffic predictions. Employing self-supervised contrastive learning, CLEAR strategically extracts discriminative embeddings from both traffic time-series and graph-structured data. The framework applies weak and strong data augmentations to facilitate subsequent exploitations of intrinsic spatial-temporal correlations that are critical for accurate prediction. Additionally, CLEAR incorporates advanced representation learning models that transmute these dynamics into compact, semantic-rich embeddings, thereby elevating downstream models&#39; prediction accuracy. By integrating with existing traffic predictors, CLEAR boosts predicting performance and accelerates the training process by effectively decoupling adjacency learning from correlation learning. Comprehensive experiments validate that CLEAR can robustly enhance the capabilities of existing graph learning-based traffic predictors and provide superior traffic predictions with a straightforward representation decoder. This investigation highlights the potential of contrastive representation learning in developing robust traffic data representations for traffic prediction.},

  abstract     = {Logical reasoning consistently plays a fundamental and significant role in the domains of knowledge engineering and artificial intelligence. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a noteworthy innovation in natural language processing (NLP). However, the question of whether LLMs can effectively address the task of logical reasoning, which requires gradual cognitive inference similar to human intelligence, remains unanswered. To this end, we aim to bridge this gap and provide comprehensive evaluations in this paper. First, to offer systematic evaluations, we select fifteen typical logical reasoning datasets and organize them into deductive, inductive, abductive and mixed-form reasoning settings. Considering the comprehensiveness of evaluations, we include 3 early-era representative LLMs and 4 trending LLMs. Second, different from previous evaluations relying only on simple metrics (e.g., accuracy), we propose fine-level evaluations in objective and subjective manners, covering both answers and explanations, including answer correctness, explain correctness, explain completeness and explain redundancy. Additionally, to uncover the logical flaws of LLMs, problematic cases will be attributed to five error types from two dimensions, i.e., evidence selection process and reasoning process. Third, to avoid the influences of knowledge bias and concentrate purely on benchmarking the logical reasoning capability of LLMs, we propose a new dataset with neutral content. Based on the in-depth evaluations, this paper finally forms a general evaluation scheme of logical reasoning capability from six dimensions (i.e., Correct, Rigorous, Self-aware, Active, Oriented and No hallucination). It reflects the pros and cons of LLMs and gives guiding directions for future works.},

However, most of existing next POI recommendation researches only model users&#39; preferences based on their own sequences and ignore the influence of partners who visit POI with the target user and may change with time. Inspired by dynamic Graph neural networks, we propose a Group-aware Dynamic Graph Representation Learning (GDGRL) method for next POI recommendation. GDGRL connects different user sequences and specific partners via dynamic graph structure, which contains interactions between users and POIs as well as influence of partners. The users&#39; dynamic preferences are learned from group-aware dynamic graph and context-aware dynamic graph through dynamic graph neural networks. Finally, the next POI recommendation task is transformed into a link prediction between user node and POI node in the dynamic graph. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show that GDGRL outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches.},

Moreover, we propose the star-centric paradigm for tracing index change and design various pruning techniques to further accelerate index maintenance. We also extend our algorithms to batch mode for shared computation, to structural maintenance for full types of updates, and generalize to all kinds of TDHL.

However, the interpretability on how could the final text sentiment be determined by neural-based text representation has not been thoroughly unfolded yet. Consequently, in this paper, we propose CogLign which injects the neural-cognition derived from Electroencephalogram (EEG)-signal into the neural-based text sentiment analysis model, aimed at learning the activation of brain regions stimulated by different sentiments, so as to guide our proposed CogLign to make proper determination on text sentiment in brain-like way. Specifically, on the one hand, the given videos in different sentiments have been watched by subjects, during which the EEG-signals are monitored to construct brain connectivity pattern as brain graph (BG), attaining more obvious sentiment response on brain region activation for neural-cognition. On the other hand, we interpret the video-plots (or video-semantics) along timeline into text, where the entire video-interpreted-text will be strictly bound with the whole EEG-signal-sequence by segment via the fixed size of time-window. Then, entities and relations are extracted from the video-interpreted-text to construct knowledge graph (KG), depicting text semantics. Next, mapping from entities (or nodes) in KG to EEG-Electrodes (or nodes) in BG, further dated back to different brain regions, has been learned via cognition alignment between the EEG-derived BG and text-derived KG. In this way, by aligning neural cognition from brain graph with the semantic cognition from knowledge graph, our proposed framework CogLign can not only achieve the overall best sentiment analysis performance on the video-interpreted-text, but can also detect brain connectivity patterns in different sentiments more consistent with the prior conclusion of brain region sentiment preference, revealing competitive interpretability on text sentiment determination},

  abstract     = {Currently, attention mechanism has become a standard fixture in most state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) models, not only due to the outstanding performance it could gain but also due to plausible innate explanations for the behaviors of neural architectures it provides, which is notoriously difficult to analyze. However, recent studies show that attention is unstable against randomness and perturbations during training or testing, such as random seeds and slight perturbation of embedding vectors, which impedes it from becoming a faithful explanation tool. Thus, a natural question is whether we can find some substitute for the current attention that is more stable and could keep the most important characteristics of explanation and prediction of attention. In this paper, to resolve the problem, we provide a rigorous definition of such alternate namely SEAT (Stable and Explainable Attention). Specifically, a SEAT should have the following three properties: (1) Its prediction distribution is enforced to be close to the distribution based on the vanilla attention; (2) Its top-$k$ indices have large overlaps with those of the vanilla attention; (3) It is robust w.r.t perturbations, i.e., any slight perturbation on SEAT will not change the prediction distribution too much, which implicitly indicates that it is stable to randomness and perturbations. To further improve the interpretability stability against perturbations, based on SEAT we provide another definition called SEAT++. Then we propose a method to get a SEAT++, which could be considered an ad hoc modification for canonical attention. Finally, through intensive experiments on various datasets, we compare our SEAT and SEAT++ with other baseline methods using RNN, BiLSTM, and BERT architectures via six different evaluation metrics for model interpretation, stability, and accuracy. Results show that SEAT and SEAT++ are more stable against different perturbations and randomness while also keeping the explainability of attention, which indicates they provide more faithful explanations. Moreover, compared with vanilla attention, there is almost no utility (accuracy) degradation for SEAT and SEAT++.},

  abstract     = {Sequential recommendation systems aim to predict the future behaviors of users based on their historical interactions. Despite the success of neural architectures like Transformer and Graph Neural Networks, these models often struggle with the inherent challenge of sparse data in accurately predicting future user behaviors. To alleviate the data sparsity problem, some methods leverage the contrastive learning to generate contrastive views, assuming the items appear discretely at the same time intervals and focusing on the sequence order. However, these approaches neglect the crucial temporal-aware collaborative patterns hidden within the user-item interactions, leading to a limited variety of contrastive pairs and less informative embeddings. The proposed framework, Temporal-aware graph contrastive learning with theoretical guarantees for sequential Recommendation (TagRec), integrates temporal-aware collaborative patterns with adaptive data augmentation to generate more informative user and item representations. TagRec employs a temporal-aware graph neural network to embed the original graph, then generates augmented graphs through the addition of interactions via latent user interest mining, the dropping of redundant interaction edges, and the perturbation of temporal information. Theoretical guarantees are provided that these augmentations enhance the graph&#39;s utility. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over the state-of-the-art recommendation methods.},

This complexity becomes particularly daunting when dealing with large sets of variables. We introduce a novel divide-and-conquer method that uniquely handles this challenge. The existing division strategies often rely on conditional independency (CI) tests or data-driven clustering to split variables, which can suffer from the typical data scarcity in large-scale settings, thus leading to inaccurate division results. The proposed method overcomes this by implementing a data-independent division strategy, which constructs a prior structure, informed by potential causal relationships identified using a Large Language Model (LLM), to guide recursively dividing variables into sub-sets. This approach avoids the impact of data insufficiency and is robust against potential incompleteness in the prior structure. In the merging phase, we adopt a score-based refinement strategy to address fake causal links caused by hidden variables in sub-sets, which eliminates edges in the intersected parts of sub-sets to optimize the score of local structures. While maintaining both correctness and completeness under the faithfulness assumption, this novel merging approach demonstrates enhanced performance than the conventional CI-test based merging strategy in practical scenarios. Empirical evaluations on various large-scale datasets demonstrate the proposed approach&#39;s superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing causal discovery methods.},

The TaylorS converts the non-linear regression problem into a multi-order non-linear approximation problem by plugging a Taylor expansion into the forecasting task. To achieve this, we design a two-step training framework, including a training step and an adjusting step. During training, we train a given forecasting model as a base model to be equipped with prior knowledge. During adjusting, we fine-tune the base model while plugging an adjustment model into the base model. The adjustment model, as a multi-order expansion, takes the multi-order derivative of data to evaluate data uncertainty for further forecasting approximation and adjustment. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed TaylorS framework can consistently improve the performance of existing state-of-the-art methods and generalize these methods to different forecasting tasks.

  abstract     = {Multi-view graph clustering (MVGC) explores pairwise correlations of entire instances and comprehensively aggregates diverse source information with optimal graph structure. One major issue of practical MVGC is the high time and space complexities prohibiting being applied on large-scale applications. As a promising solution of addressing large-scale problems, anchor-based strategy identifies small portion and key landmarks to serve as replacements for the entire dataset. Despite of its efficiency, anchors chosen across views may be semantically unaligned contrasting to naturally-aligned full sample setting, which may lead to the latter inappropriate graph fusion. Limited attention has been focused on the mentioned Multi-View Anchor-Unaligned Problem (MV-AUP) in the existing literature. In this paper, we firstly revisit existing multi-view anchor graph clustering frameworks and present the MV-AUP phenomenon. Then, we propose a novel Multi-view Corresponding Anchor Graph Alignment Fusion framework (MV-CAGAF), which elegantly solves MV-AUP with structural representation matching in multi-dimensional spaces. Further, we theoretically prove our proposed structural matching approach can be regarded as minimizing the EMD distance of the two relative anchor distributions. Based on this, we design the innovative multi-view anchor graph fusion paradigm with correspondence alignment, which inherits the linear sample complexity for scalable cross-view clustering. Our proposed MV-CAGAF achieves significant improvements with the help of the novel fusion framework on comprehensive benchmark datasets. Most importantly, the experimental results on both of the simulated and real-world datasets significantly prove the importance of cross-view alignment for large-scale multi-view clustering.},

To address the efficiency issue in causal discovery from large-scale observed variables, we propose a Hierarchical Causal Discovery (HCD) framework with a bilevel policy that handles this issue by boosting existing models. Specifically, the high-level policy first finds a causal cut set to partition observed variables into several causal clusters and releases the clusters to the low-level policy. The low-level policy applies any causal discovery method to process these causal clusters in parallel and obtain intra-cluster structures for subsequently inter-cluster structure merging in the high-level policy. To avoid missing inter-cluster edges, we theoretically demonstrate the feasibility of causal cluster cut and inter-cluster structure merging. We also prove the completeness and correctness of HCD for causal discovery. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that HCD consistently and significantly enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of existing advanced methods.

However, there are two key challenges that are not well explored in existing self-supervised tasks: i) Restricted by the structure of the graph-based CF paradigm itself, the classical graph comparison learning architecture ignores the global structural information on the user-item interaction graph. ii) In a key part of existing contrast learning-random graph data enhancement schemes can significantly deteriorate model performance. To address these challenges, we propose a new hypergraph collaborative filtering with adaptive augmentation framework(HCFAA). It captures both local and global collaborative relationships on the user-item graph through a hypergraph-enhanced joint learning architecture. In particular, the designed adaptive structure-guided model ignores the noise introduced on unimportant edges, and thus learns the critical node information on the user-item graph. Comprehensive experimental studies on the Amazon dataset show that the method is effective, which provides an optimization scheme with a new perspective for the problems of key node loss in graph data enhancement and loss of higher-order structural information in GNN. The source code of our model can be available on https://github.com/RSnewbie/RS/tree/master/HCFAA.},

  abstract     = {Federated Learning (FL) is a promising privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm that allows data owners to collaboratively train models while keeping their data localized. Despite its potential, FL faces challenges related to the trustworthiness of both clients and servers, particularly against curious or malicious adversaries. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework named Federated Learning with Low-Dimensional Update Representation and Proximity-Based defense (FLURP), designed to address privacy preservation and resistance to Byzantine attacks in distributed learning environments. FLURP employs $\mathsf {LinfSample}$ method, enabling clients to compute the $l_{\infty }$ norm across sliding windows of updates, resulting in a Low-Dimensional Update Representation (LUR). Calculating the shared distance matrix among LURs, rather than updates, significantly reduces the overhead of Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) by three orders of magnitude while effectively distinguishing between benign and poisoned updates. Additionally, FLURP integrates a privacy-preserving proximity-based defense mechanism utilizing optimized SMPC protocols to minimize communication rounds. Our experiments demonstrate FLURP&#39;s effectiveness in countering Byzantine adversaries with low communication and runtime overhead. FLURP offers a scalable framework for secure and reliable FL in distributed environments, facilitating its application in scenarios requiring robust data management and security.},

Although node attributes are vital for making predictions, previous studies have ignored their importance for explanation. This study presents GAFExplainer, a novel GNN explainer that emphasizes node attributes via attribute augmentation and fusion embedding. The former enhances node attribute encoding for more expressive masks, while the latter preserves the discrimination of node representations across different layers. Together, these modules significantly improve explanation performance.

Multiple sets of experimental results on real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that the proposed model provides valid and accurate explanations. In the visual analysis, the explanations obtained by the proposed model are more comprehensible than those in existing work.

However, recent studies show that GCNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks on graph structures. Therefore, how to defend against such attacks has become a popular research topic. The current common defense methods face two main limitations: (1) From the data perspective, it may lead to suboptimal results since the structural information is ignored when distinguishing the perturbed edges. (2) From the model perspective, the defenders rely on the low-pass filter of the GCN, which is vulnerable during message passing. To overcome these limitations, this paper analyzes the characteristics of perturbed edges, and based on this we propose a robust defense framework, REDE, to generate the adaptive Reliable Defense graph for multi-channel robust GCN. REDE first uses feature similarity and structure difference to discriminate perturbed edges and generates the defense graph by pruning them. Then REDE designs a multi-channel GCN, which can separately capture the information of different edges and high-order neighbors utilizing different frequency components. Leveraging this capability, the defense graph is adaptively updated at each layer, enhancing its reliability and improving prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the enhanced performance and robustness of our proposed REDE over the state-of-the-art defense methods.},

To ensure superior recommendations across both warm and cold scenarios, we introduce CoLLM, an innovative LLMRec approach that explicitly integrates collaborative information for recommendations. CoLLM treats collaborative information as a distinct modality, directly encoding it from well-established traditional collaborative models, and then tunes a mapping module to align this collaborative information with the LLM&#39;s input text token space for recommendations. By externally integrating traditional models, CoLLM ensures effective collaborative information modeling without modifying the LLM itself, providing the flexibility to adopt diverse collaborative information modeling mechanisms. Extensive experimentation validates that CoLLM adeptly integrates collaborative information into LLMs, resulting in enhanced recommendation performance.

  abstract     = {As the application of knowledge graphs becomes increasingly widespread, the issue of knowledge graph incompleteness has garnered significant attention. As a classical type of non-euclidean spatial data, knowledge graphs possess various complex structural types. However, most current knowledge graph completion models are developed within a single space, which makes it challenging to capture the inherent knowledge information embedded in the entire knowledge graph. This limitation hinders the representation learning capability of the models. To address this issue, this paper focuses on how to better extend the representation learning from a single space to Riemannian manifolds, which are capable of representing more complex structures. We propose a new knowledge graph completion model called MRME-KGC, based on multi-view Riemannian Manifolds fusion to achieve this. Specifically, MRME-KGC simultaneously considers the fusion of four views: two hyperbolic Riemannian spaces with negative curvature, a Euclidean Riemannian space with zero curvature, and a spherical Riemannian space with positive curvature to enhance knowledge graph modeling. Additionally, this paper proposes a contrastive learning method for Riemannian spaces to mitigate the noise and representation issues arising from Multi-view Riemannian Manifolds Fusion. This paper presents extensive experiments on MRME-KGC across multiple datasets. The results consistently demonstrate that MRME-KGC significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art models, achieving highly competitive performance even with low-dimensional embeddings.},

To bridge this gap, we propose RAGIC, a novel risk-aware framework for stock interval prediction to quantify uncertainty. Our approach leverages a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to produce future price sequences infused with randomness inherent in financial markets. RAGIC&#39;s generator detects the risk perception of informed investors and captures historical price trends globally and locally. Then the risk-sensitive intervals is built upon the simulated future prices from sequence generation through statistical inference, incorporating horizon-wise insights. The interval&#39;s width is adaptively adjusted to reflect market volatility. Importantly, our approach relies solely on publicly available data and incurs only low computational overhead. RAGIC&#39;s evaluation across globally recognized broad-based indices demonstrates its balanced performance, offering both accuracy and informativeness. Achieving a consistent 95% coverage, RAGIC maintains a narrow interval width. This promising outcome suggests that our approach effectively addresses the challenges of stock market prediction while incorporating vital risk considerations.},

Second, the theoretical interpretation of learned shapelets has been limited to binary classification. To tackle the first issue, we propose a continuous optimization that learns not only shapelets but also their probable locations in a time series, and we show theoretically that this enhances feature discriminability. To tackle the second issue, we provide a theoretical interpretation of shapelet closeness to the time series for target / off-target classes when learning with softmax loss, which allows for multi-class classification.

Given the numerical input data with non-negative entries and a set of rules with high entity coverage, the approach creates the lower-dimensional non-negative representation of the input data in such a way that its factors are described by the appropriate subset of the input rules.

To date, most work is focused on point estimation models, which only output a single value w.r.t an attribute of traffic data at a time, falling short of depicting diverse situations and uncertainty in future. Besides, most methods are not flexible enough to handle real complex traffic scenarios, involving missing values and non-uniformly sampled data. The interactions among different attributes of traffic data are also rarely explored explicitly. In this paper, we focus on probabilistic estimation in traffic prediction tasks, proposing a spatio-temporal multivariate probabilistic predictive model to estimate the distributions of traffic data. Specifically, we devise a multivariate spatio-temporal fusion graph block to extract spatio-temporal correlations of multiple traffic attributes at different locations. A multi-graph fusion module is designed to capture time-varying spatial relationships. We estimate the joint distributions of missing traffic data using copulas.

By using a causal graph, we illustrate why hidden confounders can bring bias in time series forecasting and how to tackle it. We implement causal intervention by a deep architecture that consists of two modules, a Confounders Estimation module to estimate the hidden confounders and a Debiasing module to eliminate the confounding bias in the forecasting model via sampling on confounders. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on various time series datasets.

  abstract     = {Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) provide personalised recommendations by strategically querying attributes matching users&#39; preferences. However, this process suffers from confounding effects of time and user attributes, as users&#39; preferences naturally evolve over time and differ among similar users due to their unique attributes. These confounding effects distort user behaviors&#39; causal drivers, challenging CRSs in learning users&#39; true preferences and generalizable patterns. Recently, causal inference provides principled tools to clarify cause-effect relations in data, offering a promising way to address such confounding effects. In this context, we introduce Causal Conversational Recommender (CCR), which applies causal inference to model the causality between user behaviors and time/user attribute, enabling deeper understanding of user behaviors&#39; causal drivers. First, CCR employs stratification and matching to ensure attribute asked per round is independent from time and user attributes, mitigating their confounding effects. Following that, we apply the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) to quantify the unbiased causal impact of each unasked attribute on user preferences, identifying the attribute with the highest ATE per round as the causal-based attribute, i.e., causal driver of user behaviour. Finally, CCR iteratively refines user preferences through feedback on causal-based attributes. Extensive experiments verified CCR&#39;s robustness and personalization.},

We introduce SCHENO, a principled evaluation metric for the goodness of a schema-noise decomposition of a graph. SCHENO captures how schematic the schema is, how noisy the noise is, and how well the combination of the two represent the original graph data. We visually demonstrate what this metric prioritizes in small graphs, then show that if SCHENO is used as the fitness function for a simple optimization strategy, we can uncover a wide variety of patterns. Finally, we evaluate several well-known graph mining algorithms with this metric; we find that although they produce patterns, those patterns are not always the best representation of the input data.},

  abstract     = {Graph clustering has become a crucial technique for uncovering community structures in complex network data. However, existing approaches often introduce cumbersome regularization or constraints (hyperparameter tuning burden) to obtain balanced clustering results, thereby increasing hyperparameter tuning requirements and intermediate variables. These limitations can lead to suboptimal performance, particularly in scenarios involving imbalanced clusters or large-scale datasets. Besides, most graph cut clustering methods solve two separate discrete problems, resulting in information loss and relying on time-consuming eigen-decomposition. To address these challenges, this paper propose an effective graph cut framework, termed Harmonic MaxMin Cut (HMMC), inspired by worst-case objective optimization and the harmonic mean. Unlike traditional spectral clustering, HMMC produces all cluster assignments in a single step, eliminating the need for additional discretization and notably enhancing robustness to “worst-case cluster” boundaries. this paper further devise a fast coordinate descent (CD) solver that scales linearly complexity with the graph size, offering a computationally efficient alternative to eigen decomposition. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that HMMC is comparable to, or even surpasses, state-of-the-art methods, while also finding more favorable local solutions than non-negative matrix factorization techniques.},

However, existing disentanglement methods still face the following two problems.

(2) The disentanglement process depends on backpropagation signals derived from recommendation tasks, lacking direct supervision, which may lead to biases and overfitting. To address the issues, we propose the Intent Propagation Contrastive Collaborative Filtering (IPCCF) algorithm. Specifically, we design a double helix message propagation framework to more effectively extract the deep semantic information of nodes, thereby improving the model&#39;s understanding of interactions between nodes. An intent message propagation method is also developed that incorporates graph structure information into the disentanglement process, thereby expanding the consideration scope of disentanglement. In addition, contrastive learning techniques are employed to align node representations derived from the structure and intents, providing direct supervision for the disentanglement process, mitigating biases, and enhancing the model&#39;s robustness to overfitting. The experiments on three real data graphs illustrate the superiority of the proposed approach.},

While efficient querying is paramount, data owners also emphasize the significance of privacy preservation. The state-of-the-art JXT (Jutla and Patranabis ASIACRYPT 2022) enables efficient join queries over encrypted tables with a symmetric-key solution. However, we observe that JXT inadvertently leaks undesirable query results as the number of queries increases. In this paper, we propose a novel equi-join scheme, One-Time Join Cross-Tags (OTJXT), which can avoid additional result leakage in multiple queries and extend to equi-join as opposed to natural join in JXT. Specifically, we design a new data encoding method using nonlinear transformations that reveals only the union of results for each query without extra leakage observed in JXT. Moreover, OTJXT addresses the linear search complexity issue (Shafieinejad et al. ICDE 2022) while preventing multiple query leakage. Finally, we implement OTJXT and compare its performance with JXT and Shafieinejad et al.&#39;s scheme on the TPC-H dataset. The results show that OTJXT outperforms in search and storage efficiency, achieving a $\mathbf {98.5\times }$ (resp., $\mathbf {10^{6}\times }$) speedup in search latency and reducing storage cost by 62.5% (resp., 78.5%), compared to JXT (resp., Shafieinejad et al. &#39;s scheme).

However, with the increasing prevalence of learning scenarios involving multiple graphs, traditional GNNs mostly overlook the relationships between nodes across different graphs, mainly due to their limitation of traditional message passing within each graph. In this paper, we propose a novel GNN architecture called cross-graph interaction networks (GInterNet) to enable inter-graph message passing. Specifically, we develop a cross-graph topology construction module to uncover and learn the potential topologies between nodes across different graphs. Furthermore, we establish inter-graph message passing based on the learned cross-graph topologies, achieving cross-graph interaction by aggregating information from different graphs. Finally, we employ cross-graph construction functions involving the relationships between contextual information and cross-graph topology structure to iteratively update the cross-graph topologies. Different to existing related approaches, GInterNet is designed as a cross-graph interaction paradigm for inter-graph message passing. It enables multi-graph interaction during the message passing process. Additionally, it is a plug-and-play framework that can be easily embedded into other models. We evaluate its performance in semi-supervised and unsupervised learning scenarios involving multiple graphs. A detailed theoretical analysis and extensive experiment results have shown that GInterNet improves the performance and robustness of the base models.

  abstract     = {Asynchronous pipeline model parallelism with a “1F1B” (one forward, one backward) schedule generates little bubble overhead and always provides quite a high throughput. However, the “1F1B” schedule inevitably leads to weight inconsistency and weight staleness issues due to the cross-training of different mini-batches across GPUs. To simultaneously address these two problems, in this paper, we propose an optimizer-dependent weight prediction strategy (a.k.a PipeOptim) for asynchronous pipeline training. The key insight of our proposal is that we employ a weight prediction strategy in the forward pass to approximately ensure that each mini-batch uses consistent and staleness-free weights to compute the forward pass of the “1F1B” schedule. To be concrete, we first construct the weight prediction scheme based on the update rule of the used optimizer when training the deep neural network models. Then throughout the “1F1B” pipeline training, each mini-batch is mandated to execute weight prediction, subsequently employing the predicted weights to perform the forward pass. As a result, PipeOptim 1) inherits the advantage of the “1F1B” schedule and generates high throughput, and 2) can ensure effective parameter learning regardless of the type of the used optimizer. We conducted extensive experimental evaluations using nine different deep-learning models to verify the effectiveness of our proposal. The experiment results demonstrate that PipeOptim outperforms the other five popular pipeline approaches including GPipe, PipeDream, PipeDream-2BW, SpecTrain, and XPipe.},

Unsupervised methods such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) can extract styles that are usually mixed with other features. Conditional VAEs (CVAEs) can isolate styles using class labels; however, there are no established methods to extract only styles using unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a CVAE-based method that extracts style features using only unlabeled data. The proposed model consists of a contrastive learning (CL) part that extracts style-independent features and a CVAE part that extracts style features. The CL model learns representations independent of data augmentation, which can be viewed as a perturbation in styles, in a self-supervised manner. Considering the style-independent features from the pretrained CL model as a condition, the CVAE learns to extract only styles. Additionally, we introduce a constraint based on mutual information between the CL and VAE features to prevent the CVAE from ignoring the condition. Experiments conducted using two simple datasets, MNIST and an original dataset based on Google Fonts, demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently extract style features. Further experiments using real-world natural image datasets were also conducted to illustrate the method&#39;s extendability.},

In this work, we directly formulate the inherent goals of diversity-promoting recommendation as a dual-objective optimization problem by simultaneously minimizing the recommendation error and maximizing diversity. These proposed objectives are integrated into Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) to guide the training process toward the orientation of boosting both diversification and accuracy. Additionally, we propose considering diversity in both training and serving phases. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms others in both diversity and relevance.

  abstract     = {Methods based on variational bayes theory are widely used to detect community structures in networks. In recent years, many related methods have emerged that provide valuable insights into variational bayes theory. Remarkably, a fundamental assumption remains incomprehensible. Variational bayes-based methods typically employ a posterior distribution that follows a gaussian distribution to approximate the unknown prior distribution. However, the complexity and irregularity of node distributions in real-world networks prompt us to consider what characteristics of network information are suitable for the posterior distribution. Mathematically, inappropriate low- and high-frequency signals in expectation inference and variance inference can intensify the adverse effects of community distortion and ambiguity. To analysis these two phenomena and propose reasonable countermeasures, we conduct an empirical study. It is found that appropriately compressing low-frequency signals during expectation inference and amplifying high-frequency signals during variance inference are effective strategies. Based on these two strategies, this paper proposes a novel variational bayes plug-in, namely VBPG, to boost the performance of existing variational bayes-based community detection methods. Specifically, we modulate the frequency signals during expectation and variance inference to generate a new gaussian distribution. This strategy improves the fitting accuracy between the posterior distribution and the unknown true distribution without altering the modules of existing methods. The comprehensive experimental results validate that methods using VBPG achieve competitive performance improvements in most cases. The code is available at https://github.com/GDM-SCNU/VBPG.},

To make a prediction, a typical prompt tuning method employs a template wrapping the input text into a cloze question, and a verbalizer mapping the output embedding to labels. However, current methods typically depend on handcrafted templates and verbalizers, which require much domain-specific prior knowledge by human efforts. In this work, we investigate how to build a good human-free prompt tuning using soft prompt templates and soft verbalizers, which can be learned directly from data. To address the challenge of data scarcity, we integrate a set of trainable bases for sentence representation to transfer the contextual information into a low-dimensional space. By jointly pre-training the soft prompts and the bases using contrastive learning, the projection space can catch critical semantics at the sentence level, which could be transferred to various downstream tasks. To better bridge the gap between downstream tasks and the pre-training procedure, we formulate the few-shot classification tasks as another contrastive learning problem. We name this Jointly Pretrained Template and Verbalizer (JPTV). Extensive experiments show that this human-free prompt tuning can achieve comparable or even better performance than manual prompt tuning.},

  abstract     = {Time series classification (TSC) is crucial in many applications, yet accurately modeling complex time series patterns remains challenging. Model-based TSC strives to aptly model time series by capturing their intrinsic temporal dynamics, deriving effective dynamic representations for classification. Despite significant progress in this domain, existing works are still constrained by a singular and overly simplistic modeling paradigm, which proves inadequate to handle the multiscale hierarchies inherent in time series. Additionally, the prevailing reliance on manual model configuration fails to address the diverse dynamic characteristics across varying data scenarios. In this paper, we amalgamate multiple recurrent reservoirs to devise a model-based Multiscale Temporal Dynamic Learning (MsDL) approach. These reservoirs are endowed with varied recurrent connection skips, ensuring a comprehensive capture of temporal dynamics across different timescales. We also present a multi-objective optimization algorithm, which adaptively configures the memory length of each reservoir, allowing for more accurate time series modeling. This optimization further encourages time series from the same class to look closer, while separating those from different classes, thereby enhancing the category-discriminability. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that MsDL outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, ablation studies confirm that our multiscale design and optimization algorithm effectively enhance classification accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Incomplete multiview clustering (IMVC) optimally integrates complementary information within incomplete multiview data to improve clustering performance. Several one-step graph-based methods show great potential for IMVC. However, the low-rank structures of similarity graphs are neglected at the initialization stage of similarity graph construction. Moreover, further investigation into complementary information integration across incomplete multiple views is needed, particularly when considering the low-rank structures implied in high-dimensional multiview data. In this paper, we present one-step adaptive graph learning (OAGL) that adaptively performs spectral embedding fusion to achieve clustering assignments at the clustering indicator level. We first initiate affinity matrices corresponding to incomplete multiple views using spare representation under two constraints, i.e., the sparsity constraint on each affinity matrix corresponding to an incomplete view and the degree matrix of the affinity matrix approximating an identity matrix. This approach promotes exploring complementary information across incomplete multiple views. Subsequently, we perform an alignment of the spectral block-diagonal matrices among incomplete multiple views using low-rank tensor learning theory. This facilitates consistency information exploration across incomplete multiple views. Furthermore, we present an effective alternating iterative algorithm to solve the resulting optimization problem. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed OAGL method outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {Neural architecture search (NAS) is widely used to automate the design of high-accuracy deep architectures, which are often vulnerable to adversarial attacks in practice due to the lack of adversarial robustness. Existing methods focus on the direct utilization of regularized optimization process to address this critical issue, which causes the lack of interpretability for the end users to learn how the robust architecture is constructed. In this paper, we introduce a robust enhanced plugin (REP) method for differentiable NAS to search for robust neural architectures. Different from existing peer methods, REP focuses on the robust search primitives in the search space of NAS methods, and naturally has the merit of contributing to understanding how the robust architectures are progressively constructed. Specifically, we first propose an effective sampling strategy to sample robust search primitives in the search space. In addition, we also propose a probabilistic enhancement method to guarantee natural accuracy and adversarial robustness simultaneously during the search process. We conduct experiments on both convolutional neural networks and graph neural networks with widely used benchmarks against state of the arts. The results reveal that REP can achieve superiority in terms of both the adversarial robustness to popular adversarial attacks and the natural accuracy of original data. REP is flexible and can be easily used by any existing differentiable NAS methods to enhance their robustness without much additional effort.

  abstract     = {Credit card fraud is a severe issue that causes significant losses for both cardholders and issuing banks. Existing methods utilize machine learning-based classifiers to identify fraudulent transactions from labeled transaction records. However, labeled data are often scarce compared to the billions of real transactions due to the high cost of annotation, which means that previous methods do not fully utilize the rich features of unlabeled data. What&#39;s more, contemporary methods succumb to a fallacy of unawareness of the local risk structure and the inability to capture certain risk patterns. Therefore, we propose the Risk-aware Gated Temporal Attention Network (RGTAN) for fraud detection in this work. Specifically, we first build a temporal transaction graph based on the transaction records, which consists of temporal transactions (nodes) and their interactions (edges). Then we leverage a Gated Temporal Graph Attention (GTGA) Mechanism to propagate messages among the nodes and learn adaptive representations of transactions. We also model the fraud patterns through risk propagation, taking advantage of the relations among transactions. More importantly, we devise a neighbor risk-aware representation learning layer to enhance our method&#39;s perception of multi-hop risk structures. We conduct extensive experiments on a real-world credit card transaction dataset and two public fraud detection datasets. The results show that our proposed method, RGTAN, outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on three fraud detection datasets. The risk-aware semi-supervised experiments also demonstrate the excellent performance of our model with only a small fraction of manually labeled data. Moreover, RGTAN has been deployed in a world-leading credit card issuer for credit card fraud detection, and the case study results show the effectiveness of our method in uncovering real-world fraud patterns.},

Nevertheless, existing min-min framework-based models adopt internal minimization to find the view combination with the minimized within-cluster variance, which will lead to effectiveness loss since the real clusters often exhibit high within-cluster variance. To address this issue, we provide a novel scalable min-max multi-view spectral clustering (SMMSC) model to improve clustering performance. Besides, anchor graphs, rather than full sample graphs, are utilized to reduce the computational complexity of graph construction and singular value decomposition, thereby enhancing the applicability of SMMSC to large-scale applications. Then, we rewrite the min-max model as a minimized optimal value function, demonstrate its differentiability, and develop an efficient gradient descent-based algorithm to optimize it with linear computational complexity. Moreover, we demonstrate that the resultant solution of the proposed algorithm is the global optimum. Numerous experiments on different real-world datasets, including some large-scale datasets, demonstrate that SMMSC outperforms existing state-of-the-art multi-view clustering methods regarding clustering performance.},

Firstly, a Topic2RGB algorithm was proposed to convert comment users into pixel points. The algorithm views commenting users as pixel points while using game theory to mine user pro-opposition emotions as RGB information. Secondly, a Topic2Video algorithm was proposed to convert the topic space into video. The algorithm converts the topic space into frame images. Meanwhile, the topic space is time-sliced, then the topic space is transformed into a video. Finally, the volatility of user emotional confrontation during a long time in the topic space is like the change of characteristics of frame images in forgeries videos. Then, a topic video rumor detection method (TVRD) was proposed. The experiments indicate that the method successfully verifies the viability of the topic videolization for rumor detection.

Learning the relation representation of entity pairs and evaluating the match of query and support entity pairs are the two key steps of FKGC. Existing methods learn the representation of entity pairs by either aggregating neighbors of entities or integrating relation representations in the connected paths from head to tail. However, in few-shot scenarios, the limited number of support entity pairs and insufficient structural information with a single neighborhood topology will lead to matching failure. To this end, we consider the star and ring topological information for a given entity pair: (1) Entity neighborhood, which captures multi-hop neighbors of entities; (2) Relational path, which characterizes compound relation forms. Furthermore, to effectively fuse the two kinds of heterogeneous topological information, we design the multi-aggregator and the fine-grained path correlation matching algorithm to obtain more delicate and balanced matching. Based on the proposed relational path correlation matching module, we propose the relation adaptive network to solve the few-shot temporal knowledge graph completion problem.

This limitation subsequently restricts the practicality, as it cannot handle the queries that involve missing entities or relations within the single KG. In this paper, we explore an extended link prediction task, cross-KG link prediction, which answers queries using entities or relations integrated from other KGs. The crux of this problem is transferring knowledge across KGs and fusing their embedding spaces, which possess varying schemata. We develop a relation prototype graph to model the interactions among relations from different KGs. Based on this graph, we first propose a dual-view embedding learning module to fuse embedding spaces by training with instance facts and relation prototype edges. We then introduce an attention mechanism to highlight pivotal information for specific queries, recognizing that different KGs often emphasize various domains. Moreover, we devise an augmentation strategy to generate pseudo-cross-KG facts, facilitating knowledge transfer across KGs. Using four widely-used KGs, we construct two cross-KG link prediction datasets. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our model and the unique contributions of each module.},

To address these challenges, we propose an end-to-end framework that models temporal irregularities while capturing the joint distribution of variables at arbitrary continuous-time points. Specifically, we introduce a dynamic conditional continuous normalizing flow to model data distributions in a non-parametric manner, accommodating the complex, non-Gaussian characteristics commonly found in real-world datasets. Then, by leveraging a carefully factorized log-likelihood objective, our approach captures both temporal and cross-sectional dependencies efficiently.

However, most fairness-aware methods are designed offline with the entire stationary interaction data to handle the global unfairness issue and evaluate their performance in a one-time paradigm. In real-world scenarios, users tend to interact with items continuously over time, leading to a dynamic recommendation environment where unfairness is evolving online. Moreover, previous methods that focus on mitigating the unfairness can hardly bring significant improvements to the recommendation task. Hence, in this paper, we propose a Model-agnostic Dual-side Online Fairness Learning method (MDOFair) for the dynamic recommendation. First, we carefully design dynamic dual-side fairness learning to trace the rapid evolution of unfairness from both the user and item sides. Second, we leverage the fairness and recommendation tasks in one utilized framework to pursue the double-win success. Last, we present an efficient model-agnostic post-ranking method for the dynamic recommendation scenario to mitigate the dynamic unfairness while improving the recommendation performance significantly.

To optimize the requirements of bandwidth to transmit the data as well as to store the data, an efficient synchrophasor data compression technique is desired. To this end, this paper presents a 3-stage data compression scheme in which Stage-1 performs the accumulation of the data matrix from the optimally placed PMUs in WAMS into the local PDC. The data is then passed through a novel Ramanujan&#39;s sum-based fault window detection algorithm to identify the fault within the PMU data matrix in Stage-2. Finally, Stage-3 proposes an enhanced graph filtering-enabled principal component analysis scheme which expands the notion of conventional PCA techniques into the graph domain to compress the data. The performance of the proposed scheme is verified on the IEEE 14-bus system and New England 39-bus system. Further, practical applicability of the proposed method is validated on field PMU data collected from EPFL campus in Switzerland.},

However, existing algorithms spend most of their time in computing lower bounds of Dynamic Time Warping to filter out the unpromising candidates. Specifically, the time complexity for computing these lower bounds is $O(L)$ for each pair of subsequences, where $L$ is the length of the motif (subsequences). This paper proposes two new lower bounds, called $LB_{f}$ and $LB_{M}$, both of them only cost amortized $O(1)$ time for each pair of subsequences. On real datasets, the proposed lower bounds are at least one magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art lower bounds used in motif discovery while still keeping satisfying effectiveness. Based on these faster lower bounds, this paper designs an efficient motif discovery algorithm that significantly reduces the cost of lower bounds. The experiments conducted on real datasets show the proposed algorithm is 5.6 times faster than the state-of-the-art algorithms on average.},

  abstract     = {Provenance is a standardised record that describes how entities, activities, and agents have influenced a piece of data; it is commonly represented as graphs with relevant labels on both their nodes and edges. With the growing adoption of provenance in a wide range of application domains, users are increasingly confronted with an abundance of graph data, which may prove challenging to process. Graph kernels, on the other hand, have been successfully used to efficiently analyse graphs. In this paper, we introduce a novel graph kernel called provenance kernel, which is inspired by and tailored for provenance data. We employ provenance kernels to classify provenance graphs from three application domains. Our evaluation shows that they perform well in terms of classification accuracy and yield competitive results when compared against existing graph kernel methods and the provenance network analytics method while more efficient in computing time. Moreover, the provenance types used by provenance kernels are a symbolic representation of a tree pattern which can, in turn, be described using the domain-agnostic vocabulary of provenance. Therefore, provenance types thus allow for the creation of explanations of predictive models built on them.},

While existing studies have proposed numerous oversampling methods to alleviate class imbalance by generating extra minority class samples, these methods still have some inherent weaknesses and make the generated samples less informative. This study proposes a novel over-sampling method named the Expandable Borderline Smote (EB-Smote), which can address the weaknesses of existing over-sampling methods and generate more informative synthetic samples. In EB-Smote, not only minority class but also majority class is oversampled, and the synthetic samples are generated in the area between the selected minority and majority samples, which are close to the borderlines of their respective classes. EB-Smote can generate more informative samples by expanding the borderlines of minority and majority classes toward the actual decision boundary. Based on 27 imbalanced datasets and commonly used machine learning models, the experimental results demonstrate that EB-Smote significantly outperforms the other 8 existing oversampling methods. This study can provide theoretical guidance and practical recommendations to solve the crucial class imbalance problem in classification tasks.},

  abstract     = {Semantic join discovery, which aims to find columns in a table repository with high semantic joinabilities to a query column, is crucial for dataset discovery. Existing methods can be divided into two categories: cell-level methods and column-level methods. However, neither of them ensures both effectiveness and efficiency simultaneously. Cell-level methods, which compute the joinability by counting cell matches between columns, enjoy ideal effectiveness but suffer poor efficiency. In contrast, column-level methods, which determine joinability only by computing the similarity of column embeddings, enjoy proper efficiency but suffer poor effectiveness due to the issues occurring in their column embeddings: (i) semantics-joinability-gap, (ii) size limit, and (iii) permutation sensitivity. To address these issues, this paper proposes to compute column embeddings via proxy columns; furthermore, a novel column-level semantic join discovery framework, ${\sf Snoopy}$, is presented, leveraging proxy-column-based embeddings to bridge effectiveness and efficiency. Specifically, the proposed column embeddings are derived from the implicit column-to-proxy-column relationships, which are captured by the lightweight approximate-graph-matching-based column projection. To acquire good proxy columns for guiding the column projection, we introduce a rank-aware contrastive learning paradigm. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that ${\sf Snoopy}$ outperforms SOTA column-level methods by 16% in Recall@25 and 10% in NDCG@25, and achieves superior efficiency-being at least 5 orders of magnitude faster than cell-level solutions, and 3.5× faster than existing column-level methods.},

To this end, a news-driven portfolio strategy offers valuable insights to capture sudden market changes. Nevertheless, it encounters two main challenges: how to reasonably map the relationships between news and stocks and how to effectively utilize the irregular timing of news releases. To tackle the SPO problem in fluctuating markets while addressing these challenges, we propose a novel news-driven sparse portfolio strategy, named SPIN. Specifically, SPIN not only leverages industry-specific group structures existing among stocks for a more reasonable news-stock mapping and models news sequential patterns based on our devised novel news-driven forecaster to handle the irregularity of news releases. We rigorously prove that SPIN achieves a sub-linear regret.

  abstract     = {Federated Class Incremental Learning (FCIL) has emerged as a new paradigm due to its applicability in real-world scenarios. In FCIL, clients continuously generate new data with unseen class labels and do not share local data due to privacy restrictions, and each client&#39;s class distribution evolves dynamically and independently. However, existing work still faces two significant challenges. Firstly, current methods lack a better balance between maintaining sound anti-forgetting effects over old data (stability) and ensuring good adaptability for new tasks (plasticity). Secondly, some FCIL methods overlook that the incremental data will also have a non-identical label distribution, leading to poor performance. This paper proposes CGoFed, which includes relax-constrained gradient update and cross-task gradient regularization modules. The relax-constrained gradient update prevents forgetting the knowledge about old data while quickly adapting to the new data by constraining the gradient update direction to a gradient space that minimizes interference with historical tasks. The cross-task gradient regularization also finds applicable historical models from other clients and trains a personalized global model to address the non-identical label distribution problem. The results demonstrate that the CGoFed performs well in alleviating catastrophic forgetting and improves model performance by 8%-23% compared with the SOTA comparison method.},

Eight distinct selection methods have been identified and subsequently analyzed and discussed on the basis of the relevant literature. In addition, the selection methods have been classified according to three dichotomies established by the survey. A comparative analysis of these methods was conducted along with a discussion of potentials, challenges, and future research directions for the research area. Data selection was found to be widely used in many engineering applications and has the potential to play an important role in making more sustainable Big Data applications, especially those in which transmission of data across large distances is required.

Traditional augmentation techniques, such as item randomization, may disrupt the inherent temporal dynamics. Although recent advancements in reverse chronological pseudo-item generation have shown promise, they can introduce temporal discrepancies when assessed in a natural chronological context. In response, we introduce a sophisticated approach, Bidirectional temporal data Augmentation with pre-training (BARec). Our approach leverages bidirectional temporal augmentation and knowledge-enhanced fine-tuning to synthesize authentic pseudo-prior items that retain user preferences and capture deeper item semantic correlations, thus boosting the model&#39;s expressive power. Our comprehensive experimental analysis on five benchmark datasets confirms the superiority of BARec across both short and elongated sequence contexts. Moreover, theoretical examination and case study offer further insight into the model&#39;s logical processes and interpretability.

Existing methods address trajectory data sparsity by integrating rich auxiliary information or using spatial-temporal knowledge graphs (STKGs), showing promising results. Yet, they face two main challenges: i) Due to the difficulty of transforming structured trajectory data into trajectory text describing users&#39; spatial-temporal mobility, the powerful reasoning ability of pre-trained language models is rarely explored to enhance recommendation performance. ii) Methods based on STKG can introduce external knowledge inconsistent with user preferences, leading to the knowledge noise generated hampering the accuracy of recommendations. To this end, we propose a novel approach called STKG-PLM that integrates STKG contrastive learning and prompt pre-trained language model (PLM) to enhance the next POI recommendation. Specifically, we design a spatial-temporal trajectory prompt template that transforms structured trajectories into text corpus based on STKG, serving as the input of PLM to understand the movement pattern of users from coarse-grained and fine-grained perspectives. Additionally, we propose an STKG contrastive learning framework to mitigate the introduced knowledge noise.

Providing confidence for predictions is important for real-world application of multi-label models, which provides the practitioner with a sense of the correctness of the prediction. It has been thought that the probability of the chosen labelset is a good measure of the confidence of the prediction, but multi-label accuracy can be measured in many ways and so confidence should align with the expected accuracy of the evaluation method. In this article, we investigate the effectiveness of seven candidate functions for estimating multi-label expected accuracy conditioned on the labelset distribution and the evaluation method. We found most correlate to expected accuracy and have varying levels of robustness. Further, we found that the candidate functions provide high expected accuracy estimates for Hamming similarity, but a combination of the candidates provided an accurate estimate of expected accuracy for Jaccard index and Exact match.},

  abstract     = {Approximate membership query data structures (i.e., filters) have ubiquitous applications in database and data mining. Cuckoo filters are emerging as the alternative to Bloom filters because they support deletions and usually have higher operation throughput and space efficiency. However, their designs are confined to a single-threaded execution paradigm and consequently cannot fully exploit the parallel processing capabilities of modern hardware. This paper presents PipeFilter, a faster and more space-efficient filter that harnesses pipeline parallelism for superior performance. PipeFilter re-architects the Cuckoo filter by partitioning its data structure into several sub-filters, each providing a candidate position for every item. This allows the filter operations, including insertion, lookup, and deletion, to be naturally distributed across several pipeline stages, each overseeing one of the sub-filters, which can further be implemented through multi-threaded execution or pipeline stages of programmable hardware to achieve significantly higher throughput. Meanwhile, PipeFilter excels for single-threaded execution thanks to a combination of unique design features, including block design, path prophet, round robin, and SIMD optimization, such that it achieves superior performance than the SOTAs even when running with a single core. PipeFilter also has a competitive advantage in space utilization because it permits each item to explore more candidate positions. We implement and optimize PipeFilter on four platforms (single-core CPU, multi-core CPU, FPGA, and P4 ASIC). Experimental results demonstrate that PipeFilter surpasses all baseline methods on four platforms. When running with a single core, it showcases a notable 15%$\sim$57% improvement in operation throughput and a high load factor exceeding 99%. When parallel processing on other platforms, PipeFilter achieves 7$\times \sim 800\times$ higher throughput than single-threaded execution.},

However, the inherent complexity of 3D spatial data, primarily represented by 3D geometries in real-world applications, hinders the efficient evaluation of spatial relationships through resource-intensive geometric computations. Geometric simplification algorithms have been developed to reduce the complexity of 3D representations, albeit at the cost of querying accuracy. Previous work has aimed to address precision loss by leveraging the spatial relationship between the simplified and original 3D object representations. However, this approach relied on specialized geometric simplification algorithms tailored to regions with specific criteria. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to achieve highly efficient and accurate 3D spatial queries, incorporating geometric computation and simplification. We present a generalized progressive refinement methodology applicable to general geometric simplification algorithms, involving accurate querying of 3D geometry data using low-resolution representations and simplification extents quantified using Hausdorff distances at the facet level. Additionally, we propose techniques for calculating and storing Hausdorff distances efficiently. Extensive experimental evaluations validate the effectiveness of the proposed method which outperforms state-of-the-art systems by a factor of 4 while minimizing computational and storage overhead.},

In this paper, we study the problem of counting and utilizing induced 6-cycles in large bipartite networks. We first consider two adaptations inspired by previous works for cycle counting in bipartite networks. Then, we introduce a new approach for node triplets which offer a systematic way to count the induced 6-cycles, used in BATCHTRIPLETJOIN. Our experimental evaluation shows that BATCHTRIPLETJOIN is significantly faster than the other algorithms while being scalable to large graph sizes and number of cores. On a network with $ 112M$ edges, BATCHTRIPLETJOIN is able to finish the computation in 78 mins by using 52 threads. In addition, we provide a new way to identify anomalous node triplets by comparing and contrasting the butterfly and induced 6-cycle counts of the nodes.

  abstract     = {Traditional machine-learning approaches face limitations when confronted with insufficient data. Transfer learning addresses this by leveraging knowledge from closely related domains. The key in transfer learning is to find a transferable feature representation to enhance cross-domain classification models. However, in some scenarios, some features correlated with samples in the source domain may not be relevant to those in the target. Causal inference enables us to uncover the underlying patterns and mechanisms within the data, mitigating the impact of confounding factors. Nevertheless, most existing causal inference algorithms have limitations when applied to high-dimensional datasets with nonlinear causal relationships. In this work, a new causal representation method based on a Graph autoencoder embedded AutoEncoder, named GeAE, is introduced to learn invariant representations across domains. The proposed approach employs a causal structure learning module, similar to a graph autoencoder, to account for nonlinear causal relationships present in the data. Moreover, the cross-entropy loss as well as the causal structure learning loss and the reconstruction loss are incorporated in the objective function designed in a united autoencoder. This method allows for the handling of high-dimensional data and can provide effective representations for cross-domain classification tasks. Experimental results on generated and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GeAE compared with the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {In-context learning (ICL) empowers large pre-trained language models (PLMs) to predict outcomes for unseen inputs without parameter updates. However, the efficacy of ICL heavily relies on the choice of demonstration examples. Randomly selecting from the training set frequently leads to inconsistent performance. Addressing this challenge, this study takes a novel approach by focusing on training data valuation through causal inference. Specifically, we introduce the concept of average marginal effect (AME) to quantify the contribution of individual training samples to ICL performance, encompassing both its generalization and robustness. Drawing inspiration from multiple treatment effects and randomized experiments, we initially sample diverse training subsets to construct prompts and evaluate the ICL performance based on these prompts. Subsequently, we employ Elastic Net regression to collectively estimate the AME values for all training data, considering subset compositions and inference performance. Ultimately, we prioritize samples with the highest values to prompt the inference of the test data. Across various tasks and with seven PLMs ranging in size from 0.8B to 33B, our approach consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. Particularly, it outperforms Vanilla ICL and the best-performing baseline by an average of 14.1% and 5.2%, respectively. Moreover, prioritizing the most valuable samples for prompting leads to a significant enhancement in performance stability and robustness across various learning scenarios. Impressively, the valuable samples exhibit transferability across diverse PLMs and generalize well to out-of-distribution tasks.},

  abstract     = {A multi-modal knowledge graph (MKG) includes triplets that consist of entities and relations and multi-modal auxiliary data. In recent years, multi-hop multi-modal knowledge graph reasoning (MMKGR) based on reinforcement learning (RL) has received extensive attention because it addresses the intrinsic incompleteness of MKG in an interpretable manner. However, its performance is limited by empirically designed rewards and sparse relations. In addition, this method has been designed for the transductive setting where test entities have been seen during training, and it works poorly in the inductive setting where test entities do not appear in the training set. To overcome these issues, we propose TMR (Topology-aware Multi-hop Reasoning), which can conduct MKG reasoning under inductive and transductive settings. Specifically, TMR mainly consists of two components. (1) The topology-aware inductive representation captures information from the directed relations of unseen entities, and aggregates query-related topology features in an attentive manner to generate the fine-grained entity-independent features. (2) After completing multi-modal feature fusion, the relation-augmented adaptive RL conducts multi-hop reasoning by eliminating manual rewards and dynamically adding actions. Finally, we construct new MKG datasets with different scales for inductive reasoning evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that TMP outperforms state-of-the-art MKGR methods under both inductive and transductive settings.},

  abstract     = {The objective of question generation from knowledge graphs (KGQG) is to create coherent and answerable questions from a given subgraph and a specified answer entity. KGQG has garnered significant attention due to its pivotal role in enhancing online education. Encoder-decoder architectures have advanced traditional KGQG approaches. However, these approaches encounter challenges in achieving question diversity and grammatical accuracy. They often suffer from a disconnect between the phrasing of the question and the type of the answer entity, a phenomenon known as semantic drift. To address these challenges, we introduce LEMON, a knowledge-enhanced, type-constrained, and grammar-guided model for KGQG. LEMON enhances the input by integrating entity-related knowledge using heuristic rules, which fosters diversity in question generation. It employs a hierarchical global relation embedding with translation loss to align questions with entity types. Additionally, it utilizes a graph-based module to aggregate type information from neighboring nodes. The LEMON model incorporates a type-constrained decoder to generate diverse expressions, and improves grammatical accuracy through a syntactic and semantic reward function via reinforcement learning. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate LEMON&#39;s strong competitiveness. The study also examines the impact of question generation quality on question-answering systems, providing guidance for future research endeavors in this domain.},

In particular, the firefighting Incident Commanders (ICs) are playing a pivotal role, providing directions to field operators and making critical decisions in emergency situations. Over time, traditional training tools in this field have evolved, reaching their pinnacle with Augmented Sand Tables (ASTs). ASTs build on Spatial Augmented Reality (SAR), a form of eXtended Reality (XR) that utilizes projections. Although ASTs enable large-scale visualization of the morphological features of the terrain, by relying solely on SAR it is not possible to fully leverage the potential of XR, which is increasingly recognized as a powerful tool for training. This work introduces a novel approach to training ICs by integrating ASTs with XR, incorporating a learning-by-doing methodology alongside an objective measurement of trainees&#39; performance. To this end, an XR Training System (XRTS) has been developed, combining the capabilities of an AST with personal Mixed Reality (MR) devices and integrating a physically accurate, interactive fire simulator. This system was deployed within a forest firefighting IC training course. All the system components were designed based on the theoretical foundations of decision-making to effectively develop the necessary skills. The proposed approach was compared with traditional AST-based training methods for these roles, focusing on the analysis of learning outcomes, user experience, usability, and cognitive load. The study demonstrated several advantages associated with the use of the XRTS, including improvements in training effectiveness and a notable reduction in overall cognitive load.},

Maintainability is a crucial code quality attribute that determines the ease of analyzing, modifying, reusing, and testing a software component. This quality attribute significantly affects the software&#39;s lifetime cost, contributing to developer productivity and other quality attributes. Consequently, academia and industry emphasize the need to train software engineers to build maintainable software code. Unfortunately, code maintainability is an ill-defined domain and is challenging to teach and learn. This problem is aggravated by a rising number of software engineering students and a lack of capable instructors. Existing instructors rely on scalable one-sizefits-all teaching methods that are ineffective. Advances in elearning technologies can alleviate these issues. Our primary contribution is the design of a novel assessment item type, the maintainability challenge. It integrates into the standard intelligent tutoring system (ITS) architecture to develop skills for analyzing and refactoring high-level code maintainability issues. Our secondary contributions include the code maintainability knowledge component model and an implementation of an ITS that supports the maintainability challenge for the C# programming language. We designed, developed, and evaluated the ITS over two years of working with undergraduate students using a mixed-method approach anchored in design science. The empirical evaluations culminated with a field study with 59 undergraduate students. We report on the evaluation results that showcase the utility of our contributions.

It has emerged as a promising sensing technology. However, when employing DFWS indoors, specular reflection interference arises due to the specular reflectors. This interference often induces ghost targets, impacting the accurate estimation of the number and position of targets, resulting in degradation in sensing performance. To tackle this issue, we delve into the generation mechanism of specular reflection interference and analyze its multi-domain characteristics. Through exploration, we discern its temporal sparsity, spatial symmetry or collinearity, and frequency correlation characteristics, and propose four metrics to measure them, accordingly. Specifically, we propose a temporal characteristic quantitative evaluation metric based on identity matching, spatial symmetry and collinearity quantitative evaluation metrics based on geometric analysis, and a frequency correlation quantitative evaluation metric based on Doppler velocity correction, respectively. Based on these metrics, we design a novel Specular Reflection Interference Mitigation (SRIM) method and develop a robust SRIM-DFWS prototype system based on a 60 GHz mmWave radar to validate our proposed method.

Nevertheless, traffic across BSs exhibit inherently heterogeneous trend burst and smooth fluctuation properties, but existing FL methods model single-scale series from only one view, which cannot simultaneously capture diverse trend and fluctuation properties, especially distinct burst distributions. In this paper, we propose Personalized Federated Forecasting with Multi-property Self-fusion (P2FMS), which can represent multi-scale traffic properties from different views. With precise multi-property representations, a fusion-level prediction decision is learned for each client in a personalized manner to promptly sense traffic bursts and improve forecasting performance in non-IID settings. Specifically, P2FMS decomposes the traffic series into distinct time scales, based on which, we effectively extract closeness, period, and trend properties from different views. The closeness and period are embedded through global-view representations with spatial correlations, while non-stationary trends are individually fitted from the client-side view. Furthermore, a personalized combiner is designed to accurately quantify the proportion of general fluctuation raws (i.e., closeness and period) and specific trend property in predictions, which enables multi-property self-fusion for each client to accommodate heterogeneous traffic patterns and enhance prediction accuracy. Besides, an alternant training mechanism is introduced to optimize property representation and fusion modules with the convergence guarantee. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that P2FMS outperforms status quo methods in both prediction performance and convergence time.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces an analog multi-channel millimeter-wave transceiver architecture that offers advantages in terms of low hardware complexity and computational efficiency compared to digital beamforming and hybrid beamforming techniques. Also, it is known that analog beamforming with a single phase-shifter network faces limitations in maintaining consistent accuracy across a wideband spectrum. To this end, the proposed architecture leverages the inherent bandwidth-splitting property of the multi-channel transceiver. Thus, each sub-band signal is processed by its corresponding channel in the transceiver with an independent analog beamformer per channel. This approach can significantly improve the beamforming accuracy in a wideband communication system such as 5G and future 6G cellular networks. The simulation results demonstrate that increasing the channels in the multi-channel transceiver enables multi-channel analog beamforming to achieve a comparable bit-error-rate (BER) performance to digital beamforming when interference is not considered. Moreover, when interference is present, the proposed multi-channel analog beamforming exhibits enhanced resilience to high power interference compared with digital beamforming with limited analog-to-digital conversion resolution.},

  abstract     = {As a ubiquitous deployment paradigm, integrating microservice architecture (MSA) into edge networks promises to enhance the flexibility and scalability of services. However, it also presents significant challenges stemming from dispersed node locations and intricate network topologies. In this paper, we have proposed a topology-aware MSA characterized by a three-tier network traffic model encompassing the service, microservices, and edge node layers. This model meticulously characterizes the complex dependencies between edge network topologies and microservices, mapping microservice deployment onto link traffic to accurately estimate communication delay. Building upon this model, we have formulated a weighted sum communication delay optimization problem considering different types of services. Then, a novel topology-aware and individual-adaptive microservices deployment (TAIA-MD) scheme is proposed to solve the problem efficiently, which accurately senses the network topology and incorporates an individual-adaptive mechanism in a genetic algorithm to accelerate the convergence and avoid local optima. Extensive simulations show that, compared to the existing deployment schemes, TAIA-MD improves the communication delay performance by approximately 30% to 60% and effectively enhances the overall network performance. Furthermore, we implement the TAIA-MD scheme on a practical microservice physical platform. The experimental results demonstrate that TAIA-MD achieves superior robustness in withstanding link failures and network fluctuations.},

Deep reinforcement learning is a promising technology that has been applied to optimize EVs&#39; charging recommendations. However, existing schemes have low scalability and high communication costs as they usually require collecting real-time information on both charging requests and charger availability at various stations during policy training or execution. To address this challenge, we develop a real-time distributed charging station recommendation approach, named ReDirect, to minimize the charging duration experienced by EVs, considering dynamic charging requests of EVs and fluctuating availability at charging stations. ReDirect employs federated meta-reinforcement learning (RL) to empower distributed stations to collaboratively learn effective recommendation strategies and make decisions without sharing their local information, yielding improved scalability, reduced communication overhead, and enhanced data privacy. Furthermore, we conduct a rigorous theoretical analysis of the convergence performance of ReDirect. Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that ReDirect performs closely to the centralized recommendation algorithm and outperforms several state-of-the-art distributed algorithms in EV charging duration while realizing a balanced distribution of charging requests across multiple stations.},

However, due to the system and data heterogeneity of mobile clients (MCs), client selection and bandwidth allocation is key for achieving cost-efficient FL in MEC networks with limited bandwidth. To address these challenges, we investigate the issue of joint client selection and bandwidth allocation for reducing the cost (i.e., latency and energy consumption) of FL training. We formulate the problem and decompose it into a holistic subproblem to reduce the number of rounds and a partial subproblem to reduce the costs of FL each round. We propose a joint class-balanced client selection and bandwidth allocation (CBCSBA) framework to address the whole problem. Specifically, for the holistic subproblem, CBCSBA combines MCs into groups, each having data distribution as close as possible to class-balanced distribution; For the partial subproblem, CBCSBA reduces costs by exploratively selecting a group and sequentially optimizing the latency and energy consumption of MCs within the group. Experimental results show that CBCSBA outperforms the baseline frameworks in reducing latency by 28.2% and energy consumption by 25.3% on average in the considered four datasets.

In the lower layer, by invoking Lyapunov optimization, we devise an algorithm for partitioning and offloading the computation tasks of deep neural networks. This algorithm also specifies the flow control for admitting the application traffic into the network. In the upper layer, we use the flow control as a form of guidance in the action space in order to develop a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that selectively drops video frames with object detection performance in consideration. By the nature of design, this Lyapunov-guided RL guarantees the network stability. We show through simulations that our Lyapunov-guided RL drops video frames with reasonable object detection performance and reduced latency while keeping the network stable. We also implemented our algorithm on the remote-controlled (RC) car equipped with microprocessor and GPU, and demonstrate the applicability of our algorithm to real-time object detection tasks from the video stream generated as the RC car moves.},

  abstract     = {In transportation 5.0, digital twin (DT) is considered a promising paradigm to integrate physical entities into cyber physical systems by collecting massive data. However, the open collection process and key exposure issues bring critical security challenges. Furthermore, applying the existing authentication schemes to data collection in transportation DT (TDT) systems encounters three deficiencies: 1) forward security for collected data can only be achieved at a coarse-grained level; 2) one or more additional trusted authorities are introduced, causing the robustness of TDT systems to be downgraded; 3) dynamic attribute updating and revocability of physical entities are rarely considered. Therefore, we propose a dual fine-grained authentication scheme (DFAS) in this paper. Our DFAS can not only ensure data integrity and authenticity but also enable fine-grained access control, namely, only registered physical entities with authorized attributes can generate valid signatures. Meanwhile, DFAS provides the key puncturing for physical entities to guarantee fine-grained forward security without relying on any trusted authority. In addition, a non-interactive attribute updating and revocation of malicious entities are realized in DFAS. Finally, the security analysis indicates that DFAS can deal with various security challenges for data collection in TDT systems. The performance evaluation demonstrates that DFAS is efficient and practical.},

In this paper, we address the problem of robust task offloading and resource allocation under imperfect computing capacity information, where the exact value as well as distribution knowledge of the required computing capacity cannot be obtained in advance. Specifically, we formulate the energy-time cost (ETC) minimization problem using min-max robust optimization. To tackle this challenging issue, we propose a decoupling method. This method first assumes the offloading policy is predetermined and derives two independent subproblems: local ETC and edge ETC. Then, we provide a closed-form optimal solution for the local ETC problem. The edge ETC problem is equivalently transformed into a geometric programming (GP) problem, and we introduce an effective iterative algorithm to obtain a stationary point, utilizing successive convex approximation (SCA). Finally, we design a coordinate descent (CD)-based algorithm to optimize the offloading policy effectively. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed policy significantly outperforms other benchmark methods, achieving near-optimal performance even in the presence of high estimation errors in computing capacity.},

The high energy consumption of DCNs remains a persistent and significant challenge. Thus, the energy saving is crucial and imperative for DCNs. Current energy-efficient solutions primarily rely on flow consolidation and dynamic device sleeping techniques to reduce energy consumption. However, these approaches often yield long Flow Completion Time (FCT), potentially resulting in violations of service-level agreements, particularly for delay-sensitive applications. In this paper, we formulate the problem of minimizing the power consumption in SDDCNs as key objective while ensuring timely FCT for delay-sensitive applications. To solve this problem, we first introduce the Active Network Generation (ANG) approach, which generates a minimal active subnet with the least number of active devices while meeting the current traffic demand. Subsequently, we propose two algorithms based on the type of applications: the Delay-Tolerant Flow Route (DTFR) algorithm for delay-tolerant applications and the Delay-Sensitive Flow Route (DSFR) algorithm for delay-sensitive applications. Simulation results demonstrate that our propose solution achieves an energy-saving rate of up to 67.77% and significantly reduces FCT compared to benchmark solutions.},

  abstract     = {Multi-access edge computing has become an effective paradigm to provide offloading services for computation-intensive and delay-sensitive tasks on vehicles. However, high mobility of vehicles usually incurs spatio-temporal load-imbalances among edge servers. Therefore, task migration is employed to maintain dynamic workload balancing by transmitting excessive tasks from overloaded to underloaded servers. Recent studies adopt deep reinforcement learning approaches to generate offloading and migration decisions based on current observations of systems. However, we argue that the migration direction is highly dependent on vehicular movements, and task migration towards the wrong direction could lead to additional delays. Therefore, we emphasize the importance of guiding task migration via exploring prospective trajectories of vehicles. We propose a Mobility-Aware Cooperative Multi-Agent (MCMA) deep reinforcement learning approach to make vehicle-by-vehicle decisions in multi-edge computation offloading scenarios. A two-stage decision framework is designed to solve the joint optimization problem of computation offloading and resource allocation. Additionally, an Informer-based multi-step vehicular trajectory prediction module is incorporated to enhance the capability of forecasting vehicular movements. Extensive experiments and analysis are conducted on synthetic and realistic scenarios, showing that our approach consistently outperforms both heuristic and DRL-based methods.

Aeacus adeptly fortifies DNS with substantial cache consistency by capitalizing on QUIC handshake states to detect cache inconsistency, without compromising query delay.

Our dual-pronged deployment, encompassing both commercial and test 5 G networks, demonstrates Aeacus&#39; prowess. In direct comparison with DNS, Aeacus successfully truncates connection setup delays by a remarkable 8.9% to 71.8%, all while introducing a mere 5.9% overhead attributed to supplementary packet processing and forwarding expenses. Importantly, existing DNS-based systems reap the benefits of Aeacus without necessitating modifications.

  abstract     = {This work focuses on an internet of things (IoT) status update system with the assistance of mobile edge computing (MEC) under short packet communications. The edge server includes a successive interference canceller (SIC) and a buffer pool. To simultaneously improve both information timeliness and throughput, a layer-coded hybrid automatic repeat request (L-HARQ) protocol is proposed especially considering backtrack decoding (BD) delay. In the MEC-assisted L-HARQ IoT status update system, the source successively transmits mixing updates to an access point (AP). The mixing update consists of the new generation and the part of the previously failed one. All the undecoded mixing packets are delivered to the edge server. Once a successful feedforward decoding (FD) occurs, the edge server attempts to recover undecoded mixing packets until a BD failure occurs or all buffers empty. The successful BD results are also delivered to the IR and the obtained prior information is fed back to the edge server for the next BD. By employing the stochastic hybrid system (SHS) model, the average age of informations (AoIs) are derived under circle-shift preemption (CS-P) and fixed preemption (F-P) policies. Considering the fact that the number of buffers is limited and the successful FD and BD do not always cause the reduction of system AoI, this work proposes a non-binary age evolution model as well as the state simplification mothed in SHS. The presented numerical results show that the CS-P and F-P policies obtain the enhanced information freshness compared with the non-preemptive blocking policy, and the CS-P policy outperforms the F-P one in terms of information freshness. The average AoI greatly depends on BD depth. When it is small, the average AoI is small. However, the two policies have the same average throughput that mainly depends on the size of buffer pool and the success probabilities of both FD and BD.},

While various research approaches leverage images, radar, RF signals, pressure sensors, wearables, and other methods, utilizing Wi-Fi signals for gait recognition offers distinct advantages such as a wide sensing range, simple deployment, and passive sensing capabilities. However, traditional gait recognition systems relying on Wi-Fi signals often suffer from performance degradation due to variations in walking directions and environmental conditions. To address this issue, in this paper we propose EIGait, a gait recognition system based on Wi-Fi signal time-frequency spectrograms. EIGait enhances the robustness and generalizability of extracted features through spectrogram augmentation, self-contrastive learning, and domain-adversarial training. Particularly, improvements to ResNet in EIGait yield a Spectrogram ResNet, which is better suited for time-frequency spectrograms. In addition, using merely a single pair of Wi-Fi transmitter and receiver, and by minimal signal denoising, we achieve the state-of-the-art performance. To evaluate the performance of EIGait, we conduct extensive experiments. In a typical indoor environment, EIGait achieves F1 scores ranging from 98.11% to 98.31% for four to eight individuals. In cross-direction gait recognition, we obtain F1 scores of 96.64% to 94.45% for four to eight individuals. Moreover, under the more challenging conditions of cross-room gait recognition, EIGait attains F1 scores of 92.09% to 89.61% for four to eight individuals. Additionally, we conduct experiments on the public dataset 3.0, and the results also demonstrate significant superiority.},

  abstract     = {Indoor mmWave-based sensing technologies have garnered substantial interest from both the industrial and academic. Yet, the intrinsic challenge posed by the limited Field-of-View (FOV) of mmWave radars significantly restricts their coverage. This limitation necessitates careful selection of installation positions and orientations to optimize performance, thereby severely curtailing the versatility and widespread adoption of these systems. Traditionally, expanding coverage involved increasing the number of radar units. This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance the FOV by incorporating mobility, achieved by affixing the radar onto a pan-tilt unit capable of rotating along both the horizontal and azimuthal. Nevertheless, the disparity between the pan-tilt and the radar presents significant challenges for accurately rotating the radar&#39;s orientation. To mitigate this, we propose an automated calibration algorithm for radar and pan-tilt, ensuring precise calibration. Additionally, we have devised a radar orientation adjustment algorithm intended to automatically align the radar&#39;s FOV with the positions of detected objects to facilitate various applications. Through three case studies, we have demonstrated that mmRotation can greatly expand the sensing range, enabling support for multiple applications on a single radar, such as vital signs monitoring and fall detection. Comprehensive experimental results underscore that our system surpasses the current state-of-the-art (SOTA).},

  abstract     = {Space-air-ground integration has become paramount in the next generation of wireless communication systems in the era marked by the seamless integration of terrestrial and celestial domains. On the other hand, the age of information (AoI) has recently emerged as a vital metric for evaluating the timeliness and freshness of data in these multi-hop communication systems. This paper focuses on investigating the information freshness of multi-hop satellite IoT systems while considering several automatic repeat request (ARQ) and hybrid ARQ (HARQ) schemes over different hops to promise the reliability of data transmissions. Specifically, a group of remote sensors transmits their data to a terrestrial base station (B) via the code-division multiple access (CDMA) strategy to exploit CDMA&#39;s natural merits, e.g., anti-jamming and simultaneous transmissions. Then, B sends these received data to a data destination (D) via a satellite (R) under the transparent forwarding strategy. We derive the closed form of the outage probability for the CDMA protocol considering multi-user interference (MUI) and the closed form of the end-to-end outage probability for the three kinds of ARQ and HARQ schemes on the dual-hop B-R-D transmission, and then finally derive the expression of the corresponding AoI. Finally, numerical results show that simulations match well with the theoretical results, proving the analysis&#39;s correctness and the pros and cons of the different ARQ/HARQ schemes.},

In this paper, we consider delay-sensitive, differential accuracy inference services in a Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) network while meeting user stringent delay and accuracy requirements. We formulate two novel profit maximization problems under static and dynamic settings of service request arrivals, with the aim of maximizing the accumulative profit of admitted requests. We assign differential accuracy service requests to the corresponding resolution instances of their requested service models, assuming that each resolution instance can serve up to $L\geq 1$ the same type of service requests. Since the profit maximization problem is NP-hard, we first formulate an Integer Linear Program (ILP) solution if the problem size is small or medium; otherwise, we devise a constant randomized algorithm with high probability. Then, we consider dynamic service request admissions without the knowledge of future request arrivals for a given finite time horizon, for which we develop a simple yet effective prediction mechanism to accurately predict the number of different resolution instances of each model needed, and pre-deploy the predicted number of resolution instances into cloudlets to reduce instantiating delays. We then devise an online algorithm with a provable competitive ratio for the dynamic profit maximization problem by leveraging the primal-dual dynamic updating technique. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms by simulations. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms are promising.},

  abstract     = {Free weight training (FWT) is of utmost importance for physical well-being. The success of FWT depends largely on choosing the suitable workload, as improper selections can lead to suboptimal outcomes or injury. Current workload estimation approaches rely on manual recording and specialized equipment with limited feedback. Therefore, we introduce PPGSpotter, a wearable PPG-based FWT monitoring system in a convenient, low-cost, and fine-grained manner. By characterizing the arterial geometry compressions caused by the deformation of distinct muscle groups, PPGSpotter can infer essential FWT factors such as current workload, repetitions, and exercise type and provide recommendations for workload adjustment. To remove pulse-related interference, we develop an arterial interference elimination approach based on adaptive filtering, effectively extracting the pure motion-derived signal (MDS). Furthermore, we explore 2D representations of MDS within the phase space to extract spatiotemporal information, enabling PPGSpotter to address the challenge of resisting sensor shifts. Finally, we leverage a multi-task CNN-based network and workload adjustment guidance to achieve personalized FWT monitoring. Extensive experiments with 15 participants confirm that PPGSpotter can achieve promising workload estimation (0.59  kg RMSE), repetitions estimation (0.96  reps RMSE), and exercise type recognition (91.57% F1-score) while providing valid workload adjustment recommendations (0.22  kg RMSE).},

As a promising EL framework, federated synergy learning (FSyL) mitigates the computation and communication overhead on resource-constrained devices by offloading partial model layers to the edge server for synergistic training. Nevertheless, due to the system and statistical heterogeneity, naively using existing FSyL methods is significantly time-consuming and causes accuracy degradation. Motivated by this issue, this paper introduces a novel FSyL framework that integrates multi-dimensional training optimization and formulates the edge learning cost minimization (ELCM) problem. To tackle the ELCM efficiently, we design OL-MG, an OnLine Model Splitting and Resource Provisioning Game. Specifically, we first reformulate and decompose the original ELCM based on data quality evaluation. Then, given a model splitting decision, we determine the optimal resource provisioning in Sub-problem1, based on which optimal model splitting in Sub-problem2 is modeled as a potential game. Subsequently, we introduce a decentralized algorithm to find a Nash equilibrium (NE) solution. Furthermore, we further extend OL-MG to support a budget-aware multi-edge scenario. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed mechanism significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cost-saving and accuracy improvement.},

  abstract     = {In the forthcoming era of 6 G networks, delay-sensitive applications for Internet of Things (IoT) are poised to become the prevailing services with ultra-reliable and low-latency (URLLC) requirements. Unlike traditional video caching, IoT-based edge caching faces unique challenges due to diverse data types, update frequencies, and computational needs, requiring integrated storage and computational resource management. To support the more stringent requirements for these innovative applications, mobile edge computing (MEC) is introduced to enhance the service reliability of delay-sensitive applications in the 6 G era. However, task offloading, as an indispensable procedure in MEC, would encounter many challenges, such as network jitter and resource insufficiency, possibly leading to unpredictable queuing delays and other negative issues. To ensure reliable services in a dynamical MEC environment, the caching-enabled MEC network has emerged as a novel architecture, placing computing and storage resources in the edge network. In this paper, we investigate the caching-enabled MEC to support reliable task offloading for delay-sensitive applications, with a focus on IoT scenarios. In our system model, we formulate the task process as a two-hop tandem queuing system with limited capacity, including task transmission and computation queues. The Martingale theory is leveraged to analyze the delay violation probability in this system, demonstrating how the offloading and caching decisions affect the end-to-end (E2E) delay. Besides, task offloading and resource allocation policies are integrated to reduce high system costs, including energy consumption and cache resource rental costs. Based on the delay analysis of martingale theory, we propose an advanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm called Dynamic Request Aware Soft Actor-Critic (DRA-SAC) algorithm to achieve minimal system costs by obtaining the optimal task offloading and resource allocation policies, including caching and computation resources. We conduct some illustrative studies to evaluate the proposed scheme. The algorithm we have put forward outperforms benchmark algorithms regarding both cache hit ratio and system cost.},

Existing solutions commonly rely on prior knowledge and rarely consider efficient resource allocation during the service migration process, making it hard to reach optimal performance in dynamic IoV environments. To address these important challenges, we propose SR-CL, a novel mobility-aware seamless Service migration and Resource allocation framework via Convex-optimization-enabled deep reinforcement Learning in multi-edge IoV systems. First, we decouple the Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem of service migration and resource allocation into two sub-problems. Next, we design a new actor-critic-based asynchronous-update deep reinforcement learning method to handle service migration, where the delayed-update actor makes migration decisions and the one-step-update critic evaluates the decisions to guide the policy update. Notably, we theoretically derive the optimal resource allocation with convex optimization for each MEC server, thereby further improving system performance. Using the real-world datasets of vehicle trajectories and testbed, extensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed SR-CL.

  abstract     = {WiFi-based gait recognition technologies have seen significant advancements in recent years. However, most existing approaches rely on a critical assumption: users must walk continuously and maintain a consistent body posture. This poses a substantial challenge when users engage in non-periodic or discontinuous behaviors (e.g., stopping, starting, or turning mid-walk), which can disrupt the extraction of gait-related features and degrade recognition performance. To address this issue, we propose freeGait, a novel approach designed to mitigate the impact of non-gait behaviors in WiFi-based gait recognition systems. Our solution models this problem as domain adaptation, where we learn domain-independent representations to isolate gait features from behavior-dependent noise. We treat human behaviors with labeled user data as source domains and behaviors without user labels as target domains. However, applying domain adaptation directly is challenging due to the ambiguous classification boundaries in the target domains for WiFi signals. To overcome this, we align the posterior distributions between the source and target domains and constrain the conditional distribution within the target domains to enhance gait classification accuracy. Additionally, we implement a data augmentation module to generate data resembling the labeled data, while supervised learning ensures distinctiveness between users. Our experiments, conducted with 20 participants across 3 different scenarios, demonstrate that freeGait can accurately predict data across 15 domains by labeling only a small subset from 6 source domains, achieving up to a 45% improvement in user classification accuracy compared to existing methods.},

  abstract     = {The Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) has garnered significant interest due to its potential applications in monitoring underwater environments. However, the unique characteristics of acoustic communication, such as long propagation delays and high attenuation, present considerable obstacles for achieving efficient and dependable data transmission. Opportunistic routing is a crucial technique for enhancing packet delivery ratios by selecting a set of forwarding nodes and utilizing their cooperative forwarding to boost network throughput. Nevertheless, choosing an excessive number of forwarding nodes can lead to wasteful energy usage and extended communication delays. Moreover, the overlooked trustworthiness of forwarded nodes in most research works can undermine the effectiveness of opportunistic routing. Therefore, this study presents a novel trust opportunistic routing scheme that employs reinforcement learning to achieve resilience in constantly changing underwater settings. The combination of reinforcement learning and trust management enables the proposed opportunistic routing scheme to adapt to the unstable underwater environment and unknown malicious attacks. Initially, a method is introduced for measuring environmental fitness by considering multiple trust factors, including communication success rate, data reliability, and location dynamics. The proposed scheme then uses reinforcement learning to develop a reliable opportunistic routing method based on quantified state information. This component employs the obtained state to formulate action strategies and obtains reward values from environmental inputs. The reward update equation integrates these qualities to optimize the deployment of superior action strategies, finally achieving trust opportunistic routing for underwater data collection. Fundamental experimental results demonstrate that the proposed protocol performs exceptionally well in demanding underwater conditions, outperforming existing methods in packet transmission rate, energy efficiency, and end-to-end delay.},

  abstract     = {Image-based indoor localization using smartphones has gained wide popularity in daily life. Existing solutions usually utilize visual landmarks and extract fingerprint features for localization, so the fingerprint density directly affects the localization accuracy. However, the collection of dense fingerprints with high resolution is extremely labor-intensive during site surveys and faces heavy computation/storage overhead during matching fingerprint features. Meanwhile, the efficient extraction of features restricts users to shoot with specific poses, otherwise the localization accuracy will be seriously decreased. To tackle these challenges, we propose an Automated Real-time Generative Image Localization System, named ARGILS. Our core idea is to replace the dense sampling with the cross-sparse sampling and generate fingerprint features for missing locations, and finally obtain locations quickly and efficiently through feature orthogonal decomposition. Specifically, cross-sparse sampling refers to fingerprint sampling to achieve full scene coverage and facilitate the generation of missing fingerprint features. We design a distance-constrained generative adversarial network to generate features for missing locations to extend the database, ensuring high localization accuracy with sparse sampling. Additionally, we develop an orthogonal feature extraction method that decomposes image features into horizontal and vertical directions in 2D space. Then two-stage retrieval is used in both directions to obtain the precise location. To address the impact of obstacles, we introduce a scanning localization that improves localization robustness through keyframe filtering and clustering. We have implemented ARGILS and performed extensive real-world evaluations.

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles, In-Vehicle Network attacks have garnered heightened research scrutiny due to vehicles&#39; increasing connectivities to the external environment. The common characteristic among these attacks is to tamper with targeted powertrain-related signals in the Powertrain Controller Area Network (PT-CAN) and further physically threaten vehicles&#39; safety. These powertrain-related signals are encoded within CAN messages grounded by the syntax specification, which is proprietary to Original Equipment Manufacturers and publicly unavailable. Thus, to undertake comprehensive security analysis and strategies, reverse engineering PT-CAN to the semantic level is urgently needed. However, the existing methods rely on interactions (injecting challenge signals/actions) with the targeted vehicle, and certain manual efforts are required. To fill this gap, we propose PicaCAN, a novel framework to extract signals from CAN messages and reverse engineer their physical semantics based on physically induced causality. Once access to the CAN traffic, PicaCANoffers the researcher an eye on the vehicle&#39;s powertrain system, decoding binaries flows into powertrain-related signals automatically. We experimentally evaluate PicaCANon PT-CAN of three automobiles containing two power types. The experimental results show that PicaCANcould successfully extract physical signals representing all targeted semantics (pedals, engine speed, etc.) from two Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles and one Hybrid Electric Vehicle under EV mode.},

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) has been proposed as a solution to meet the requirements of ultra-reliable, secure, and privacy-preserving connectivity in human digital twin (HDT) networks. In such an AIGC-enhanced HDT, contents representing the true statuses of physical twins are generated in the virtual environment for the immediate update and evolution of the corresponding virtual twins (VTs). However, adopting a distributed AIGC in HDT presents several challenges, including the need for personalized VTs, data privacy concerns, and insufficient contextual understanding. This paper introduces a multi-layer federated semantic learning framework to address these challenges, incorporating batch learning to meet the training requirements for semantic-channel encoders and decoders. Furthermore, we introduce a novel user association framework to maximize the overall system performance under shard formation constraints. We then formulate a long-term joint optimization problem for user selection over finite learning periods. A novel Lyapunov-based online optimization strategy was proposed to mitigate the impact of time-varying and unpredictable training conditions. Additionally, we introduce a multi-arm bandit-based method and a context-centric user selection approach to solve the optimization problem. The results demonstrate that the proposed user association framework addresses the limitations of existing approaches, thereby improving the overall performance of the multi-shard AIGC-enhanced HDT.},

  abstract     = {In Video Analytics Pipelines (VAP), Analytics Units (AUs) such as object detection and face recognition operating on remote servers rely heavily on surveillance cameras to capture high-quality video streams to achieve high accuracy. Modern network cameras offer an array of parameters that directly influence video quality. While a few of such parameters, e.g., exposure, focus and white balance, are automatically adjusted by the camera internally, the others are not. We denote such camera parameters as non-automated (NAUTO) parameters. In this work, we first show that in a typical surveillance camera deployment, environmental condition changes can have significant adverse effect on the accuracy of insights from the AUs, but such adverse impact can potentially be mitigated by dynamically adjusting NAUTO camera parameters in response to changes in environmental conditions. Second, since most end-users lack the skill or understanding to appropriately configure these parameters and typically use a fixed parameter setting, we present CAMTUNER, to our knowledge, the first framework that dynamically adapts NAUTO camera parameters to optimize the accuracy of AUs in a VAP in response to adverse changes in environmental conditions. CAMTUNER is based on SARSA reinforcement learning and it incorporates two novel components: a light-weight analytics quality estimator and a virtual camera that drastically speed up offline RL training. Our controlled experiments and real-world VAP deployment show that compared to a VAP using the default camera setting, CAMTUNER enhances VAP accuracy by detecting 15.9% additional persons and 2.6%-4.2% additional cars (without any false positives) in a large enterprise parking lot. CAMTUNER opens up new avenues for elevating video analytics accuracy, transcending mere incremental enhancements achieved through refining deep-learning models.},

  abstract     = {Virtual reality (VR) applications have revolutionized digital interaction by providing immersive experiences. $360^{\circ }$ VR video streaming has experienced significant growth and popularity as a pivotal VR application. However, the combination of limited network bandwidth and the demand for high-quality videos frequently hinders the achievement of a satisfactory quality of experience (QoE). Although prior methods have enhanced QoE, the effects of decoding latency have been poorly studied. It is technically challenging to design a quality adaptation algorithm that can balance the pursuit of high-quality videos and the limitation of limited bandwidth resources. To address this challenge, we propose an edge-end architecture for $360^{\circ }$ VR video streaming and aim to enhance overall QoE by solving a performance optimization problem. Specifically, our experiments on commercial mobile devices in real-world situations reveal that decoding latency significantly influences QoE. First, decoding latency plays a major role in contributing to end-to-end latency, which exceeds the transmission latency. Second, decoding latency can differ considerably between devices with varying computational capabilities. Building on this insight, we propose a novel latency-aware quality adaptation (LAQA) algorithm. LAQA lies in developing a solution that can allocate video quality in real-time and enhance overall QoE. LAQA involves not only the quality of the received content, the transmission latency and the quality variance, but also the decoding latency and the fairness of the user quality. Subsequently, we formulate a combinatorial optimization problem to maximize overall QoE. Through extensive validation with experimental data from real-world situations, LAQA offers a promising approach to enhance QoE and ensure fairness performance in different devices. In particular, LAQA achieves 16.77% and 10.66% enhancement over the state-of-the-art combinatorial optimization and reinforcement learning algorithm, respectively, in terms of QoE at 4K resolution. Furthermore, LAQA ensures excellent scalability by simulating the number of users ranging from 15 to 60, making it a robust solution for diverse and growing user scales. We have open-sourced our implementations on https://github.com/Gemwise/LAQA.},

  abstract     = {The tile-based approach is widely adopted in adaptive 360-degree video streaming systems, due to its efficiency in managing limited bandwidth resources. Recently, significant research efforts have been devoted to viewport-prediction-enabled bitrate adaptation for tile-based 360-degree Adaptive Bit-Rate (ABR) streaming, towards improving the average video quality while reducing rebuffering. However, the inherent uncertainty of users&#39; viewports has posed limitations on users&#39; Quality of Experience (QoE) for tile-based 360-degree ABR streaming. In this paper, we introduce a multi-window and stochastic viewport prediction approach to address the viewport uncertainty. In particular, considering our goal of maximizing the expectation of future QoE, we investigate a viewport distribution prediction model, to cope with the inherent randomness. Additionally, to accommodate the varying gap between the playback and the download process, we explore the multiple-window viewport prediction models to capture different prediction gaps. Even with the utilization of distributional prediction and multi-window models, predicting viewports far into the future is still inherently challenging. Accordingly, we propose a patience pattern temporarily suspending the download process, allowing for the accumulation of additional head movement trajectory data. Finally, we employ a model predictive control (MPC) approach for sequential decision-making, formulating the MPC problem as a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) task. To mitigate the computational burden associated with solving MINLP, we introduce a mixed-integer linear programming transformation to achieve efficient decision-making. Extensive experiments, utilizing real-world traces and user head movement trajectories, demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving overall QoE performance by 16.75% - 18.91%.},

  abstract     = {Task-oriented communications with semantic encoders are promising to enhance the communication efficiency, by selecting and transmitting valuable data according to task requirements/queries. However, existing semantic encoders lack the capability to track the changing in queries, leading to biased data selection. This paper proposes a query-aware semantic encoder, i.e., Query-Data Cross (QDC) encoder for task-oriented communications. By consistently focusing on data features that are most relevant to the current query at the transmitter, QDC can adapt to changing queries. Based on the dynamic semantic relevance obtained by QDC, a relevance-based data selection and bandwidth allocation optimization (RDSBA) problem is formulated, considering a multi-device task-oriented communication system, where devices should transmit valuable data with high relevance to the queries broadcasted by the base station (BS). RDSBA aims to maximize the data profit of all devices, which is defined as the difference between the relevance of data selected for the BS and the cost of obtaining the data. Then, a DRL-based data selection and bandwidth allocation (DRL-DB) algorithm is proposed to solve the NP-hard optimization problem. Simulation results demonstrate that QDC can smartly track the changing in queries and achieve an accuracy of at least 85% in relevance evaluation, more than 8% higher than existing schemes. Based on the relevance provided by QDC, the proposed RDSBA scheme with DRL-DB can increase the data profit by at least 18%, comparing to existing schemes.},

Although the motion prior has shown great potential for frame selection, existing motion-based strategies suffer from limitations in terms of robustness and interpretive evaluation. In this paper, we devise a robust frame sampling strategy called positive motion guided sampler (PMGSampler). It consists of two procedures, local motion capture and global motion statistics. At the local level, we propose two concepts about inter-frame motion amplitude and motion continuity, which helps to perceive the movement of subjects and identify abnormal events that may generate negative pseudo-motion information. Then, through a global analysis of the obtained local motions, the sampler becomes more sensitive to informative frames and robust to outliers. The proposed sampler can be applied to most existing models for improving recognition accuracy. We conduct extensive experiments on four widely-used benchmarks to demonstrate the superiority of our PMGSampler over other methods of the same type. In addition, to analyse how sampled frames influence action recognition, we present a visual interpretation method for video models, termed as spatio-temporal class activation map (STCAM). By introducing spatial and temporal branches, our STCAM is able to visualise the salience of spatio-temporal features. With the help of STCAM, we can further intuitively evaluate the performance of different sampling strategies. Code is available at https://github.com/zyx-cv/PMGSampler.},

The DPLA framework leverages Beam Pattern (BP) deviation, which arises from hardware-specific gain errors, as a key authentication feature. A fusion center is introduced to make the final authentication decision by aggregating local decisions from multiple collaborative nodes, enabling multi-directional perception. Specifically, a low-complexity hybrid combining fusion rule is carefully designed to accommodate the fully connected structure of mmWave MIMO systems, balancing computational efficiency and authentication performance. A rigorous performance analysis is conducted by deriving closed-form analytical expressions for the probabilities of correct detection and false alarm. Furthermore, the asymptotic detection and discrimination performance are systematically analyzed in the large-scale antenna regime. To further enhance authentication accuracy, digital signaling matrices are designed using the deflection coefficient maximization principle. The feasibility of the proposed framework is validated through a comprehensive evaluation, demonstrating its superior robustness and efficiency compared to benchmark methods.},

  abstract     = {The rapid development of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has led to an explosion of industrial data. Due to computing and storage capacity limitations, IIoT devices often outsource the collected data to remote cloud servers. Unfortunately, cloud storage and cloud sharing services are not as reliable as they claim to be. Existing schemes aim to check data integrity in the cloud through cloud auditing. However, they suffer from a number of security and privacy vulnerabilities. The challenge of designing a secure storage auditing framework for industrial IoT comes from two aspects: 1) lack of physical protection of data owner IIoT devices; 2) privacy issues due to auditing of sensitive shared data. Inspired by the aforementioned challenges, we design the secure storage audit framework to support flexible cloud data sharing in IIoT: S2A-P2FS. The first contribution in our work is the Polynomial Prefix Message Authentication Code(P2MAC) design. We design an innovative P2MAC data structure as a label, which can simultaneously achieve efficient data verification in cloud data storage and privacy protection in flexible cloud data sharing for cloud auditing. The second contribution is the design of a unique Physical Unclonable Function(PUF) for IIoT. Harsh industrial conditions hinder the stable operation of PUFs. To protect the trustness of IIoT data owners, we propose a robust PUF-based physical protection mechanism for IIoT devices. The key point is that the required key is not stored in the memory of IIoT but hidden within its physical structure. A security analysis was conducted to demonstrate the robustness of S2A-P2FS against known vulnerabilities. A prototype was implemented in a real-world IIoT scenario. Experimental results indicate that, compared to state-of-the-art schemes, S2A-P2FS achieves over a 3x speedup in computational time and requires only 67.5% of the communication cost.},

  abstract     = {In the era of the Internet of Things (IoT), managing the deluge of data generated by distributed devices presents unique challenges, particularly concerning privacy and the efficient use of computational resources. Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) offers a promising avenue for collaborative machine learning without centralizing data, thereby addressing privacy concerns inherent in traditional approaches. However, as data privacy laws and personal data deletion requests become more prevalent, the necessity for effective machine unlearning strategies within VFL frameworks grows increasingly important. To this end, this paper introduces a novel approach to feature-based machine unlearning tailored specifically for VFL systems in IoT networks. Our methodology enables the selective removal of data influence from trained models without the need for full retraining, thus preserving model utility while ensuring compliance with privacy requirements. By integrating a combination of feature relevance measuring techniques and efficient communication protocols, our solution minimizes the data footprint on network nodes, reduces bandwidth consumption, and maintains the integrity and performance of the learning models. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed framework represents the first practical approach to enable machine unlearning within vertical federated learning environments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through rigorous evaluation using several IoT datasets, highlighting significant improvements in unlearning efficiency and model robustness compared to existing techniques. Our work not only furthers the development of sustainable and compliant machine learning models in IoT but also sets a foundational framework for future research in secure and efficient data management within federated environments.},

Under this prism, we introduce two key pricing families, namely the non-cooperative one which involves competition and is treated through game theoretic approaches, and the cooperative resource pricing (full or partial), which addresses complex scenarios through optimization and coalition. A thorough performance assessment is provided, through modeling and simulation, in order to highlight and quantify the key characteristics and tradeoffs of the various resource pricing approaches introduced.},

  abstract     = {Mobile edge computation (MEC) is envisioned as a prospective approach for processing the computation-intensive and delay-sensitive tasks of smart mobile devices (SMDs) through offloading them to base stations (BSs) nearby. In fact, efficient task offloading mechanisms are crucial to accomplish an MEC system. The key challenge is to make on-spot decisions upon the arrival of each task and at the same time achieve truthfulness of each SMD. The challenge further escalates, when the unique characteristics of an MEC system, such as locality constraint, delay constraint, etc., are explicitly considered. To solve the challenge, we present a truthful online combinatorial auction-based mechanism (TOCA) for task offloading in an MEC system. Specifically, we first devise the candidate offloading scheme determination algorithm, aiming to determine the candidate offloading schemes of an SMD upon the arrival of its task. Next, we devise the winning offloading scheme selection and pricing algorithm based on the online primal-dual optimization framework, to decide the winning scheme among the SMD&#39;s candidate offloading schemes and calculate its payment. By solid theoretical analysis, we verify that TOCA achieves truthfulness, individual rationality and computational efficiency and a smaller competitive ratio. Trace-driven simulation studies validate the effectiveness and efficacy of TOCA.},

Traditional methods, however, struggle with the vast number of tunable parameters and lack scalability in diverse network scenarios. To address these challenges, this paper introduces an optimization-inspired bipartite graph neural network (Bi-GNN) approach for scalable network optimization. Our approach leverages the bipartite structure of network topologies, and incorporates a message-passing mechanism by unfolding the Zeroth-Order Block Coordinate Projected Gradient Descent (ZO-BCPGD) algorithm, which ensures not only high-performance optimization but also manageable computational demand. We demonstrate the permutation and dimensionality equivariance property of the Bi-GNN, which significantly enhances the model&#39;s generalizability across various network structures and sizes. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the expressive power and generalization ability of the Bi-GNN, demonstrating its adeptness at complex network optimization tasks. The training process, parallel execution, and practical implementation techniques are also discussed to ensure the model&#39;s applicability in real-world scenarios. Numerical results verify that the Bi-GNN outperforms existing methods in both coverage ratios and computational cost. Furthermore, our approach exhibits robust scalability across various network scenarios, making it a versatile tool for optimizing a wide range of wireless networks.},

  abstract     = {Recent years have witnessed the proliferation of wireless energy transfer for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), which are mainly used for data gathering in real-world applications. A number of studies have investigated mobile vehicle scheduling to charge sensor nodes via wireless Mobile Chargers (MCs). Unfortunately, most of them cannot parallelly charge all nodes in an intelligent manner with the global network attributes. Furthermore, the time-variable charging ignores the optimal data gathering, resulting in poor Joint Energy Replenishment and Data Gathering (JERDG). To fill this gap, this paper proposes a Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning (FDRL)-based JERDG (FERG) solution for WSNs. To this end, FERG firstly partitions the networks into a set of clusters to distribute the workload evenly among multiple MCs, and then designs an FDRL-based framework that incorporates various time-variant network attributes to determine the optimal schedule for charging and data gathering via multiple MCs and a base station (BS). The BS as the cloud server is responsible for global training of JERDG models, while multiple MCs will parallelly train local models to jointly charge energy-exhausted nodes and gather the data from all nodes in clusters. To reserve more personalized characteristics of each cluster, a density-based partial aggregation strategy is designed to train the global model. Furthermore, a reward-weighted update and selection solution is proposed to generate and exploit reference samples with high rewards. Simulation results obtained from various scenarios demonstrate that FERG significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of network lifetime, energy efficiency and data collection latency.},

In this paper, we investigate the novel problem of oPtimizing unmanned aErial vehicles plAcement by Considering both monitoring utility and adverse Effects (PEACE). We propose an approach to solve PEACE, which is proved to be NP-hard. Overall, our approach achieves a $1- \frac{1}{e}-\varepsilon$ approximation ratio. First, we approximate the original problem of PEACE as a classical problem of Monotone Submodular function Maximization under a Uniform Matroid constraint (MSMUM) with a controlled gap. Then, for MSMUM, we propose a combination of algorithms achieving a $1-\frac{1}{e}$ approximation and $O(n\log n)$ time complexity considering the correlation among the UAV monitoring strategies. The proposed algorithms outperform existing algorithms for MSMUM through theoretical analysis and experimental results. Extensive simulations and field experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving performance gains of 9.0% to 1434.5% compared to existing methods.},

To resolve these challenges, we develop a new model compression method where ENs utilize dynamic, non-identical compression rates to improve the communication efficiency of DFL under time-varying, heterogeneous resource constraints. We show that our method can be formulated as a graphical Markov potential game where ENs act as players deciding on their compression factors and the number of data samples used for model updates. Each EN is incentivized to participate in DFL through rewards based on the EN&#39;s contribution to training. We prove that our game has a dominant pure-strategy Nash equilibrium (NE) maximizing its potential function and propose a dynamic distributed compression algorithm in which each EN can find its dominant strategy independently. We show that this algorithm converges to the Pareto-optimal NE, representing the most efficient solution of our game enhancing the DFL performance with minimal costs.},

Due to the requirements of low latency and ultra reliability, we utilize finite blocklength information theory to characterize the reliability of the communication phase and exploit extreme value theory to investigate the delay violation probability in the computation phase. Following these characterizations, we derive the average end-to-end error probability of the entire service and provide two average endto-end reliability-optimal design frameworks considering fixed frames structure and dynamic frames structure, in both of which the goal is to minimize the average end-to-end error probability by optimally allocating the total time length to each frame, as well as allocating each frame length to the communication phase and the computation phase. For the fixed frames structure, the original problem is decomposed, and the joint convexity of the decomposed sub-problems is rigorously proved, and the optimal solutions are obtained by the proposed optimal time allocation algorithm. Moreover, for the dynamic frames structure, we reformulate the optimization problem by introducing an average time constraint. By exploiting Lagrange multipliers, we transform the reformulated optimization problem into a dual problem with strong duality, the solutions of which can be obtained by the proposed time allocation algorithm. Via simulations, we validate the proven convexity and the approximation in our analytical model and evaluate the performance for both fixed frames length structure and dynamic frames length structure.},

Concurrently, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted wireless communication has drawn significant attention. We observe that the view selection based on the base station and the view synthesis based on depth-image-based rendering (DIBR) can effectively reduce power consumption. Therefore, this paper studies the view selection and synthesis for RIS-aided MVV in multigroup multicast beamforming. To deal with this complicated scenario, we investigate a problem, named the joint View selection, Multicast beamforming, and DIBR (JVMD), to minimize the total multicast beamforming power, the view transmission operation power, and view synthesis, subject to quality-of-service (QoS), RIS phase shifts, view selection, and DIBR constraints. Unfortunately, the mathematical model is a complicated mixed discrete-continuous optimization problem. To tackle this challenging problem, we designed an algorithm, named View selection, Beamforming, RIS phase, and DIBR (VBRD) algorithm. First, we deal with the discrete optimization problem of selecting the view. VBRD uses the dual-based approximation methodology to round back a primal&#39;s integer solution. Then, in the continuous optimization problem, we apply the alternating optimization (AO) method to determine beamforming, RIS phase, and DIBR. Finally, simulation results show the performance of exploiting view synthesis for RIS-assisted wireless communication.},

To solve this problem, Named Data Networking (NDN)-based VANETs are proposed, utilizing in-network caching and named-based forwarding to overcome the dual challenges of mobility and connectivity. Although in-network caching enhances content availability, a strategy that accurately locates and efficiently utilizes the cached content in VANETs with highly dynamic environments is still lacking. In this paper, we propose a novel NDN-based cache-aware adaptive forwarding (CAAF) strategy for VANETs. CAAF proactively predicts content locations and ensures reliable content retrieval by adaptively selecting forwarding nodes that prioritize fast delivery and stable transmission. Specifically, we design a content information table for each vehicle to record information about the Interest packets it receives. Furthermore, these tables are updated periodically across all vehicles and a prediction model is used to predict real-time in-network caching during the update interval. Subsequently, we execute a filter mechanism to sieve candidate forwarding vehicles that satisfy both the accessibility and stability requirements. These candidates are then evaluated using a multi-attribute decision-making method across diverse parameters to determine the optimal forwarding node. Our extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CAAF outperforms the state-of-the-art forwarding strategy regarding content retrieval delay and Interest satisfaction ratio across diverse scenarios.},

In this work, we propose a new MobIlity-Driven feDerated LEarning framework, namely MIDDLE. MIDDLE addresses unbalanced model updates by capitalizing on model aggregation opportunities on mobile devices due to their mobility across edges. It consists of two components: on-device model aggregation, which aggregates models from different edges carried by mobile devices as they move across edges, and in-edge device selection, adjusting the current edge optimization direction through careful device selection. Theoretical analysis emphasizes that on-device model aggregation can reduce bias in model updating on edges and the cloud, thereby accelerating the FL model convergence. Building on this analysis, we introduce on-device global control averaging, modifying the training process on mobile devices and extending MIDDLE into $\text{MIDDLE}^{+}$. Extensive experimental results validate that MIDDLE and $\text{MIDDLE}^{+}$ can reduce the time steps to reach the target accuracy by 19.44% and 20.37% at least, respectively.},

However, the performance of VFL can be hindered when the number of shared or aligned samples is limited, a common issue in mobile environments where user data are diverse and unaligned across multiple devices. Existing approaches use feature generation and pseudo-label estimation for unaligned samples to address this issue, unavoidably introducing noise during the generation process. In this work, we propose Local Enhanced Effective Vertical Federated Learning (LEEF-VFL), which fully utilizes unaligned samples in the local learning before collaboration. Unlike previous methods that overlook private labels owned by each client, we leverage these private labels to learn from all local samples, constructing robust local models to serve as solid foundations for collaborative learning. Additionally, we reveal that the limited number of aligned samples introduces distribution bias from global data distribution. In this case, we propose to minimize the distribution discrepancies between the aligned samples and the global data distribution to enhance collaboration. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LEEF-VFL in addressing the challenges of limited aligned samples, making it suitable for VFL in mobile computing environments.

However, the existing literature overlooks the fact that MEC servers can not only mine for mobile users but also mine for themselves, potentially explaining why MEC mining offloading has not gained broad acceptance within the industry. In this work, we exploit a more practical case and rethink the question of whether MEC servers lease computing power to mobile users by taking into account that MEC servers can mine for themselves. We establish a game model and apply backward induction to analytically characterize Nash equilibria for mining strategies adopted by MEC and mobile users. Our findings suggest that, if MEC can mine for self, MEC would mine for mobile users only under specific conditions where mobile users possess superior information gathering capability (at least better than the MEC server) or the whole blockchain system exhibits significant network value. We further provide a series of simulations to verify our conclusion and illustrate the impact of network parameters on the strategies of both sides.},

As constellation sizes increase, network contention poses a downlink bottleneck. Orbital Edge Computing (OEC) leverages limited onboard compute resources to reduce transfer costs by processing the raw captures at the source. However, current solutions have limited practicability due to reliance on crude filtering methods or over-prioritizing particular downstream tasks. This work presents an OEC-native and task-agnostic feature compression method that preserves prediction performance and partitions high-resolution satellite imagery to maximize throughput. Further, it embeds context and leverages inter-tile dependencies to lower transfer costs with negligible overhead. While the encoding prioritizes features for downstream tasks, we can reliably recover images with competitive scores on quality measures at lower bitrates. We extensively evaluate transfer cost reduction by including the peculiarity of intermittently available network connections in low earth orbit. Lastly, we test the feasibility of our system for standardized nanosatellite form factors. We demonstrate that the proposed approach permits downlinking over 100× the data volume without relying on prior information on the downstream tasks.},

  abstract     = {WiFi-based identity recognition differs from traditional identification technologies as it is not limited by lighting conditions and does not require dense, specialized sensors or wearable devices. This makes it valuable in modern human–machine interactions. However, the diversity of real-world environmental conditions substantially limits the application of existing WiFi-based identity recognition algorithms, particularly when applied across different environments. As a solution, we introduce the incremental wavelet capsule (IWC) model, which combines a newly designed wavelet convolution layer with a capsule network to accelerate precise feature extraction. We adopt a hybrid incremental learning strategy, solving the catastrophic forgetting problem in cross-environment tasks and enabling the model to adapt to new environments in the data stream without forgetting the original environment. Furthermore, we developed a customized data augmentation method for WiFi signals, enhancing the model&#39;s adaptability and stability across various environments. Experimental results show that the IWC model achieves an average recognition accuracy of 97.36% across five different environments and maintains an accuracy of 91.5% even when only 5% of the training data from a new environment is used. These findings demonstrate the model&#39;s robust performance and practicality in cross-environment scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Current research in human activity recognition primarily emphasizes enhancing accuracy, with limited exploration into computational efficiency and hardware compatibility. Recently, Mamba has sparked substantial interest within the realm of deep learning. Mamba is a hardware-aware algorithm enabling very efficient training and inference. Researchers are applying Mamba to various tasks, demonstrating significant promise in both language and vision tasks. It is worthwhile to investigate the use of Mamba for efficient human activity recognition. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid neural network that integrates CNN and visual Mamba, called ActivityMamba. The SE-Mamba block in ActivityMamba utilizes both CNN&#39;s local and Mamba&#39;s global context modeling while keeping computation and memory efficiency. We evaluated the ActivityMamba on five public benchmark datasets collected by using three different sensing techniques. ActivityMamba achieved higher performance than vision transformers, vision Mamba, and CNNs with fewer FLOPs and parameters. It sets a new SOTA on all five datasets, which are 91.78% OA and 89.13% F1 on the USC-HAD dataset, 99.19% OA and 98.64% F1 on the UT-HAR dataset, 99.82% OA and F1 on the DIAT dataset, 98.59% OA and 98.65% F1 on the UCI-HAR dataset, and 95.41% OA and 93.14% F1 on the UniMib dataset.

NG-HetNetIs include industry 5.0 enabled infrastructures like Internet of Things (IoT), cognitive radio (CR) enabled B5G and 6G networks, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs). Digital twin (DT) joins hand with cognitive radio and resource aggregation technologies to provide the integrated framework for intelligent resource allocation in NG-HetNetIs. In NG-HetNetIs, the obtained statistics of measured radio activity as prior information play an instrumental role in enabling optimized resource allocation using context awareness. Unfortunately, the already available static approaches are inefficient to replicate (DT) the radio activity in a heterogeneous radio environment. To address the issue, static implementation framework is extended as dynamic radio activity characterization framework (DRAC) to have context awareness in NG-HetNetIs. The proposed DRAC replicates (DT) the wide sense stationarity of time and carrier aggregated radio activity due to its exploitation of more localized temporal and spectral information in NG-HetNets. The obtained localized statistics using DRAC can be exploited as appropriate prior knowledge and test statistics during the spectrum sensing phase of NG-HetNetIs for intelligent resource allocation instead of a single statistic obtained by the static approach.},

  abstract     = {Mobile Opportunistic Networks (MONs) often experience frequent interruptions in end-to-end connections, which increases the likelihood of message loss during delivery and makes users more susceptible to various cyber attacks. However, most currently proposed anonymous routing protocols are primarily designed for networks with stable connections, making it challenging to protect user identities in MONs. To address these challenges, we propose FLAG-POR (Forward Legal Anonymous Group Pairing-Onion Routing), a novel anonymous routing protocol specifically tailored to enhance message delivery anonymity and security in MONs. Specifically, we abstract the mobile opportunistic network as a contact graph. By introducing the concept of “groups&quot; into the pairing-onion routing protocol, which encrypts messages and relay nodes layer by layer, we develop a novel group-based pairing-onion routing protocol. This protocol ensures message confidentiality and relay node anonymity, while also improving message forwarding rates, as any node within a group can potentially act as a relay. To ensure message authenticity, we employ the efficient SM2 signing algorithm to generate signatures for the message source. Furthermore, by incorporating parameters such as the public key validity period and master key validity period into the group pairing-onion routing protocol, we achieve forward security in message delivery. We conduct a thorough theoretical analysis of the protocol&#39;s security and performance. The experimental results demonstrate that our FLAG-POR protocol outperforms baseline anonymous protocols in terms of delivery success rate, traceability rate, path anonymity, and node anonymity. Additionally, the FLAG-POR scheme effectively resists three potential threats to the routing system: collusion attack threat, node identification threat, and path identification threat, in any situation},

To address this issue, in this paper, we propose an Age-predicting Local Information Dependable Transmission (ALIDT) mechanism for the LSHSN by considering the impact of time-varying topology on the timeliness of data, in which a novel metric of data freshness called Forwarding-aware Age of Information (FAoI) is well-designed to evaluate the timeliness in data forwarding at node. In particular, we develop a satellite Coverage-based Local Information Sharing (CLIS)-assisted Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Network (STGNN) to extract the topological features in both temporal and spatial dimensions and a Graph Matching Network (GMN)-based topology compression algorithm to improve computation efficiency. The simulation results indicate that the proposed mechanism performs better in improving the storage overhead, throughput and average FAoI compared with the conventional Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) routing algorithm with Time-Varying Graph (TVG) model, GNN-based Multipath Routing (GMR) algorithm, and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) based metric prediction algorithm in hybrid satellite networks, respectively.},

Trajectory planning plays a crucial role in RIS-assisted UAV communications to face the challenges of UAV&#39;s limited power capacities and dynamic wireless channels. Existing solutions assume complete channel state information, focus on single-rotor UAVs, and rely heavily on time-consuming training processes for machine learning; thus, they lack applicability to deal with highly dynamic real-world scenarios. To fill these research gaps, we aim to characterize RISassisted UAV communications and design responsive and accurate UAV trajectory planning algorithms in this paper. We first develop a communication model with incomplete information and an energy consumption model for quadrotor UAVs. We then formulate UAV trajectory planning as an optimization problem to minimize UAV&#39;s energy consumption while maintaining communication throughput. To solve this problem, we design an acceleration framework, FedX, for reinforcement learning (RL) solvers and present two fast trajectory planning algorithms, FedSAC and FedPPO, as instantiations of the FedX framework. Our evaluation results indicate that the proposed framework is effective and efficient–more than 3 times faster with 5 agents and 7 times faster with 10 agents than standard RL algorithms, making it suitable for using RL solvers within wireless networks and mobile computing environments. We also discuss and identify the pros and cons of our proposed framework.},

To address these issues, we propose a lightweight contribution evaluation method for federated learning participants, named LCEFL, based on model projection theory, which does not require the server to provide a test dataset. In addition, a model compression method is designed to be used in LCEFL to reduce the computational complexity. Furthermore, a trusted aggregation method based on LCEFL is proposed, where the weight of each participant&#39;s local model is determined by its trust level, which can be calculated using its contribution evaluation result. Experimental results show that LCEFL can achieve nearly the same accuracy as schemes based on Shapley Value, while significantly reducing computational overhead by more than 50%. Compared to available aggregation methods, the proposed trusted aggregation scheme is able to accelerate the convergence speed of the global model and improve its accuracy by 2% to 45%.},

In this paper, we generate similar data for each client through the collaboration of a generic model (GM) on the server, rather than merging model parameters. To train a generator capable of generating data for all classes on the server without real data, we employ the GM as the discriminator in adversarial training with the generator. Additionally, we introduce a similarity assessment metric, which allows for the assessment of the similarity between local data and data from other classes. Nevertheless, the presence of non-IID data among clients can weaken the performance of the GM, consequently impacting the training of the generator and similarity assessment. To address this issue, we design a directive mechanism so that GM can be optimized during adversarial training without the need for additional training.

Meanwhile, visible light communication (VLC) has become increasingly popular with VLC-ready commercial products (e.g., Philips lamps) available on the market. These facts provoke us to ask: can we leverage a VLC-ready lamp to realize integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) by conducting both HGR and VLC simultaneously? To this end, we propose ReflexGest as our answer to this question. ReflexGest is implemented upon a table lamp for the sake of practicality; this VLC-ready lamp is equipped with a ring-shaped light-emitting diode (LED) array and a photodiode (PD, for light intensity sensing) originally aiming for up/down-link VLCs. Demanding hand gestures to be performed between the lamp and a table surface, ReflexGest exploits the variation of the reflection and their unique correlation with the corresponding hand gestures to achieve HGR. In particular, ReflexGest first handles the limited sensing ability of the PD by enhancing the LED lamp and thus diversifying the light emission patterns. Moreover, ReflexGest combats the reflection interference from varying table surfaces via an adversarial learning technique to distill only the features relevant to hand gestures. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that ReflexGest is able to deliver accurate HGR under realistic VLC traffic.},

To resolve this problem, we first design a novel vehicle-assisted VEC network architecture and further propose VaCo, a Vehicle-assisted Collaborative caching system. VaCo allows VEC servers to download the cached service content from any vehicle in the VEC network to support task offloading. VaCo mainly considers the real-time scheduling problem of vehicle storage resources under the dynamic VEC network and the benefit problem caused by invoking vehicle resources under the highly dynamic load environment. VaCo models the vehicle storage resources as an independent resource pool and deploys a cross-VEC server content retrieval mechanism to achieve unified and efficient management of the storage resources of the vehicle cluster and the VEC server cluster. Then, we propose a multi-swarm collaborative optimization scheme to jointly optimize the service failure rate and cost, and further propose a Pareto-based optimization scheme to ensuring that VaCo can correctly evaluate the benefits of invoking vehicle resources in a dynamic VEC network. Finally, we implement VaCo and conduct extensive evaluations on real-world dataset.

Then, the non-convex constrained problem is formulated to maximize the WSR, where the PA, HBF, phase and amplitude of IRS elements are jointly optimized. Given PA and passive BF (PBF), closed-form suboptimal HBF is obtained for each iteration. Also, given HBF and PBF, using the block coordinate descent (BCD) methods, closed-form PA is derived. Moreover, the phase and amplitude of IRS elements are derived for PBF design during each iteration. With the obtained HBF, the digital and analogue BFs are also derived. Based on this, joint schemes of PA, HBF and PBF are developed.

ElastiCast adapts the broadcast mode of the lost devices to the scan modes of the finder devices, considering their diversity. We start with an overview of OFNs, followed by a detailed analysis of the issues and challenges of existing solutions, which motivates the design of ElastiCast. Then we provide Blender, a simulator that models the neighbor discovery behavior of different broadcasters and scanners. By adopting Blender, ElastiCast can be implemented with three components: Local Optima Estimation, Common Interest Extraction, and Interval Multiplexing, in which we capture the key features of BLE neighbor discovery and globally optimize the broadcast mode interacting with diverse scan modes. Experimental evaluation results and commercial product deployment experience demonstrate that ElastiCast is effective in achieving stable and bounded neighbor discovery latency within the power budget.},

In order to train the graph neural network, our method leverages reinforcement learning, specifically employing the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm. This approach allows us to benefit from the advantages of both value-based and policy-based reinforcement learning methods. A simple but flexible reward function is defined to capture the trade-off between the fraction of active access points and network blockage. The graph neural network&#39;s awareness of the network topology gives the proposed method a clear performance advantage over the commonly used greedy heuristic optimization method, reducing blockage by up to more than 50% on real-world network traffic data while also reducing computational complexity from O(N3) to O(N).

  abstract     = {Driven by the increasing demands of vehicular tasks, edge offloading has emerged as a promising paradigm to enhance quality of experience (QoE) in Internet of Vehicles (IoV) networks. This approach enables vehicles to offload computation-intensive tasks to edge servers, resulting in reduced computation delays and lower energy consumption. However, traditional binary offloading limits the efficiency of edge offloading. To address this gap, we propose a partial offloading strategy that jointly optimizes the offloading ratio, computation, and communication resources in IoV. Recognizing the varying priorities of vehicular tasks regarding task delay and energy consumption, we formulate two distinct scenarios: one focused on minimizing delay and the other on minimizing energy consumption. Furthermore, we employ a reinforcement learning approach to establish a multi-dimensional joint optimization function by setting different objectives for each scenario. Based on this framework, we introduce a multi-state iteration deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm (SIDDPG), which effectively determines task partitioning and resource allocation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms benchmark schemes in terms of task delay and energy consumption.},

In this paper, we introduce a nonintrusive facial expression reconstruction system, mm3DFace, which uses a millimeter wave (mmWave) radar to reconstruct facial expressions in a privacy-preserving and passive manner. mm3DFace first captures and pre-processes mmWave signals reflected by a human face, and extracts intricate facial geometric features using a ConvNeXt model integrated with triple loss embedding. Subsequently, mm3DFace derives pose-invariant facial representations utilizing region-divided affine transformation, and further generates individual facial shapes with 68 facial landmarks. Then, dynamic facial expressions with 3D facial avatars are reconstructed to exhibit realistic facial expressions. Finally, mm3DFace enables micro-expression recognition with mmWave signals, which ensures the capability of describing tiny facial changes. Through extensive real-world experiments involving 15 participants, mm3DFace achieves a normalized mean error of 3.94%, a mean absolute error of 2.30mm, and a 3D-mean absolute error of 4.10mm in tracking 68 facial landmarks, which demonstrates the efficacy and practicality of mm3DFace in real-world 3D facial reconstruction scenarios.},

Traditional methods improve network performance through algorithm optimization, but neglect charging security, exposing networks to potential attacks. This paper addresses this problem from an adversarial view and develops a novel attack for MWRSN through Denying of Charge (DoC) to maximize network destructiveness. We start by establishing a generalized on-demand charging model, essential for developing DoC tactics. Subsequently, we unveil the Collaborative DoC (CoDoC) algorithm, capable of manipulating and falsifying charging requests. Central to CoDoC is the Request Prediction Method (RPM), which forecasts the initiation of charging requests and facilitates rapid request surges to enhance the attack&#39;s efficacy. CoDoC is able to disguise the presence of the attack, which is able to escape from being detected by the base station. Theoretical analyses are provided to explore the features of the proposed scheme. To demonstrate the outperformed features of the proposed schemes, extensive simulations and test-bed experiments are conducted. Our analysis and extensive simulations demonstrate that CoDoC increases sensor node failures by 20% to 142% compared to traditional methods, highlighting its effectiveness in marine environments.},

We then propose a three-subproblem alternating iterative delay minimization algorithm to effectively tackle the challenges of offloading and caching. Additionally, we analyze the convergence and complexity of our proposed algorithm. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach.

To this end, we present EdgeMoE, an on-device inference engine for mixture-of-expert (MoE) LLMs – a popular form of sparse LLM that scales its parameter size with almost constant computing complexity. EdgeMoE achieves both memory- and compute-efficiency by partitioning the model into the storage hierarchy: non-expert weights are held in device memory; while expert weights are held on external storage and fetched to memory only when activated. This design is motivated by a key observation that expert weights are bulky but infrequently used due to sparse activation. To further reduce the expert I/O swapping overhead, EdgeMoE incorporates two novel techniques: (1) expert-wise bitwidth adaptation that reduces the expert sizes with tolerable accuracy loss; (2) expert preloading that predicts the activated experts ahead of time and preloads it with the compute-I/O pipeline. On popular MoE LLMs and edge devices, EdgeMoE showcase significant memory savings and speedup over competitive baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/UbiquitousLearning/mllm.},

In our considered model, a base station (BS) continuously collects factory physical object state data from wireless devices to build a real-time virtual DT system for factory event analysis. Due to continuous data transmission, maintaining DT synchronization must use extensive wireless resources. To address this issue, a subset of devices is selected to transmit their sensing data, and resource block (RB) allocation is optimized. This problem is formulated as a constrained Markov process (CMDP) problem that minimizes the long-term mismatch between the physical and virtual systems. To solve this CMDP, we first transform the problem into a dual problem that refines RB constraint impacts on device scheduling strategies. We then propose a continual reinforcement learning (CRL) algorithm to solve the dual problem. The CRL algorithm learns a stable policy across historical experiences for quick adaptation to dynamics in physical states and network capacity. Simulation results show that the CRL can adapt quickly to network capacity changes and reduce normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) between physical and virtual states by up to 55.2%, using the same RB number as traditional methods.},

  abstract     = {Transferring important files, photos, and other sensitive data between laptops and smartphones has become a routine necessity in daily life. Device pairing acts as the most fundamental need to secure the communication channel between two unconnected devices. Traditional pairing methods leveraging PINs or QR codes require tedious human efforts in the pairing procedures to establish a shared communication key. Nevertheless, these designs are vulnerable to shoulder-surfing attacks in which attackers might record and replay the pairing credentials. It is preferred to have more intuitive pairing designs that minimize users&#39; overhead in the pairing process while providing secure keys for communication purposes. In this paper, we propose MIPair for laptop-phone pairing by leveraging magnetic induction (MI) signals. MIPair is based on a key observation that changes in the CPU workload of a device cause variations in internal current, thereby inducing changes in surrounding magnetic fields. Moreover, the trends of MI signal variations are highly correlated with CPU workload trends. Thus, users simply need to place a smartphone on the keyboard of a laptop. By randomly altering the workload of the laptop through a stimulation program, the smartphone can capture MI signals with similar changing trends, thereby converting them into similar bit sequences that form the basis of a symmetric key. We propose essential techniques to overcome challenges such as time asynchronization between two devices, unfixed state transition time in MI signal, and shared key distribution from the two similar bit sequences. Our real-world experiments demonstrate reliable pairing as well as robustness against common attacks and high randomness of the generated keys. When generating a 128-bit key, MIPair achieves a successful pairing rate as high as 98% and a usable pairing time of 8.35 seconds.},

However, due to the non-interpretable nature of mmWave signals, labeling the radar data has always been a difficult task. While there have been investigations on unsupervised pre-training for mmWave radar sensing, these methods are tailored to specific signal representations. In this paper, we propose UMIMO, an unsupervised learning framework combining the hardware nature of MIMO radar and deep learning techniques to resolve the challenge raised by the insufficient labeled data. UMIMO leverages the antenna arrays synthesized from multiple transmitting and receiving antennas in mmWave radar to construct positive samples for contrastive learning. To achieve this, we propose the constraints on angular resolution and grating lobes to generate effective signal representations with different synthetic arrays. We conduct experiments using UMIMO on three tasks: contactless ECG monitoring, 3D human pose estimation, and human silhouette generation. All experimental results demonstrate that UMIMO can effectively improve the performance of learning-based mmWave radar sensing in an unsupervised manner.},

  abstract     = {The scale and quality of point cloud datasets constrain the advancement of point cloud learning. Recently, with the development of multi-modal learning, the incorporation of domain-agnostic prior knowledge from other modalities, such as images and text, to assist in point cloud feature learning has been considered a promising avenue. Existing methods have demonstrated the effectiveness of multi-modal contrastive training and feature distillation on point clouds. However, challenges remain, including the requirement for paired triplet data, redundancy and ambiguity in supervised features, and the disruption of the original priors. In this paper, we propose a language-assisted approach to point cloud feature learning (LAST-PCL), enriching semantic concepts through large language model-based text enrichment. We achieve de-redundancy and feature dimensionality reduction without compromising textual priors by statistical-based and training-free significant feature selection. Furthermore, we also delve into an in-depth analysis of the impact of text contrastive training on the point cloud. Extensive experiments validate that the proposed method learns semantically meaningful point cloud features and achieves state-of-the-art or comparable performance in 3D semantic segmentation, 3D object detection, and 3D scene classification tasks.},

  abstract     = {Underwater image quality assessment (UIQA) is a challenging task due to the complexities of underwater environments. Traditional UIQA methods primarily rely on fitting mean opinion scores (MOS), which are limited by human visual biases. To address the above limitation, we propose a no-reference underwater image quality assessment paradigm using reinforcement sequences. Our paradigm leverages reinforcement learning to iteratively merge the input image with the corresponding ground truth, generating an optimized sequence of images. A classifier generates probability arrays for the optimized sequence, which are converted into objective scores by a regression model. Unlike existing methods that focus solely on the final quality score, our paradigm emphasizes dynamic quality changes throughout the image-enhancement process. By employing objective mixing ratio labels, our reinforcement sequence dataset reduces subjective bias. The multiscale classifier captures local and global information differences between the input and ground truth images, effectively preserving the contrast and detail in diverse lighting conditions. Our paradigm combines multi-source data classification with support vector regression, optimizing the mapping of feature vectors to quality scores through fine-tuning libsvm kernel parameters. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our paradigm outperforms the state-of-the-art UIQA methods, providing an effective solution for Underwater Image quality Assessment via Reinforcement Sequences (RSUIA).

To bridge the gap between video-level and boundary-level annotations, explicit supervision methods (i.e., generating pseudo-temporal boundaries for training) have achieved great success. However, data augmentation in these methods might disrupt critical temporal information, yielding poor pseudo-temporal boundaries. In this paper, we propose a new perspective that maintains the integrity of the original temporal content while introducing more valuable information for expanding the incomplete boundaries. To this end, we propose ETC (Expand then Clarify), first using the additional information to expand the initial incomplete pseudo-temporal boundaries, and subsequently refining these expanded ones to achieve precise boundaries. Motivated by video continuity, i.e., visual similarity across adjacent frames, we use powerful multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to annotate each frame within the initial pseudo-temporal boundaries, yielding more comprehensive descriptions for expanded boundaries. To further clarify the noise in expanded boundaries, we combine mutual learning with a tailored proposal-level contrastive objective to use a learnable approach to harmonize a balance between incomplete yet clean (initial) and comprehensive yet noisy (expanded) boundaries for more precise ones. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method on two challenging WSVG datasets.},

  abstract     = {The Facial Expression Recognition (FER) technique has increasingly matured over time. However, recognizing facial expressions in wild environments poses great challenges in achieving promising performance. The main obstacles arise from various factors, such as illumination changes, head pose variations, and occlusions. To overcome interferences from external environments and improve recognition accuracy, we propose a novel Quaternion Wavelet TRansformer (QWTR) model for FER in the wild. Specifically, we present a Quaternion Value Transformer (QVT) network that combines quaternion multi-head attention with quaternion CNN to capture emotional cues from global and local perception. To preserve the color structure while enhancing image contrast and brightness, we introduce a Quaternion Histogram Equalization (QHE) representation to transform color images into quaternion matrices representation. After that, to alleviate the impact of head pose and occlusion together with feature redundancy, a Quaternion Wavelet Feature Selection (QWFS) scheme is designed to decompose quaternion features and select the most correlated signals. Extensive experiments have been conducted on four in-the-wild FER datasets and several specific FER benchmarks under various conditions. The qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that QWTR outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in FER benchmarks, e.g., 68.37% vs. 66.31% accuracy on the AffectNet dataset.

In light of this, we have reevaluated the utility of panchromatic (PAN) images and introduced a theory anchored in the spectral response of satellite sensors. This posits that a PAN image is effectively a linear weighted summation of individual bands from its corresponding multi-spectral (MS) image, offset by an error map. We developed a deep unmixing network termed “DUN” that integrates an unmixing network, a fusion mechanism, and a distinctive mutual information contrastive loss function. Notably, the unmixing network is adept at decomposing a PAN image into its MS counterpart and error map. Further, the demixed image alongside the low-resolution MS image is channeled into the fusion network for pan-sharpening. Recognizing the challenges of achieving robust supervised learning directly from the unmixing phase, we have innovated a mutual information contrastive learning loss function, ensuring enhanced separation and minimizing overlap during the unmixing process. Preliminary experiments underscore both the quantitative and qualitative prowess of the proposed method.},

To address this limitation, a novel sampling and reconstruction method for video CS (called WRDD) is proposed, which exploits the advantages of wavelet residual sampling and dual-domain fusion optimization.Specifically, in order to capture high-frequency details and achieve efficient and high-quality measurements, we propose a wavelet residual (WR) sampling strategy for the nonkeyframe sampling, which is achieved by the wavelet residuals between nonkeyframes and keyframes. Furthermore, a dual-domain (DD) fusion strategy is proposed, which fully combine intraframe and interframe to improve the reconstruction quality of nonkeyframes both in the pixel domain and multilevel feature domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our WRDD surpasses the state-of-the-art video and image CS methods in both subjective and objective evaluations.

Due to varying depth reliability across scenes, some researchers propose evaluating the overall quality of the depth maps and discarding the less reliable ones to avoid contamination. However, these methods often fail to fully utilize valuable information in depth maps, leading to sub-optimal performance particularly when depth quality is unreliable. Since low-quality depth maps still contain useful information that potentially improves model performance, we propose a Depth Pixel-wise Potential-aware Network to leverage these depth cues effectively. This network includes two novel components designed: 1) A learning strategy for explicitly modeling the confidence of each depth pixel to assist the model in locating valid information in the depth map. 2) A cross-modal adaptive multiple fusion module that fuses features from both RGB and depth modalities. It aims to mitigate the contamination effect of unreliable depth maps and fully exploit the benefits of multiple fusion strategies.

  abstract     = {Weakly supervised LiDAR semantic segmentation has made significant strides with limited labeled data. However, most existing methods focus on the network training under weak supervision, while efficient annotation strategies remain largely unexplored. To tackle this gap, we implement LiDAR semantic segmentation using scatter image annotation, effectively integrating an efficient annotation strategy with network training. Specifically, we propose employing scatter images to annotate LiDAR point clouds, combining a pre-trained optical flow estimation network with a foundational image segmentation model to rapidly propagate manual annotations into dense labels for both images and point clouds. Moreover, we propose ScatterNet, a network that includes three pivotal strategies to reduce the performance gap caused by such annotations. First, it utilizes dense semantic labels as supervision for the image branch, alleviating the modality imbalance between point clouds and images. Second, an intermediate fusion branch is proposed to obtain multimodal texture and structural features. Finally, a perception consistency loss is introduced to determine which information needs to be fused and which needs to be discarded during the fusion process. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and SemanticKITTI datasets demonstrate that our method requires less than 0.02% of the labeled points to achieve over 95% of the performance of fully-supervised methods. Notably, our labeled points are only 5% of those used in the most advanced weakly supervised methods.},

In this work, we propose AdaMesh, a novel adaptive speech-driven facial animation approach, which learns the personalized talking style from a reference video of about 10 seconds and generates vivid facial expressions and head poses. Specifically, we propose mixture-of-low-rank adaptation (MoLoRA) to fine-tune the expression adapter, which efficiently captures the facial expression style. For the personalized pose style, we propose a pose adapter by building a discrete pose prior and retrieving the appropriate style embedding with a semantic-aware pose style matrix without fine-tuning.

Prevalent replay-based methods keep a buffer composed of carefully selected instances towards this goal. However, due to the limited storage space and uniform feature distribution, existing methods are prone to overfit on replayed instances, leading to poor generalization on diverse test data. Additionally, the imbalance in data quantity makes the detector fail to distinguish old and new classes that are visually similar, introducing bias toward new classes. To enhance the diversity of stored instances and eliminate bias, we propose a Local Response Exploration (LRE) framework, which comprises three modules. First, Region-Entropy Instance Selector (REIS) introduces a novel metric to assess instance diversity based on the entropy of local responses. Second, Confusion-Guided Instance Replay (CGIR) replaces the previous random replay approach by replaying specific old class instances based on class similarity, ensuring that parameters for similar new and old classes are updated together, thereby mitigating bias and helping mining discriminative patterns. Third, Confusion-Aware Region Segregation (CARS) adaptively differentiates biased regions from other regions based on local responses, reducing bias toward new classes while preserving relationships between new and old classes.

In our work, we identify that the perception bias mainly stems from an inappropriate subspace where images are projected and compared. For this issue, we propose a Debiased Mapping based quality Measure (DMM), leveraging orthonormal bases formed by singular value decomposition (SVD) in the deep features domain. The SVD effectively decomposes the quality variations into singular values and mapping bases, enabling quality inference with more reliable feature difference measures.

However, unlike hybrid video codecs, existing deep video codecs cannot offer both flexible rates and regulable complexities within one single codec, which limits their applications. In this paper, we propose a Regulable Deep Video Codec (RDVC) to address the above issue. First, we propose an Adaptive Feature Compression (AFC) network that generates variable rates while ensuring Rate-Distortion (RD) performance. The network introduces a two-stage coarse-to-fine rate adjustment that can be controlled by a user-specified rate level. Second, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Feature Propagation (STFP) mechanism to provide high-quality reference information for AFC process. Third, we also utilize slimmable convolutional components in our framework to adjust decoding complexity constrained by user configuration. Experimental results demonstrate that RDVC can adjust the codec structure flexibly according to different user configurations while maintaining advanced performance. On average, it reduces the bit-per-pixel (bpp) by 9.35%$/$58.12% while maintaining the same PSNR/MS-SSIM as the reference software VTM-13.2.

  abstract     = {Unsupervised domain adaptive semantic segmentation aims to transfer knowledge from the annotated source domain to the unlabeled target domain. Recently, self-training methods have gained substantial attention, which leverage high-confidence predictions in the target domain as pseudo labels for supervision. However, limited exploration of intra-class variations across domains, including significant visual differences within each category, has led to misalignment between feature distribution across domains. In this paper, we present a unified non-parametric distance-based online clustering method to efficiently maintain multiple centroid-based prototypes within each category subspace instead of one prototype for each category subspace, which enables prototypes to possess the capacity for richer feature representation. Then, considering the variance across different dimensions of a feature representation, we then extend the prototypes from centroid-based ones to distribution-based ones. Specifically, each subspace is modeled using a Gaussian mixture model which includes several anisotropic Gaussian distributions, aimed at prioritizing discriminative dimensions and obtaining a finer measurement of the pixel-to-prototype similarity. Meanwhile, a category-aware feature space is achieved through pixel-to-prototype contrastive learning to ensure the compactness of pixel features in the same subcategory and drive the separation between pixel features of different subcategories. What&#39;s more, multi-resolution features are utilized to promote diversity and robustness among intra-class prototypes. Experiments validate the competitiveness of our two prototype-based methods against existing state-of-the-art methods, with a mIoU of $76.8\%$ on GTA $\rightarrow$ Cityscapes, $68.4\%$ on Synthia $\rightarrow$ Cityscapes, $54.5\%$ on Cityscapes $\rightarrow$ DarkZurich and $56.4\%$ on Cityscapes $\rightarrow$ ACDC.

  abstract     = {Multimodal sarcasm detection, aiming to uncover sarcastic sentiment behind multimodal data, has gained substantial attention in multimodal communities. Recent advancements in multimodal sarcasm detection (MSD) methods have primarily focused on modality alignment with pre-trained vision-language (V-L) model. However, text-image pairs often exhibit weak or even opposite semantic correlations in MSD tasks. Consequently, directly aligning these modalities can potentially result in feature shift and inter-class confusion, ultimately hindering the model&#39;s ability. To alleviate this issue, we propose the Enhancing Semantic Awareness Model (ESAM) for multimodal sarcasm detection. Specifically, we first devise a Modality-decoupled Framework (MDF) to separate the textual and visual features from the fused multimodal representation. This decoupling enables the parallel integration of the Sentimental Congruity Constraint (SCC) within both visual and textual latent spaces, thereby enhancing the semantic awareness of different modalities. Furthermore, given that certain outlier samples with ambiguous sentiments can mislead the training and weaken the performance of SCC, we further incorporate Automatic Outlier Masking. This mechanism automatically detects and masks the outliers, guiding the model to focus on more informative samples during training. Experimental results on two public MSD datasets validate the robustness and superiority of our proposed ESAM model.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the problem of semi-supervised learning on graphs, which has recently aroused widespread interest in relational data mining. The focal point of exploration in this area has been the utilization of graph neural networks (GNNs), which stand out for excellent performance. Previous methods, however, typically rely on the limited labeled data while ignoring the abundant structural information in unlabeled nodes inherently on graphs, easily resulting in overfitting, especially in scenarios where only a few label nodes are available. Even worse, GNNs, despite their success, are constrained by their ability to solely capture local neighborhood information through message-passing mechanisms, thereby falling short in modeling higher-order dependencies among nodes. To circumvent the above drawbacks, we propose a simple yet effective framework called Hypergraph COnsistency LeArning (HOLA). Specifically, we employ a collaborative distillation framework consisting of a teacher network and a student network. To achieve effective interaction, we propose momentum distillation, a self-training method that enables the student network to learn from pseudo-targets generated by a momentum teacher network. Further, a novel hypergraph structure learning network is developed to model complex high-order relations among nodes with relational consistency learning, thereby transferring the knowledge to the student network. Extensive experiments conducted on a variety of benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the HOLA over various state-of-the-art methods.},

They ignore that proper prompt design for rich and fine-grained action cues can provide robust representation space clustering. In order to alleviate the problem of insufficient information available for skeleton sequences, we design an information compensation learning framework from an information-theoretic perspective to improve zero-shot action recognition accuracy with a multi-granularity semantic interaction mechanism. Inspired by ensemble learning, we propose a multi-level alignment (MLA) approach to compensate information for action classes. MLA aligns multi-granularity embeddings with visual embedding through a multi-head scoring mechanism to distinguish semantically similar action names and visually similar actions. Furthermore, we introduce a new loss function sampling method to obtain a tight and robust representation. Finally, these multi-granularity semantic embeddings are synthesized to form a proper decision surface for classification. Significant action recognition performance is achieved when evaluated on the challenging NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and PKU-MMD benchmarks and validate that multi-granularity semantic features facilitate the differentiation of action clusters with similar visual features.},

These direct methods offer efficiency and an optimal optimization target, presenting significant potential for practical applications. However, due to the complex and implicit mappings between input features and target pose parameters, direct methods are challenging to train and prone to overfitting on mappings seen during training, resulting in limited effectiveness and generalization capability on unseen mappings. Existing methods focus primarily on improvements of the network architecture and training strategies, with less attention given to mappings. In this work, we propose a geometric constraints learning approach, which enables networks to explicitly capture and utilize the geometric mappings between inputs and optimization targets for pose estimation. Specifically, we introduce a residual pose transformation formula that preserves pose transformation constraints within both the 2D image plane and the 3D space while decoupling the absolute pose distribution, thereby addressing the pose distribution gap issue. We further design a Geo6D mechanism based on the formula, which enables the network to explicitly utilize geometric constraints for pose estimation by reconstructing the inputs and outputs. We select two different methods as our baseline and extensive experiments show that Geo6D enhances the performance and reduces the dependence on extensive training data, remaining effective even with only 10% of the typical data volume.

  abstract     = {Multi-view clustering, which identifies shared semantics from different perspectives and classifies data samples into distinct categories using unsupervised methods, is gaining increasing interest. This task primarily focuses on learning consistent multi-view feature representations and clustering labels. Current approaches for achieving consistent multi-view feature representations often use techniques such as cascading, weight fusion, and attention mechanism fusion. These methods reconstruct features based on original low-level features via encoder-decoder, which often contain visual private information, leading to misleading feature representations. Furthermore, in the clustering label learning process, many methods use a two-stage approach: first, they achieve consistent feature representations, and then they apply hard labeling methods like K-means or spectral clustering to obtain clustering labels. Single-stage methods typically derive consistent labels through a linear coding layer based on consistent representation learning. These methods do not fully utilize the multi-view view semantic information, and consistent representation learning may be impaired when some low-quality views are present, leading to the generation of inaccurate semantic labels. To address these issues, we propose a Self-supervised Semantic Soft Label Learning Network for Deep Multi-view Clustering. Specifically, we introduce a consensus high-level feature learning module that uses a shared MLP layer to transform low-level features into a high-level feature space. To enhance the consistency between high-level features from different views, we maximize mutual information between these features and introduce the U-Projection module, which improves the expressive power of the consensus feature via resampling the features and concatenating the fused features before and after sampling operations. Additionally, we propose a self-supervised semantic label learning module that employs a dual-branch approach to independently learn consistent view-specific semantic labels through contrastive learning, while deriving view-consensus semantic labels from shared high-level features extracted from multiple views. Finally, KL divergence is used to align the view-consensus labels with the view-specific labels. A series of extensive experiments have shown that our approach yields superior clustering results compared to existing techniques. Codes will be available at https://github.com/shayeyty/SSLNMVC.},

To perform multi-modal fusion, we propose the Modality Aggregation Decoder, leveraging the Vision-to-Audio Fusion Block to integrate visual features into audio features across both frame and temporal levels. Further, we adopt the Contextual Integration Pyramid to perform audio-to-vision spatial-temporal context collaboration.

However, existing image hazing works generate hazy images from a given clear image with a single transmission map. This violates the fact that hazy images are diverse for a natural scene at different times. The domain shift issue between synthetic and real-world hazy images constrains the robustness of deep dehazing models when dealing with real-world hazy images. In this work, we propose an unsupervised haze generation work to synthesize multiple hazy images with diverse haze distributions from a clear image, which requires only an atmospheric scattering model without extra labeling information. Instead of estimating a transmission map from a clear image, we propose to customize the transmission maps by redefining the transmission function. In such a controllable way, hazy images with diverse haze distributions are generated, which avoids the labor-intensive collection of paired data and alleviates the common domain-shift issue of deep image dehazing. Incorporating the unsupervised hazy images generator, we also construct a generalizable self-supervised image dehazing (SSID) framework, where deep image dehazing models can be trained without any human annotations. Extensive experiments on real-world hazy images show that the proposed approach is superior to state-of-the-art unsupervised dehazing works, and achieves competitive performance with the supervised works. Moreover, the proposed SSID framework can be easily generalized to the existing deep dehazing models, greatly improving dehazing robustness on real-world hazy images.

However, current occlusion removal methods have several issues: (1) inefficient exploitation of spatial and angular complementary information among views; (2) indistinguishable treatment of pixels from foreground occlusion and background and (3) insufficient exploration of spatial detail supplementation. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a mask-aware de-occlusion network (MANet). Specifically, MANet is a joint training network that integrates the occlusion mask predictor (OMP) and the occlusion remover (OR). First, OMP is proposed to provide the location of occluded regions for OR, as the occlusion removal task is ill-posed without occluded region localization. In OR, we introduce gated spatial-angular feature aggregation, which uses a soft gating mechanism to focus on spatial-angular interaction features in non-occluded regions, extracting effective aggregated features specific to the de-occlusion. Then, we design a complementary strategy to fully utilize spatial-angular information among views. Finally, we propose texture-semantic attention to improve the performance of detail generation. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MANet, with substantial improvements in both PSNR and SSIM metrics. Moreover, MANet stands out with an efficient parameter count of 2.4M, making it a promising solution for real-world applications in public safety and security surveillance.},

The objective of this paper is to learn self-supervised facial expression features that enable the FER model not to rely on the annotation consistency of the different datasets. Most current self-supervised learning algorithms based on contrastive learning learn the representation by forcing different augmented views of the same image close in the embedding space, but they cannot cover all variances within a semantic class. We propose a heatmap neighbor contrastive learning (HNCL) method for FER. It treats the images corresponding to the heatmap nearest neighbors of expressions as other positives, providing more semantic variations than pre-defined augmented transformations. Therefore, our HNCL can learn better expression features covering more intraclass variances, improving the performance of the FER model based on self-supervised learning. After fine-tuning, HNCL with a simple framework achieves top-three performance on the inthe-lab datasets and even matches the performance of state-ofthe-art supervised learning methods on the in-the-wild datasets.},

Since multimodal fusion is routinely employed to improve the ability of system in cognition, we assume that haptic codec is guided by visual semantics to optimize parameter settings in the coding process. We first design a multi-dimensional tactile feature fusion network (MTFFN) relying on multi-head attention mechanism. The MTFFN extracts the multi-dimensional features from the material surface and maps them to infer the coding parameters. Secondly, we provide second-order difference and linear interpolation to establish an criterion for the determination of optimal codec parameters, which are customized by the material categories so as to give high robustness. Finally, the simulation results reveal that our compression scheme can efficiently make a personalized codec procedure for different materials, obtaining more than 17% improvement in terms of compression ratio with high perceptual quality at the same time.},

  abstract     = {The purpose of robust image watermarking is to embed a watermark into a carrier image in an invisible form and extract the watermark successfully even under noise interference conditions to achieve copyright confirmation and traceability. Although watermarking methods based on deep learning can improve the robustness by adding a noise simulation layer, few theoretical analyses of the codec structure have been conducted. Theoretical explainability is the theoretical basis for developing a network architecture, which plays a guiding role in network development. On the basis of the interpretability of convolutional networks, this paper analyzes the mathematical process of embedding and extracting watermarks in codecs and proposes a novel watermarking framework based on multi-layer watermark feature fusion. Specifically, the encoder can be a convolutional network structure of arbitrary depth, whereas the decoder needs only to adopt its corresponding deconvolution structure. To improve the quality and robustness of the generated watermarked image, the watermark is associated with an arbitrary layer feature space in the decoder. In the decoder, the network quickly converges to each original encoding feature space through the deconvolution structure, thus decoupling the watermark features. Finally, the watermark is extracted via the automatic fusion of multi-layer watermark features. The experimental results show that the proposed method is suitable for few-shot learning, and its invisibility, robustness and generalization performance on multiple datasets are significantly better than those of other advanced methods.},

  abstract     = {Current cross-modal food retrieval approaches focus mainly on the global visual appearance of food without explicitly considering multi-grained information. Additionally, direct calculation of the global similarity of image-recipe pairs is not particularly effective in terms of latent alignment, which suffers from mismatch during the mutual image-recipe retrieval process. This paper proposes a threefold encoder interaction (TEI) cross-modal food retrieval framework to maintain the multi-granularity of food images and the multi-levels of textual recipes to address the aforementioned challenges. The TEI framework comprises an image encoder, a recipe encoder, and a multi-grained interaction encoder. We simultaneously propose a multi-grained relation-aware attention (MRA) embedded in the multi-grained interaction encoder to capture multi-grained food visual features. The multi-grained interaction similarity scores are calculated to better establish the multi-grained correlation between recipe and image entities based on the extracted hierarchical textual and multi-grained visual features. Finally, a hierarchical multi-grained semantic alignment loss is designed to supervise the whole process of cross-modal training using the multi-grained interaction similarity scores. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on the Recipe1M dataset have demonstrated that the proposed TEI framework achieves multi-grained semantic alignment between image and text modalities and is superior to other state-of-the-art methods in cross-modal food retrieval tasks.},

Due to the lack of large-scale paired underwater color-depth datasets for effective training, existing style transfer-based and self-supervision-based approaches can improve the performance of depth estimation to some extent, but they remain unsatisfactory. Leveraging the power of massive training datasets, foundation models designed for terrestrial monocular depth estimation have demonstrated superior performance across various scenes. These models provide rich prior knowledge of 3D perception, which can be valuable for underwater depth estimation. Upon this, we introduce tunable adapters (UW-Adapter) that tailor a pre-trained foundation model specifically for underwater depth estimation, customizing it to the unique characteristics of underwater imagery. Our approach involves freezing the parameters of the pre-trained model and updating only the adapters through self-supervision. To address the complex degradation of underwater images, we propose two adapters: the transmission adapter and the high-frequency adapter. These adapters incorporate depth clues and high-frequency information as prior knowledge, thereby enhancing the performance of pre-trained model in underwater depth estimation. Experimental results demonstrate that by integrating lightweight adapters into off-the-shelf depth estimation foundation models, our method achieves superior performance across multiple datasets.},

While the long-tailed distribution of multimedia dataset remains a constant, we can enhance the acquisition of balanced training samples and corresponding features during the learning process. This paper innovatively designs a sample provider to construct balanced training samples to enhance the acquisition of comprehensive features, and proposes a Siamese-based parameter-sharing framework to handle data with long-tailed distributions. Specifically, one branch of the Siamese network is introduced to classify samples with conventional random cropping sampling, another branch integrates the advantages of constructed balanced samples and hybrid optimization to capture the balanced features to identify more precise category boundaries. This combination not only facilitates the learning of long-tailed distribution but also strengthens the model&#39;s extraction of balanced features through the incorporation of contrastive learning. Most significantly, extensive experiments on CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT and iNaturalist 2018 datasets demonstrate our model not only achieves superior performance but also retains the benefits of end-to-end training.

To remove clouds from optical remote sensing images, a series of deep learning-based thin cloud removal methods have been developed. However, these methods have not explored the long-range modeling ability of state space models in optical remote sensing image thin cloud removal. In this paper, we propose a frequency-domain assisted Mamba for thin cloud removal, which is called CR-Famba. In CR-Famba, to better extract global and local features of images, we design a frequency-domain assisted state space layer (FDA-SSL). The FDA-SSL consists of two core components: residual state space block (RSSB) and frequency domain detail enhancement block (FDDEB). The RSSB utilizes the visual state space module (VSSM) to extract long-range dependencies of images from a spatial perspective while adding convolutional layers to overcome local pixel forgetting. Due to the rich detailed information of remote sensing images, we present FDDEB equipped with discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to supplement the extracted local information from the frequency domain perspective. We conduct experiments on different types of cloud-containing datasets, and the results show that our method can recover images with clearer texture details compared to other methods. https://github.com/Lab-PANbin/},

  abstract     = {Recently, numerous learning-based point cloud compression methods with outstanding performance have been developed. The majority of them concentrate on point cloud geometry compression, and several works have demonstrated advances in the color attribute compression for dense point clouds. However, compression of the reflectance attribute attached to the point captured by the light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors remains a major challenge. In this paper, we present a lossless reflectance compression method for LiDAR point clouds (LPCs) that learns reflectance probability distributions with a deep hierarchical k-nearest-neighbors (KNN) context model, namely, the HK-PCRC. We first represent the original LPC with a series of hierarchical layers. Relying on the hierarchical structure, points in the same layer are coded in parallel by referencing the points in the previously coded layers. The approach balances the coding efficiency and time complexity while also supporting the progressive coding functionality. By introducing the KNN context, the context size is significantly reduced, which eases the computational burden while maintaining the coding performance. To enrich the context information, we further search for enhanced neighbors for each point in the context window. For each enhanced neighbor, in addition to its reflectance value, the relative distance, elevation angle, and local density are further collected. Then, a transformer-style sequential model is applied to construct an accurate deep context model. Furthermore, to efficiently fuse context features from different sources, a cross-feature fusion attention mechanism is designed for the transformer network. The comprehensive experimental results on SemanticKITTI, a large scale LiDAR benchmark, and Ford, an MPEG-specified dataset, demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves a state-of-the-art reflectance lossless compression performance, with average bit savings of 11.3% and 9.6% when compared to the state-of-the-art hand-crafted methods.},

We start with an official food nutrition database and propose a consensus-based approach using Large Language Models to identify visually discernible and directly edible foods, expanding food synonyms and harnessing diverse web-based food images for comprehensive visual representation. To minimize manual annotation of noisy web images, we introduce a cyclic training-based area under the margin metric (cAUM) approach that effectively distinguishes appropriate images, including rare instances, from noisy ones. Additionally, we design a generic accuracy gap (AccGap) algorithm to automatically estimate the noise ratio of the web-harnessed data. Our integrated cAUM and AccGap method demonstrates superior performance in noise detection and enhancement of image recognition accuracy compared to existing noise-robust frameworks. Furthermore, we successfully apply the visually enriched FoodnKB and food recognition capabilities within a smart nutritionist mobile application.},

This task can alleviate the workload of radiologists, enhance the efficiency of disease diagnosis, and therefore holds significant value and challenges. Considering the feature differences between different modalities, existing methods primarily focus on facilitating medical report generation through cross-modal alignment of images and texts. However, since medical images are very similar to each other, it is difficult to tag obvious objects, making most methods limited to coarse-grained image-text global alignment. In this paper, we propose a medical report generation model based on adaptive topic learning and fine-grained cross-modal alignment, which aligns images and texts from medical topic perspective and token perspective. From the medical topic perspective, a global-local contrastive loss is introduced to adaptively learn efficient medical topic features, and medical topics are utilized to map images and texts to the same semantic space for fine-grained alignment. From the token perspective, a token prediction module is designed to enable the model to focus on important local information by predicting the key tokens contained in the report. Experimental results on the two public datasets (i.e. IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR) demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.},

The scheme cooperates with the Reference Picture Resampling of the latest video coding standard Versatile Video Coding (VVC), which allows coding scale variations on each frame. More specifically, a dataset with 5200 videos is created by a greedy rate-distortion optimization algorithm employed to select the optimal coding scale for each frame. A neural network-based decision model is further incorporated into VVC, learning to predict the coding scale for each frame in one pass. The scheme is implemented into the Fraunhofer Versatile Video Encoder (VVenC), a fast and efficient VVC encoder, and evaluated on 4K contents.

Traditional VQA approaches do not distinguish between data processing and reasoning, limiting their interpretability and generalizability in complex and diverse scenarios. Conversely, Programmatic Visual Question Answering (PVQA) models leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate executable codes, providing answers with detailed and interpretable reasoning processes. However, existing PVQA models typically rely on simplistic input-output prompting, which struggles to elicit domain-specific knowledge from LLMs and often produces unclear or extraneous outputs. Furthermore, PVQA models typically rely on a basic in-context example (ICE) selection methodology that is heavily influenced by individual word similarity rather than the overall sentence context. This leads to suboptimal ICE selection and a reliance on dataset-specific ICE candidates. In this paper, we propose ContextualCoder, a novel prompting framework tailored for PVQA models. ContextualCoder leverages frozen LLMs for code generation and pre-trained visual models for code execution, eliminating the need for extensive training and enhancing model flexibility. By incorporating an innovative prompting methodology and a novel ICE selection strategy, ContextualCoder facilitates the use of diverse in-context information for code generation, thereby improving the performance of PVQA models.

Autonomous systems rely on sensors that provide data about the environment and internal situations to their perception systems for learning and inference mechanisms. These systems can also learn Self-Aware and SituationAware generative modules from these data to localize themselves and interact with the environment. In this paper, we propose a self-aware cognitive architecture capable to perform tasks where the interactions between the self-state of an agent and the surrounding environment are explicitly and dynamically represented. We specifically develop a Deep Learning (DL) based Self-Aware interaction model, empowered by learning from Multi-Modal Perception (MMP) and World Models using multisensory data in a novel Multi-Agent Self-Awareness Architecture (MASAA). Two sub-modules are developed, the Situation Model (SM) and the First-Person model (FPM), that address different and interrelated aspects of the World Model (WM). The MMP model, instead, aims at learning the mapping of different sensory perceptions into Exteroceptive (EI) and Proprioceptive (PI) latent information. The WM then uses the learned MMP model as experience to predict dynamic self-behaviors and interaction patterns within the experienced environment. WM and MMP Models are learned in a data-driven way, starting from the lowerdimensional odometry data used to guide the learning of higherdimensional video data, thus generating coupled Generalized State Hierarchical Dynamic Bayesian Networks (GS-HDBNs). We test our model on KITTI, CARLA, and iCab datasets, achieving high performance and a low average localization error (RMSE) of 2.897%, when considering two interacting agents.},

These networks, though perform well on rotation-aware tasks, is inferior in general tasks such as classification and segmentation. On the other hand, many powerful point processing networks, such as PointNet++, DGCNN, etc., have general point processing abilities, but do not own the property of rotation invariance. In this paper, we propose a standalone rotation-invariant convolution operator called SGGConv (Spherical Geometric Graph-based Convolution) and two ways integrating it with common point-based networks. The networks equipped with SGGConvs are called SGG-Nets which promote the rotation-invariance ability of regular point networks without modifying their network architectures much. Our contributions are three-fold. First, we propose a rotation-invariant feature descriptor, namely Spherical Geometry Descriptor (SGD), which captures point-pair features in a Local Spherical Coordinate System (LSCS). Second, we propose the SGGConv based on SGD and LSCS with an efficient Graph-based Spherical Feature Passing (GSFP) mechanism. Thirdly, we define two modules S-SGGConvMdl and M-SGGConvMdl, which are used to integrate SGGConv into baseline point nets. We test SGG-Nets, such as SGG-PointNet++, SGG-DGCNN, SGG-RIConv++, on representative point cloud datasets. These models, equipped with our SGGConvs, not only enhance the rotation-invariance of the baseline network but also improve its performance on point cloud analysis tasks such as classification and part segmentation, without incurring too much computational overhead.},

  abstract     = {Video moment retrieval (VMR) aims to localize a video segment in an untrimmed video that is semantically relevant to a language query. The challenge of this task lies in effectively aligning the intricate and information-dense video modality with the succinctly summarized textual modality, and further localizing the starting and ending timestamps of the target moments. Previous works have attempted to achieve multi-granularity alignment of video and query in a coarse-to-fine manner, yet these efforts still fall short in addressing the inherent disparities in representation and information density between videos and queries, leading to modal misalignments. In this paper, we propose a progressive video moment retrieval framework, initially retrieving the most relevant and irrelevant video clips to the query as semantic guidance, thereby bridging the semantic gap between video modality and language modality. Futhermore, we introduce a pseudo clips guided aggregation module to aggregate densely relevant moment clips closer together and propose a discriminative boundary-enhanced decoder with the guidance of pseudo clips to push the semantically confusing proposals away. Extensive experiments on the Charades-STA, ActivityNet Captions and TACoS datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods.},

Existing approaches remain confined to the de-occlusion of a specific depth plane, i.e., single depth in focus, unable to be applied to observe occluded targets with varying depths due to the decreased focus range. To achieve All-in-Focus E-SAI, i.e., recovering the occlusion-free image of all depth planes, the depth information behind the occlusions should be given to ensure accurate event refocusing. In this paper, we first prove the feasibility of predicting the depth map from captured events in the presence of dense occlusions. Then, we propose the ESAI-AF network, which consists of a Depth Estimation Module (DEM) designed to estimate the depth information from multi-view events and an Image Enhancement Module (IEM) designed to reconstruct high-quality occlusion-free images from the refocused events. We employ only multi-view occlusion-free images as supervised signals for end-to-end training of the above modules. Extensive experiments have shown that the proposed method can effectively perform All-in-Focus image reconstruction of occluded multi-depth targets and achieves superior performance to existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS) aims to incrementally learn novel classes while retaining the ability to segment old classes, and suffers catastrophic forgetting since the old-class labels are unavailable. Most existing methods typically impose strict constraints on the consistency between the extracted features or output logits of each pixel from old and current models in an attempt to prevent forgetting through knowledge distillation (KD), which 1) results in a significant transfer of redundant knowledge while limiting the restoration of old classes (rigidity) due to potentially overlooking essential knowledge extraction, and 2) imposes strong constraints at the pixel level making it challenging for the model to learn novel classes (plasticity). To solve the above limitations, we propose a novel Spatial Visual and Statistical Relation Distillation (SVSRD) by applying multi-scale visual and statistical position relation distillation for CISS, which enjoys several merits. First, we introduce a region-based similarity matrix and impose a consistency constraint between current and old models, which preserves the essential visual knowledge to enhance the rigidity. Second, we propose a novel statistical feature calculation algorithm to investigate the distribution of the data and further preserve the rules of statistics through statistical consistency, which also promotes the model on the novel-class learning for improving the plasticity. Finally, the aforementioned constraints are jointly applied in multiple scales to alleviate old-class forgetting and enhance novel-class learning. Extensive experiments on Pascal-VOC 2012 and ADE20K demonstrate that the proposed approach performs favorably against the state-of-the-art CISS methods.

  abstract     = {Pedestrian detection plays a crucial role in autonomous driving systems. To ensure reliable and effective detection in challenging conditions, researchers have proposed RGB–T (RGB–thermal) detectors that integrate thermal images with color images for more complementary feature representations. However, existing methods face challenges in capturing the spatial and geometric correlations between different modalities, as well as in assuming perfect synchronization of the two modalities, which is unrealistic in real-world scenarios. In response to these challenges, we present a new deformableattention-based approach for weakly aligned RGB–T pedestrian detection. The proposed method uses a dual-branch crossattention mechanism to capture the inherent spatial and geometric correlations between color and thermal images. Furthermore, it incorporates positional information for each image pixel into the sampling offset generation to enhance robustness in scenarios where modalities are not precisely aligned or registered. To reduce computational complexity, we introduce a local attention mechanism that samples only a small set of keys and values within a limited region in the feature maps for each query. Extensive experiments and ablation studies conducted on multiple public datasets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Many existing automatic methods focus on roughly controlling predefined shot types or movement patterns, which struggle to engage viewers with the actor&#39;s circumstances. Real-world cinematographic rules show that directors can create immersion by comprehensively synchronizing the camera with the actor. Inspired by this strategy, we propose a deep camera control framework that enables actor-camera synchronization in three aspects, considering frame aesthetics, spatial action, and emotional status in the 3D virtual stage. Following rule-of-thirds, our framework first modifies the initial camera placement to position the actor aesthetically. This adjustment is facilitated by a weakly-supervised adjustor that analyzes frame composition via camera projection. We then design a GAN model that can adversarially synthesize fine-grained camera movement based on the actor&#39;s action and psychological state, using an encoder-decoder generator to map kinematics and emotional variables into camera trajectories. Moreover, we incorporate a regularizer to align the generated stylistic variances with specific emotional categories and intensities. The experimental results show that our proposed method yields immersive cinematic videos of high quality, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Effective means to detect such tampering is crucial in controlling the dissemination of false information. However, a major challenge in achieving high detection accuracy lies in the variability of the scale of the copied targets. To tackle this problem, we introduce an all-encompassing methodology called Cross-Scale Modeling and Alternating Refinement (CANet) to detect the genuine source and tampered region at the pixel level. CANet consists of three modules: the Cross-Scale Similar Region Detection (CS) module, the Edge-Supervised Tamper Region Detection (ET) module, and the Alternating Refinement (AR) module. The CS module extracts coarse similar region features by cross-scale correlation modeling, which can alleviate the scale gap between the source and tampered region. The obtained coarse similar region feature is refined by the AR module, in which we introduce the source and the tampered region as the auxiliary information and employ a two-stage process that sequentially models their global feature representations. The tampered region used in the AR module is obtained from the ET module using edge supervision with a salient edge selection scheme, and the source region is generated by the implicit modeling. We conducted experiments on the USC-ISI, CASIA v2.0, CoMoFoD, and MICC-F220 datasets separately. Results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art.},

  abstract     = {By converting low-frame-rate, low-resolution videos into high-frame-rate, high-resolution ones, space-time video super-resolution techniques can enhance visual experiences and facilitate more efficient information dissemination. We propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) for space-time video super-resolution, namely GIRNet. Our method combines long-term global information and short-term local information from the video to better extract complete and accurate spatial-temporal information. To generate highly accurate features and thus improve performance, the proposed network integrates a feature-level temporal interpolation module with deformable convolutions and a global spatial-temporal information-based residual convolutional long short-term memory (convLSTM) module. In the feature-level temporal interpolation module, we leverage deformable convolution, which adapts to deformations and scale variations of objects across different scene locations. This provides a more efficient solution than conventional convolution for extracting features from moving objects. Our network effectively uses forward and backward feature information to determine inter-frame offsets, leading to the direct generation of interpolated frame features. In the global spatial-temporal information-based residual convLSTM module, the first convLSTM is used to derive global spatial-temporal information from the input features, and the second convLSTM uses the previously computed global spatial-temporal information feature as its initial cell state. This second convLSTM adopts residual connections to preserve spatial information, thereby enhancing the output features. Experiments on the Vimeo90K dataset show that the proposed method outperforms open source state-of-the-art techniques in peak signal-to-noise-ratio (by 1.45 dB, 1.14 dB, and 0.2 dB over STARnet, TMNet, and 3DAttGAN, respectively), structural similarity index(by 0.027, 0.023, and 0.006 over STARnet, TMNet, and 3DAttGAN, respectively), and visual quality.},

  abstract     = {Over the recent years, multimodal named entity recognition has gained increasing attentions due to its wide applications in social media. The key factor of multimodal named entity recognition is to effectively fuse information of different modalities. Existing works mainly focus on reinforcing textual representations by fusing image features via the cross-modal attention mechanism. However, these works are limited in reinforcing the text modality at the token level. As a named entity usually contains several tokens, modeling token-level inter-modal interactions is suboptimal for the multimodal named entity recognition problem. In this work, we propose a multimodal named entity recognition approach dubbed Adaptive Multi-scale Language Reinforcement (AMLR) to implement entity-level language reinforcement. To this end, our model first expands token-level textual representations into multi-scale textual representations which are composed of language units of different lengths. After that, the visual information reinforces the language modality by modeling the cross-modal attention between images and expanded multi-scale textual representations. Unlike existing token-level language reinforcement methods, the word sequences of named entities can be directly interacted with the visual features as a whole, making the modeled cross-modal correlations more reasonable. Although the underlying entity is not given, the training procedure can encourage the relevant image contents to adaptively attend to the appropriate language units, making our approach not rely on the pipeline design. Comprehensive evaluation results on two public Twitter datasets clearly demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model.},

In this paper, we introduce a bi-directional deep contextual video compression scheme tailored for B-frames, termed DCVC-B, to improve the compression performance of deep B-frame coding. Our scheme mainly has three key innovations. First, we develop a bi-directional motion difference context propagation method for effective motion difference coding, which significantly reduces the bit cost of bi-directional motions. Second, we propose a bi-directional contextual compression model and a corresponding bi-directional temporal entropy model, to make better use of the multi-scale temporal contexts.

Experimental results show that our DCVC-B achieves an average reduction of 26.6% in BD-Rate compared to the reference software for H.265/HEVC under random access conditions. Remarkably, it surpasses the performance of the H.266/VVC reference software on certain test datasets under the same configuration.

  abstract     = {The interactions between human and objects are important for recognizing object-centric actions. Existing methods usually adopt a two-stage pipeline, where object proposals are first detected using a pretrained detector, and then are fed to an action recognition model for extracting video features and learning the object relations for action recognition. However, since the action prior is unknown in the object detection stage, important objects could be easily overlooked, leading to inferior action recognition performance. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end object-centric action recognition framework that simultaneously performs Detection And Interaction Reasoning (dubbed DAIR) in one stage. Particularly, after extracting video features using a base network, we design three consecutive modules for simultaneously learning object detection and interaction reasoning. Firstly, we build a Patch-based Object Decoder (PatchDec) to generate object proposals from video patch tokens. Then, we design an Interactive Object Refining and Aggregation (IRA) to identify the interactive objects that are important for action recognition. The IRA module adjusts the interactiveness scores of proposals based on their relative position and appearance, and aggregates the object-level information into global video representation. Finally, we build an Object Relation Modeling (ORM) module to encode the object relations. These three modules together with the video feature extractor can be trained jointly in an end-to-end fashion, thus avoiding the heavy reliance on an off-the-shelf object detector, and reducing the multi-stage training burden. We conduct experiments on two datasets, Something-Else and Ikea-Assembly, to evaluate the performance of our proposed approach on conventional, compositional, and few-shot action recognition tasks. Through in-depth experimental analysis, we show the crucial role of interactive objects in learning for action recognition, and we can outperform state-of-the-art methods on both datasets. We hope our DAIR can provide a new perspective for object-centric action recognition. The code is available at https://github.com/lixunsong/DAIR.},

  abstract     = {Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in multimedia processing, which can be used for analyzing, understanding, editing contents of images and videos, among others. To accelerate the analysis of multimedia data, existing segmentation researches tend to extract semantic information by progressively reducing the spatial resolutions of feature maps. However, this approach introduces a misalignment problem when restoring the resolution of high-level feature maps. In this paper, we design a Semantic Refinement Module (SRM) to address this issue within the segmentation network. Specifically, SRM is designed to learn a transformation offset for each pixel in the upsampled feature maps, guided by high-resolution feature maps and neighboring offsets. By applying these offsets to the upsampled feature maps, SRM enhances the semantic representation of the segmentation network, particularly for pixels around object boundaries. Furthermore, a Contextual Refinement Module (CRM) is presented to capture global context information across both spatial and channel dimensions. To balance dimensions between channel and space, we aggregate the semantic maps from all four stages of the backbone to enrich channel context information. The efficacy of these proposed modules is validated on three widely used datasets-Cityscapes, Bdd100K, and ADE20K-demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, this paper extends these modules to a lightweight segmentation network, achieving an mIoU of 82.5% on the Cityscapes validation set with only 137.9 GFLOPs.},

  abstract     = {Multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) has garnered significant attention due to its emphasis on transferring knowledge from multiple labeled source domains to a single unlabeled target domain. MSDA requires sufficient labeled data from multiple source domains, but in practice, massive unlabeled data exist instead of well-labeled data. Multiple target domains also provide plenty of information, which is useful for domain adaptation. However, most MSDA studies overlook the critical scenario of multi-source and multi-target domain adaptation (MMDA). To address these problems, we propose a Multiple Adaptation Network (MAN) approach for MMDA, which utilizes multiple alignment strategies for each source-target domain pair-group to align relevant specific feature spaces. MAN also aligns multiple classifiers for the relevant feature spaces to optimize the decision boundaries of multiple target domains. Moreover, to consider the task relations of multiple classifiers, we minimize the semantic differences between the target-conditioned classifiers and utilize a weight learning category to optimize this process. To fully utilize the information from multiple target domains, we transfer the style information of the target data to the source data, aiding in the training of multiple classifiers. Extensive experiments in challenge domain adaptation benchmarks, including the ImageCLEF-DA, Office-Home, DomainNet, and RGB-to-thermal datasets, demonstrate the superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {The goal of Few-Shot Continual Learning (FSCL) is to incrementally learn novel tasks with limited labeled samples and preserve previous capabilities simultaneously. However, current FSCL works lack research on domain increment and domain generalization ability, which cannot cope with changes in the visual perception environment. In this paper, we set up a Generalized FSCL (GFSCL) protocol involving both class- and domain-incremental scenarios together with domain generalization assessment. Firstly, two benchmark datasets and protocols are newly arranged, and detailed baselines are provided for this unexplored configuration. Furthermore, we find that common continual learning methods have poor generalization ability on unseen domains and cannot better tackle catastrophic forgetting issue in cross-incremental tasks. Hence, we propose a rehearsal-free framework based on Vision Transformer (ViT) named Contrastive Mixture of Adapters (CMoA). It contains two non-conflicting parts: (1) By applying the fast-adaptation characteristic of adapter-embedded ViT, the mixture of Adapters (MoA) module is incorporated into ViT. For stability purpose, cosine similarity regularization and dynamic weighting are designed to make each adapter learn specific knowledge and concentrate on particular classes. (2) To further enhance domain generalization ability, we alleviate the intra-class variation by prototype-calibrated contrastive learning to improve domain-invariant representation learning. Finally, six evaluation indicators showing the overall performance and forgetting are compared by comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets to validate the efficacy of CMoA, and the results illustrate that CMoA can achieve comparative performance with rehearsal-based continual learning methods.

The process of medical images has attracted great attention in the machine learning community. However, the labeled medical images are limited and the regions of lesions are usually much smaller in the image. Most of the existing methods are prone to learning the spurious correlation for classification, resulting in poor generalization. In this paper, we propose a medical generation transformer network based on self-supervised learning and the adversarial strategy to capture the discriminative label-relevant regions with lesions in the images by extending the Chest X-ray images. In the proposed method, we first localize the label-relevant regions in each transformer layer. Then we keep the label-relevant regions to mask the image and construct the masked image with self-supervised learning. Thus we can generate more images to fine-tune the classification network with masked images that keep the label-relevant regions. Since the generated images are usually noisy to fine-tune the classification network, we adopt the adversarial probabilities to weight the importance of each generated image for training. Experimental results on two large-scale and popular chest X-ray datasets show that the proposed method can efficiently leverage the location of lesions to improve the performance of classification.},

  abstract     = {Video question answering (Video-QA) has emerged as a core task in the vision-language domain, which requires the models to understand a given video and answer textual questions related to the video. Compared to conventional image-language tasks, Video-QA is designed for improving the models&#39; capacity of memorizing and integrating multi-frame temporal cues associated with the questions. While significant performance improvements have recently been witnessed on public benchmarks, in this work, we rethink whether these improvements truly stem from better understanding of video temporal context as expected. To this end, we accomplish a strong single-frame baseline model trained with knowledge distillation. With this model, we surprisingly find that visiting only one single frame, without incorporating multi-frame and temporal information, is sufficient to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple mainstream benchmarks. This finding reveals the prevalence of single-frame bias in current benchmarks for the first time. Around the single-frame bias, we conduct an in-depth analysis on multiple popular benchmarks, which demonstrate that: (i) merely relying on one frame is able to achieve comparable performance with SOTA temporal Video-QA models; (ii) simply ensembling the prediction scores of only 3 separate frames is able to surpass temporal SOTAs. Furthermore, we observe that most of the benchmarks are biased towards central segments, and even the latest benchmarks tailored for temporal reasoning still suffer from severe single-frame bias. In case study, we find two key properties of low-bias instances: the question emphasizes temporal dependency and contextual understanding, and the associated video content presents significant variability in scenes, actions or interactions. Through further analysis on compositional reasoning datasets, we find that constructing explicit object/event interactions upon videos to fill in well-designed temporal question templates can effectively reduce the single-frame bias during annotation. We hope our analysis helps facilitate future efforts in the field towards mitigating static bias and highlighting temporal reasoning.},

The mixed method has demonstrated notable performance by integrating both anchor-based and anchor-free approaches. However, while it leverages the strengths of each method, it also retains their respective limitations. For instance, the anchor-based approach depends on manually crafted anchors tailored to specific datasets, while the anchor-free approach predicts potential action instances at each temporal position, resulting in a significant number of false positives in category prediction. The inclusion of these limitations undermines the potential benefits of the mixed method. In this paper, we propose a novel Boundary Discretization and Reliable Classification Network (BDRC-Net) that addresses the issues above by introducing boundary discretization and reliable classification modules. Specifically, the boundary discretization module (BDM) elegantly merges anchor-based and anchor-free approaches in the form of boundary discretization, eliminating the need for the traditional handcrafted anchor design. Furthermore, the reliable classification module (RCM) predicts reliable global action categories to reduce false positives. Extensive experiments conducted on different benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method achieves competitive detection performance.

Recent advancements have primarily concentrated on supervised image deraining methods, which rely on paired rain-clean image datasets to train deep neural network models. However, collecting such paired real data is challenging and time-consuming. To address this, our method introduces a novel self-supervised approach that leverages the proposed locally dominant gradient prior and non-local self-similarity stochastic sampling. This approach extracts potential rain streaks and generates stochastic derained references for image deraining.

  abstract     = {Retinex theory-based low-light image enhancement methods have received increasing attention and achieved tremendous advancements. However, there still exist two seldom-explored issues: 1) The above methods only formally simulate the Retinex decomposition, resulting in lacking explicit interpretability. 2) They usually are performed in single-scale space, leading to suboptimal enhancement results. In this paper, we propose an interpretable Multi-scale Retinex Unfolding Network (MRUNet) for low-light image enhancement, which can tackle both of the aforementioned issues simultaneously. Specifically, we formulate low-light image enhancement as a multi-scale Retinex optimization problem and design an iteration minimization solution to solve it. The optimization solution is further unfolded to fabricate MRUNet, which is empowered with clear physical significance and multi-scale prior knowledge in favor of image enhancement. However, it will aggravate model size and efficiency when exploiting multiple proximal mapping networks to extract multi-scale prior from multi-scale inputs. To surmount the issue, we propose a Scale-Aware Proximal mapping Module (SAPM), which efficiently collect multi-scale prior knowledge via the weight sharing strategy. In SAPM, we tailor a scale-aware transformer to model the specific scale-similarity among different scales. Extensive experiments manifest that MRUNet surpasses other Retinex-based low-light image enhancement methods on multiple benchmarks.

  abstract     = {Deep learning based remote sensing (RS) image segmentation significantly impacts several real application scenarios. Behind its success, massive labeled data plays an important role. However, annotating high-resolution RS images requires time-consuming and relevant expertise efforts. To address it, many works dive into semi-supervised learning which utilizes raw information embedded in unlabeled data to improve the segmentation model. Nevertheless, previous studies ignore the integrity and effectiveness of the potential context information hidden in RS data. In this work, we propose an uncertainty-aware masked consistency learning (U-MCL) framework that contains an uncertainty-aware masked denoising (U-MD) module and an uncertainty-aware masked image consistency (U-MIC) module. U-MCL initially generates a patch-wise uncertainty map for each unlabeled image during each training iteration, which is then used to derive an adaptive mask ratio for pseudo-label denoising in U-MD. Simultaneously, the uncertainty map is adopted to model a masked unlabeled image for reasoning unseen areas in U-MIC. Consequently, U-MCL is capable of enhancing model performance by engaging in accurate and stable consistency learning while preserving the integrity of the context and employing the context to infer the predictions of the masked regions safely. Extensive experiments on six RS datasets, i.e., ISPRS Vaihingen, FloodNet, MiniFrance, LoveDA, MER, and MSL, demonstrate the superiority of our U-MCL over recent most advanced methods, achieving new state-of-the-art performance under all benchmarks.

Drawing inspiration from traditional schemes, numerous works focus on introducing vision-specific inductive biases. However, the implicit modeling of permutation invariance and fully-connected interaction with individual tokens disrupts the regional context and spatial topology, further hindering higher-order modeling. This deviates from the principle of perceptual organization that emphasizes the local groups and overall topology of visual elements. Thus, we introduce the concept of hypergraph for perceptual exploration. Specifically, we propose a topology-aware vision transformer called HyperGraph Transformer (HGFormer). Firstly, we present a Center Sampling K-Nearest Neighbors (CS-KNN) algorithm for semantic guidance during hypergraph construction. Secondly, we present a topology-aware HyperGraph Attention (HGA) mechanism that integrates hypergraph topology as perceptual indications to guide the aggregation of global and unbiased information during hypergraph messaging. Using HGFormer as visual backbone, we develop an effective and unitive representation, achieving distinct and detailed scene depictions. Empirical experiments show that the proposed HGFormer achieves competitive performance compared to the recent SoTA counterparts on various visual benchmarks. Extensive ablation and visualization studies provide comprehensive explanations of our ideas and contributions.},

  abstract     = {Fine-grained 3D shape classification (FGSC) has garnered significant attention recently and has made notable advancements. However, due to high inter-class similarity and intra-class diversity, it is still a challenge for existing methods to capture subtle differences between different subcategories for FGSC. On the one hand, one-hot labels in loss function are too hard to describe the above data characteristics, and on the other hand, local details are submerged in the global features extraction process and final network constraints, impacting classification results. In this paper, we propose a duplex label smoothingbased hierarchical context-aware network for fine-grained 3D shape classification, named DLS-HCAN. Specifically, DLS-HCAN firstly employs a hierarchical context-aware network (HCAN), in which the intra-view context attention mechanism (intra-ATT) and the inter-view context multilayer perceptron (inter-MLP) are designed to focus on and discern the beneficial local details. Subsequently, we propose a novel duplex label smoothing (DLS) regularization in which shape-level and view-level smooth labels are separately applied in two improved loss functions, adapting to the fine-grained data characteristics and considering the varying uniqueness of different views. Notably, our approach does not require additional annotation information. Experimental results and comparison with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the superiority of our proposed DLS-HCAN for FGSC. In addition, our approach also achieves comparable performance for the coarse-grained dataset on ModelNet40},

In this paper, we develop a 3-D spatial-temporal knowledge aware-based unsupervised network for IR target detection (STUTD). Specifically, we transform IR sequences into 3-D spatial-temporal tensors as data foundation. Based on the designed spatial-temporal Swin Transformer block (ST-STB), we introduce a multiscale feature extraction and aggregation (MFEA) module for effective feature extraction. And a Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-style background reconstruction module with a multihead gating mechanism is designed for background reconstruction. Besides, a designed sparse cardinality selection of residuals performs element-wise filtering on the residuals between the original tensors and the reconstructed background to obtain a pure target tensor. By an unsupervised learning approach, STUTD can achieve IR small target detection. Comprehensive experiments illustrate the superiority of STUTD among state-of-the-art methods. It can be concluded that STUTD has satisfactory overall performance and real-time performance.},

In contrast, our study addresses an inverse problem by investigating the generation patterns of noise during screen-shooting and considering them as feasible representations of watermark signals. Leveraging Moiré patterns as one of the distortion signals naturally generated by the interaction between electronic screens and camera sensors, we propose Moiré-watermark, presenting watermark information encoded into meticulously crafted Moiré patterns within images. To enhance the naturalness of Moiré-watermark amidst the irregularities of screen-shooting Moiré patterns, we encode watermark signals using gratings at different angles.

Experimental results show that our method achieves a robustness rate of up to 95% against time-stretching and maintains an average security accuracy rate exceeding 97% across various attack scenarios.

Previous 3D adversarial attackers mainly focus on attacking naive 3D classification models by perturbing 3D objects. However, since real-world 3D applications generally rely on more complicated scene-based point cloud data, these attack methods are impractical to deploy in realistic scenarios. Therefore, in this paper, we attempt to introduce the adversarial attacks into a more practical yet challenging large-scale scene-based 3D task, i.e., text-guided 3D scene grounding. To make perturbations both effective and imperceptible in scene cases, we investigate the vulnerability of 3D grounding models to backdoor attacks, which implant backdoor triggers into 3D models via data poisoning so as to control the models&#39; predictions at test time. Specifically, we propose a novel Joint Scene-Text Backdoor Attack (JSTBA) method to embed triggers in each of the input modalities and activate the malicious behavior only when both triggers are present. We further design a visual trigger optimization strategy to place the visual trigger appropriately in the 3D scene, aiming to make it natural and imperceptible. Extensive experiments are conducted on seven classic 3D grounding models and three datasets, showing that our JSTBA attack significantly degrades the performance of 3D models on the poisoned data while gaining comparable performance with the benign models on the clean data.},

  abstract     = {The prevalent convolution neural network (CNN) and Transformer have revolutionized the area of single-image super-resolution (SISR). Though these models have significantly improved performance, they often struggle with real-time applications or on resource-constrained platforms due to their complexity. In this paper, we propose TBag, a lightweight hybrid network that combines the strengths of CNN and Transformer to address these challenges. Our method simplifies the Transformer block with three key optimizations: 1) No projection layer is applied to the value in the original self-attention operation; 2) The number of tokens is rescaled before the self-attention operation and then rescaled back for easing of computation; 3) The expansion factor of the original feed-forward network (FFN) is adjusted. These optimizations enable the development of an efficient hybrid network tailored for real-time SISR. Notably, the hybrid design of CNN and Transformer further enhances both local detail recovery and global feature modeling. Extensive experiments show that TBag achieves a competitive trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency compared to previous lightweight SISR methods (e.g., +0.42dB PSNR with an 86.7% reduction in latency). Moreover, TBag&#39;s real-time capabilities make it highly suitable for practical applications, with the TBag-Tiny version achieving up to 59 FPS on hardware devices. Future work will explore the potential of this hybrid approach in other image restoration tasks, such as denoising and deblurring.},

It is more challenging than Task Incremental Learning (TIL) as task ID is not provided during testing. Therefore, transitioning from CIL to TIL is an intuitive approach to handling CIL problems for image classification. Currently, the main challenge of this approach lies in improving the accuracy of task identification. To address this issue, we propose to use a large-scale image-text pre-training model (i.e. CLIP) as the backbone, training and saving different classifiers for different tasks. Each classifier not only includes the classes of the current task, but also an Out-of-distribution (OOD) class corresponding to the classes encountered in all previous tasks. At test time, we iterate through classifiers from the last task to find the correct task ID of the test image, and perform classification in a TIL way. In addition, to tackle the issue of early-stop termination in iterative prediction due to model bias toward later tasks, we propose using CLIP zero-shot ability to assist learned OOD detection. Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the traditional many-shot and the more challenging few-shot settings of CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-Subset datasets.},

To maximize long-term user satisfaction, existing research has incorporated reinforcement learning into interactive recommender systems and combined it with meta-learning to form a meta-reinforcement learning framework that further addresses the cold-start problem in interactive recommendation. However, on one hand, there are latent confounders affecting user feedback; on the other hand, since training samples are observed rather than experimentally obtained, selection bias and exposure bias exist in the interactive data. Most existing studies remove biases using the method of Inverse Propensity Score, which often utilizes fixed propensity scores and neglects the latent confounders affecting user feedback. In this paper, we propose an unbiased interactive recommender system (UIRS) based on a meta-reinforcement learning framework. To eliminate the impact of latent confounders in the state encoding process, we design a user preference representer consisting of three interconnected gated recurrent units. Additionally, we use the item recommendation probabilities output from the policy network as propensity scores and design the objective functions based on these scores, to eliminate biases while addressing latent confounders.

Recently, many learning-based methods were proposed to achieve single image dehazing with the training of tremendous paired synthetic hazy/ real clean images. Due to the domain gap between real and synthetic scenes, these models cannot generalize well to various real hazy scenes, leading to under-dehazed results. To overcome this problem, we propose a real scene image Dehazing Network with Multi-prior Guidance and Domain Transfer (DNMGDT). Our DNMGDT is based on a parameter shared architecture trained by synthetic hazy images and real hazy images simultaneously. For real hazy images, multiple prior-based dehazed images are adopted as pseudo clean images. An Image Quality Guided Adaptive Weighting (IQGAW) scheme is proposed to form the supervision by automatically weighting different parts of these prior-based dehazed images and suppressing negative information of them. Moreover, to reduce the domain gap between real and synthetic hazy scenes, a Physical Model Guided image level Domain Transfer (PMGDT) mechanism is proposed to regularize the learning process with consistency constraint. Experiments on various datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed method especially for real hazy scenes. The official codes see https://github.com/NianWang-HJJGCDX/DNMGDT},

  abstract     = {Zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval (ZS-SBIR) is a challenging task that hinges on overcoming the cross-domain differences between sketches and images. Previous methods primarily address cross-domain differences by creating a common embedding space, improving final retrieval results. However, most previous approaches have overlooked a critical aspect: sketch-based image retrieval task actually requires only the cross-domain invariant information relevant to the retrieval. Irrelevant information (such as posture, expression, background, and specificity) may detract from retrieval accuracy. In addition, most previous methods perform well on traditional SBIR datasets but lack corresponding research on generalization and extensibility in the face of more diverse and complex data. To address these issues, we propose a Dual Causal Disentangled Learning (DCDL) for ZS-SBIR. This approach can mitigate the negative impact of irrelevant features by separating retrieval-relevant features in the latent variable space. Specifically, we constructed a causal disentanglement model using two Variational Autoencoders (VAE), each applied to the sketch and image domains, to obtain disentangled variables with exchangeable attributes. Our framework effectively integrates causal intervention with disentangled representation learning, enabling a clearer separation of cross-domain retrieval-relevant and intra-class irrelevant features, which can be recombined into new reconstructed samples. Concurrently, we designed a Dual Alignment Module (DAM), leveraging the accurate and comprehensive semantic features provided by a text encoder pre-trained on large-scale datasets to supplement semantic associations and align disentangled retrieval-relevant features. The Dual Alignment Module enhances the model&#39;s ability to generalize across diverse datasets by effectively aligning retrieval-relevant information from different domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the Sketchy and TU-Berlin datasets. Additionally, more experiments on larger scale dataset QuickDraw, fine-grained datasets, Shoe-V2 and Chair-V2, as well as an inter-dataset further validate the generalization and extensibility of DCDL.},

Research has shown that humans have brain areas that recognize actions that process top-down attentional information, such as the temporoparietal association area. Also, humans have brain regions dedicated to understanding the minds of others and analyzing their intentions, such as the medial prefrontal cortex of the temporal lobe. Skeleton-based action recognition creates mappings for the complex connections between the human skeleton movement patterns and behaviors. Although existing studies encoded meaningful node relationships and synthesized action representations for classification with good results, few of them considered incorporating a priori knowledge to aid potential representation learning for better performance. LA-GCN proposes a graph convolution network using large-scale language models (LLM) knowledge assistance. First, the LLM knowledge is mapped into a priori global relationship (GPR) topology and a priori category relationship (CPR) topology between nodes. The GPR guides the generation of new “bone” representations, aiming to emphasize essential node information from the data level. The CPR mapping simulates category prior knowledge in human brain regions, encoded by the PC-AC module and used to add additional supervision-forcing the model to learn class-distinguishable features. In addition, to improve information transfer efficiency in topology modeling, we propose multi-hop attention graph convolution. It aggregates each node&#39;s k-order neighbor simultaneously to speed up model convergence. LA-GCN reaches state-of-the-art on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA datasets.},

Although transformer-based models have made certain progress recently, the lack of hierarchical feature interaction and insufficient consideration of the importance of features at different network levels lead to semantic ambiguity in image reconstruction. To enhance the visual quality and accuracy of image inpainting, we adopt a multi-level feature fusion approach and propose a novel, efficient hierarchical feature collaboration transformer (HFCT). Our approach comprises two modules: dual stream gated feature fusion (DSGF) and region-separated attention module (RSAM), effectively capturing features at different levels of the network and enhancing inter-level information exchange. The DSGF module uses soft gating to fuse primary and advanced features, strengthening the connection from local to global consistency and reducing artifacts. The RSAM module resolves attention isolation issues in feature fusion through region-separated attention, strengthening the understanding of feature relationships, capturing more image semantics, and improving restoration accuracy. Extensive experiments on the Paris StreetView, CelebA-HQ, and Places2 benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves superior image inpainting quality compared to several state-of-the-art inpainting algorithms.

  abstract     = {The rise of the metaverse has driven the rapid development of various applications, such as Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR). As a form of multimedia in the metaverse, VR video streaming (a.k.a., VR spherical video streaming and $360^{\circ }$ video streaming) can provide users with a $360^{\circ }$ immersive experience. Generally, transmitting VR video requires far more bandwidth than regular videos, which greatly strains existing network transmission. Predicting and selectively streaming VR video in the users&#39; viewports in advance can reduce bandwidth consumption and system latency. However, existing methods either consider only historical viewport-based prediction methods or predict viewports by correlations between visual features of video frames, making it hard to adapt to the dynamics of users and video content. In the meantime, spurious correlations between visual features lead to inaccurate and unreliable prediction results. Hence, we propose an unsupervised multiscale causal representation learning (UMCRL)-based method to predict viewports in VR video streaming, including user preference-based and video content-based viewport prediction models. The former is designed by a position predictor to predict the future users&#39; viewports based on their historical viewports in multiple video frames to adapt to users&#39; dynamic preferences. The latter achieves unsupervised multiscale causal representation learning through an asymmetric causal regressor, used to infer the causalities between local and global-local visual features in video frames, thereby helping the model understand the contextual information in the videos. We embed the causalities in the transformer decoder via causal self-attention for predicting the users&#39; viewports, adapting to the dynamic changes of video content. Finally, combining the results of the two aforementioned models yields the final prediction of the users&#39; viewports. In addition, the QoE of users is satisfied by assigning different bitrates to the tiles in the viewport through a pyramid-based bitrate allocation. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the method.},

  abstract     = {Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction (ECPE) in conversations aims to identify the emotional utterances (even their categories) along with their corresponding causal utterances, which is crucial in understanding the cause-effect relationship in dialogues. While prior studies of ECPE have predominantly focused on purely textual dialogues and neglected the exploration on the natural scenario of the dialogues with multimodal features, i.e., Multimodal Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction (MECPE) in conversations. To attempt this scenario, we propose a Generative approach for Multimodal Emotion-Cause pair extraction (GMEC) with a single stage, thus effectively reducing errors associated with the propagation and accumulation for MECPE. This approach can not only uniformly handle the information of diverse modalities, but also address all emotion and cause analysis tasks uniformly. Additionally, instead of utilizing the fixed commonsense knowledge base as previously, we resort to the Large Language Models (LLMs), which possess a powerful ability to emerge new knowledge, thereby acting as implicit knowledge engines for MECPE. We refer to this approach as enhanced GMEC. Extensive experimental results and detailed analysis demonstrate a notable improvement in the generative approach. Moreover, the integration of external knowledge from LLMs optimizes the efficiency of data utilization, particularly in few-shot scenarios. The integration of the generative model with LLMs has resulted in a cumulative enhancement of 4.94%, 10.90% on MECPE and MECPE-C (with emotion Category).},

  abstract     = {Driven by rising demands in autonomous driving, robotics, etc., 3D object detection has recently achieved great advancement by fusing optical images and LiDAR point data. On the other hand, most existing optical-LiDAR fusion methods straightly overlay RGB images and point clouds without adequately exploiting the synergy between them, leading to suboptimal fusion and 3D detection performance. Additionally, they often suffer from limited localization accuracy without proper balancing of global and local object information. To address this issue, we design a synergistic network (SyNet) that fuses geometric information, semantic information, as well as global and local information of objects for robust and accurate 3D detection. The SyNet captures synergies between optical images and LiDAR point clouds from three perspectives. The first is geometric, which derives high-quality depth by projecting point clouds onto multi-view images, enriching optical RGB images with 3D spatial information for a more accurate interpretation of image semantics. The second is semantic, which voxelizes point clouds and establishes correspondences between the derived voxels and image pixels, enriching 3D point clouds with semantic information for more accurate 3D detection. The third is balancing local and global object information, which introduces deformable self-attention and cross-attention to process the two types of complementary information in parallel for more accurate object localization. Extensive experiments show that SyNet achieves 70.7% mAP and 73.5% NDS on the nuScenes test set, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority as compared with the state-of-the-art.},

To close this gap, a novel VIF method in frequency domain is proposed. First, a frequency-domain feature extraction module is developed for source images. Then, a frequency-domain transformer fusion method is designed to merge the extracted features. Finally, a residual reconstruction module is introduced to obtain final fused images. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that image fusion study is conducted from frequency domain perspective. Comprehensive experiments on three datasets, i.e., MSRS, TNO, and Roadscene, demonstrate that the proposed approach obtains superior fusion performance over several state-of-the-art fusion methods, indicating its great potential as a generic backbone for VIF tasks.},

  abstract     = {Recent mainstream image captioning methods usually adopt two-stage captioners, i.e., calculating the object features of the given image by a pre-trained detector and then feeding them into a language model to generate the descriptive sentences. However, such a two-stage procedure will lead to a task-based information gap that decreases the performance of the captioners, because the object features learned from the detection task are suboptimal representations and cannot provide all the necessary information for subsequent sentence generation. Besides, the object features are usually represented by the last pooling features of the detector that lose the local details of images. In this paper, we propose a novel One-Stage Image Captioner using dynamic multi-sight embedding and alignment, called SeaCap, which directly transforms input images into descriptive sentences in one stage to eliminate the information gap. Specifically, to obtain rich features, we use the Swin Transformer to capture multi-level features, followed by a sights alignment module to alleviate the vision confusion, and then feed them into a novel dynamic multi-sight embedding module to exploit both the global structure and local texture of input images. To enhance the global modeling capacity of the visual encoder, we propose a new dual-dimensional refining module to non-locally model the interaction of the embedded features. As a result, SeaCap can obtain rich and useful information to improve the performance of the captioner. Extensive comparisons on the benchmark MS-COCO, Flickr8K and Flickr30 K datasets verified the superior performance of our method.},

Although the voxel grid approximation provides a continuous representation for dynamic scenes, its volumetric nature requires substantial storage. The compression of MV videos can be interpreted as the compression of dense features. However, the substantial size of these features poses a significant problem relative to the generation of dynamic scenes at arbitrary viewpoints. To address this challenge, this study introduces a hierarchical coded representation of dynamic volumes based on low-rank tensor decomposition of volumetric features and develops effective coding techniques based on this representation. The proposed method employs a two-level coding strategy to capture the temporal characteristics of the decomposed features. At a higher level, spatial features are encoded, representing 3D structural information, with time-invariant components over short intervals of an MV video sequence. At a lower level, temporal features are encoded to capture the dynamics of current scenes. The spatial features are shared in a group, and temporal features are encoded at each time step. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed technique outperforms existing MV video coding standards and current state-of-the-art methods, providing superior rate-distortion performance in the novel view synthesis of MV video compression.},

Since low-light data is limited and difficult to annotate, we focus on image processing to enhance low-light images and improve the performance of any downstream task model, instead of fine-tuning each of the models which can be prohibitively expensive. We propose to improve the existing zero-reference low-light enhancement by leveraging the CLIP model to capture image prior and for semantic guidance. Specifically, we propose a data augmentation strategy to learn an image prior via prompt learning, based on image sampling, to learn the image prior without any need for paired or unpaired normal-light data. Next, we propose a semantic guidance strategy that maximally takes advantage of existing low-light annotation by introducing both content and context cues about the image training patches. We experimentally show, in a qualitative study, that the proposed prior and semantic guidance help to improve the overall image contrast and hue, as well as improve background-foreground discrimination, resulting in reduced over-saturation and noise over-amplification, common in related zero-reference methods. As we target machine cognition, rather than rely on assuming the correlation between human perception and downstream task performance, we conduct and present an ablation study and comparison with related zero-reference methods in terms of task-based performance across many low-light datasets, including image classification, object and face detection, showing the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

To solve the above issues, we propose a novel dual space alignment framework (DSAF) to constrain the modality in two specific spaces. Specifically, for (i), we design a lightweight and plug-and-play modality invariant enhancement (MIE) module to capture fine-grained semantic information and render identity discriminative. This facilitates the establishment of correlations between visible and infrared modalities, enabling the model to learn robust modality-shared features. To tackle (ii), a dual space alignment (DSA) is introduced to conduct the pixel-level alignment in both Euclidean space and Hilbert space. DSA establishes an elastic relationship between these two spaces, remaining invariant knowledge across two spaces. To solve (iii), we propose an adaptive identity-consistent learning (AIL) to discover identity-consistent knowledge between visible and infrared modalities in a dynamic manner.

Recently, prototypical methods, which primarily use single-source or single-target domain prototypes as category centers to aggregate features from both domains, have achieved competitive performance in this task. However, due to large domain shifts, single-source domain prototypes have finite generalization ability and not all source domain knowledge is conducive to model generalization. Single-target domain prototypes are noisy because they are prematurely initialized with all features filtered by pseudo labels, which causes error accumulation in the prototypes. To address these issues, we proposes a covariance-aware cross-domain prototypes method (CACP) to achieve robust domain adaptation. We propose to use both domain prototypes to dynamically rectify pseudo labels in the target domain, effectively reducing the recognition difficulty of hard target domain samples and narrowing the gap between features of the same category in both domains. In addition, to further generalize the model to the target domain, we propose two modules based on covariance correlation, FSPC (Features Selection by Prototypes Covariances) and WSPC (Weighting Source by Prototypes Coefficients), to learn discriminative characteristics. FSPC selects highly correlated features to update target domain prototypes online, denoising and enhancing discriminativeness between categories. WSPC utilizes the correlation coefficients between target domain prototypes and source domain features to weight each point in the source domain, eliminating the information interference from the source domain. In particular, CACP achieves excellent performance on the GTA5 $\to$ Cityscapes and SYNTHIA $\to$ Cityscapes tasks with minimal computational resources and time.},

Firstly, we introduce the physical coding module, which employs a conditional variational autoencoder GAN to learn the distributions of relative temperature information for the objects and environmental state information. Then, the physical information can be obtained by sampling the distribution. When this information is fused with the visible image, it facilitates the generation of diverse TIR images. To ensure authenticity and strengthen the physical constraints across different regions of the image, we introduce a self-attention mechanism in the generator that prioritizes the relative temperature relationships within the image. Additionally, we utilize a local discriminator that focuses on objects with actively changing temperatures and their interactions with the surrounding environment, thereby reducing the discontinuity between the target and the background. Experiments on the Drone Vehicle and AVIID datasets show that our approach outperforms mainstream diversity generation methods in terms of authenticity and diversity.},

In this study, we propose a continual learning framework based on a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) that does not require storing old class data. This framework utilizes parameter-efficient fine-tuning of the VLM&#39;s text encoder for constructing a shared and consistent semantic textual space throughout the continual learning process. The textual priors of visual classes are encoded by the adapted VLM&#39;s text encoder to generate discriminative semantic representations, which are then used to guide the learning of visual classes. Additionally, fake out-of-distribution (OOD) images constructed from each training image further assist in the learning of visual classes. Extensive empirical evaluations on three natural datasets and one medical dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework.

In this paper, we propose a novel network named Completed Interaction Network (CINet) to simultaneously consider the social interactions in all moments, the environmental interactions and the short-term goal of pedestrians in a unified framework for pedestrian trajectory prediction. Specifically, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Transformer Layer (STTL) to fully mine the spatio-temporal information among historical trajectories of all pedestrians in order to obtain the social interactions in all moments. Additionally, we present the Gradual Goal Module (GGM) to capture the environmental interactions under the supervision of the short-term goal, which is beneficial to understanding the intentions of the pedestrian. Afterwards, we employ the cross-attention to effectively integrate the all-moment social and environmental interactions. The experimental results on three standard pedestrian datasets, i.e., ETH/UCY, SDD and inD demonstrate that our method achieves a new state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, the visualization results indicate that our method could predict trajectories more reasonably in complex scenarios such as sharp turns, infeasible areas and so on.},

Existing methods typically assume that each training image is accurately depicted by its textual descriptions. However, textual descriptions can be ambiguous and fail to depict discriminative visual details in images, leading to inaccurate representation learning. To alleviate the effects of text ambiguity, we propose a Multi-Modal Reference learning framework to learn robust representations. We first propose a multi-modal reference construction module to aggregate all visual and textual details of the same object into a comprehensive multi-modal reference. The multi-modal reference hence facilitates the subsequent representation learning and retrieval similarity computation. Specifically, a reference-guided representation learning module is proposed to use multi-modal references to learn more accurate visual and textual representations. Additionally, we introduce a reference-based refinement method that employs the object references to compute a reference-based similarity that refines the initial retrieval results.

  abstract     = {Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) plays a crucial role in multimedia applications due to its effectiveness in analyzing graph-structured data. Existing GCL methods focus on maximizing the agreement of node representations across different augmentations, which leads to the neglect of unique and complementary information in each augmentation. In this paper, we propose a fusion-based GCL model (FB-GCL) that learns fused representations to effectively capture complementary information from both the graph structure and node attributes. Our model consists of two modules: a graph fusion encoder and a graph contrastive module. The graph fusion encoder adaptively fuses the representations learned from the topology graph and the attribute graph. The graph contrastive module extracts supervision signals from the raw graph by leveraging both the pairwise relationships within the graph structure and the multi-label information from the attributes. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that FB-GCL enhances performance in node classification and link prediction tasks. This improvement is especially valuable for multimedia data analysis, as integrating graph structure and attribute information is crucial for effectively understanding and processing complex datasets.},

Therefore, in this paper, we utilize the more challenging image-level annotations and propose an adaptive frequency-aware network (AFANet) for weakly-supervised few-shot semantic segmentation (WFSS). Specifically, we first propose a cross-granularity frequency-aware module (CFM) that decouples RGB images into high-frequency and low-frequency distributions and further optimizes semantic structural information by realigning them. Unlike most existing WFSS methods using the textual information from the multi-modal language-vision model, e.g., CLIP, in an offline learning manner, we further propose a CLIP-guided spatial-adapter module (CSM), which performs spatial domain adaptive transformation on textual information through online learning, thus providing enriched cross-modal semantic information for CFM.

  abstract     = {Learning-based Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models have obtained impressive performance with the help of reliable subjective quality labels, where Mean Opinion Score (MOS) is the most popular choice. However, in view of the subjective bias of individual annotators, the Labor-Abundant MOS (LA-MOS) typically requires large collections of opinion scores from multiple annotators for each image, which significantly increases the learning cost. In this paper, we aim to learn robust IQA models from Low-Cost MOS (LC-MOS), which only requires very few opinion scores or even a single opinion score for each image. More specifically, we consider the LC-MOS as the noisy observation of LA-MOS and enforce the IQA model learned from LC-MOS to approach the unbiased estimation of LA-MOS. Thus, we represent the subjective bias between LC-MOS and LA-MOS, and the model bias between IQA predictions learned from LC-MOS and LA-MOS (i.e., dual-bias) as two latent variables with unknown parameters. By means of the expectation-maximization-based alternating optimization, we can jointly estimate the parameters of the dual-bias, which suppresses the misleading of LC-MOS via a gated dual-bias calibration (GDBC) module. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first exploration of robust IQA model learning from noisy low-cost labels. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on four popular IQA datasets show that the proposed method is robust toward different bias rates and annotation numbers and significantly outperforms the other Learning-based IQA models when only LC-MOS is available. Furthermore, we also achieve comparable performance with respect to the other models learned with LA-MOS.},

Common challenges in EEG-based BCIs include performance discrepancies, often requiring frequent recalibration of decoding algorithms. The objective of this study was enhancing BCI decoding performance of upper-limb MI identification by exploiting both machine and subjects learning and maintaining stable decoding algorithms. Significant performance improvements were observed across most subjects from the first to the last session of the experiment. Some subjects also demonstrated stable performance without requiring any model recalibration between sessions. All subjects achieved high efficacy in online decoding of movement intention, as reflected in improvement of the F1 score from 0.5810.26 in the first session, to 0.84±0.13 in the final session. We emphasize the critical importance of allowing users sufficient time to improve their performance in BCIs for upper-limb MI decoding.

  abstract     = {The emotion–cause pair extraction (ECPE) task is to simultaneously extract emotions and causes as pairs (EC-pairs) from documents, which is important for natural language processing. Previous research tackled this task via a two-step approach, which first predicts separately the emotion and cause clauses, and then pairs them up by using a binary classifier. However, such a two-step approach may suffer from the possible propagation of errors, and it neglects the interaction between emotions and causes. In this article, an end-to-end double-graph method with relational enhancement (DGRE) is proposed to stimulate two relationship modes among clauses, i.e., semantic dependence and logical dependence. First, two united graph encoders are established to embed the semantic dependence into the representation of clauses and pairs. The first encoder is built on graph attention networks (GATs) for clause-level representation, the result of which is used by a relational graph convolutional network (RGCN) for the refinement of pair-level representation. Aiming to enhance the fitting ability of logical dependence, the emotion-type classification task is introduced into the multitask learning framework of GATs, which can effectively distinguish the logical relations between clauses according to their emotion types. Moreover, seven types of dependence relations have been designed for the node connections in RGCN, which emphasize the contextual interaction and clustering among neighboring nodes. Experiments on a benchmark Chinese corpus demonstrate that the proposed DGRE approach could effectively establish the communication mechanism between clauses and pairs from multiple perspectives, and comparisons with state-of-the-art (SOTA) models well validate its effectiveness.},

Some works intuitively merge graph neural networks (GNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to capture structural and temporal information, and recent works propose to aggregate information from neighbor nodes in local subgraphs based on message passing or random walks. These methods produce node embeddings from a global or local perspective and ignore the complementarity between them, thus facing limitations in capturing complex and entangled dynamic patterns when applied to diverse datasets or evaluated by more challenging evaluation protocols. To address the issues, we propose the global and local embedding network (GLEN) for effective and efficient temporal graph representation learning. Specifically, GLEN dynamically generates embeddings for graph nodes by considering both global and local perspectives using specially designed modules. Then, global and local embeddings are combined by a devised cross-perspective fusion module to extract high-order semantic relations of node embeddings. We evaluate GLEN on multiple real-world datasets and apply more stringent evaluation procedures. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that GLEN outperforms other baselines in both link prediction and dynamic node classification tasks. Moreover, with concise and effective modules, GLEN can achieve a better balance between inference precision and training efficiency.},

The state-of-the-art methods usually formulate PU learning as a cost-sensitive learning problem, in which every unlabeled example is treated as negative with modified class weights. However, existing methods fail to generate high-quality data representations, which brings about negative-prediction preference and performance decline. To overcome this problem, this article proposes a novel algorithm dubbed weighted contrastive learning with hard negative mining for positive and unlabeled learning (termed WConPU), which specifically designs a new prototypical contrastive strategy for gaining discriminative representations for PU learning. Specifically, our proposed WConPU consists of a contrastive learning (CL) module and a classifier training module, which can benefit from each other in an iterative manner. Moreover, a novel weighted contrastive objective function equipped with a prototype-based hard negative mining module is proposed to further enhance the representation quality. Theoretically, we show that our WConPU can be justified from the perspective of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Empirically, we compare our method with state-of-the-art PU algorithms on a wide range of real-world benchmark datasets, and the experimental results firmly demonstrate the advantage of our proposed method over the existing PU learning approaches.},

Generally, they concatenate the features of each view and employ a single GNN to extract the representations of this concatenated feature. It causes that the within-view information may not be learned and the pivotal view will not be strengthened during the concatenation. Although some GNN models introduce the Siamese structure to extract the within-view information, the learned representation may not be informative since the Siamese GNNs share the same parameters. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel deep graph auto-encoder for multi-view representation learning. Among them, a self-augmented view-weight technique is theoretically devised for cross-view fusion, which can highlight the pivotal views and maintain the rest views. Then, GNNs of different views can learn the informative representation without sharing parameters. Furthermore, by fitting the fusion distribution with a neural layer, the model unifies these two individual procedures and achieve to extract the fusion representation end-to-end.

The ability of handling NL-DG is realized by shifting the gradient penalty base from the dummy classifier to the entire model. EIRM is shown to be closely related to locating a flat minimum, which is crucial for label noise (LN) robustness and model generalization. Explorations on function smoothness and algorithm convergence are offered to understand EIRM from the theoretical aspect. An efficient implementation of EIRM is also developed to construct the fault diagnosis model. The EIRM-based fault diagnosis method is compared with strong benchmarks on multiple NL-DG tasks using actuator and gearbox fault datasets.

One is the batch-oriented dictionary for frequency-domain transform, and the other one is the instance-specific on-grid frequency and off-grid bias. As the dictionary is required to be universally applicable among all observed signals, network layers are designed and network weights are updated to approximate the transform bases in a data-driven way. Besides, instance-specific on-grid frequencies and off-grid biases are solved by unfolding the iterative soft-threshold algorithm (ISTA). In addition, the instance-specific hyperparameters for sparsity in ISTA are obtained by an encoder–decoder soft-threshold (EDS) module with the attention mechanism. In this way, the dictionary, on-grid frequency, and off-grid bias are learned in a unified data-driven framework. Numerical experiments show that the OGFreq obtains 4% lower false negative rate (FNR) when the SNR is 20 dB. Moreover, the computational complexity is one order of magnitude lower than the iteration-based off-grid frequency estimation methods. Finally, the robustness of the OGFreq is discussed when extended to the impulse noise and damped signals.},

The representative key points are iteratively estimated spatially and in the feature space to capture the fine-grained semantics and cover the full object extent. Hierarchical AttentionShift is performed at instance, part, and fine-grained levels, optimizing object semantics while promoting the conventional self-attention activation to hierarchical activation with local refinement. Experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 Aug and MS-COCO 2017 benchmarks show that hierarchical AttentionShift improves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method by 10.4% and 7.0% upon mean average precision (mAP)50, respectively. When applying hierarchical AttentionShift to the segment anything model (SAM), 9.4% AP improvement on the COCO test-dev is achieved.

This framework employs a global-level contrastive learning to align multimodal semantic features and a Top-K rank-based mask strategy to construct positive–negative pairs, thereby learning a finer grained multimodal interaction representation.

Compared with the RBF NN using neuron fixed evenly spaced strategy (NFES), the improved RBF NN has two major advantages: one is to extremely reduce the number of neurons, especially for the high dimensional NN inputs; and the other is to provide a theoretical criteria for the choice of NN structure parameters including the neuron center and the compact set size. To guarantee the dynamic learning ability of the improved RBF NN, the persistent excitation (PE) is verified strictly by subtly constructing the threshold and the center of newly added neurons. Simulation and experimental results illustrate that the improved RBF NN integrated into the existing dynamic learning control effectively enhances the transient control performance, reduces the computational burden, and saves data storage space.},

  abstract     = {The deep random vector functional link (dRVFL) and ensemble dRVFL (edRVFL) succeed in various tasks and achieve state-of-the-art performance compared with other randomized neural networks (NNs). However, existing edRVFL structures need more diversity and error correction ability in an independent network. Our work fills the gap by combining stacked deep blocks and residual learning with the edRVFL. Subsequently, we propose a novel dRVFL combined with residual learning, ResdRVFL, whose deep layers calibrate the wrong estimations from shallow layers. Additionally, we propose incorporating a scaling parameter to control the scaling of residuals from shallow layers, thus mitigating the risk of overfitting. Finally, we present an ensemble deep stacking network, SResdRVFL, based on ResdRVFL. SResdRVFL aggregates multiple blocks into a cohesive network, leveraging the benefits of deep learning and ensemble learning. We evaluate the proposed model on 28 datasets and compare it with the state-of-the-art methods. The comparative study demonstrates that the SResdRVFL is the best-performing approach in terms of average ranking and errors based on 28 datasets.},

Data users have been endowed with the “right to be forgotten” (RTBF) of their data. In the course of machine learning (ML), the forgotten right requires a model provider to delete user data and its subsequent impact on ML models upon user requests. Machine unlearning (MU) emerges to address this, which has garnered ever-increasing attention from both industry and academia. Specifically, MU allows model providers to eliminate the influence of unlearned data without retraining the model from scratch, ensuring the model behaves as if it never encountered this data. While the area has developed rapidly, there is a lack of comprehensive surveys to capture the latest advancements. Recognizing this shortage, we conduct an extensive exploration to map the landscape of MU including the (fine-grained) taxonomy of unlearning algorithms under centralized and distributed settings, debate on approximate unlearning, verification and evaluation metrics, and challenges and solutions across various applications. We also focus on the motivations, challenges, and specific methods for deploying unlearning in large language models (LLMs), as well as the potential attacks targeting unlearning processes. The survey concludes by outlining potential directions for future research, hoping to serve as a beacon for interested scholars.},

Notably, Transformers have been extensively investigated for long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) due to their remarkable ability on modeling sequential data. However, the point-wise calculation of its self-attention leads to a challenging task for accurately capturing real-world time series’ local and global characteristics, especially with multiple seasonal periodic components and outliers. In this article, we leverage wavelet analysis to recognize different frequency patterns and design an effective attention mechanism for time series forecasting to address this issue. In detail, we employ the maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT) to construct a novel wavelet attention (WA) mechanism and propose the wavelet transformer (Waveformer) prediction technique. This approach effectively extracts multiple periodic features, mitigates the influence of anomalies and improves the precision of time series prediction under seasonal-trend decomposition methods. Experimental evaluations on six real-world datasets from various application fields demonstrate that the multiple periodic decomposition strategy of Waveformer successfully captures time series seasonal patterns and improves forecasting performance in comparison with many state-of-art methods.},

The issue of non-commutativity within quaternion is circumvented by utilizing the real representation.

Incorrect labels are a common and challenging issue in complex hierarchical data. However, the existing hierarchical methods often struggle to dynamically adapt to label noise and lack the flexibility to adjust sample weights. Therefore, their effectiveness in managing complex data with many classes and mitigating label noise is significantly limited. To address these issues, in this article, an adaptive sample weighting-based progressive hierarchical feature selection (PHFS) method was proposed, which dynamically adjusts the sample weights to focus on high-quality data. PHFS integrates progressive sample selection and hierarchical feature selection into a unified framework, thus enhancing its effectiveness in reducing the impact of label noise and achieving optimal performance. The progressive selection process is divided into initial and subsequent stages, focusing on correct and incorrect samples. In the initial stage, PHFS selects valuable and correct samples based on the adaptive weights calculated through hierarchical classification feedback, maximizing the guiding effect of the correctly labeled examples. In the subsequent stages, PHFS uses matrix factorization to preserve the structure of the correctly labeled samples, preventing the forgetting of the early selected samples and minimizing the negative impact of the mislabelled samples. The superiority of PHFS over 13 state-of-the-art methods was demonstrated by performing extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets, highlighting its effectiveness in reducing label noise and achieving optimal performance.},

In this article, we propose ${\underline{\text{u}}}$nsupervised ${\underline{\text{d}}}$omain-${\underline{\text{a}}}$daptive vehicle-to-everything ${\underline{\text{c}}}$ollaboration framework dubbed CUDA-X, which is built on top of a de facto collective model with key-point information exchange and instance adaptation. Specifically, collaborative knowledge transfer (CKT) is responsible for domain-agnostic feature reconstruction from nearby car or infrastructure by spatial–channel pooling operation in an elementwise manner. To promote the candidate alignment, a brand-new bin-based location correction (BLC) provides an auxiliary supervision for cross-dataset box refinement via residual coordinate encoding (RCE), and category-aware pooling alignment (CPA) is further designed for pulling the category-specific instance closer between source and target samples. We benchmark CUDA-X against the counterparts on four prevalent cooperative perception datasets, i.e., OPV2V, V2X-Sim, V2V4Real, and DAIR-V2X: it establishes the new state-of-the-art vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) performances regardless of simulation or reality. We expect that this appealing attempt would provide an in-depth insight into domain generalization in the context of multiagent perception, and the code is publicly available soon.},

Subsequently, an adaptive BC scheme under boundary measurements is proposed, where the control gain is regulated effectively. Next, based on the inequality techniques and Lyapunov direct approach, the delay-dependent synchronization conditions are gained and some linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) based theorems are given.

  abstract     = {The detecting arbitrary shape text is a challenging task due to the significant variation in text shape, size, and aspect ratio, as well as the complexity of scene backgrounds. The enhancing feature extraction capabilities is essential for the boosting text detection accuracy. However, traditional text feature extraction methods face several issues, including insufficient multiscale feature fusion, limited information transfer between different feature levels, and constrained receptive field expansion when using asymmetric convolutional kernels for long text detection. To address these challenges, this article introduces an arbitrarily shaped scene text detector called the semantic-information space sharing interaction network (S3INet). The proposed network leverages the semantic-information space sharing module (S3M) to generate a single-level feature map capable of capturing multiscale features with rich semantic information and prominent foreground elements. In addition, we propose the multibranch parallel asymmetric convolutional module (MPACM) group to enhance the representation of text features, thereby further enhancing text detection performance. Extensive experimental evaluations on five publicly available natural scene text datasets (CTW-1500, Total-Text, MSRA-TD500, ICDAR2015, and ICDAR2017-MLT) and two traffic text datasets (CTST-1600 and TPD) demonstrate the superiority of our method.

Subsequently, numerous samples are directly input to the edge predictor, obtaining the generated distance matrix and enabling fast KNNG construction. Compared to the traditional KNNG construction method, this approach outputs directly without calculating the distance matrix, significantly reducing the computational burden. The experimental results show that the performance of the proposed method is as well as existing graph data-driven methods.

Yet they neglect the underlying intermediate motions between captured frames, which comprise the temporal-interim poses lost in the video. In this article, we introduce a novel framework, temporal-interim pose synthesis and distillation, to produce and leverage the intermediate motion information for dynamic motion establishment. The pose synthesis yields the visual feature maps of the intermediate poses, which appear between the existing video frames. It allows the synthesized and current poses to form richer motion patterns. Next, the pose distillation divides the body parts into several groups, where it learns the specific part-wise relationship within each group. It degrades the complexity of learning useful part-wise relationships from rich motion patterns and extracts more detailed motion information for fine-grained part groups.

By using NCMI to evaluate popular DNNs pretrained over CIFAR-100 and ImageNet in the literature, it is shown that their validation accuracies are more or less inversely proportional to their NCMI values. Based on this observation, the standard deep learning (DL) framework is further modified to minimize the standard cross entropy (CE) function subject to an NCMI constraint, yielding CMI constrained DL (CMIC-DL). A novel alternating learning algorithm is proposed to solve such a constrained optimization problem. Extensive experimental results show that DNNs trained within CMIC-DL outperform the state-of-the-art models trained within the standard DL and other loss functions in the literature in terms of both accuracy and robustness against adversarial attacks. In addition, visualizing the evolution of the learning process through the lens of CMI and NCMI is also advocated.},

  abstract     = {When using a synapse as a coupler to connect neurons, parameter-based synchronization transitions have been investigated. However, the dependence on initial conditions has not been comprehensively discussed in the literature. This work presents an electrical-synapse-coupled model consisting of two homogeneous Hopfield neural networks (HNNs), which is the simplest network-to-network coupling model known for HNN. The model possesses several fixed points, which are found to be unstable. Simulation results of peak differences, bifurcation diagrams, and normalized mean synchronization errors indicate that complex synchronization transitions occur, depending on both the electrical coupling strength and initial conditions. Particularly, we focus here on mapping the basins of attraction between periodic and chaotic synchronization for bistable patterns. Finally, a multiplierless electrical neuron circuit is developed to validate initial condition-induced synchronization phenomena, which provides a new perspective for the study of collective dynamics of brain-like networks and the development of lightweight neuromorphic circuits.},

  abstract     = {Prosody plays a fundamental role in human speech and communication, facilitating intelligibility and conveying emotional and cognitive states. Extracting accurate prosodic information from speech is vital for building assistive technology, such as controllable speech synthesis, speaking style transfer, and speech emotion recognition (SER). However, it is challenging to disentangle speaker-independent prosody representations since prosodic attributes, such as intonation, excessively entangle with speaker-specific attributes, e.g., pitch. In this article, we propose a novel model, called Diffsody, to disentangle and refine prosody representations: 1) to disentangle prosody representations, we leverage the expressive generative ability of a diffusion model by conditioning it on quantified semantic information and pretrained speaker embeddings. Additionally, a prosody encoder automatically learns prosody representations used for spectrogram reconstruction in an unsupervised fashion; and 2) to refine and learn speaker-invariant prosody representations, a scheduled gradient reversal layer (sGRL) is proposed and integrated into the prosody encoder of Diffsody. We extensively evaluate Diffsody through qualitative and quantitative means. t-SNE visualization and speaker verification experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the sGRL method in preventing speaker-specific information leakage. Experimental results on speaker-independent SER and automatic depression detection (ADD) tasks demonstrate that Diffsody can efficiently factorize speaker-independent prosody representations, resulting in a significant boost in SER and ADD. In addition, Diffsody synergistically integrates with the semantic representation model WavLM, which leads to a discernibly elevated performance, outperforming contemporary methods in both SER and ADD tasks. Furthermore, the Diffsody model exhibits promising potential for various practical applications, such as voice or style conversion. Some audio samples can be found on our https://leyuanqu.github.io/Diffsody/demo website.},

However, data fusion methods simply concatenating features or images barely consider the correlations or complementarities among different modalities and easily suffer from exponential growth in dimensions and computational complexity when the modality increases. Consequently, this article proposes a subspace fusion network with tensor decomposition (TD) to heighten multimodal medical image classification. We first introduce a Tucker low-rank TD module to map the high-level dimensional tensor to the low-rank subspace, reducing the redundancy caused by multimodal data and high-dimensional features. Then, a cross-tensor attention mechanism is utilized to fuse features from the subspace into a high-dimension tensor, enhancing the representation ability of extracted features and constructing the interaction information among components in the subspace. Extensive comparison experiments with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods are conducted on one self-established and three public multimodal medical image datasets, verifying the effectiveness and generalization ability of the proposed method.

  abstract     = {Adjusting the latency, power, and accuracy of natural language understanding models is a desirable objective of an efficient architecture. This article proposes an efficient Transformer architecture that adjusts the inference computational cost adaptively with a desired inference latency speedup. In the fine-tuning phase, the proposed method detects less important hidden sequence elements (word-vectors) and eliminates them in each encoder layer using a proposed attention context contribution (ACC) metric. After the fine-tuning phase, with the novel offline-tuning property, the inference latency of the model can be adjusted in a wide range of inference speedup selections without any further training. Extensive experiments reveal that most word-vectors in higher Transformer layers contribute less to subsequent layers, allowing their removal to improve inference latency. Experimental results on various language understanding, text generation, and instruction tuning tasks and benchmarks demonstrate the approach’s effectiveness across diverse datasets, with minimal impact on the input’s global context. The technique improves the time-to-first-token (TTFT) of Llama3 by up to 2.9×, with a minor performance drop. The suggested approach posits that in large language models (LLMs), although the complete network is necessary for training, it can be truncated during the fine-tuning phase.},

  abstract     = {Since the recognition in the early 1990s of the vanishing/exploding (V/E) gradient issue plaguing the training of neural networks (NNs), significant efforts have been exerted to overcome this obstacle. However, a clear solution to the V/E issue remained elusive so far. The pursuit of approximate dynamical isometry, i.e., parameter configurations where the singular values of the input–output Jacobian (IOJ) are tightly distributed around 1, leads to the derivation of an NN’s architecture that shares common traits with the popular residual network (ResNet) model. Instead of skipping connections between layers, the idea is to filter the previous activations orthogonally and add them to the nonlinear activations of the next layer, realizing a convex combination between them. Remarkably, the impossibility of the gradient updates to either vanish or explode is demonstrated with analytical bounds that hold even in the infinite depth case. The effectiveness of this method is empirically proved by means of training via backpropagation an extremely deep multilayer perceptron (MLP) of 50k layers, and an Elman NN to learn long-term dependencies in the input of 10k time steps in the past. Compared with other architectures specifically devised to deal with the V/E problem, e.g., LSTMs, the proposed model is way simpler yet more effective. Surprisingly, a single-layer vanilla recurrent NN (RNN) can be enhanced to reach state-of-the-art performance, while converging super fast; for instance, on the psMNIST task, it is possible to get test accuracy of over 94% in the first epoch, and over 98% after just ten epochs.},

Outsourcing model training and data hosting to third-party platforms has become a standard method for reducing costs. In such a situation, the attacker can manipulate the training process or data to inject a backdoor into models. Backdoor attacks are a serious threat where malicious behavior is activated when triggers are present; otherwise, the model operates normally. However, there is still no systematic and comprehensive review of LMs from the attacker’s capabilities and purposes on different backdoor attack surfaces. Moreover, there is a shortage of analysis and comparison of the diverse emerging backdoor countermeasures. Therefore, this work aims to provide the natural language processing (NLP) community with a timely review of backdoor attacks and countermeasures. According to the attackers’ capability and affected stage of the LMs, the attack surfaces are formalized into four categorizations: attacking the pretrained model with fine-tuning (APMF) or parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), attacking the final model with training (AFMT), and attacking large language model (ALLM). Thus, attacks under each categorization are combed. The countermeasures are categorized into two general classes: sample inspection and model inspection. Thus, we review countermeasures and analyze their advantages and disadvantages. Also, we summarize the benchmark datasets and provide comparable evaluations for representative attacks and defenses. Drawing the insights from the review, we point out the crucial areas for future research on the backdoor, especially soliciting more efficient and practical countermeasures.},

However, while most GNN-based methods focus on learning node representations in static graphs, they often ignore the dynamic nature of real-world networks, limiting their applicability. Furthermore, existing dynamic representation learning methods using Hawkes point processes, while capable of modeling event sequences, are inherently transductive and tailored to specific scenarios with dual timescales and mixed event types, thus not fully generalizable. To bridge this gap, we introduce DNRHP, a novel framework for learning temporal network representations. Specifically, DNRHP integrates historical edge (HE) information with the network’s evolutionary properties, using the Hawkes point process to model edge formation. It captures not only the influence of past events on the likelihood of future connections but also the impact of the structural evolution of the network. The novelty of our model lies in its comprehensive consideration of the dynamics of network evolution and historical connectivity, allowing for a more accurate representation of nodes and their interactions over time. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world networks demonstrate the effectiveness of DNRHP, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accuracy and efficiency for tasks such as node classification and link prediction.},

However, partial observability poses a significant challenge by hindering efficient task inference from agents’ limited local experiences. To address this, we propose MG2L, a novel algorithm featuring a global-to-local (G2L) training scheme based on mutual information optimization (MIO). We first extend the centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) framework to MAMRL, and introduce a multilevel task encoder for joint global and local task inference. Building on this encoder, the MG2L scheme employs tailored loss functions to optimize task representations. For global inference, the MAS learns a centralized global representation by maximizing the MI between the representation and the task context. For local inference, we formulate conditional MI reduction to quantify the G2L gap. Agents then learn the local representation by minimizing this reduction. The MG2L scheme effectively harmonizes centralized training with decentralized execution, offering a versatile solution for MAMRL challenges. Additionally, we integrate a permutation-invariant attention (PIA) module into the task encoder to reduce sensitivity to behavior policy variations. Extensive experiments—including comparative analyses, ablation studies, meta-test evaluations, and visualizations—demonstrate MG2L’s effectiveness.

  abstract     = {The exponential growth in model sizes has significantly increased the communication burden in federated learning (FL). Existing methods to alleviate this burden by transmitting compressed gradients often face high compression errors, which slow down the model’s convergence. To simultaneously achieve high compression effectiveness and lower compression errors, we study the gradient compression problem from a novel perspective. Specifically, we propose a systematical algorithm termed extended single-step synthetic features compressing (E-3SFC), which consists of three subcomponents, i.e., the single-step synthetic features compressor (3SFC), a double-way compression (DWC) algorithm, and a communication budget scheduler (BS). First, we regard the process of gradient computation of a model as decompressing gradients from corresponding inputs, while the inverse process is considered as compressing the gradients. Based on this, we introduce a novel gradient compression method termed 3SFC, which utilizes the model itself as a decompressor, leveraging training priors such as model weights and objective functions. The 3SFC compresses raw gradients into tiny synthetic features in a single-step simulation, incorporating error feedback (EF) to minimize overall compression errors. To further reduce communication overhead, 3SFC is extended to E-3SFC, allowing DWC and dynamic communication budget scheduling. Our theoretical analysis under both strongly convex and nonconvex conditions demonstrates that 3SFC achieves linear and sublinear convergence rates with aggregation noise. Extensive experiments across six datasets and six models reveal that 3SFC outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by up to 13.4% while reducing communication costs by 111.6 times. These findings suggest that 3SFC can significantly enhance communication efficiency in FL without compromising model performance.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge distillation (KD) improves the performance of a compact student network by transferring learned knowledge from a cumbersome teacher network. In the existing approaches, the multiscale feature knowledge is transferred via densely connected paths, which increases the optimization difficulty. Moreover, correlations among the labels are neglected despite their capability to enhance the intraclass similarity of samples. To solve these issues, we propose cascade fusion and correlation enhancement for KD (CC-KD). The multiscale feature knowledge is transferred via much simpler paths, which are constructed by fusing features of different scales with cross-scale attention (CSA) in a cascade manner, thereby reducing the optimization difficulty. On the other hand, the relational knowledge of teacher logits is further enhanced by correlations of the corresponding labels, so that the student can produce more similar logits for the samples in the same category. Extensive experimental results on five public datasets (i.e., CIFAR100/10, ImageNet, RAF-DB, and FERPlus) indicate superior performance of the proposed method over several state-of-the-arts (SOTAs). More specifically, our method obtains an accuracy of 71.70% on ImageNet and achieves a new record of 90.20% on RAF-DB with fewer calculations and parameters.},

However, the high computational complexity and two successive steps have limited SC’s development. In addition, the traditional SC is formulated to maximize the arithmetic mean of trace ratios which is dominated by the larger objectives and may reduce the recognition accuracy in practical applications. In this article, we propose a novel graph cut criterion to minimize the trace ratios of harmonic mean with objectives, which can avoid the worst-cluster issue without imposing any regularization or constraints. Furthermore, an efficient and effective coordinate descent (CD) method is exploited to achieve a one-step solution. Therefore, this article can simultaneously solve three main challenges in a unified framework. Extensive experiments verify that the harmonic fast one-step graph cut (HFOC) achieves superior clustering performance with relatively less time-consuming compared to the other state-of-the-art clustering methods.},

  abstract     = {The risk prediction of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is crucial for its early prevention and treatment. However, current risk prediction methods face challenges in effectively extracting and fusing multiomics features, particularly overlooking the multilevel evolutionary mechanisms of AD. This article combines biomedical large foundation models with the conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) to mine the evolutionary patterns of AD by considering the regulatory effect of genes on brain lesions. Specifically, we first use biomedical large foundation models to effectively construct high-quality imaging genetic features. Next, a conditional probabilistic state transition mathematical model is constructed to describe AD progression as state transitions of brain regions under genetic regulations. Based on the mathematical model, a conditional probabilistic state transition GAN (CPST-GAN) is proposed. This algorithm can mine the dynamic evolutionary patterns of AD by fusing brain imaging and genetic features to achieve risk prediction of AD. Finally, experiments on the public imaging genetics datasets validate the effectiveness and superiority of CPST-GAN in evolutionary pattern mining and risk prediction of AD. This article not only provides a reliable intelligence algorithm for early intervention of AD but also offers new insights for future research on AD pathogenesis.

  abstract     = {In this article, we attempt to study a problem of identifying outliers from multiple dimensions, terming it as multidimensional anomaly detection. This task assumes that each sample corresponds to heterogeneous discriminative spaces, where each space characterizes distinct semantic information along one dimension. Consequently, the abnormalities exhibited by a sample will vary under these semantically different dimensions. In contrast to traditional anomaly detection, multidimensional anomaly detection offers a more holistic assessment of a sample’s abnormalities. However, the heterogeneity of discriminative spaces leads to incomparability of the outputs from different dimensions which is the major difficulty in designing multidimensional anomaly detection methods. This article introduces a novel model, maximum margin multidimensional anomaly detection (ALOE), specifically tailored for multidimensional anomaly detection. ALOE constructs a convex optimization problem with nonlinear constraints. The primary objective is to simultaneously learn multiple decision boundaries, utilizing the maximum margin principle and covariance regularization, while distinguishing between outliers and normal samples under multiple dimensions by capturing the correlation among multiple dimensions. To obtain the optimal decision boundary under each dimension, we devise an alternating optimization method for this convex optimization problem. To validate the effectiveness of ALOE, we conduct extensive experiments on 12 real-world datasets, comparing its performance against 34 anomaly detection methods. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of ALOE.},

  abstract     = {Time series forecasting (TSF) is an essential branch of machine learning with various applications. Most methods for TSF focus on constructing different networks to extract better information and improve performance. However, practical application data contain different internal mechanisms, resulting in a mixture of multiple patterns. That is, the model’s ability to fit different patterns is different and generates different errors. In order to solve this problem, we propose an end-to-end framework, namely probability pattern-guided time series forecasting (PPGF). PPGF reformulates the TSF problem as a forecasting task guided by probabilistic pattern classification. First, we propose the grouping strategy to approach forecasting problems as classification and alleviate the impact of data imbalance on classification. Second, we predict the corresponding class interval to guarantee the consistency of classification and forecasting. In addition, true class probability (TCP) is introduced to pay more attention to the difficult samples to improve the classification accuracy. Detailedly, PPGF classifies the different patterns to determine which one the target value may belong to and estimates it accurately in the corresponding interval. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets, and PPGF achieves significant performance improvements over several baseline methods. Furthermore, the effectiveness of TCP and the necessity of consistency between classification and forecasting are proved in the experiments.

However, cross-task feature interactions of current methods are still suffering from incomplete levels of representations, less discriminative semantics in feature participants, and inefficient pair-wise task interaction processes. To tackle these under-explored issues, we propose a novel BridgeNet framework, which extracts comprehensive and discriminative intermediate Bridge Features, and conducts interactions based on them. Specifically, a Task Pattern Propagation (TPP) module is first applied to ensure highly semantic task-specific feature participants are prepared for subsequent interactions, and a Bridge Feature Extractor (BFE) is specially designed to selectively integrate both high-level and low-level representations to generate the comprehensive bridge features. Then, instead of conducting heavy pair-wise cross-task interactions, a Task-Feature Refiner (TFR) is developed to efficiently take guidance from bridge features and form final task predictions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work considering the completeness and quality of feature participants in cross-task interactions. Extensive experiments are conducted on NYUD-v2, Cityscapes and PASCAL Context benchmarks, and the superior performance shows the proposed architecture is effective and powerful in promoting different dense prediction tasks simultaneously.},

Recent works show that the attention mechanism inside Transformer may not be necessary, and Transformer alternatives such as convolutional neural networks, multi-layer perceptron, and state space model have also been investigated. Transformer-based models have two main limitations: Firstly, they have quadratic time complexity due to the full attention mechanism, which leads to high computational costs. Secondly, they rely on representation of a special token such as [CLS] to encode entire text, which limits its sentence-level expressiveness. In this paper, we consider a graph recurrent network with linear time complexity for language model pre-training, which builds a graph structure for each sequence with local token-level communications, together with a sentence-level representation detached from other normal tokens. On both English and Chinese text understanding tasks, our model can achieve comparable performance to existing pre-trained models while also achieving higher inference efficiency. Furthermore, we discovered that the representations generated by our model are more diverse and uniform compared to that of Transformer, which alleviates the problems in existing pre-trained models such as representation degradation.},

  abstract     = {Matching suitable jobs provided by employers with qualified candidates is a crucial task for online recruitment. Typically, candidates and employers have specific expectations in recruitment market, leading them to prefer similar jobs and candidates, respectively. Metric learning provides a promising way to capture the similarity propagation between candidates and jobs. However, existing metric learning technologies rely on symmetric distance measures, which fail to model the asymmetric relationships of bilateral users (i.e., candidates and employers) in the two-way selective process of recruitment scenarios. In addition, the behavior of users (e.g., candidates) is highly affected by the actions and feedback of their counterparts (e.g., employers). These effects can hardly be captured by the existing person-job fit methods which primarily explore homogeneous and undirected graphs. To address these problems, we propose a quasi-metric learning framework to capture the similarity propagation between candidates and jobs while modeling their asymmetric relations for bilateral person-job fit. Specifically, we propose a quasi-metric space that not only satisfies the triangle inequality rule to capture the fine-grained similarity between candidates and jobs, but also incorporates a tailored asymmetric measure to model the two-way selection process of bilateral users in online recruitment. More importantly, the proposed quasi-metric learning framework can theoretically model recruitment rules from similarity and competitiveness perspectives, making it seamlessly align with bilateral person-job fit scenarios. To explore the mutual effects of two-sided users on each other, we first organize candidates, employers, and their different-typed interactions into a heterogeneous relation graph, and then propose a relation-aware graph convolution network to capture the mutual effects of users with their bilateral behaviors. Extensive experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed quasi-metric learning framework and bilateral person-job fit model.},

  abstract     = {In embodied vision, Instance ImageGoal Navigation (IIN) requires an agent to locate a specific object depicted in a goal image within an unexplored environment. The primary challenge of IIN arises from the need to recognize the target object across varying viewpoints while ignoring potential distractors. Existing map-based navigation methods typically use Bird&#39;s Eye View (BEV) maps, which lack detailed texture representation of a scene. Consequently, while BEV maps are effective for semantic-level visual navigation, they are struggling for instancelevel tasks. To this end, we propose a new framework for IIN, Gaussian Splatting for Visual Navigation (GaussNav), which constructs a novel map representation based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). The GaussNav framework enables the agent to memorize both the geometry and semantic information of the scene, as well as retain the textural features of objects. By matching renderings of similar objects with the target, the agent can accurately identify, ground, and navigate to the specified object. Our GaussNav framework demonstrates a significant performance improvement, with Success weighted by Path Length (SPL) increasing from 0.347 to 0.578 on the challenging HabitatMatterport 3D (HM3D) dataset.

  abstract     = {Unintentional action localization (UAL) is a challenging task that requires reasoning about action intention clues to detect the temporal locations of unintentional action occurrences in real-world videos. Previous efforts usually treated this task as a dense binary classification problem and did not fully explore the relationships between intention clues and unintentional actions, resulting in unsatisfactory performance on open-set scenarios during inference. In this paper, we propose a Transferable Unintentional Action Localization framework by introducing language-guided intention translation, which explicitly formulates unintentional action localization as an open-set localization problem. Our framework constructs a transferable reasoning model guided by natural languages to translate the action intention of the entire video, which generates natural and powerful supervision signals for reconstructing complete action intention clues to address the problem of unintentional action localization. Based on the fact that a video with failure action is composed of intentional and unintentional parts connected by a transient action transition. Our transferable reasoning model employs a transformer architecture to transfer knowledge between intentional and unintentional parts for learning complementary semantic representations of these two parts, completing the action intention clue in an implicit supervision manner. We also present a dense voting scheme for detecting the action transition from intentional to unintentional using discriminative representations incorporating action intention clues. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms representative unintentional action localization methods in a wide range of open-set scenarios. In addition, we create a new unintentional sports video dataset, FS-Falls, and extend our framework from in-the-wild scenarios to competitive sports to demonstrate better generalization ability. We hope this work will provide a new perspective on creating powerful representations with complete action intention priors, which will help us better understand human action and capture underlying intention clues in real-world videos.},

The outcome is a new strategy that can significantly enhance multi-scale feature representations of real-time object detectors. To verify the effectiveness of our work, we train our YOLO-MS on the MS COCO dataset from scratch without relying on any other large-scale datasets, like ImageNet or pre-trained weights.

  abstract     = {AI fairness, also known as algorithmic fairness, aims to ensure that algorithms operate without bias or discrimination towards any individual or group. Among various AI algorithms, the Fair Representation Learning (FRL) approach has gained significant interest in recent years. However, existing FRL algorithms have a limitation: they are primarily designed for categorical sensitive attributes and thus cannot be applied to continuous sensitive attributes, such as age or income. In this paper, we propose an FRL algorithm for continuous sensitive attributes. First, we introduce a measure called the Expectation of Integral Probability Metrics (EIPM) to assess the fairness level of representation space for continuous sensitive attributes. We demonstrate that if the distribution of the representation has a low EIPM value, then any prediction head constructed on the top of the representation become fair, regardless of the selection of the prediction head. Furthermore, EIPM possesses a distinguished advantage in that it can be accurately estimated using our proposed estimator with finite samples. Based on these properties, we propose a new FRL algorithm called Fair Representation using EIPM with MMD (FREM). Experimental evidences show that FREM outperforms other baseline methods.},

  abstract     = {While deep neural networks (NN) significantly advance image compressed sensing (CS) by improving reconstruction quality, the necessity of training current CS NNs from scratch constrains their effectiveness and hampers rapid deployment. Although recent methods utilize pre-trained diffusion models for image reconstruction, they struggle with slow inference and restricted adaptability to CS. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes Invertible Diffusion Models (IDM), a novel efficient, end-to-end diffusion-based CS method. IDM repurposes a large-scale diffusion sampling process as a reconstruction model, and fine-tunes it end-to-end to recover original images directly from CS measurements, moving beyond the traditional paradigm of one-step noise estimation learning. To enable such memory-intensive end-to-end fine-tuning, we propose a novel two-level invertible design to transform both (1) multi-step sampling process and (2) noise estimation U-Net in each step into invertible networks. As a result, most intermediate features are cleared during training to reduce up to 93.8% GPU memory. In addition, we develop a set of lightweight modules to inject measurements into noise estimator to further facilitate reconstruction. Experiments demonstrate that IDM outperforms existing state-of-the-art CS networks by up to 2.64dB in PSNR. Compared to the recent diffusion-based approach DDNM, our IDM achieves up to 10.09dB PSNR gain and 14.54 times faster inference. Code is available at https://github.com/Guaishou74851/IDM.},

  abstract     = {The goal of continual learning (CL) is to learn from a series of continuously arriving new tasks without forgetting previously learned old tasks. To avoid catastrophic forgetting of old tasks, orthogonal gradient projection (OGP) based CL methods constrain the gradients of new tasks to be orthogonal to the space spanned by old tasks. This strict gradient constraint will limit the learning ability of new tasks, resulting in lower performance on new tasks. In this paper, we first establish a unified framework for OGP-based CL methods. We then revisit OGP-based CL methods from a new perspective on the loss landscape, where we find that when relaxing projection constraints to improve performance on new tasks, the unflatness of the loss landscape can lead to catastrophic forgetting of old tasks. Based on our findings, we propose a new Dual Flatness-aware OGD framework that optimizes the flatness of the loss landscape from both data and weight levels. Our framework consists of three modules: data and weight perturbation, flatness-aware optimization, and gradient projection. Specifically, we first perform perturbations on the task&#39;s data and current model weights to make the task&#39;s loss reach the worst-case. Next, we optimize the loss and loss landscape on the original data and the worst-case perturbed data to obtain a flatness-aware gradient. Finally, the flatness-aware gradient will update the network in directions orthogonal to the space spanned by the old tasks. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show that the framework improves the flatness of the loss landscape and performance on new tasks, and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on average accuracy across all tasks.},

  abstract     = {Recently, numerous benchmarks have been developed to evaluate the logical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, assessing the equally important creative capabilities of LLMs is challenging due to the subjective, diverse, and data-scarce nature of creativity, especially in multimodal scenarios. In this paper, we consider the comprehensive pipeline for evaluating the creativity of multimodal LLMs, with a focus on suitable evaluation platforms and methodologies. First, we find the Oogiri game—a creativity-driven task requiring humor, associative thinking, and the ability to produce unexpected responses to text, images, or both. This game aligns well with the input-output structure of modern multimodal LLMs and benefits from a rich repository of high-quality, human-annotated creative responses, making it an ideal platform for studying LLM creativity. Next, beyond using the Oogiri game for standard evaluations like ranking and selection, we propose LoTbench, an interactive, causality-aware evaluation framework, to further address some intrinsic risks in standard evaluations, such as information leakage and limited interpretability. The proposed LoTbench not only quantifies LLM creativity more effectively but also visualizes the underlying creative thought processes. Our results show that while most LLMs exhibit constrained creativity, the performance gap between LLMs and humans is not insurmountable. Furthermore, we observe a strong correlation between results from the multimodal cognition benchmark MMMU and LoTbench, but only a weak connection with traditional creativity metrics. This suggests that LoTbench better aligns with human cognitive theories, highlighting cognition as a critical foundation in the early stages of creativity and enabling the bridging of diverse concepts.},

  abstract     = {Passive hyperspectral longwave infrared measurements are remarkably informative about the surroundings. Remote object material and temperature determine the spectrum of thermal radiance, and range, air temperature, and gas concentrations determine how this spectrum is modified by propagation to the sensor. We introduce a passive range imaging method based on computationally separating these phenomena. Previous methods assume hot and highly emitting objects; ranging is more challenging when objects&#39; temperatures do not deviate greatly from air temperature. Our method jointly estimates range and intrinsic object properties, with explicit consideration of air emission, though reflected light is assumed negligible. Inversion being underdetermined is mitigated by using a parametric model of atmospheric absorption and regularizing for smooth emissivity estimates. To assess where our estimate is likely accurate, we introduce a technique to detect which scene pixels are significantly influenced by reflected downwelling. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the importance of regularization, temperature differentials, and availability of many spectral bands. We apply our method to longwave infrared (8–13 $\mu$ m) hyperspectral image data acquired from natural scenes with no active illumination. Range features from 15 m to 150 m are recovered, with good qualitative match to lidar data for pixels classified as having negligible reflected downwelling.},

Unlike most previous approaches that focus on decomposing 2D images, we present a 3D generative model named DynaVol-S for dynamic scenes that enables object-centric learning within a differentiable volume rendering framework. The key idea is to perform object-centric voxelization to capture the 3D nature of the scene, which infers per-object occupancy probabilities at individual spatial locations. These voxel features evolve through a canonical-space deformation function and are optimized in an inverse rendering pipeline with a compositional NeRF. Additionally, our approach integrates 2D semantic features to create 3D semantic grids, representing the scene through multiple disentangled voxel grids. DynaVol-S significantly outperforms existing models in both novel view synthesis and unsupervised decomposition tasks for dynamic scenes. By jointly considering geometric structures and semantic features, it effectively addresses challenging real-world scenarios involving complex object interactions. Furthermore, once trained, the explicitly meaningful voxel features enable additional capabilities that 2D scene decomposition methods cannot achieve, such as novel scene generation through editing geometric shapes or manipulating the motion trajectories of objects.},

However, current studies primarily focus on single specific tasks, which limits model applicability in real-world scenarios. This paper aims to address this issue by introducing a novel instruct-ReID task that unifies 6 existing ReID tasks in one model and retrieves images based on provided visual or textual instructions. Instruct-ReID is the first exploration of a general ReID setting, where 6 existing ReID tasks can be viewed as special cases by assigning different instructions. To facilitate research in this new instruct-ReID task, we propose a large-scale OmniReID++ benchmark equipped with diverse data and comprehensive evaluation methods, e.g., task-specific and task-free evaluation settings. In the task-specific evaluation setting, gallery sets are categorized according to specific ReID tasks. We propose a novel baseline model, IRM, with an adaptive triplet loss to handle various retrieval tasks within a unified framework. For task-free evaluation setting, where target person images are retrieved from task-agnostic gallery sets, we further propose a new method called IRM++ with novel memory bank-assisted learning. Extensive evaluations of IRM and IRM++ on OmniReID++ benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 10 test sets.

To further accelerate the sampling process, the combination of these two methods has been extensively studied in recent years. However, existing MRI reconstruction methods often overlook the exploration of high-frequency information of images, leading to sub-optimal recovery of fine details in the reconstructed results. To address this issue, we conduct an in-depth analysis of image gradients and propose a novel MRI reconstruction model based on Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimation. We first establish the Cumulative Deviation from Maximum Gradient magnitude (CDMG) prior for fully sampled MR images through theoretical analysis, then incorporate this explicit CDMG prior along with an implicit deep prior to form the prior probability term. This combination of priors strikes a balance between physically informed constraints and data-driven adaptability, aiding in the recovery of meaningful high-frequency information. Additionally, we introduce a multi-order gradient operator to enhance the observation model, thereby improving the accuracy of the likelihood term. Through MAP estimation, we develop a novel accelerated MRI reconstruction model, the optimization of which is achieved by unrolling it into a convolutional neural network structure, referred to as DDGU-Net. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reconstructing high-quality MR images and achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results, particularly at higher acceleration factors.},

As the layout is determined by the dominant indoor planes, this problem inherently requires the reconstruction of these planes. Some studies reconstruct indoor planes from perspective images by learning pixel-level or instance-level plane parameters. However, directly learning these parameters has the problems of susceptibility to occlusions and position dependency. In this paper, we introduce the Comprehensive depth map to Planar depth (C2P) conversion, which reformulates planar depth reconstruction into the prediction of a comprehensive depth map and planar visibility confidence. Based on the parametric representation of planar depth we propose, the C2P conversion is applicable to both panoramic and perspective images. Accordingly, we present an effective framework for room layout estimation that jointly learns the comprehensive depth map and planar visibility confidence. Due to the differentiability of the C2P conversion, our network autonomously learns planar visibility confidence by constraining the estimated plane parameters and reconstructed planar depth map. We further propose a novel approach for 3D layout generation through sequential planar depth map integration. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method across all evaluated panoramic and perspective datasets.},

Our multi-space scheme works as an enhancement to existing NeRF methods, with only small computational overheads needed for training and inferring the extra-space outputs. We design different multi-space modules for representative MLP-based and grid-based NeRF methods, which improve Mip-NeRF 360 by 4.15 dB in PSNR with 0.5% extra parameters and further improve TensoRF by 2.71 dB with 0.046% extra parameters on reflective regions without degrading the rendering quality on other regions.

Based on these observations, we propose a Class-Flipping-aware Adversarial Training (CFAT) method. On the one hand, we obtain the most misleading categories for the data in each class by counting the samples flipped to different wrong categories, and utilize them as the target to construct corresponding targeted adversarial samples, respectively. On the other hand, we take the proportions of samples flipped to the most misleading category as factors to scale the perturbation budgets of adversarial training samples for the data with corresponding classes.

Specifically, we construct a novel soft decision tree using a recurrent structure and demonstrate which features influence the decision-making process. Then, based on the value decomposition framework, we linearly assign credit to each agent by explicitly mixing individual action values to estimate the joint action value using only local observations, providing new insights into interpreting the cooperation mechanism. Theoretical analysis confirms that MIXRTs guarantee additivity and monotonicity in the factorization of joint action values. Evaluations on complex tasks like Spread and StarCraft II demonstrate that MIXRTs compete with existing methods while providing clear explanations, paving the way for interpretable and high-performing MARL systems.},

  abstract     = {Recent advancements in learning techniques that employ coordinate-based neural representations have yielded remarkable results in multi-view 3D reconstruction tasks. However, these approaches often require a substantial number of input views (typically several tens) and computationally intensive optimization procedures to achieve their effectiveness. In this paper, we address these limitations specifically for the problem of few-shot full 3D head reconstruction. We accomplish this by incorporating a probabilistic shape and appearance prior into coordinate-based representations, enabling faster convergence and improved generalization when working with only a few input images (even as low as a single image). During testing, we leverage this prior to guiding the fitting process of a signed distance function using a differentiable renderer. By incorporating the statistical prior alongside parallelizable ray tracing and dynamic caching strategies, we achieve an efficient and accurate approach to few-shot full 3D head reconstruction. Moreover, we extend the H3DS dataset, which now comprises 60 high-resolution 3D full-head scans and their corresponding posed images and masks, which we use for evaluation purposes. By leveraging this dataset, we demonstrate the remarkable capabilities of our approach in achieving state-of-the-art results in geometry reconstruction while being an order of magnitude faster than previous approaches.},

The underlying idea is based on feature attribution, using a subset of the ranking of the attributes highlighted by a model-agnostic explainable method in a forecasting task. Then, association rules are generated using these key attributes as input data. Novel metrics, including global support and confidence, are proposed to assess the joint quality of generated rules. Finally, the quality of the explanations is calculated based on a wise and comprehensive combination of the association rules global metrics. The proposed method integrates local explanations through attribution-based approaches for evaluation and feature selection with global explanations for the entire dataset. This paper rigorously evaluates the new metric by comparing three explainability techniques: the widely used SHAP and LIME, and the novel methodology RULEx. The experimental design includes predicting time series of different natures, including univariate and multivariate, through deep learning models. The results underscore the efficacy and versatility of the proposed methodology as a quantitative framework for evaluating and comparing explainable techniques.},

However, the properties of medical images make unreliable correspondence discovery, bringing an open problem of large-scale false positive and negative (FP&amp;N) pairs in DCRL. In this paper, we propose GEoMetric vIsual deNse sImilarity (GEMINI) learning which embeds the homeomorphism prior to DCRL and enables a reliable correspondence discovery for effective dense contrast. We proposes a deformable homeomorphism learning (DHL) which models the homeomorphism of medical images and learns to estimate a deformable mapping to predict the pixels&#39; correspondence under the condition of topological preservation. It effectively reduces the searching space of pairing and drives an implicit and soft learning of negative pairs via gradient. We also proposes a geometric semantic similarity (GSS) which extracts semantic information in features to measure the alignment degree for the correspondence learning. It will promote the learning efficiency and performance of deformation, constructing positive pairs reliably. We implement two practical variants on two typical representation learning tasks in our experiments. Our promising results on seven datasets which outperform the existing methods show our great superiority. We will release our code at a companion https://github.com/YutingHe-list/GEMINI.},

  abstract     = {Object pose estimation and shape reconstruction are inherently coupled tasks although they have so far been studied separately in most existing approaches. A few recent works addressed the problem of joint pose estimation and shape reconstruction, but they found difficulties in handling partial observations and shape ambiguities. An open challenge in this area is to design a mechanism that has the two tasks benefit each other and boost the performance and robustness of both. In this work, we advocate the use of diffusion models for joint estimation of category-level object poses and reconstruction of object geometry. Diffusion models formulate shape reconstruction as a generation process conditioned on input observations. It has two main advantages. First, the iterative inference of diffusion models provides a mechanism for iterative optimization for both pose estimation and shape reconstruction. Second, diffusion models allow multiple outputs starting from different input noises, which would address the problem of ambiguity caused by partial observations. To achieve this, we propose equivariant diffusion model for joint pose estimation and shape reconstruction. The approach consists of an equivariant feature extractor to aggregate features of the input point cloud and a ShapePose diffusion model to generate object pose and shape simultaneously. To avoid training the model on all possible shape poses in the SO(3) space, we propose to augment the diffusion model with A5-group neurons where the neurons are converted into 5D vectors and can be rotated with the alternating group A5. Based on the A5-group neurons, we implement SO(3)-equivariant 3D point convolution and SO(3)-equivariant concatenation, making the entire network SO(3)-equivariant. Moreover, to select the most plausible combination of pose and shape from the generated ones, we propose a geometry-based measure of plausibility for an estimated pose along with a reconstructed shape. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Specifically, our method achieves the state-of-the-art on two public datasets and a new dataset with stacked objects, in terms of shape reconstruction and pose estimation. In particular, we show the proposed method could provide multiple plausible outputs under partial observations and shape ambiguities.},

  abstract     = {Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) or continual learning is a desired capability in the real world, which requires a learning system to adapt to new tasks without forgetting former ones. While traditional CIL methods focus on visual information to grasp core features, recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLM) have shown promising capabilities in learning generalizable representations with the aid of textual information. However, when continually trained with new classes, VLMs often suffer from catastrophic forgetting of former knowledge. Applying VLMs to CIL poses two major challenges: 1) how to adapt the model without forgetting; and 2) how to make full use of the multi-modal information. To this end, we propose PROjectiOn Fusion (Proof) that enables VLMs to learn without forgetting. To handle the first challenge, we propose training task-specific projections based on the frozen image/text encoders. When facing new tasks, new projections are expanded, and former projections are fixed, alleviating the forgetting of old concepts. For the second challenge, we propose the fusion module to better utilize the cross-modality information. By jointly adjusting visual and textual features, the model can capture better task-specific semantic information that facilitates recognition. Extensive experiments on nine benchmark datasets with various continual learning scenarios and various VLMs validate that Proofachieves state-of-the-art performance.

  abstract     = {Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) is a challenging cross-modality retrieval task due to the large modality gap. While numerous efforts have been devoted to the supervised setting with a large amount of labeled cross-modality correspondences, few studies have tried to mitigate the modality gap by mining cross-modality correspondences in an unsupervised manner. However, existing works failed to capture the intrinsic relations among samples across two modalities, resulting in limited performance outcomes. In this paper, we propose a novel Progressive Graph Matching (PGM) approach to globally model the cross-modality relationships and instance-level affinities. PGM formulates cross-modality correspondence mining as a graph matching procedure, aiming to integrate global information by minimizing global matching costs. Considering that samples in wrong clusters cannot find reliable cross-modality correspondences by PGM, we further introduce a robust Dual-Level Matching (DLM) mechanism, combining the cluster-level PGM and Nearest Instance-Cluster Searching (NICS) with instance-level affinity optimization. Additionally, we design an Outlier Filter Strategy (OFS) to filter out unreliable cross-modality correspondences based on the dual-level relation constraints. To mitigate false accumulation in cross-modal correspondence learning, an Alternate Cross Contrastive Learning (ACCL) module is proposed to alternately adjust the dominated matching, i.e., visible-to-infrared or infrared-to-visible matching. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of our unsupervised solution, achieving comparable performance with supervised counterparts.},

  abstract     = {Digital image forensics plays a crucial role in image authentication and manipulation localization. Despite the progress powered by deep neural networks, existing forgery localization methodologies exhibit limitations when deployed to unseen datasets and perturbed images (i.e., lack of generalization and robustness to real-world applications). To circumvent these problems and aid image integrity, this paper presents a generalized and robust manipulation localization model through the analysis of pixel inconsistency artifacts. The rationale is grounded on the observation that most image signal processors (ISP) involve the demosaicing process, which introduces pixel correlations in pristine images. Moreover, manipulating operations, including splicing, copy-move, and inpainting, directly affect such pixel regularity. We, therefore, first split the input image into several blocks and design masked self-attention mechanisms to model the global pixel dependency in input images. Simultaneously, we optimize another local pixel dependency stream to mine local manipulation clues within input forgery images. In addition, we design novel Learning-to-Weight Modules (LWM) to combine features from the two streams, thereby enhancing the final forgery localization performance. To improve the training process, we propose a novel Pixel-Inconsistency Data Augmentation (PIDA) strategy, driving the model to focus on capturing inherent pixel-level artifacts instead of mining semantic forgery traces. This work establishes a comprehensive benchmark integrating 16 representative detection models across 12 datasets. Extensive experiments show that our method successfully extracts inherent pixel-inconsistency forgery fingerprints and achieve state-of-the-art generalization and robustness performances in image manipulation localization.},

For this reason, pixel-wise uncertainty assessment is required for safety-critical applications to highlight the areas where the prediction is unreliable. We address this in a post hoc manner and introduce gradient-based uncertainty estimation for already trained depth estimation models. To extract gradients without depending on the ground truth depth, we introduce an auxiliary loss function based on the consistency of the predicted depth and a reference depth. The reference depth, which acts as pseudo ground truth, is in fact generated using a simple image or feature augmentation, making our approach simple and effective. To obtain the final uncertainty score, the derivatives w.r.t. the feature maps from single or multiple layers are calculated using back-propagation. We demonstrate that our gradient-based approach is effective in determining the uncertainty without re-training using the two standard depth estimation benchmarks KITTI and NYU. In particular, for models trained with monocular sequences and therefore most prone to uncertainty, our method outperforms related approaches.

Although the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has been employed to scale large language or visual-language models efficiently, these efforts typically involve fewer experts and limited modalities. To address this, our work presents the pioneering attempt to develop a unified MLLM with the MoE architecture, named Uni-MoE that can handle a wide array of modalities. Specifically, it features modality-specific encoders with connectors for a unified multimodal representation. We also implement a sparse MoE architecture within the LLMs to enable efficient training and inference through modality-level data parallelism and expert-level model parallelism. To enhance the multi-expert collaboration and generalization, we present a progressive training strategy: 1) Cross-modality alignment using various connectors with different cross-modality data, 2) Training modality-specific experts with cross-modality instruction data to activate experts&#39; preferences, and 3) Tuning the whole Uni-MoE framework utilizing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on mixed multimodal instruction data. We evaluate the instruction-tuned Uni-MoE on a comprehensive set of multimodal datasets. The extensive experimental results demonstrate Uni-MoE&#39;s principal advantage of significantly reducing performance bias in handling mixed multimodal datasets, alongside improved multi-expert collaboration and generalization.

For instance, under a certain condition, two images may demonstrate similarity, while under different circumstances, the same pair could exhibit absolute dissimilarity. A singular feature space is therefore insufficient for capturing the nuanced semantic relationships that exist between samples. Conditional Similarity Learning (CSL) aims to address this gap by learning multiple, distinct feature spaces. Existing approaches in CSL often fail to capture the intricate similarity relationships between samples across different semantic conditions, particularly in weakly-supervised settings where condition labels are absent during training. To address this limitation, we introduce Distance Induced Semantic COndition VERification NETwork (DISCOVERNET), a unified framework designed to cater to a range of CSL scenarios– supervised CSL (sCSL), weakly-supervised CSL (wsCSL), and semi-supervised CSL (ssCSL). In addition to traditional linear projections, we also introduce a prompt learning technique utilizing transformer encoding layer to create diverse embedding spaces. Our framework incorporates a Condition Match Module (CMM) that dynamically matches different training triplets with corresponding embedding spaces, adapting to varying levels of supervision. We also shed light on existing evaluation biases in wsCSL and introduce two novel criteria for a more robust evaluation. Through extensive experiments and visualizations on benchmark datasets such as UT-Zappos-50k and Celeb-A, we substantiate the efficacy and interpretability of DISCOVERNET.},

  abstract     = {Existing scene text recognition methods leverage large-scale labeled synthetic data (LSD) to reduce reliance on labor-intensive annotation tasks and improve recognition capability in real-world scenarios. However, the emergence of a synth-to-real domain gap still limits their efficiency and robustness. Consequently, harvesting the meaningful intrinsic qualities of unlabeled real data (URD) is of great importance, given the prevalence of text-laden images. Toward the target, recent efforts have focused on pre-training on URD through sequence-to-sequence self-supervised learning, followed by fine-tuning on LSD via supervised learning. Nevertheless, they encounter three important issues: coarse representation learning units, inflexible data augmentation, and an emerging real-to-synth domain drift. To overcome these challenges, we propose CCDPlus, an accurate character-to-character distillation method for scene text recognition with a joint supervised and self-supervised learning framework. Specifically, tailored for text images, CCDPlus delineates the fine-grained character structures on URD as representation units by transferring knowledge learned from LSD online. Without requiring extra bounding box or pixel-level annotations, this process allows CCDPlus to enable character-to-character distillation flexibly with versatile data augmentation, which effectively extracts general real-world character-level feature representations. Meanwhile, the unified framework combines self-supervised learning on URD with supervised learning on LSD, effectively solving the domain inconsistency and enhancing the recognition performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CCDPlus outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) supervised, semi-supervised, and self-supervised methods by an average of 1.8%, 0.6%, and 1.1% on standard datasets, respectively. Additionally, it achieves a 6.1% improvement on the more challenging Union14M-L dataset. Code will be available at https://github.com/TongkunGuan/CCD.},

  abstract     = {In domain adaptation (DA), the effectiveness of deep learning-based models is often constrained by batch learning strategies that fail to fully apprehend the global statistical and geometric characteristics of data distributions. Addressing this gap, we introduce “Global Awareness Enhanced Domain Adaptation” (GAN-DA), a novel approach that transcends traditional batch-based limitations. GAN-DA integrates a unique predefined feature representation (PFR) to facilitate the alignment of cross-domain distributions, thereby achieving a comprehensive global statistical awareness. This representation is innovatively expanded to encompass orthogonal and common feature aspects, which enhances the unification of global manifold structures and refines decision boundaries for more effective DA. Our extensive experiments, encompassing 27 diverse cross-domain image classification tasks, demonstrate GAN-DA&#39;s remarkable superiority, outperforming 24 established DA methods by a significant margin. Furthermore, our in-depth analyses shed light on the decision-making processes, revealing insights into the adaptability and efficiency of GAN-DA. This approach not only addresses the limitations of existing DA methodologies but also sets a new benchmark in the realm of domain adaptation, offering broad implications for future research and applications in this field.},

Existing methods are devoted to developing various robust training strategies or regularizations to update the weights of the neural network. But beyond the weights, the overall structure and information flow in the network are explicitly determined by the neural architecture, which remains unexplored. Thus, this paper aims to improve the adversarial robustness of the network from the architectural perspective. We explore the relationship among adversarial robustness, Lipschitz constant, and architecture parameters and show that an appropriate constraint on architecture parameters could reduce the Lipschitz constant to further improve the robustness. The importance of architecture parameters could vary from operation to operation or connection to connection. We approximate the Lipschitz constant of the entire network through a univariate log-normal distribution, whose mean and variance are related to architecture parameters. The confidence can be fulfilled through formulating a constraint on the distribution parameters based on the cumulative function. Compared with adversarially trained neural architectures searched by various NAS algorithms as well as efficient human-designed models, our algorithm empirically achieves the best performance among all the models under various attacks on different datasets.},

The system effectively utilizes noisy and sparse LiDAR data to refine training and address depth outliers, ensuring high-quality reconstruction and novel-view rendering. It also provides a diverse foreground asset bank by reconstructing and generating different foreground vehicles to support comprehensive scenario creation. Moreover, we have developed an advanced foreground-background fusion pipeline that skillfully integrates illumination and shadow effects, further enhancing the realism of our simulations.

  abstract     = {Knowledge distillation (KD) has shown to be effective to boost the performance of graph neural networks (GNNs), where the typical objective is to distill knowledge from a deeper teacher GNN into a shallower student GNN. However, it is often quite challenging to train a satisfactory deeper GNN due to the well-known over-parametrized and over-smoothing issues, leading to invalid knowledge transfer in practical applications. In this paper, we propose the first Free-direction Knowledge Distillation framework via reinforcement learning for GNNs, called FreeKD, which is no longer required to provide a deeper well-optimized teacher GNN. Our core idea is to collaboratively learn two shallower GNNs in an effort to exchange knowledge between them via reinforcement learning in a hierarchical way. As we observe that one typical GNN model often exhibits better and worse performances at different nodes during training, we devise a dynamic and free-direction knowledge transfer strategy that involves two levels of actions: 1) node-level action determines the directions of knowledge transfer between the corresponding nodes of two networks; and then 2) structure-level action determines which of the local structures generated by the node-level actions to be propagated. Additionally, considering that different augmented graphs can potentially capture distinct perspectives or representations of the graph data, we propose FreeKD-Prompt that learns undistorted and diverse augmentations based on prompt learning for exchanging varied knowledge. Furthermore, instead of confining knowledge exchange within two GNNs, we develop FreeKD++ and FreeKD-Prompt++ to enable free-direction knowledge transfer among multiple shallow GNNs. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate our approaches outperform the base GNNs by a large margin, and show their efficacy to various GNNs. More surprisingly, our FreeKD has comparable or even better performance than traditional KD algorithms that distill knowledge from a deeper and stronger teacher GNN.},

Several recent approaches use the CLIP model to generate pseudo labels for training an individual segmentation model, while there is no attempt to apply the CLIP model as the backbone to directly segment objects with image-level labels. In this paper, we propose WeCLIP and its advanced version WeCLIP+, to build the single-stage pipeline for weakly supervised semantic segmentation. For WeCLIP, the frozen CLIP model is applied as the backbone for semantic feature extraction, and a new light decoder is designed to interpret extracted semantic features for final prediction. Meanwhile, we utilize the above frozen backbone to generate pseudo labels for training the decoder. Such labels are fixed during training. We then propose a refinement module (RFM) to optimize them dynamically. For WeCLIP+, we introduce the frozen DINO model to achieve more comprehensive semantic feature extraction. The frozen DINO is combined with the frozen CLIP as the backbone, followed by a shared decoder to make predictions with less training cost. Moreover, a strengthened refinement module (RFM+) is designed to revise online pseudo labels with extra guidance from DINO features. Extensive experiments show that both WeCLIP and WeCLIP+ significantly outperform other approaches with less training cost. Particularly, WeCLIP+ gets mIoU of 83.9% on VOC 2012 test set and 56.3% on COCO val set. Additionally, these two approaches also obtain promising results for fully supervised settings.

In the proposed variational Bayesian inference theory of continuum mechanics, the elastic strain energy is used as a prior in a Bayesian inference network, which can intelligently recover the detailed continuum deformation mappings with only given the information on the deformed and undeformed continuum body shapes without knowing the interior deformation and the precise actual boundary conditions, both traction as well as displacement boundary conditions, and the actual material constitutive relation. Moreover, we have implemented the related finite element formulation in a computational probabilistic mechanics framework. To numerically solve mixed variational problem, we developed an operator splitting or staggered algorithm that consists of the finite element (FE) step and the Bayesian learning (BL) step as an analogue of the well-known the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. By solving the mixed probabilistic Galerkin variational problem, we demonstrated that the proposed method is able to inversely predict continuum deformation mappings with strong discontinuity or fracture without knowing the external load conditions. The proposed method provides a robust machine intelligent solution for the long-sought-after inverse problem solution, which has been a major challenge in structure failure forensic pattern analysis in past several decades.

In this work, we introduce a general framework for robust and decomposable rank losses optimization. It addresses two major challenges for end-to-end training of deep neural networks with rank losses: non-differentiability and non-decomposability. Firstly, we propose a general surrogate for ranking operator, SupRank, that is amenable to stochastic gradient descent. It provides an upperbound for rank losses and ensures robust training. Secondly, we use a simple yet effective loss function to reduce the decomposability gap between the averaged batch approximation of ranking losses and their values on the whole training set. We apply our framework to two standard metrics for image retrieval: AP and R@k. Additionally, we apply our framework to hierarchical image retrieval. We introduce an extension of AP, the hierarchical average precision ${\mathcal {H}}$, and optimize it as well as the NDCG. Finally, we create the first hierarchical landmarks retrieval dataset. We use a semi-automatic pipeline to create hierarchical labels, extending the large scale Google Landmarks v2 dataset.

  abstract     = {Snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) surges as a novel way of capturing hyperspectral images. It operates an optical encoder to compress the 3D data into a 2D measurement and adopts a software decoder for the signal reconstruction. Recently, a representative SCI set-up of coded aperture snapshot compressive imager (CASSI) with Transformer reconstruction backend remarks high-fidelity sensing performance. However, dominant spatial and spectral attention designs show limitations in hyperspectral modeling. The spatial attention values describe the inter-pixel correlation but overlook the across-spectra variation within each pixel. The spectral attention size is unscalable to the token spatial size and thus bottlenecks information allocation. Besides, CASSI entangles the spatial and spectral information into a 2D measurement, placing a barrier for information disentanglement and modeling. In addition, CASSI blocks the light with a physical binary mask, yielding the masked data loss. To tackle above challenges, we propose a spatial-spectral (S 2 -) Transformer implemented by a paralleled attention design and a mask-aware learning strategy. Firstly, we systematically explore pros and cons of different spatial (-spectral) attention designs, based on which we find performing both attentions in parallel well disentangles and models the blended information. Secondly, the masked pixels induce higher prediction difficulty and should be treated differently from unmasked ones. We adaptively prioritize the loss penalty attributing to the mask structure by referring to the mask-encoded prediction as an uncertainty estimator. We theoretically discuss the distinct convergence tendencies between masked/unmasked regions of the proposed learning strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that on average, the results of the proposed method are superior over the state-of-the-art methods. We empirically visualize and reason the behaviour of spatial and spectral attentions, and comprehensively examine the impact of the mask-aware learning, both of which advances the physics-driven deep network design for the reconstruction with CASSI.

Among these, diffusion model-based approaches, which employ a forward diffusion process to degrade an image and a reverse denoising process for image generation, have become particularly prominent for producing high-quality, diverse samples with intricate texture details. Despite their widespread success in low-level vision, there remains a lack of a comprehensive, insightful survey that synthesizes and organizes the advances in diffusion model-based techniques. To address this gap, this paper presents the first comprehensive review focused on denoising diffusion models applied to low-level vision tasks, covering both theoretical and practical contributions. We outline three general diffusion modeling frameworks and explore their connections with other popular deep generative models, establishing a solid theoretical foundation for subsequent analysis. We then categorize diffusion models used in low-level vision tasks from multiple perspectives, considering both the underlying framework and the target application. Beyond natural image processing, we also summarize diffusion models applied to other low-level vision domains, including medical imaging, remote sensing, and video processing. Additionally, we provide an overview of widely used benchmarks and evaluation metrics in low-level vision tasks. Our review includes an extensive evaluation of diffusion model-based techniques across six representative tasks, with both quantitative and qualitative analysis. Finally, we highlight the limitations of current diffusion models and propose four promising directions for future research. This comprehensive review aims to foster a deeper understanding of the role of denoising diffusion models in low-level vision.

Auto-Regressive (AR)-based models implement the recognition in a character-by-character manner, showing superiority in accuracy but with slow inference speed. Alternatively, Parallel Decoding (PD)-based models infer all characters in a single decoding pass, offering faster inference speed but generally worse accuracy. To realize the dual goals of “AR-level accuracy and PD-level speed”, we propose a Context Perception Parallel Decoder (CPPD) to perceive the related context and predict the character sequence in a PD pass. CPPD devises a character counting module to infer the occurrence count of each character, and a character ordering module to deduce the content-free reading order and positions. Meanwhile, the character prediction task associates the positions with characters. They together build a comprehensive recognition context, which benefits the decoder to focus accurately on characters with the attention mechanism, thereby improving the recognition accuracy. We construct a series of CPPD models and also plug the proposed modules into existing STR decoders. Experiments on both English and Chinese benchmarks demonstrate that the CPPD models achieve highly competitive accuracy while running much faster than existing leading models. Moreover, the plugged models achieve significant accuracy improvements.},

  abstract     = {Understanding human emotions is crucial for a myriad of applications, from psychological research to advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Traditionally, emotions are categorized into distinct basic groups, which has led to the development of various emotion detection tasks within NLP. However, these tasks typically rely on one-hot vectors to represent emotions, a method that fails to capture the relations between different emotion categories. In this study, we challenge the assumption that emotion categories are mutually exclusive and argue that the connections and boundaries between them are complex and often blurred. To better represent these nuanced interconnections, we introduce an innovative framework as well as two algorithms to learn distributed representations of emotion categories by leveraging soft labels from trained neural network models. For the first time, our approach enables the detection of emotion relations across different languages through an NLP lens, a feat unattainable with traditional one-hot representations. Validation experiments confirm the superior ability of our distributed representation algorithms to articulate these emotional connections. Moreover, application experiments corroborate several interdisciplinary insights into cross-linguistic emotion relations, findings that align with research in psychology and linguistics.

  abstract     = {Time series forecasting has remained a focal point due to its vital applications in sectors such as energy management and transportation planning. Spectral-temporal graph neural network is a promising abstraction underlying most time series forecasting models that are based on graph neural networks (GNNs). However, more is needed to know about the underpinnings of this branch of methods. In this paper, we establish a theoretical framework that unravels the expressive power of spectral-temporal GNNs. Our results show that linear spectral-temporal GNNs are universal under mild assumptions, and their expressive power is bounded by our extended first-order Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm on discrete-time dynamic graphs. To make our findings useful in practice on valid instantiations, we discuss related constraints in detail and outline a theoretical blueprint for designing spatial and temporal modules in spectral domains. Building on these insights and to demonstrate how powerful spectral-temporal GNNs are based on our framework, we propose a simple instantiation named Temporal Graph Gegenbauer Convolution (TGGC), which significantly outperforms most existing models with only linear components and shows better model efficiency. Our findings pave the way for devising a broader array of provably expressive GNN-based models for time series, and the code is at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TGGC.},

  abstract     = {In the image super-resolution (SR) field, recovering missing high-frequency textures has always been an important goal. However, deep SR networks based on pixel-level constraints tend to focus on stable edge details and cannot effectively restore random high-frequency textures. It was not until the emergence of the generative adversarial network (GAN) that GAN-based SR models achieved realistic texture restoration and quickly became the mainstream method for texture SR. However, GAN-based SR models still have some drawbacks, such as relying on a large number of parameters and generating fake textures that are inconsistent with ground truth. Inspired by traditional texture analysis research, this paper proposes a novel SR network based on local texture pattern estimation (LTPE), which can restore fine high-frequency texture details without GAN. A differentiable local texture operator is firstly designed to extract local texture structures, and a texture enhancement branch is used to predict the high-resolution local texture distribution based on the LTPE. Then, the predicted high-resolution texture structure map can be used as a reference for the texture fusion SR branch to obtain high-quality texture reconstruction. Finally, $L_{1}$ loss and Gram loss are simultaneously used to optimize the network. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively recover high-frequency texture without using GAN structures. In addition, the restored high-frequency details are constrained by local texture distribution, thereby reducing significant errors in texture generation. The proposed algorithm will be open-sourced.},

  abstract     = {Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) has been widely applied to measure heart rate from face videos. To increase the generalizability of the algorithms, domain generalization (DG) attracted increasing attention in rPPG. However, when rPPG is extended to simultaneously measure more vital signs (e.g., respiration and blood oxygen saturation), achieving generalizability brings new challenges. Although partial features shared among different physiological signals can benefit multi-task learning, the sparse and imbalanced target label space brings the seesaw effect over task-specific feature learning. To resolve this problem, we designed an end-to-end Mixture of Low-rank Experts for multi-task remote Physiological measurement (PhysMLE), which is based on multiple low-rank experts with a novel router mechanism, thereby enabling the model to adeptly handle both specifications and correlations within tasks. Additionally, we introduced prior knowledge from physiology among tasks to overcome the imbalance of label space under real-world multi-task physiological measurement. For fair and comprehensive evaluations, this paper proposed a large-scale multi-task generalization benchmark, named Multi-Source Synsemantic Domain Generalization (MSSDG) protocol. Extensive experiments with MSSDG and intra-dataset have shown the effectiveness and efficiency of PhysMLE. In addition, a new dataset was collected and made publicly available to meet the needs of the MSSDG. The code is available at https://github.com/WJULYW/PhysMLE.},

In view of the misalignment of testing and training metrics, not yet considered by the current fair FR algorithms, in theory, we inspect the correlation between the testing metrics (FPR and TPR) and the label classification loss, and we derive a high-probability consistency of unfairness penalties from FPR and TPR to the softmax loss. According to the theoretical analysis, we further develop an instance-consistent fairness solution by introducing customized instance margins, which well preserve consistent FPR and TPR of all instances during the label classification in training. To encourage more fine-grained fairness evaluation, we contribute a dataset called national faces in the world (NFW) to measure the fairness of individuals and countries.

  abstract     = {To efficiently train large-scale models, low-bit gradient communication compresses full-precision gradients on local GPU nodes into low-precision ones for higher gradient synchronization efficiency among GPU nodes. However, it often degrades training quality due to compression information loss. To address this, we propose the Low-bit Communication Adaptor (LoCo), which compensates gradients on local GPU nodes before compression, ensuring efficient synchronization without compromising training quality. Specifically, LoCo designs a moving average of historical compensation errors to stably estimate concurrent compression error and then adopts it to compensate for the concurrent gradient compression, yielding a less lossless compression. This mechanism allows it to be compatible with general optimizers like Adam and sharding strategies like FSDP. Theoretical analysis shows that integrating LoCo into full-precision optimizers like Adam and SGD does not impair their convergence speed on non-convex problems. Experimental results show that across large-scale model training frameworks like Megatron-LM and PyTorch&#39;s FSDP, LoCo significantly improves communication efficiency, e.g., improving Adam&#39;s training speed by 14% to 40% without performance degradation on large language models like LLAMAs and MoEs.},

  abstract     = {We focus on a very challenging task: imaging at nighttime dynamic scenes. Conventional RGB cameras struggle with the trade-off between long exposure for low-light imaging and short exposure for capturing dynamic scenes. Event cameras react to dynamic changes, with their high temporal resolution (microsecond) and dynamic range (120dB), and thus offer a promising alternative. However, existing methods are mostly based on simulated datasets due to the lack of paired event-clean image data for nighttime conditions, where the domain gap leads to performance limitations in real-world scenarios. Moreover, most existing event reconstruction methods are tailored for daytime data, overlooking issues unique to low-light events at night, such as strong noise, temporal trailing, and spatial nonuniformity, resulting in unsatisfactory reconstruction results. To address these challenges, we construct the first real paired lowlight event dataset (RLED) through a co-axial imaging system, comprising 80,400 spatially and temporally aligned image GTs and low-light events, which provides a unified training and evaluation dataset for existing methods. We further conduct a comprehensive analysis of the causes and characteristics of strong noise, temporal trailing, and spatial non-uniformity in nighttime events, and propose a nighttime event reconstruction network (NER-Net+). It includes a learnable event timestamps calibration module (LETC) to correct the temporal trailing events and a non-stationary spatio-temporal information enhancement module (NSIE) to suppress sensor noise and spatial non-uniformity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and generalization on real-world nighttime datasets.},

Traditional SSL methods undergo performance deterioration in such mismatch scenarios due to the invasion of those instances from unknown categories. Despite some technical efforts to enhance SSL by mitigating the invasion, the profound theoretical analysis of SSL under class distribution mismatch is still under study. Accordingly, in this work, we propose Bi-Objective Optimization Mechanism (https://www.anonymousx.store) to theoretically analyze the excess risk between the empirical optimal solution and the population-level optimal solution. Specifically, BOOM reveals that the SSL error is the essential contributor behind excess risk, resulting from both the pseudo-labeling error and invasion error. Meanwhile, BOOM unveils that the optimization objectives of SSL under mismatch are binary: high-quality pseudo-labels and adaptive weights on the unlabeled instances, which contribute to alleviating the pseudo-labeling error and the invasion error, respectively. Moreover, BOOM explicitly discovers the fundamental factors crucial for optimizing the bi-objectives, guided by which an approach is then proposed as a strong baseline for SSL under mismatch.

  abstract     = {The current studies of provable robustness for deep neural networks (DNNs) usually assume that the class distribution is overall balanced. However, in real-world applications especially for safety-sensitive systems, the class distribution often exhibits a long-tailed property. It is well-known that the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) is a more proper metric for long-tailed learning problems. Motivated by this fact, an AUC-oriented provable robustness learning framework (named AUCPro) is first proposed in this paper. The key is to construct a proxy model smoothed by the isotropic Gaussian noise and then consider optimizing the proxy model from the AUC-oriented learning point of view. Theoretically, we provide a certified safety region for AUCPro within which the model would be free from the $\ell _{2}$ adversarial attacks. Most importantly, we propose a novel standard to theoretically study the robustness generalization toward unseen data for provable robustness learning approaches. To the best of our knowledge, such a problem remains barely considered in the machine learning community. To be specific, under a general principle for performance-robustness trade-off, we prove that the generalization ability of the resulting model could be equivalently expressed as the expected adversarial risk of AUC under $\ell _{2}$ perturbation. On top of this, we present two practical settings to explore the excess risk formed by the difference between the empirical risk of AUCPro and the derived generalization performance.

Even though growing efforts have been devoted to cross-view recognition, academia is restricted by current existing databases captured in the controlled environment.

The GREW dataset is constructed from natural videos, which contain hundreds of cameras and thousands of hours of streams in open systems. With tremendous manual annotations, the GREW consists of 26K identities and 128K sequences with rich attributes for unconstrained gait recognition. Moreover, we add a distractor set of over 233K sequences, making it more suitable for real-world applications. Compared with prevailing predefined cross-view datasets, the GREW has diverse and practical view variations, as well as more naturally challenging factors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale dataset for gait recognition in the wild. Equipped with this benchmark, we dissect the unconstrained gait recognition problem, where representative appearance-based and model-based methods are explored. The proposed GREW benchmark proves to be essential for both training and evaluating gait recognizers in unconstrained scenarios.

The rapid development of multi-modal retrieval technologies poses new threats, making sensitive data more vulnerable to leakage and malicious mining.

Our method starts by sending queries to a knowledge-agnostic retrieval system and analyzing the results to understand the retrieval feedback mechanism. Using a U-Net-based diffusion model, we create a semantic perturbation network that subtly alters the implicit semantics of sensitive data. This, combined with multi-modal retrieved results and random noise, shifts the data&#39;s semantics towards outliers, preventing retrieval as neighbors to relevant queries. Additionally, a discriminator and pre-trained model enhance the visual realism and outlier generalization of protected data. Extensive experiments show that PAML outperforms potential baselines in data privacy protection. Ablation analysis validates each component&#39;s effectiveness, and our approach&#39;s variants are applicable to diverse retrieval systems.

Despite the recent progress, most existing approaches either ignore the unsynchronized property of audio-visual tracks or discount the complementary modality for explicit enhancement. We argue that, a modality should provide ample presence evidence for an event, while the complementary modality offers absence evidence as a reference. However, to learn reliable evidence, we face challenging uncertainties caused by weak supervision and the complicated audio-visual data itself. To this end, we propose to collect Probabilistic Presence-Absence Evidence (PPAE) in a unified framework. Specifically, by leveraging uni-modal and cross-modal representations, a probabilistic presence-absence evidence collector (PAEC) is designed. To learn the evidence in a reliable range, we propose a joint-modal mutual learning (JML) process, which calibrates the evidence of diverse audible, visible, and audi-visible events adaptively and dynamically. Extensive experiments show that our method surpasses state-of-the-arts (e.g., absolute gains of $3.1\%$ and $4.2\%$ in terms of event-level audio and visual metrics on the LLP dataset).},

Accordingly, the well-trained model is valuable intellectual property for its owner. However, recent studies revealed the threats of model stealing, where the adversaries can obtain a function-similar copy of the victim model, even when they can only query the model. In this paper, we propose an effective and harmless model ownership verification (MOVE) to defend against different types of model stealing simultaneously, without introducing new security risks. In general, we conduct the ownership verification by verifying whether a suspicious model contains the knowledge of defender-specified external features. Specifically, we embed the external features by modifying a few training samples with style transfer. We then train a meta-classifier to determine whether a model is stolen from the victim. This approach is inspired by the understanding that the stolen models should contain the knowledge of features learned by the victim model. In particular, we develop our MOVE method under both white-box and black-box settings and analyze its theoretical foundation to provide comprehensive model protection. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our method and its resistance to potential adaptive attacks.

  abstract     = {As a cross-topic of multi-view learning and multi-label classification, multi-view multi-label classification has gradually gained traction in recent years. The application of multi-view contrastive learning has further facilitated this process; however, the existing multi-view contrastive learning methods crudely separate the so-called negative pair, which largely results in the separation of samples belonging to the same category or similar ones. Besides, plenty of multi-view multi-label learning methods ignore the possible absence of views and labels. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose an incomplete multi-view missing multi-label classification network named RANK. In this network, a label-driven multi-view contrastive learning strategy is proposed to leverage supervised information to preserve the intra-view structure and perform the cross-view consistency alignment. Furthermore, we break through the view-level weights inherent in existing methods and propose a quality-aware subnetwork to dynamically assign quality scores to each view of each sample. The label correlation information is fully utilized in the final multi-label cross-entropy classification loss, effectively improving the discriminative power. Last but not least, our model is not only able to handle complete multi-view multi-label data, but also works on datasets with missing instances and labels. Extensive experiments confirm that our RANK outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {To address the communication burden issues associated with Federated Learning (FL), Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) discards the central server and establishes a decentralized communication network, where each client communicates only with neighboring clients. However, existing DFL methods still suffer from two major challenges: local inconsistency and local heterogeneous overfitting, which existing DFL methods have not fundamentally addressed. To tackle these issues, we propose novel DFL algorithms, DFedADMM and its enhanced version DFedADMM-SAM, to improve the performance for DFL. The DFedADMM algorithm employs primal-dual optimization (ADMM) by utilizing dual variables to control the model inconsistency raised from the decentralized heterogeneous data distributions. The DFedADMM-SAM algorithm further improves on DFedADMM by employing a Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) optimizer, which uses gradient perturbations to generate locally flat models and searches for models with uniformly low loss values to mitigate local heterogeneous overfitting. Theoretically, we derive convergence rates of $\mathcal {O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{KT}}+\frac{1}{KT(1-\psi )^{2}})$ and $ \mathcal {O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{KT}}+\frac{1}{KT(1-\psi )^{2}}+ \frac{1}{T^{3/2}K^{1/2}})$ in the non-convex setting for DFedADMM and DFedADMM-SAM, respectively, where $1 - \psi$ represents the spectral gap of the gossip matrix. Empirically, extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 datasets demonstrate that our algorithms exhibit superior performance in terms of generalization, convergence speed, and communication overhead compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) optimizers in DFL.},

  abstract     = {The occlusion of the sun by clouds is one of the primary sources of uncertainties in solar power generation, and is a factor that affects the wide-spread use of solar power as a primary energy source. Real-time forecasting of cloud movement and, as a result, solar irradiance is necessary to schedule and allocate energy across grid-connected photovoltaic systems. Previous works monitored cloud movement using wide-angle field of view imagery of the sky. However, such images have poor resolution for clouds that appear near the horizon, which reduces their effectiveness for long term prediction of solar occlusion. Specifically, to be able to predict occlusion of the sun over long time periods, clouds that are near the horizon need to be detected, and their velocities estimated precisely. To enable such a system, we design and deploy a catadioptric system that delivers wide-angle imagery with uniform spatial resolution of the sky over its field of view. To enable prediction over a longer time horizon, we design an algorithm that uses carefully selected spatio-temporal slices of the imagery using estimated wind direction and velocity as inputs. Using ray-tracing simulations as well as a real testbed deployed outdoors, we show that the system is capable of predicting solar occlusion as well as irradiance for tens of minutes in the future, which is an order of magnitude improvement over prior work.},

  abstract     = {Hyperspectral super-resolution is commonly accomplished by the fusing of a hyperspectral imaging of low spatial resolution with a multispectral image of high spatial resolution, and many tensor-based approaches to this task have been recently proposed. Yet, it is assumed in such tensor-based methods that the spatial-blurring operation that creates the observed hyperspectral image from the desired super-resolved image is separable into independent horizontal and vertical blurring. Recent work has argued that such separable spatial degradation is ill-equipped to model the operation of real sensors which may exhibit, for example, anisotropic blurring. To accommodate this fact, a generalized tensor formulation based on a Kronecker decomposition is proposed to handle any general spatial-degradation matrix, including those that are not separable as previously assumed. Analysis of the generalized formulation reveals conditions under which exact recovery of the desired super-resolved image is guaranteed, and a practical algorithm for such recovery, driven by a blockwise-group-sparsity regularization, is proposed. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed generalized tensor approach outperforms not only traditional matrix-based techniques but also state-of-the-art tensor-based methods; the gains with respect to the latter are especially significant in cases of anisotropic spatial blurring.},

To address these issues, we propose UPAM, a novel framework to evaluate the robustness of T2I models from an attack perspective. Unlike prior methods that focus solely on textual defenses, UPAM unifies the attack on both textual and visual defenses. Additionally, it enables gradient-based optimization, overcoming reliance on enumeration for improved efficiency and effectiveness. To handle cases where T2I models block image outputs due to defenses, we introduce Sphere-Probing Learning (SPL) to enable optimization even without image results. Following SPL, our model bypasses defenses, inducing the generation of harmful content. To ensure semantic alignment with attacker intent, we propose Semantic-Enhancing Learning (SEL) for precise semantic control. UPAM also prioritizes the naturalness of adversarial prompts using In-context Naturalness Enhancement (INE), making them harder for human examiners to detect. Additionally, we address the issue of iterative queries–common in prior methods and easily detectable by API defenders–by introducing Transferable Attack Learning (TAL), allowing effective attacks with minimal queries. Extensive experiments validate UPAM&#39;s superiority in effectiveness, efficiency, naturalness, and low query detection rates.},

  abstract     = {The research of class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS) seeks to enhance semantic segmentation methods by enabling the progressive learning of new classes while preserving knowledge of previously learned ones. A significant yet often neglected challenge in this domain is class imbalance. In CISS, each task focuses on different foreground classes, with the training set for each task exclusively comprising images that contain these currently focused classes. This results in an overrepresentation of these classes within the single-task training set, leading to a classification bias towards them. To address this issue, we propose a novel CISS method named STAR, whose core principle is to reintegrate the missing proportions of previous classes into current single-task training samples by replaying their prototypes. Moreover, we develop a prototype deviation technique that enables the deduction of past-class prototypes, integrating the recognition patterns of the classifiers and the extraction patterns of the feature extractor. With this technique, replay can be accomplished without using any storage to save prototypes. Complementing our method, we devise two loss functions to enforce cross-task feature constraints: the Old-Class Features Maintaining (OCFM) loss and the Similarity-Aware Discriminative (SAD) loss. The OCFM loss is designed to stabilize the feature space of old classes, thus preserving previously acquired knowledge without compromising the ability to learn new classes. The SAD loss aims to enhance feature distinctions between similar old and new class pairs, minimizing potential confusion. Our experiments on two public datasets, Pascal VOC 2012 and ADE20 K, demonstrate that our STAR achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

The memory-intensive embedding layers of recommendation systems are the crucial performance bottleneck, with operations manifesting as sparse memory lookups and simple reduction computations. Recent studies propose near-memory processing (NMP) architectures to speed up embedding operations by utilizing high internal memory bandwidth. However, these solutions typically employ a fixed vector partitioning strategy that fail to adapt to changes in data center deployment scenarios and lack practicality. We propose Flips, a flexible partitioning strategy NMP architecture that accelerates embedding layers. Flips supports more than ten partitioning strategies through hardware-software co-design. Novel hardware architectures and address mapping schemes are designed for the memory-side and host-side. We provide two approaches to determine the optimal partitioning strategy for each embedding table, enabling the architecture to accommodate changes in deployment scenarios. Importantly, Flips is decoupled from the NMP level and can utilize rank-level, bank-group-level and bank-level parallelism. In peer-level NMP evaluations, Flips outperforms state-of-the-art NMP solutions, RecNMP, TRiM, and ReCross by up to 4.0×, 4.1×, and 3.5×, respectively.},

Traditional learning systems rely on centralized training and inference, which poses serious privacy and security concerns. To solve this problem, distributed learning over wireless edge networks (DLWENs) emerges as a trending solution and has attracted increasing research interests. In DLWENs, corresponding services need to be placed onto the edge servers to process the distributed tasks. Apparently, different placement of training services can significantly affect the performance of all distributed learning tasks. In this paper, we propose TASP, a task-aware service placement scheme for distributed learning in wireless edge networks. By carefully considering the structures (directed acyclic graphs) of the distributed learning tasks, the fine-grained task requests and inter-task dependencies are incorporated into the placement strategies to realize the parallel computation of learning services. We also exploit queuing theory to characterize the dynamics caused by task uncertainties. Extensive experiments based on the Alibaba ML dataset show that, compared to the state-of-the-art schemes, the proposed work reduces the overall delay of distributed learning tasks by 38.6% on average.},

Virtual machine placement (VMP) has been heavily investigated as a way to provide flexible and scalable cloud services in an energy efficient way in data centers. However, due to a more complex and diversified tendency of applications, VMP suffer from waste of resources and bottlenecks for accommodating diversified VM&#39;s resource demands due to unbalanced utilization of multi-resource. To investigate joint optimization of power consumption and multi-dimensional resources utilization, in this paper, we present a bi-objective optimization model for virtual machine placement. Unfortunately, solving such a large-scale bi-objective model involves a challenge in the trade off between performance and time complexity.To this end, an improved decomposition-based multi-objective evolutionary (MOEA/D) algorithm based on $\varepsilon$-domination, termed $\varepsilon$-IMOEA/D-M2M is designed to provide solutions for the proposed optimization problem. Compared with both heuristics and evolutionary based algorithms, the performance evaluation shows that our proposal reduces power consumption and balances multidimensional resources while significantly reducing running time.},

Unfortunately, the existing solutions fall short of achieving this design objective, which we argue, is largely attributed to the fact that they fail to take the query fanout explicitly into account. In this paper, we propose TailGuard based on a Tail-latency-SLO-and-Fanout-aware Earliest-Deadline-First Queuing policy (TF-EDFQ) for task queuing at individual task servers the query tasks are fanned out to. With the task pre-dequeuing time deadline for each task being derived based on both query tail latency SLO and query fanout, TailGuard takes an important first step towards achieving the design objective. A query admission control scheme is also developed to provide tail latency SLO guarantee in the presence of resource shortages. TailGuard is evaluated against First-In-First-Out (FIFO) task queuing, task PRIority Queuing (PRIQ) and Tail-latency-SLO-aware EDFQ (T-EDFQ) policies by both simulation and testing in the Amazon EC2 cloud. It is driven by three types of applications in the Tailbench benchmark suite, featuring web search, in-memory key-value store, and transactional database applications. The results demonstrate that TailGuard can significantly improve resource utilization (e.g., up to 80% compared to FIFO), while also meeting the targeted tail latency SLOs, as compared with the other three policies. TailGuard is also implemented and tested in a highly heterogeneous Sensing-$a$s-a-Service (SaS) testbed for a data sensing service, demonstrating performance gains of up to 33%. These results are consistent with both the simulation and Amazon EC2 results.},

However, FL faces significant challenges such as data heterogeneity and resource-constraint edge devices for model training and analysis, leading to accuracy degradation and bias in model performance. To address these critical issues, we propose a novel FL strategy named FedTune-SGM, designed to optimize model training in decentralized settings. In this strategy, a cloud-based model is initially trained and fine-tuned on the edge devices with additional layers tailored to the specific data characteristics. This fine-tuning process effectively mitigates the impact of data heterogeneity, enhancing the robustness and generalization capability of the model. FedTune-SGM employs a strategic weighting mechanism that ensures a balanced and equitable contribution from participating edge devices to prevent dominant influences from resource-rich devices and promote a fairer and more accurate aggregated model. Additionally, the proposed strategy integrates a Stackelberg Game model to foster an interactive and dynamic cloud-edge setup that motivates edge devices to invest more effort in model training and ensures the effectiveness of resource-constraint edge devices. Extensive experiments conducted on three diverse datasets highlight the superior performance of the proposed FedTune-SGM strategy compared to state-of-the-art FL techniques in terms of accuracy and robustness while meeting the critical challenges of data heterogeneity and resource limitations in FL environments. Through these innovations, FedTune-SGM paves the way for more reliable and efficient distributed learning systems, unlocking the full potential of FL in practical applications.},

  abstract     = {As one of the pillars in cluster computing frameworks, coflow scheduling algorithms can effectively shorten the network transmission time of cluster computing jobs, thus reducing the job completion times and improving the execution performance. However, most of existing coflow scheduling algorithms failed to consider the influences of concurrent flows, which can degrade their performance under a massive number of concurrent flows. To fill the gap, we propose a unified communication agent named Courier to minimize the number of concurrent flows in cluster computing applications, which is compatible with the mainstream coflow scheduling approaches. To maintain the scheduling order given by the scheduling algorithms, Courier merges multiple flows between each pair of hosts into a unified flow, and determines its order based on that of origin flows. In addition, in order to adapt to various types of topologies, Courier introduces a control mechanism to adjust the number of flows while maintaining the scheduling order. Extensive large-scale trace-driven simulations have shown that Courier is compatible with existing scheduling algorithms, and outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by about 30% under a variety of workloads and topologies.},

  abstract     = {The cyclical and continuous working characteristics of Internet of Things (IoT) devices make a large amount of the same or similar data, which can significantly consume storage space. To solve this problem, various secure data deduplication schemes have been proposed. However, existing deduplication schemes only perform deduplication based on data similarity, ignoring the internal connection among devices, making the existing schemes not directly applicable to parallel and distributed scenarios like IoT. Furthermore, since secure data deduplication leads to multiple users sharing same encryption key, which may lead to security issues. To this end, we propose a device relationship-based IoT data deduplication scheme that fully considers the IoT data characteristics and devices internal connections. Specifically, we propose a device relationship prediction approach, which can obtain device collaborative relationships by clustering the topology of their communication graph, and classifies the data types based on device relationships to achieve data deduplication with different security levels. Then, we design a similarity-preserving encryption algorithm, so that the security level of encryption key is determined by the data type, ensuring the security of the deduplicated data. In addition, two different data deduplication methods, identical deduplication and similar deduplication, have been designed to meet the privacy requirement of different data types, improving the efficiency of deduplication while ensuring data privacy as much as possible. We evaluate the performance of our scheme using five real datasets, and the results show that our scheme has favorable results in terms of both deduplication performance and computational cost.},

However, incorporating the numerous activity modes in real-world ambulation often requires high-dimensional feature spaces and restrictions on the leg leading each transition. This paper addresses these challenges by delegating sit/stand transitions and variable-incline walking to the mid-level controller, effectively reducing the classification space to four states with easily distinguishable features. We implement simple heuristic rules for both prosthetic-led and intact-led (i.e., ambilateral) transitions, using lower-limb kinematic features, ground contact and inclination, and environmental distance from an ultrasonic sensor. Two transfemoral amputee subjects using a powered knee-ankle prosthesis demonstrated an ambilateral transition accuracy of 99.2% under both self-paced and rapid-paced/fatiguing conditions, with a 100% recovery rate due to backup logic or user-cued resets. The incline estimator enabled the prosthesis to continuously adapt between level and inclined surfaces without explicit classification. These results and an outdoor multi-terrain demonstration indicate that simple and straightforward transition logic can enable powered prosthetic legs to be used reliably across a broad array of daily activities.},

Existing hip exoskeletons that assist in both the sagittal and frontal planes are too heavy and bulky for use in the real world. Here we present the kinematic model, mechatronic design, and benchtop and human testing of a powered hip exoskeleton with a unique parallel kinematic actuator. The exoskeleton is lightweight (5.3 kg), has a slim profile, and can generate 30 Nm and 20 Nm of torque during gait in the sagittal and frontal planes. The exoskeleton torque density is 5.7 Nm/kg—53% higher than previously possible with series kinematic design. Testing with five healthy subjects indicate that frontal plane torques applied during stance or swing can alter step width, while sagittal plane torque can assist with hip flexion and extension.

A novel hierarchical optimal control strategy was recently introduced to achieve performance-optimal tracking under static and strict priority constraints. However, in complex and dynamic environments, robots must possess the capability to switch hierarchical behaviors online to adapt to varying operational scenarios. Existing continuous priority-switching methods often sacrifice hierarchical control performance and fail to asymptotically track the hierarchical optimal trajectory. In this paper, a continuously shaping prioritized Jacobian algorithm is proposed and integrated into a newly developed continuous hierarchical optimal control framework with priority transitions. This approach not only ensures optimal control performance but also facilitates continuous priority switching. The continuity and accuracy of the proposed algorithm, as well as the bounded stability of the closed-loop system state variables, are thoroughly analyzed in this work. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through simulations and experiments on the Franka Emika Panda robot.},

At the core of the algorithm, a probabilistic model learns the dependence between the policy parameters and the robot learning objective not only by performing experiments on the robot, but also by leveraging data from a simulator. This substantially reduces interaction time with the robot. Using the model, we can guarantee improvements with high probability for each policy update, thereby facilitating fast, goal-oriented learning. We evaluate our algorithm on simulated fine-tuning tasks and demonstrate the data-efficiency of the proposed dual-information source optimization algorithm.

  abstract     = {Achieving accurate closed-loop position control of soft robots remains an ongoing research problem, due to the challenges posed by underactuation, elastic nonlinearities, and material creep. Although soft driving technologies relying on tendons and smart material transducers (e.g., dielectric elastomers, shape memory alloys) offer more ease of controllability compared to pneumatics, the corresponding controller design problem becomes even more challenging because of additional nonlinear effects. Those include a configuration-dependent actuation matrix, that stems from the kinematics of the actuation, and control input saturation, which is especially critical for smart material actuators. In this paper, we investigate for the first time the closed-loop position control of a soft robotic system driven by dielectric elastomer actuators. The objective is to regulate the robot state to a constant setpoint, accounting for the effects of open-loop instability, underactuation, control input saturation, and constant external disturbances. To achieve this goal, we propose a model-based feedback scheme which combines a stabilizing energy-shaping controller with a robustifying PI- like law. After presenting the general theory, a linear matrix inequalities algorithm is proposed to practically address the controller design in spite of strong model nonlinearities. Experimental validation conducted on a prototype of the soft robotic system confirms the effectiveness of the proposed control approach.},

Additionally, the specific dynamics of robot models poses new nonlinear and nonholonomic challenges. To solve these problems, a containment control law is proposed first for double- integrator MRSs subject to non-uniform time-varying delays. In contrast to impractical uniform delays, non-uniform time-varying delays are considered more deeply from the perspective of the Laplace matrix in this paper. The stability is proved by the Lyapunov-Krasovskii function and linear matrix inequalities. The proposed control law is further refined into a dual-loop structure for multi-nonholonomic-mobile-robot systems (NHMRSs), addressing the problem of nonholonomic constraints. Specifically, the first loop decouples the control inputs in a finite time, and then the nonholonomic robot models are regarded as linear models, which facilitates the proof of system stability. The effectiveness of the above two control laws is validated through simulations and experiments. Under these containment control laws, followers in the system reach the convex hull formed by leaders and meet the convergence objective despite the constraint of non-uniform time-varying delays.},

  abstract     = {Global localization using onboard perception sensors, such as cameras and LiDARs, is crucial in autonomous driving and robotics applications when GPS signals are unreliable. Most approaches achieve global localization by sequential place recognition (PR) and pose estimation (PE). Some methods train separate models for each task, while others employ a single model with dual heads, trained jointly with separate task-specific losses. However, the accuracy of localization heavily depends on the success of place recognition, which often fails in scenarios with significant changes in viewpoint or environmental appearance. Consequently, this renders the final pose estimation of localization ineffective. To address this, we introduce a new paradigm, PR-by-PE localization, which bypasses the need for separate place recognition by directly deriving it from pose estimation. We propose RING#, an end-to-end PR-by-PE localization network that operates in the bird&#39;s-eye-view (BEV) space, compatible with both vision and LiDAR sensors. RING# incorporates a novel design that learns two equivariant representations from BEV features, enabling globally convergent and computationally efficient pose estimation. Comprehensive experiments on the NCLT and Oxford datasets show that RING# outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both vision and LiDAR modalities, validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Many related works exclude the control of the end&#39;s orientation, i.e., only the end&#39;s position is considered. In this paper, a differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) model-based instantaneous optimal control (IOC) framework for the end&#39;s position and orientation cooperative tracking of a cable-driven tensegrity continuum robot (TCR) is developed. Based on the tensegrity concept, a TCR is designed first as the control object, which can achieve multimode deformations such as bending, scoliosis, contraction, and the S- or J-shape. Then, the actuation of cables is introduced as the system kinematic constraints from the view of multibody dynamics, so that a control-oriented model of the TCR can be built by DAEs. Subsequently, the original continuous trajectory tracking problem is approximated for a series of IOC problems at each discrete time slot. Finally, considering the constraints of control input saturation, a linear complementarity problem (LCP) was derived for solving these IOC problems. The method provides an easy-to-implement and unified framework for addressing the trajectory tracking control issues of cable-driven continuum robots, which can improve the control performance of the position-only tracking controllers and exploit the TCR&#39;s advantages to handle more application scenarios. The advanced performance and potential applications of the proposed controller have been evaluated via several numerical simulations and experiments on the TCR prototype.},

Second, we derive an iterative optimal control algorithm for trajectory optimization with the kernel metric. Numerical benchmarks show our method is two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art method. Finally, we demonstrate the proposed algorithm with a peg-in-hole insertion task. We formulate the problem as a coverage task in the space of SE(3) and use a 30-second-long human demonstration as the prior distribution for ergodic coverage. Ergodicity guarantees the asymptotic solution of the peg-in-hole problem so long as the solution resides within the prior information distribution, which is seen in the 100% success rate.},

However, mastering this feat poses a considerable challenge for robotic fliers, especially to perform dynamic perching with rapid body rotations (or flips) and landing against gravity. Inverted landing in flies have suggested that optical flow senses are closely linked to the precise triggering and control of body flips that lead to a variety of successful landing behaviors. Building upon this knowledge, we aimed to replicate the flies&#39; landing behaviors in small quadcopters by developing a control policy general to arbitrary ceiling-approach conditions. First, we employed reinforcement learning in simulation to optimize discrete sensory-motor pairs across a broad spectrum of ceiling-approach velocities and directions. Next, we converted the sensory-motor pairs to a two-stage control policy in a continuous optical flow space augmented by ceiling distance measurement. The control policy consists of a first-stage Flip-Trigger Policy, which employs a one-class support vector machine, and a second-stage Flip-Action Policy, implemented as a feed-forward neural network. To transfer the inverted-landing policy to physical systems, we utilized domain randomization and system identification techniques for a zero-shot sim-to-real transfer with emulated optical flow using external motion tracking. As a result, we successfully achieved a range of robust inverted-landing behaviors in small quadcopters, emulating those observed in flies.},

  abstract     = {Learning multi-object dynamics purely from visual data is challenging due to the need for robust object representations that can be learned through robot interactions. In previous work [1] we introduced two novel architectures: SlotTransport for discovering object-centric representations from singleview RGB images, referred to as slots, and SlotGNN for predicting scene dynamics from singleview RGB images and robot interactions using the discovered slots. This paper introduces InvSlotGNN, a novel framework for learning multiview slot discovery and dynamics that are invariant to the camera viewpoint. First, we demonstrate that SlotTransport can be trained on multiview data such that a single model discovers temporally aligned, object-centric representations from a wide range of different camera angles. These slots bind to objects from various viewpoints, even under occlusion or absence. Next, we introduce InvSlotGNN, an extension of SlotGNN, that learns multi-object dynamics invariant to the camera angle and predicts the future state from observations taken by uncalibrated cameras. InvSlotGNN learns a graph representation of the scene using the slots from SlotTransport and performs relational and spatial reasoning to predict the future state of the scene for arbitrary viewpoints, conditioned on robot actions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SlotTransport in learning multiview object-centric features that accurately encode visual and positional information. Furthermore, we highlight the accuracy of InvSlotGNN in downstream robotic tasks, including long-horizon prediction and multi-object rearrangement. Finally, with minimal real data, our framework robustly predicts slots and their dynamics in real-world multiview scenarios. Our project page: https://bit.ly/InvSlotGNN.},

Although exoskeletons have been developed for numerous land-based scenarios, their application in underwater diving remains unexplored. This paper proposes a soft underwater lower-limb exosuit designed to assist three aquatic movements: flutter kick, breaststroke kick, and underwater walk. We presented the mechanical design of the exosuit that is capable of assisting bidirectional leg movements in full kicking/gait cycle, while ensuring natural leg mobility without impeding normal leg function. A cascade force integral controller is also designed to resolve issues related to uncontrollable states and stiffness variations within the system. To verify the assistive performance of the system, experiments were conducted with nine participants to assess how the proposed exosuit aids in reducing metabolic cost across various motion patterns and frequencies. The findings indicate that the underwater exosuit effectively reduces the air consumption rate by $29.77\pm 7.68$% during flutter kick, $25.70\pm 5.99$% during breaststroke kick, and $18.35\pm 4.53$% during underwater walk.},

It is then utilized to develop a heuristics distributed coverage control strategy for a heterogeneous sensor network, adaptively balancing the workload based on each sensor&#39;s current unused capacity.

The aquatic surface robots move quickly without penetrating the water-air interface and utilize incoordinate propulsive force from asymmetric footpads to realize precise trajectory control. An ultrafast linear speed of 21.82 BL/s (24 cm/s) and a high angular speed of 303 °/s are achieved, which are advanced among small aquatic surface robots. We showcase agility and maneuverability by navigating through a water maze with a total route length of 88 cm in an actual driving time of 16.5 seconds. Moreover, proof-of-concept for search and rescue operations is demonstrated by using a robot to tow an on-water monitoring system to record a real-time video showing the “SOS” symbol.

  abstract     = {Generating optimal excitation trajectories is crucial for ensuring that the observation matrix is well-conditioned in robot dynamic identification. This task is a typical optimization problem involving explicit physical constraints defined by initial conditions (zero initial joint velocity and acceleration) and physical limits (joint position, velocity, and acceleration within specified bounds). Physical constraints complicate problem-solving, necessitating the use of heuristic or gradient-based iteration methods. Despite extensive study of this problem over many years, the success rate of finding feasible solutions that do not violate physical constraints within a limited number of iteration steps is lower than desired, and two major challenges remain: 1) a low success rate and 2) high time consumption, which adversely affect practical applications. This article presents an analytical approach to address these physical constraints in optimization. Feasible solutions are ensured through a deterministic calculation of the Fourier series-based parameterization rather than relying on iterative searches. Specifically, initial conditions are met by assigning offsets directly, while scaling and central-translation operations ensure adherence to physical limits. Our approach achieves a 100% success rate in generating physically executable excitation trajectories. Extensive experiments indicate that our approach has improved optimization efficiency by an order of magnitude compared to available methods, while delivering excellent excitation performance. For practitioners, our method renders excitation optimization a viable approach for time-critical payload identification tasks.},

With prior information about the unexplored area&#39;s outline from the real-time shared BEV, the UGV can carry out more efficient and informed exploration from a global perspective.

In this work, we aim to improve results in all of these subfields with the novel approach of multi-source training. Multi-source training relies on the availability of various datasets at training time. To overcome the common obstacles in multi-source training, we introduce the coarse labels and call the newly created multi-source dataset COLA.

The design reported here uses image processing from cameras placed inside steerable compliant rollers to track contact conditions and locations. Integration of this data into a controller enables a variety of robust in-hand manipulation capabilities. We demonstrate that the same information can be used to reconstruct object shape. In addition, we show that by converting in-hand manipulation from a discontinuous process, with fingers frequently attaching and detaching from the object surface, to a continuous process, we can implement a convergent control loop that minimizes errors that otherwise accumulate during large object motions. The difference is apparent when comparing the results of an object rotation using a discontinuous finger-gaiting approach, as would be required without rolling fingertips, to the results obtained with continuous rolling.

  abstract     = {Magnetic microrobots have garnered significant attention and hold great potential for biomedical research applications. However, achieving precise manipulation in vivo poses significant challenges, particularly in medical image-based real-time feedback control, because it is difficult for a visual camera to track the motion of magnetic microrobots inside the body in biomedical applications. To realize the precise control of magnetic microrobots, it is also necessary to design and implement a simple and powerful control method. This approach allows for avoiding resource-intensive and complex control strategies. In this paper, we present a learning-based real-time control method utilizing ultrasound images. Inspired by the ADboost concept, we use a reinforcement learning approach to integrate two simple control methods: a Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller and a guiding vector field controller. We develop a novel Q-learning method called average Q-learning that incorporates average operation and n-step bootstraps. Its primary objective is to dynamically adjust the outputs of the different simple controllers. While each controller individually offers a straightforward solution, their integration contributes to a powerful control approach. To demonstrate its scalability, a non-smooth path is utilized to investigate the integration performance of three simple controllers. In addition, we enhance a classic segmentation module, U-net, by incorporating an atrous spatial pyramid pooling module. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed control method, we conduct simulations and experiments using various planar paths. The quantitative analysis of the results demonstrates the efficacy of our approach in achieving precise manipulation, leveraging real-time control based on medical images for magnetic microrobots. Overall, this study provides a preliminary investigation into the field of medical image-based precise manipulation of magnetic microrobots in vivo applications.},

For this purpose, we consider a maximum consensus formulation of the registration problem and reformulate it as a (large) maximal clique search in a correspondence graph, where a clique represents a complete rigid transformation. Specifically, we use a maximum clique algorithm to enumerate large maximal cliques and a fitness procedure that evaluates each clique by solving a least-squares optimization problem. The main advantages of our approach are $i)$ it is possible to exploit the cutting-edge optimization techniques employed by current exact maximum clique algorithms, such as partial maximum satisfiability-based bounds, branching by partitioning or the use of bitstrings, etc.; $ii)$ the correspondence graphs are expected to be sparse in real problems (confirmed empirically in our tests), and, consequently, the maximum clique problem is expected to be easy; $iii)$ it is possible to have a good control of suboptimality with a k-nearest neighbor analysis that determines the size of the correspondence graph as a function of $k$. The new algorithm is called CliReg and has been implemented in C++. To evaluate CliReg, we have carried out extensive tests both on synthetic and real public datasets. The results show that CliReg clearly dominates the state of the art (e.g., RANSAC, FGR, and TEASER++) in terms of robustness, with a running time comparable to TEASER++ and RANSAC. In addition, we have implemented a fast variant called CliRegMutual that performs similarly to the fastest heuristic FGR.},

  abstract     = {Teleoperated medical robots have the potential to revolutionize healthcare. However, when developing systems for tasks like remote palpation, state-of-the-art literature still uses test phantoms of oversimplified geometries, due to the complexity of the required mechanical robot-patient interaction. In reality, human bodies have complex 3D shapes and require fine-tuning of all 6 manipulator&#39;s degrees of freedom, controlled by the user. In this paper, we argue that the implementation of depth-vision-driven autonomous dimensionality-reduction (DVD ADR) shared control can greatly improve the users&#39; performance. The proposed control method keeps the user in control of the end-effector&#39;s position, while automatically adjusting its orientation in order to maintain the tactile sensor normal to the phantom&#39;s surface. A depth camera and a computer vision algorithm are used to infer the phantom&#39;s shape and achieve DVD ADR shared control. Experimental results showcase how this leads to statistically significant performance improvement. Not only were the participants able to achieve more precise palpations, with up to $29.5\%$ and $22.4\%$ more accuracy in position and orientation, respectively, but the DVD ADR shared control allowed them to achieve a $8.8\%$ better detection accuracy while needing $13.8\%$ less time. The above-mentioned results are all tested for statistical significance and achieved a p-value lower than 0.05.},

  abstract     = {Inter-robot relative positions are crucial for executing various multi-robot missions, such as formation maneuvering and collaborative inspection. However, the current sensing technology only provides part of relative position information, such as inter-robot distances, bearings and angles. This prompts the study of determining inter-robot relative positions, i.e., relative localization, from these partial measurements. Based on the existing results of static networks&#39; localizability and mobile networks&#39; relative localization, we propose a novel concept, relative localizability to describe whether a multi-robot system is relatively localizable. Given each robot&#39;s self-displacement measurements and inter-robot partial measurements in $d$ ($d\leq 4$) sampling instants, we show that a multi-robot system&#39;s relative localization can be achieved in a purely algebraic and distributed manner, in which the multi-robot system is said to be $d$-step relatively localizable. To make the results more general, we consider that a) the multi-robot system consists of landmarks, leaders and followers, b) and the inter-robot measurements can be distances, bearings or angles. When robots&#39; coordinate frames have different orientations, we show that the given local measurements can be used to determine robots&#39; relative positions and their coordinate frames&#39; relative orientations simultaneously. Simulations and experiments of relative localization for ground robots are conducted to validate the obtained results.},

In this work, we present an innovative exploration strategy to simultaneously detect symmetries in a 3D object and use this information to enhance shape estimation. This is achieved by leveraging a novel formulation of Gaussian Process models that allows the modeling of symmetric surfaces. Our procedure does not assume any prior knowledge about the object, neither about its shape nor about the presence and type of symmetry, necessitating only an approximate estimate of the size and boundaries (bounding box). We report experimental results both in simulation and in the real world, showing that using symmetric models leads to a reduction in shape estimation error, exploration time, and in the number of physical contacts performed by a robot when exploring objects that have symmetries.},

  abstract     = {Wheel-legged planetary rovers possess superb locomotion capabilities. This paper combines an offline, predefined motion planning library with online path planning, integrating energy consumption and probabilistic aspects of the robotic system. The primary focus is on addressing the planning challenges in dense environments, where the distance between any adjacent obstacles is smaller than the width of the prototype. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the interaction between the prototype and the environment. Firstly, the GF (Generalized Function) set theory and configuration topology theory are utilized to mathematically describe the motions of multi-limbed systems. Based on the representation, an offline planning library is established. Secondly, the MDP (Markov Decision Processes)- based path planning method is extended by incorporating the platform&#39;s geometry and locomotion capabilities. The concept of “LTR (Limb Travel Relevant) nodes” is introduced. To address the numerous iteration problem, the Informed VI (Informed Value Iteration) algorithm is proposed. Thirdly, a multi-layered map is evaluated to further enhance computational efficiency. Finally, the proposed algorithm is implemented on the TAWL (Terrain Adaptive Wheel-Legged) rover. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is capable of finding the optimal path with high computational efficiency, and it exhibits excellent adaptability on non-uniform maps},

  abstract     = {LiDARs are widely used for mapping and localization in dynamic environments. However, their high cost limits their widespread adoption. On the other hand, monocular localization in LiDAR maps using inexpensive cameras is a cost-effective alternative for large-scale deployment. Nevertheless, most existing approaches struggle to generalize to new sensor setups and environments, requiring retraining or fine-tuning. In this paper, we present CMRNext, a novel approach for camera-LIDAR matching that is independent of sensor-specific parameters, generalizable, and can be used in the wild for monocular localization in LiDAR maps and camera-LiDAR extrinsic calibration. CMRNext exploits recent advances in deep neural networks for matching cross-modal data and standard geometric techniques for robust pose estimation. We reformulate the point-pixel matching problem as an optical flow estimation problem and solve the Perspective-n-Point problem based on the resulting correspondences to find the relative pose between the camera and the LiDAR point cloud. We extensively evaluate CMRNext on six different robotic platforms, including three publicly available datasets and three in-house robots. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that CMRNext outperforms existing approaches on both tasks and effectively generalizes to previously unseen environments and sensor setups in a zero-shot manner.

A stable haptic interface is always needed while the human operator interacts with the robot. Passivity-based approaches have been widely utilised in the control design as a sufficient condition for stability. However, it is a conservative approach which therefore sacrifices performance to maintain stability. This paper proposes a novel concept to characterise an ultimately passive system, which can achieve the boundedness of the energy in the steady-state. A so-called Ultimately Passive Controller (UPC) is then proposed. This algorithm switches the system between a nominal mode for keeping desired performance and a conservative mode when needed to remain stable. An experimental evaluation on two robotic systems, one admittance-based and one impedance-based, demonstrates the potential interest of the proposed framework compared to existing approaches. The results demonstrate the possibility of UPC in finding a more aggressive trade-off between haptic performance and system stability, while still providing a stability guarantee.},

Subsequently, an adaptive power-law algorithm is designed to realize local FXT optimization for each agent with arbitrary initial state. In the convergence analysis, unlike previous analysis method based on Lyapunov FXT stability criteria, this study employs the definition of FXT stability with Laplace transformation and a method of contradiction, several sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure that the states of all agents converge to the global optimal value within a fixed time, and the upper bound of convergence time is estimated. Furthermore, these adaptive algorithms on undirected graphs are extended to weight-balanced digraphs. Finally, the validity of the proposed edge-based adaptive distributed algorithms is demonstrated through numerical simulations of two packet-level charge-state balance problems.},

Hence, a novel modeling approach is proposed for constructing CBRBS in the aim of providing a better XAI, in which a joint optimization model is proposed first to describe the mathematical model of parameter and structure optimization, and the corresponding algorithm is further designed to automatically achieve the joint optimization of CBRBS. Afterward, a domain-based calculation method of synthesis factor is proposed to develop a new rule synthesis method for CBRBS, which not only achieves the reduction of inefficient and inconsistent rules but also takes into account interpretability and generalization ability. In experimental analysis, the proposed modeling approach is employed to construct CBRBS for handling rice taste assessment and benchmark classification problems. The comparison results show that the proposed approach makes it possible for CBRBS to achieve a good balance between model complexity and inference accuracy. More importantly, the resulting CBRBS has better accuracy and lower complexity than some existing rule-based systems and classical classifiers.},

Then, optimal speed regulation problem for PMSM is equivalently transformed into an optimal control problem for the error system. Given the presence of model variable couplings, an adaptive dynamic programming method is adopted to derive the optimal controller, where a critic neural network (NN) and an actor NN are used to approximate the cost function and the optimal controller, respectively. Notably, this article addresses the simultaneous occurrence of disturbances and actuator faults within the optimal control framework by designing separate treatments. Eventually, a composite controller, fulfilling optimality, robustness and safety constraints, is presented with rigorous proof via Lyapunov method.

Kinematic calibration (KC) is well-known as a vital technique in APA-promoting tasks. However, existing KC models generally adopt a single distance-oriented Loss, e.g., an L2 norm-oriented one that neglects the featured Lp norms. In response to this critical issue, this study presents an Adaptive p-norms-oriented Kinematic Calibration (ApKC) model on the basis of threefold ideas: 1) studying the effects of diversified Lp norms on the industrial robot calibration performance; 2) combining multiple Lp norms to obtain the aggregated loss with the hybrid effects by different norms; and 3) implementing the weight adaptation on the norm components of the aggregated loss, and rigorously prove its ensemble capability benefiting the calibration performance. Afterwards, a novel Newton interpolated Adaptive Differential Evolution (NADE) algorithm is further proposed to optimize the ApKC model. Empirical studies on an HRS JR680 industrial robot demonstrate that the achieved ApKC-NADE calibrator can significantly reduce the robot’s maximum positioning error from 4.610 to 0.856 mm. It can vigorously support the high-accuracy application of industrial robots.},

  abstract     = {This article extends the problem of safety of the intended functionality (SOTIF) to the platooning of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). In such multivehicle systems, SOTIF objectives are particularly challenging, since new issues arise due to the presence of interactions that propagate and intensify the effects and the risk connected to faults/failures/uncertainties, triggered by any platoon member and external conditions. To tackle and solve the SOTIF-oriented platoon control problem, we propose a robust and resilient decentralized control protocol, based on distributed observer which exploits the information shared via the Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication network. The approach allows maintaining acceptable SOTIF performance in adversarial conditions, mitigating the effects of the unreasonable risks originated from sensors/actuators performance limitations/faults and disturbances. The uniformly ultimate bounded (UUB) stability and the input-to-state string stability (ISSS) of the platoon dynamics are analytically proved via the Lyapunov theory. Feasible linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are obtained as stability conditions, whose solution allows adapting the distributed control/observer gains according to leader-tracking performance and robustness margins. A detailed analysis via the vehicular co-simulation platform mixed traffic simulator (MiTraS) corroborates the theoretical derivations and shows the achievement of the SOTIF platoon goals for a set of nontrivial and uncertain driving scenarios.},

  abstract     = {In the article, a stabilized issue for complex-valued hybrid stochastic multilinks networks (CHSMNs) is investigated under event-triggered control (E-TC). In contrast to existing literature, the proposed E-TC defines the event-triggered instant sequence as the random sequence rather than the number sequence, which is more accurate concerning hybrid stochastic systems. Especially, a modified more general event-triggered function is proposed. After the Zeno behavior is eliminated by the contradiction, several stabilized conditions are established to guarantee the input-to-state stability and exponential stability in the mean square and almost surely exponential stability of CHSMNs, where studying in the complex domain and no splitting real and imaginary parts. Subsequently, we analyze the lower bound of the event-triggered intervals for E-TC in the sense of mathematical expectation. Whereafter, the stabilized problem for the Cohen–Grossberg neural networks (CSDLCNs) and the islanded micro grid model (IMGM) is considered as an application. Meanwhile, numerical simulations are presented for verification.},

Specifically, a more generalized semi-Markov process (SMP) that is governed by a higher-level deterministic switching signal (HLDSS) is addressed. A novel dynamic ETM is skillfully developed based on the information of quantization and two internal dynamic adjusting variables to further enhance the network bandwidth utilization. The dual asynchronous phenomenon between the plant and controller (asynchronous modes and mismatched premise variables) is addressed. This implies that the designed controller is not required to share the same membership functions and modes as the plant, establishing a more rational structure. The hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) is attained to characterize the stochastic varying channel fading amplitudes. The Lyapunov function incorporating mode and fuzzy information is constructed to establish sufficient criteria ensuring the strictly dissipative performance and mean-square exponential stability (MSES) of the resulting closed-loop systems, and a new security fuzzy dual asynchronous controller is then developed. Finally, the efficacy and applicability of the results are demonstrated through numerical and practical examples.},

During real-time information exchange among agents, communication failures between agents occur randomly, which may result in each possible network topology occurring with a certain probability, and its sojourn time is also stochastic. This necessitates the consideration of a more general switching signal to describe the stochastic switching phenomenon of networks. In pursuit of this goal, a semi-Markov chain is introduced to characterize the switching signal of stochastic interaction networks, whose sojourn time distribution allows for arbitrary continuous-time distribution and depends on the current and next state. Additionally, this article delves into the impact of two distinct types of DoS attacks on MASs. The first type involves random DoS attacks, which are also modeled by a semi-Markov chain to capture the stochastic nature of attack durations. The second type is deterministic DoS attacks, characterized by their frequency and duration. The proposed new stochastic analysis method, based on the law of large numbers, is used to analyze the ASC for MASs featuring SMSNs under the DoS attacks. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by evaluating the results obtained from two illustrative numerical examples.},

First, under hybrid stochastic faults, an observer is constructed to estimate all states, which converts the process stochastic faults into a processable form. Second, an event-triggered mechanism is proposed for the estimated states to reduce their update frequency. To deal with the problem that the triggered estimated states are nondifferentiable, a continuous controller with continuous estimated states is developed, and the event-triggered controller with triggered estimated states is established accordingly. By the use of Lyapunov stability theory, it can be rigorously shown that all signals of the closed-loop systems are bounded in probability.

  abstract     = {Exploring the structure information is crucial for data clustering task, particularly for the sceneries of incomplete multiview clustering (IMVC) when some views are missing. However, almost all of the existing graph-based IMVC methods either introduce the Laplacian constraint with fixed graphs or simply fuse the graphs of all views, which are vulnerable to the quality of the constructed graphs. To address this issue, we propose a new graph-based method, called confident local structure-aware incomplete multiview spectral clustering. Different from existing works, our method seeks to adaptively uncover the inherent similarity structure among the available instances in each view and learn the optimal consensus graph within a unified learning framework. Moreover, to mitigate the adverse effects of imbalance information across incomplete views and improve the quality of consensus graph, we further impose some adaptive weights on the consensus graph learning model w.r.t. each view and introduce some confident structure graphs to explore the most confident similarity information in the model. In contrast to existing works, our approach simultaneously takes into account the pairwise similarity information and neighbor group-based confident structure information. This dual consideration makes our method more effective in achieving the optimal consensus graph and delivering superior IMVC performance. Experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that our method effectively learns a high-quality and clustering-friendly graph from incomplete multiview data, and it outperforms many state-of-the-art IMVC methods in terms of clustering performance.},

In this study, a robust dissimilarity analytics model (RDAM) is established with Laplace distribution to detect process anomalies in noisy environment. Because of the heavy-tailed characteristic of Laplace distribution, the proposed RDAM method is more robust to ambient noise and outliers when compared to Gaussian distribution-based models. Besides, the missing data problem is also considered and solved in the model development procedure. Using the variational Bayesian inference, the model parameters and latent variables of the RDAM model can be estimated. After that, a monitoring strategy is designed based on the obtained results with both static and dynamic statistics. By this means, both the static deviation of the current sample and the temporal correlation within the process data can be effectively revealed. A simulated example and a real low-pressure heater process are adopted to illustrate the performance of the proposed RDAM method.

Unlike other event-triggered controllers, the complete timeline is divided, and the AET controller is built with two switching modes based on the intervals of dormant and active periods of DoS attacks in which the system is located. Second, to reconcile AET controller with actuator saturation, a switched system modeling approach is established that explicitly incorporates saturation constraints into the coupled network dynamics. Third, a switched Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF) is proposed, with which sufficient conditions are provided to ensured the RPS, and a joint design strategy is developed for the desired triggered matrix and feedback gain using linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Moreover, the results are generalized to the case of actuator faults, indicating that the system is able to achieve RPS with actuator faults.

We design a nonstrided downsampling method (ASDP) to map the attention spatial features to depth and improve the detection of low-resolution objects with fine-grained features. We enhance the model’s robustness to different viewing angles by feature perturbation during training. Moreover, we use a cascaded strategy to reduce false positives. To evaluate our method, we construct a real review room dataset (EDD) with 28,000 images from multiple angles. Our method improves the multiview generalization performance by 4.48% mAP and 5.62% mAR.

Notably, for remote state estimation with local estimate cases considered in this article, most existing works consider DoS attacks but not FDI attacks, negatively affecting remote state estimation performance. Furthermore, current detection mechanisms encounter challenges when identifying such attacks due to the unavailable innovation or raw measurement. As such, we study FDI attacks under this framework and provide the corresponding secure analysis using a dual-perspective approach. Specifically, we propose a detector to detect such attacks using the prior information extracted from the remote estimator. Then, we analyze the existence of stealthy attacks and characterize the corresponding performance evaluation for the remote estimation under such attacks. Following this, we construct the optimal attack scheme, maximizing the expected average and terminal estimation error covariances, respectively. To reduce the above vulnerability, we develop a co-design transmission strategy and offer an analytical detection performance evaluation under different attack scenarios.

  abstract     = {The industrial system usually contains not only controllable variables (CVs) but also uncontrollable variables (unCVs), e.g., weather conditions and friction. These unCVs have a direct impact on system control performance. Despite the success of current deep reinforcement learning (DRL) control algorithms, most of them neglect the impact of unCVs, which can cause the deterioration of control performance and instability of the system. To perceive and eliminate the impact of unCVs, a performance-aware self-optimizing universal controller (PASOUC) is designed in this article. The PASOUC aims at integrating the representation of unCVs and controller design to perceive and eliminate the impact of unCVs under different conditions, which goes beyond most existing control methods. Technically, a historical trajectory-inspired control performance perceptron is developed to perceive the impact of unCVs on system control performance under different conditions. Subsequently, a new performance-aware reward is designed to integrate the representation of unCVs and controller design while training the DRL controller. In addition, the domain randomization (DR) training strategy is employed to learn a universal control policy, which can access the approximate optimal trajectory under nonideal conditions. In this way, the impact of unCVs can be eliminated. To handle the low efficiency of the DR training, the policy improvement-policy proximal optimization (PI-PPO) is proposed to enhance the convergence speed of the DR training by performing explicit policy improvement. Finally, illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {This article studies a more realistic issue in multiagent systems (MASs) named open topology, where the network scale tends to be variable as agents may join, leave, or be replaced. In order to reveal the influence that the variation of network scale brings on the dynamic behavior of MASs, a novel transition process containing impulse is provided. Then by applying the Halanay-like inequality, the distributed sampled-data control is designed to ensure the consensus property of the MASs under open topology. It is shown that the derived results can degenerate into the consensus criteria for general MASs with fixed-scale topology. Also, the potential packet loss phenomenon existing in controller is considered, which is integrated into the consensus performance via the average packet loss interval (APLI) condition, thereby guaranteeing the robustness of consensus performance against packet loss. Moreover, within the framework of open topology, it is proved that the admissible packet loss for MASs can be estimated in an average sense. At the end, the availability of this article is demonstrated by discussing a numerical example.},

This study aims to develop a novel segmentation architecture that leverages both spatial and spectral characteristics for better segmentation outcomes. This research introduces the wavelet-infused convolutional Transformer (WaveCoformer), a computationally effective framework to fuse information from both spatial and spectral domains of medical images. Fine-grained textural features are captured from the wavelet components by the convolution module. A transformer block identifies the relevant activation maps within the volumes, followed by self-attention to effectively learn long-range dependencies to capture the global context of the target regions. A cross-attention mechanism effectively combines the distinctive features acquired by both modules to produce a comprehensive and robust representation of the input data. WaveCoformer outperforms related state-of-the-art networks in publicly available Synapse and Adrenal tumor segmentation datasets, with a mean Dice score of 83.86% and 79%, respectively. The model is feasible for deployment in resource-constrained environments with rapid medical image analysis due to its computationally efficient nature and improved segmentation performance.

Combining this model-based condition with data-based representations, two distinct stability conditions are formulated. ASD controllers are subsequently designed based on these conditions. The proposed approach is validated by modeling an aircraft system as an MJS, with flight test data showing that the controller effectively stabilizes the system, whether the system matrices are known or unknown.

Radial basis function neural networks (RBF NNs) are employed to handle the nonlinear uncertainties of MASs. Simultaneously, an adaptive compensatory mechanism is incorporated within the backstepping process to address the nonlinear effect posed by input saturation.

While the introduction of deep learning does improve the prediction performance, it is highly restricted to the number of labeled training data, as well as large computational burden and cumbersome parameter tuning procedures. How to break through the bottleneck of data-drive models in terms of limited labeled data and high computational complexity should be one of the main recent focuses in the field of industrial soft sensing. In this article, a deep co-training PLS (deep CT-PLS) model is proposed to extend the ordinary PLS model to the semi-supervised deep form. While the deep model can efficiently extract inherent natures of process data, the co-training strategy makes lots of unlabeled data useful through a two-view cross training and annotation process. In this case, the performance restriction of the deep PLS model can be greatly relieved, with the incorporation of additional unlabeled data, while at the same time the designed model structure keeps in a low computational complexity.

First, a novel ETM is designed for continuous-time FNNs with time-varying delays to achieve quasi-synchronization, with which synchronization errors is suppressed to globally exponentially converge to a ball. Second, we introduce the ETM for continuous-time FNNs to discrete-time FNNs, owing to the existence of discrete-time states, the Lypunov function of synchronization errors run over the exponentially decay curve, but it can be suppressed to evolve under another exponentially decay curve. Third, for FNNs on time scales with constant and time-varying delays, we estimate the forward jump operator of the Lyapunov functions and design ETMs to guarantee that the Lypunov functions evolve under the exponentially decay curves, so quasi-synchronization can be achieved.

  abstract     = {With increasingly challenging applications for quadrotors, higher requirements are emerging for tracking accuracy and safety. While high accuracy is a prerequisite for complex tasks, safety is ensured through tolerance to actuator faults and resistance to external disturbances. In this article, adaptive robust control (ARC) integrated with Gaussian processes (GPs), i.e., ARC-GP, is proposed to achieve enhanced accuracy, fault tolerance, and anti-disturbance. These three requirements are interrelated and affected by uncertainties. The primary idea of this article is to categorize uncertainties into parametric and nonparametric types, which are then addressed through parameter adaptation and GP, respectively. First, a detailed dynamic model is established, including actuator models that reflect different types of faults corresponding to changes in different physical parameters. Then, parameter adaptation is designed, with direct and indirect methods adopted for different parameters. In particular, the actuator parameters are effectively estimated to achieve targeted fault compensation. Regarding GP for nonparametric uncertainties, its model parameters are also updated via parameter adaptation. The GP thereby also learns parameter estimation errors along with external disturbances. Accordingly, ARC controllers are designed, for which robust feedback terms are constructed to further mitigate uncertainties on the basis of the covariances predicted by GP. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed ARC-GP can actively tolerate various types of actuator faults and better resist wind disturbances.},

  abstract     = {The optimal control of nonlinear systems is crucial to improve system performance. However, the uncertainties of cost functions and systems dynamics make it difficult to solve the optimal control laws. To cope with this problem, a hierarchical learning-based integrated robust optimal control (HL-IROC) method is proposed in this article. The merits of the proposed HL-IROC method are three aspects: First, a hierarchical learning-based integrated optimal control (HL-IOC) scheme, contains a system dynamic learning layer and a cost function learning layer, is designed to transform the original optimal control problem into an integrated optimization problem with control laws as decision variables. Then, the relationships between cost functions and control laws are captured to overcome the difficulties brought by uncertainties in the optimal control process. Second, a global-local cooperative robust evolutionary optimization (GL-CREO) algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal control laws. Then, a global-local robust searching strategy is employed to deal with two types of uncertainties for improving the robustness of control laws. Third, the convergence analysis of HL-IOC and GL-CREO is discussed in theory. In the experiments, the effectiveness of HL-IROC is illustrated with a nonlinear system and a wastewater treatment process.},

In contrast to traditional centralized control, the primary challenge is that only partial subsystems can access the desired reference trajectory. To address this, positive time-varying smooth function compensating terms are introduced to counteract the effects of uncertain external disturbances and unknown desired trajectories. Then, by fusing consensus errors into the backstepping technique, feedforward controllers are given. On this basis, the controlled nonlinear systems are transformed into an equivalent affine form, and feedback optimal controllers are designed using actor and critic neural networks (NNs) to execute control behavior and evaluate control performance. The whole control laws comprise both feedforward and feedback controllers. The proposed distributed adaptive consensus control protocol can simultaneously achieve desired optimal control performance and minimize the cost function, as demonstrated through theoretical analysis and simulation results.},

The proposed distributed PT controller based on local information can guarantee that all signals of the closed-loop system are PT bounded, and consensus errors of NNMSs can be enforced to a small region around the origin within a predefined time.

Combine with the fuzzy Lyapunov function method and dissipativity theory, some brand-new conditions with slack scalars and matrices are attained to ensure that observation error systems are strictly $(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{W},\mathcal{S})$ $-\delta-$ dissipative. Besides, to improve the transient FE performance, regional pole placement problem is also considered in FE observer design. It is worth mentioning that different from some existing results which assume that actuator faults occur in a constant form, the method given in this article is suitable for more types of faults such as time-varying ones.

The pursuer copes not only with its maneuverability constraint but also with the target’s deception behavior, in which the target deliberately conceals its private preference information. The target capture game involving deception behavior is formulated as a nonlinear differential game framework where the information structure is incomplete and asymmetric. The solution to this differential game is proposed based on an RL policy that incorporates critic, actor, and virtual actor neural networks (NNs), when taking into consideration the maneuverability constraint and information structure of the pursuer. Moreover, the states of the constrained adversarial system and the weight errors are proven to be ultimately uniformly bounded (UUB). To counter the deception of the target, we adopt unscented Kalman filter (UKF) to obtain the target intention on energy preference, and integrate it into the pursuer strategy. The feasibility of the proposed strategy and its superiority are verified through comparisons with recent works.},

To achieve the expected tracking performance, the design philosophy focuses on developing a prescribed finite-time performance function (PFTPF), capable of preassigning the convergence time and accuracy precisely beforehand. The explored adaptive control algorithm can ensure that the whole signals concerning the closed-loop MASs remain bounded while the bipartite consensus errors converge to a predetermined range around zero within the prescribed finite time.

The goals are to enhance operator safety as well as well-being and, at the same time, to improve efficiency and reduce production costs. To these aims, the speed and separation monitoring (SSM) operation method is employed for the first time in HDI, drawing an analogy to the safety requirements outlined in collaborative robots’ ISO standards. The so-called protective separation distance is used to ensure the safety of operators engaged in collaborative tasks with drones. In addition, we employ the rapid upper limb assessment (RULA) method to evaluate the ergonomic posture of operators during interactions with drones. To validate the proposed approach in a realistic industrial setting, a quadrotor is deployed for pick-and-delivery tasks along a predefined trajectory from the picking bay to the palletizing area, where the interaction between the drone and a moving operator takes place. The drone navigates toward the interaction space while avoiding collisions with shelves and other drones in motion. The control strategy for the drone cruise navigation integrates simultaneously the time-variant artificial potential field (APF) technique for trajectory planning and the iterative linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controller for trajectory tracking. Differently, in the descent phase, the receding horizon LQR algorithm is employed to follow a trajectory planned in accordance with the SSM, which starts from the approach point at the border of the interaction space and ends in the volume with the operator’s minimum RULA. The presented control strategy facilitates drone management by adapting the drone’s position to changes in the operator’s position while satisfying HDI safety requirements. The results of the proposed HDI framework simulations for the case study demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in ensuring a safe and ergonomic HDI within industrial warehouses.},

CRPTpro decouples data sampling from encoder pretraining, proposing decoupled random collection to easily and quickly generate a qualified cross-domain pretraining dataset. Moreover, a novel prototypical self-supervised algorithm is proposed to pretrain an effective visual encoder that is generic across different domains. Without finetuning, the cross-domain encoder can be implemented for challenging downstream tasks defined in different domains, either seen or unseen. Compared with recent advanced methods, CRPTpro achieves better performance on downstream policy learning without extra training on exploration agents for data collection, greatly reducing the burden of pretraining. We conduct extensive experiments across multiple challenging continuous visual-control domains, including balance control, robot locomotion, and manipulation. CRPTpro significantly outperforms the next best Proto-RL(C) on 11/12 cross-domain downstream tasks with only 54.5% wall-clock pretraining time, exhibiting state-of-the-art pretraining performance with greatly improved pretraining efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Layered network visualizations assign each node to one of several parallel axes. They can convey sequence or flow data, hierarchies, or multiple data classes, but edge crossings and long edges often impair readability. Layout algorithms can reduce edge crossings and shorten edges using quick heuristics or optimal methods that prioritize human readability over computation speed. This work uses an optimization metaheuristic to provide the best of both worlds: high-quality layouts within a predetermined execution time. Our adaptation of the large neighborhood search (LNS) metaheuristic repeatedly selects fixed-sized subgraphs to lay out optimally. We conducted a computational evaluation using 450 synthetic networks to compare five ways of selecting candidate nodes, four ways of selecting their neighboring subgraph, and three criteria for determining subgraph size. LNS generally halved the number of crossings vs. the barycentric heuristic while maintaining a reasonable runtime. Our best approach randomly selected candidate nodes, used degree centrality to pick cluster-like neighborhoods, and chose smaller neighborhoods that could be optimally laid out in 0.6 or 1.2 seconds (vs. 6 seconds). In a case study visualizing 13 control flow graphs, most with over 1000 nodes, we show that our method can be employed to create visualizations with fewer crossings than Tabu Search, another metaheuristic, and vastly outperforms an ILP solver when runtime is bounded.

This process involves converting target 3D surfaces into developable surfaces and then flattening them into 2D patterns. Since the geometric and topological diversity of target surfaces, this task is both comprehensive and intricate, encompassing multiple aspects from design to fabrication. In this paper, we review relevant technologies and methods in fabrication processes, classify them, and summarize a pipeline from design to fabrication.

However, there is a lack of research on measurement of brain synchrony during social interactions in remote AR. In this study, we investigated the brain synchrony of remote augmented reality (AR; Study 1) and face-to-face (FTF; Study 2) interactions. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy was used to measure the brain synchrony during the tangram puzzle task. In a collaboration condition, participants worked together to solve the puzzle. In an individual condition, participants solved the puzzle independently. We recruited 46 participants in Study 1 and 48 participants in Study 2. Study 1 showed there was a significant difference in brain synchrony between the individual and collaboration conditions, and a positive correlation was observed between brain synchrony and the task performance in the collaboration condition. A comparison between Study 1 and 2 suggested that the difference between the collaboration and individual conditions was maintained, and some differences were observed in the brain synchrony between the AR and FTF interactions. These results suggest that measurement of brain synchrony is beneficial for social interaction in remote AR collaborations. The implications of these results on future remote interactions are discussed.},

Despite strides made in exploring requirement and solution spaces, challenges persist due to the absence of guidance in the initial consideration space and the lack of shared problem-solving knowledge, often resulting in suboptimal solutions. To address these issues, we conducted an empirical study of VA research, with a focus on mapping the relations between requirement and solution spaces. Analyzing 220 VA papers, we formulate refined topologies for data, requirements, and solutions. We propose conceptualizing the connections between requirements, data, and solutions through knowledge graphs and utilizing solution paths to encapsulate fundamental problem-solving knowledge in visual analytics research. Through the integration of solution paths into a graph and analyzing their interconnections, we identified a subset of problem-driven design patterns that demonstrated the efficacy of our approach. By externalizing problem-solving knowledge and formulating problem-driven design patterns, our aim is to streamline the exploration of consideration space, facilitating the inclusion of “good” solutions, and establish a benchmark for shared design decisions among researchers and readers.},

However, these methods are deficient in both accuracy and efficiency due to the neglect of the unique cues of floor plans compared to natural images. To address the above issues, we propose MMParseNet that yields accurate parsing results by incorporating multimodal cues unique to floor plans, such as room names, furniture icons, and room boundaries.

  abstract     = {Prior foveated rendering methods often suffer from a limitation where the shading load escalates with increasing display resolution, leading to decreased efficiency, particularly when dealing with retinal-level resolutions. To tackle this challenge, we begin with the essence of the human visual system (HVS) perception and present visual acuity-consistent foveated rendering (VaFR), aiming to achieve exceptional rendering performance at retinal-level resolutions. Specifically, we propose a method with a novel log-polar mapping function derived from the human visual acuity model, which accommodates the natural bandwidth of the visual system. This mapping function and its associated shading rate guarantee a consistent output of rendering information, regardless of variations in the display resolution of the VR HMD. Consequently, our VaFR outperforms alternative methods, improving rendering speed while preserving perceptual visual quality, particularly when operating at retinal resolutions. We validate our approach using both the rasterization and ray-casting rendering pipelines. We also validate our approach using different binocular rendering strategies for HMD devices. In diverse testing scenarios, our approach delivers better perceptual visual quality than prior foveated rendering while achieving an impressive speedup of 6.5×-9.29× for deferred rendering of 3D scenarios and an even more powerful speedup of 10.4×-16.4× for ray-casting at retinal resolution. Additionally, our approach significantly enhances the rendering performance of binocular 8K path tracing, achieving smooth frame rates.},

To bridge this gap between perception and network visualization, we introduce a framework highlighting five key perceptual mechanisms used in node-link diagrams and adjacency matrices: attention, visual search, perceptual organization, ensemble coding, and object recognition. Our framework describes the role these perceptual mechanisms play in common network analytical tasks. We use the framework to revisit four past empirical investigations and outline future design experiments that can help produce more perceptually effective network visualizations. We anticipate this connection will afford translational understanding to guide more effective network visualization design and offer hypotheses for perception-aware network visualizations.},

However, due to the ambiguity of the keypoint and the complexity of 3D objects, it is still tricky for existing 3D keypoint detection methods to generate stable keypoints with good coverage, especially for unsupervised detection methods. This paper proposes a 3D keypoint detection method based on hierarchical point saliency. This method can effectively and accurately locate the keypoints of a 3D point cloud, and it does not require complex training processes. First, we propose a simple and effective point descriptor called the local geometric structure feature, which can effectively characterize the geometric structure changes of 3D point clouds and has a strong feature identification ability. Second, we define two saliency measures used to characterize the saliency of points in the point cloud, which are low-level and high-level saliency. Third, we hierarchically characterize the saliency of points by combining the low-level and high-level saliency, thus measuring the probability that a point belongs to a keypoint. Finally, we extensively test our method on three benchmark 3D point cloud datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in keypoint detection tasks, significantly superior to the prior hand-crafted and deep-learning-based 3D keypoint detection methods.},

Our evaluation asked three domain experts to author drillboards for their own datasets, which we then showed to casual end-users with favorable outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Recent advancements in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) show promise for various applications like social networks and financial networks. However, they exhibit fairness issues, particularly in human-related decision contexts, risking unfair treatment of groups historically subject to discrimination. While several visual analytics studies have explored fairness in machine learning (ML), few have tackled the particular challenges posed by GNNs. We propose a visual analytics framework for GNN fairness analysis, offering insights into how attribute and structural biases may introduce model bias. Our framework is model-agnostic and tailored for real-world scenarios with multiple and multinary sensitive attributes, utilizing an extended suite of fairness metrics. To operationalize the framework, we develop GNNFairViz, a visual analysis tool that integrates seamlessly into the GNN development workflow, offering interactive visualizations. Our tool enables GNN model developers, the target users, to analyze model bias comprehensively, facilitating node selection, fairness inspection, and diagnostics. We evaluate our approach through two usage scenarios and expert interviews, confirming its effectiveness and usability in GNN fairness analysis. Furthermore, we summarize two general insights into GNN fairness based on our observations on the usage of GNNFairViz, highlighting the prevalence of the “Overwhelming Effect” in highly unbalanced datasets and the importance of suitable GNN architecture selection for bias mitigation.},

In this paper, we present the propagation of data uncertainty to the spectra and its visualization. We consider the Fourier and continuous wavelet transformations, which are two common spectral analysis methods. Deriving the propagation for time series that can be modeled as a Gaussian process leads to a combination of weighted non-central chi-squared distributions in the spectrum. Percentile-based visualizations explicitly encode the non-normal uncertainty in the 1D Fourier and 2D wavelet spectrum. We enrich the visualization by including correlations, sensitivity, and signal-to-noise analysis. For visual exploration, we combine the different visualizations into an interactive approach that allows for investigating the uncertain time series in the temporal and spectral domains. Finally, we show the usefulness of our approach by applying it to several real-world data sets and by a qualitative interview study with visualization experts.},

  abstract     = {Photoinduced electronic transitions are complex quantum-mechanical processes where electrons move between energy levels due to the absorption of light. This induces dynamics i.e., coupled changes in the electronic structure and nuclear geometry, that drive physical and chemical processes of importance in diverse fields ranging from photobiology and materials design to medicine. The evolving electronic structure can be characterized by two electron density fields: hole and particle natural transition orbitals (NTOs). A study of the two density fields helps understand the movement of electronic charge from one part of the molecule to another, specifically the donor and acceptor regions. Previous works in this area rely on side-by-side visual comparisons of isosurfaces, statistical approaches, or visual analysis of bivariate fields restricted to limited time instances. We propose a new method to analyze time-varying bivariate fields with a large number of instances, as pertinent to understand electronic structure changes during light-induced dynamics. Since the NTO fields depend on the nuclear geometry, the nuclear motion leads to a large number of bivariate field instances. Structures like tracking graphs have been used to analyze time-varying univariate fields. This paper presents a structured and practical approach to feature-directed visual exploration of time-varying bivariate fields using continuous scatterplots (CSPs) and image moment-based descriptors, tailored for studying the evolving electronic structure following photoexcitation. The CSP of the bivariate field at every time step is represented using an image moment vector of length 4. The collection of all image moment vector descriptors is considered as a point cloud in $\mathbb {R}^{4}$ and visualized using principal component analysis. Choosing an appropriate pair of principal components results in a representation of the point cloud as a curve on the plane. This representation supports tasks such as identifying interesting time steps, identifying patterns within the bivariate field, and tracking their evolution over time. We present two case studies on excited-state dynamics in molecular systems that demonstrate how the time-varying bivariate field analysis helps provide application-specific insights.},

In this paper, we propose a novel and lightweight mesoscopic system for personality-based crowd simulation in immersive virtual reality (iVR). We use the Big Five personality framework, also known as OCEAN, to model a synthetic personality for each autonomous agent. Agents can autonomously aggregate in formations using machine learning-based clustering techniques operating on OCEAN. Moreover, agents can also externalize their personality traits by performing peculiar behavioral animations. To choose which animations to perform, we adopt a probabilistic approach that considers each OCEAN dimension as a continuous spectrum with two extremes linked to pairs of animations. Our system is designed to be flexible and suitable for different applications. Flexibility is achieved by using graphs to store agent and map topology data that control how the agents move and behave at runtime. In a within-subjects study with 40 users, we compare our personality-based system against a basic system that does not use personality. Results show that introducing personality into iVR crowd simulation enhances users&#39; social presence and experienced realism. Introducing personality also increases the perceived match between the agents and the virtual environment where the simulation takes place.},

A first step toward this goal is to understand how informal skill sharing takes place in order to identify how it could be improved. We experimentally studied informal skill-sharing in pairs of participants analyzing scatterplots in a shared virtual reality environment. We used an original mixed-method to analyze video and log recordings as well as subjective experiential data, based on common ground theory and the grounding process. We uncovered 101 episodes of skill-sharing, organized in 14 recurring types, and identified associated problems from which we could propose six implications for designing systems that favor informal skill-sharing, hence skill learning. The method can be used to study informal skill sharing in other systems enabling embodied face-to-face collaboration, but would need to be simplified for large-scale use.},

  abstract     = {The task of reconstructing indoor floorplans has become an increasingly popular subject, offering substantial benefits across various applications such as interior design, virtual reality, and robotics. Despite the growing interest, existing approaches frequently encounter challenges due to high computational costs and sensitivity to errors in primitive detection. In this paper, we introduce PolyGraph, a new computational framework that combines a deep-learning based primitive detection network with an optimization-based reconstruction algorithm to facilitate high-quality reconstruction results. Specifically, we develop a novel guided wall point primitive estimation network capable of generating dense samples along wall boundaries. This network not only retains structural detail but also shows improved robustness in the detection phase. Then, PolyGraph utilizes wall points to establish a graph-based representation, formulating indoor floorplan reconstruction as a subgraph optimization problem. This approach significantly reduces the search space comparing to existing pixel-level optimization approaches. By utilizing “structural weight”, we seamlessly integrate the structural information of walls and rooms into graph representations, ensuring high-quality reconstruction results. Experimental results demonstrate PolyGraph&#39;s effectiveness and its advantages compared to other optimization-based approaches, showcasing its computational efficiency, and its ability to preserve structural integrity and capture fine details, as quantified by the structure metrics.

Existing works produce accurate 2D joint detection, however, when these are triangulated and lifted into 3D, available solutions all struggle in selecting the most accurate candidates and associating them to the correct joint type and target identity. As such, in order to fully utilize all accurate 2D joint location information, we propose to independently triangulate between all same-typed 2D joints from all camera views regardless of their target ID, forming the Joint Cloud. Joint Cloud consist of both valid joints lifted from the same joint type and target ID, as well as falsely constructed ones that are from different 2D sources. These redundant and inaccurate candidates are processed over the proposed Joint Cloud Selection and Aggregation Transformer (JCSAT) involving three cascaded encoders which deeply explore the trajectile, skeletal structural, and view-dependent correlations among all 3D point candidates in the cross-embedding space. An Optimal Token Attention Path (OTAP) module is proposed which subsequently selects and aggregates informative features from these redundant observations for the final prediction of human motion. To demonstrate the effectiveness of JCSAT, we build and publish a new multi-person motion capture dataset BUMocap-X with complex interactions and severe occlusions. Comprehensive experiments over the newly presented as well as benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, which outperforms all existing state-of-the-art methods, especially under challenging occlusion scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) use multi-view images for 3D scene representation, demonstrating remarkable performance. As one of the primary sources of multi-view images, multi-camera systems encounter challenges such as varying intrinsic parameters and frequent pose changes. Most previous NeRF-based methods assume a unique camera and rarely consider multi-camera scenarios. Besides, some NeRF methods that can optimize intrinsic and extrinsic parameters still remain susceptible to suboptimal solutions when these parameters are poor initialized. In this paper, we propose MC-NeRF, a method for joint optimization of both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters alongside NeRF, allowing individual camera parameters for each image. First, we analyze the coupling issue that arises from the joint optimization between intrinsics and extrinsics, and propose a decoupling constraint utilizing auxiliary images. To further address the degenerate cases in the decoupling process, we introduce an efficient auxiliary image acquisition scheme to mitigate these effects. Furthermore, recognizing that most existing datasets are designed for a unique camera, we provided a new dataset that includes both simulated data and real-world data. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in scenarios where each image corresponds to different camera parameters. Specifically, our approach outperforms the baselines favorably in terms of intrinsics estimation, extrinsics estimation, scale estimation, and rendering quality.

Despite the introduction of various immersive visualization authoring toolkits, domain experts still face hurdles in adopting immersive analytics into their workflow, particularly when faced with dynamically changing tasks and data in real time. To lower such technical barriers, we introduce XROps, a web-based authoring system that allows users to create immersive analytics applications through interactive visual programming, without the need for low-level scripting or coding. XROps enables dynamic immersive analytics authoring by allowing users to modify each step of the data visualization process with immediate feedback, enabling them to build visualizations on-the-fly and adapt to changing environments. It also supports the integration and visualization of real-time sensor data from XR devices—a key feature of immersive analytics—facilitating the creation of various analysis scenarios. We evaluated the usability of XROps through a user study and demonstrate its efficacy and usefulness in several example scenarios.

  abstract     = {Relightable 4D avatar reconstruction which enables high fidelity and real-time rendering continues to be a crucial but challenging problem, especially from monocular videos. Previous NeRF-based 4D avatars enable photo-realistic relighting but are too slow for rendering, while point-based or mesh-based 4D avatars are efficient but have limited rendering quality. The recent success of 3D Gaussian Splatting, i.e., 3DGS, has inspired a series of impressive 4D Gaussian avatars, however, most of which only focus on faithful appearance reconstruction but are not relightable. To address such issues, this paper proposes a new Relightable 4D Gaussian Avatar, i.e., RGAvatar, tailored for high fidelity relightable rendering from monocular videos. Our key idea is to introduce a new relightable 4D Gaussian representation, based on which we can directly perform high fidelity Physically Based Rendering, and an effective joint learning mechanism for compact 4D Gaussian reconstruction with SDF regulation and accurate materials and lighting decomposition. By comparing with previous state-of-the-art approaches, RGAvatar can significantly outperform previous approaches in relightable rendering quality and speed. To our best knowledge, RGAvatar contributes a new state-of-the-art 4D Gaussian avatar from monocular videos, which enables high fidelity relightable rendering in a quite efficient manner.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we introduce a novel method of Filtering and Serializing Spatial Information to tackle uncalibrated photometric stereo tasks, termed FSSI-PS. Photometric stereo aims to recover surface normals from images with varying lighting and is crucial for tasks like 3D reconstruction and defect detection. Current methods in complex surface reconstruction are costly and inaccurate due to redundant feature representations from GCN or Transformer modules, caused by the weak global information extraction capability of GCNs or the large computational cost of Transformers. Furthermore, the trainset&#39;s lack of richness in texture complexity makes reconstruction more difficult. We address these issues by optimizing feature maps and dataset richness through serializing and filtering. Firstly, we use Mamba-RNN to optimize feature representation by directly fusing feature maps, which reduces redundancy and uses minimal computational resources. Specifically, we treat input spatial information as a sequence and serialize it by sorting. Furthermore, we introduce the Mean Angular Variation metric to assess reconstruction difficulty by measuring texture complexity. It classifies PS-Sculpture and PS-Blobby into three categories: Difficult, Normal, and Simple. We use this to construct DNS-S+B, a photometric stereo training set with rich complexity levels. Our method is compared with state-of-the-art methods on the DiLiGenT and LUCES benchmarks to highlight effectiveness.},

Existing methods mainly focus on pose control but lack the ability to achieve sketch-based control, largely due to the absence of appearance-consistent and shape-varying knowledge in existing datasets. Moreover, the necessity of sequential structure inputs to control video generation hinders real-world applications. To address these limitations, we introduce Sketch2HumanVideo, an approach that, for the first time, achieves sketch-controllable human video generation with three conditions: temporally sparse sketches, a spatially sparse pose sequence, and a reference appearance image. Our key contribution is a sparse sketch encoder, which takes the first two conditions as input, enabling precise and multi-view control of shape motion. To provide the above knowledge, we leverage the expertise of two pretrained models to synthesize a dataset comprising shape-varying yet appearance-consistent examples for model training. Furthermore, we introduce an enlarging-and-resampling scheme to enhance high-frequency details of local regions in resource-constrained scenarios, thereby promoting the generation of realistic videos. Through qualitative and quantitative experiments, our method showcases superior performance to state-of-the-art approaches and flexible control.

  abstract     = {Telerehabilitation is a cost-effective alternative to in-clinic rehabilitation. Although convenient, it lacks immersive and free-viewpoint patient visualization. Current research explores two solutions to this issue. Mesh-based methods use 3D models and motion capture for AR visualization. However, they are labor-intensive and less photorealistic than 2D images. Microsoft&#39;s Holoportation generates photorealistic 3D models with eight RGBD cameras in real time. However, it requires complex setups, high GPU power, and high-speed communication infrastructure, making deployment challenging. This paper presents a Real-Time Free-Viewpoint Holographic Patient Rendering (RT-FVHP) system for telerehabilitation. Unlike traditional methods that require manually crafted assets such as 3D meshes, texture maps, and skeletal rigging, our data-driven approach eliminates the need for explicit asset definitions. Inspired by the HumanNeRF framework, we retarget dynamic human poses to a canonical pose and leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting to train a neural network in canonical space for patient representation. The trained model generates 2D RGB$\sigma$ outputs via Gaussian Splatting rasterization, guided by camera parameters and human pose inputs. Compatible with HoloLens 2 and web-based platforms, RT-FVHP operates effectively under real-world conditions, including handling occlusions caused by treadmills. Occlusion handling is accomplished using our Shape-Enforced Gaussian Density Control (SGDC), which initializes and densifies 3D Gaussians in occluded regions using estimated SMPL human body priors. This approach minimizes manual intervention while ensuring complete body reconstruction. With efficient Gaussian rasterization, the model delivers real-time performance of up to 400 FPS at 1080p resolution on a dedicated RTX6000 GPU.},

The proposed S-OTFS is designed for use as a secondary user (SU) waveform in an underlay cognitive radio (CR) system. While the primary system divides the entire spectrum into subbands and allocates them to primary users (PUs), the S-OTFS spreads the data symbols across the entire frequency-time (FT) domain, effectively reducing interference power levels to the primary system. To mitigate the interference from PUs at the underlay S-OTFS receiver, we propose modified linear minimum mean square error (M-LMMSE) equalizers in both time and FT domains. To this end, we rigorously derive the necessary statistical properties of the PU&#39;s interference as the explicit functions of the PU&#39;s subband location. We investigate various sparse patterns for the proposed S-OTFS and demonstrate through simulations that the scattered-type sparse patterns exhibit superior performance compared to the clustered-type sparse patterns. Most importantly, the proposed S-OTFS-based CR system with the scattered-type sparse patterns consistently demonstrates substantially improved performance compared to conventional underlay CR systems where multicarrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA) is employed for a SU, especially in high-speed mobile environments.},

We design a robust and adaptive Coupled Multiple Sliding Mode Control (CMSMC) law that ensures trajectory tracking despite time-varying disturbances acting on the SV. The controller accepts position and velocity inputs from the neighboring vehicles, through vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. The design is initially validated for an ideal communication channel that does not drop any data packets. Subsequently, we derive a sufficient condition that ensures the boundedness of the tracking error even when the communication channel exhibits packet drops. Using an appropriate model for packet drops, we derive an upper bound on the packet-transmission interval for each vehicle communicating with the SV, and also outline the associated condition for update of the controller. The DLTP model is validated using real-world field traffic data extracted from NGSIM; and the analytical results are substantiated through numerical computations, and simulations performed on SUMO.

In this paper, we introduc the airship-assisted train-to-ground communications in space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN), aiming to maximize the number of scheduling flows that satisfy quality of service (QoS) requirements. Then we formulate an optimization problem by configuring the number of networks, QoS requirements of flows, and the number of time slots (TSs) in each frame for transmission schedule. To address the problem, we first propose a network selection algorithm to help the airship and BSs select the right MRs, and determine whether the number of TSs occupied by flows can satisfy the QoS requirements. Furthermore, to enhance the number of scheduling flows, we propose a flow scheduling algorithm to optimizing the scheduling order of flows in different networks, and we also consider the flow scheduling when there is no network switching in certain frames. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve the number of scheduling flows and transmitted bits. We also verify that the proposed algorithm can further improve the system performance with different periods of network switching compared to other algorithms.},

Firstly, to address the “explosion of complexity” challenge, an enhanced nonlinear PT filter is presented, which reduces the requirement of design parameter and improves the precision of linear filter. Then, an adaptive control strategy is proposed via backstepping technique and fuzzy approximation theory, which can realize the practical PT stability (PPTS) of HVPSs, and the asymptotic convergence of spacing errors is guaranteed by introducing smoothing function while meeting the constraint imposed by the performance funnel. Importantly, the complex Lyapunov function often associated with barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) technique can be avoided in this work.

  abstract     = {Roadside units (RSUs) with strong sensing abilities enhance the viability of the RSU-to-Everything (R2X) paradigm, offering crucial infrastructure support for Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) that enables real-time data processing and reduced delay. Since RSUs collect a large volume of data but have limited computing capability, data analysis tasks are usually offloaded to other network nodes, such as the cloud, other RSUs, or even vehicles. The multi-hop distributed collaborative task offloading scheme is expected to achieve high resource utilization efficiency and low task delay in this scenario, despite increasing energy consumption in data transmission. However, the highly dynamic nature of the R2X network topology makes it challenging for a node to independently select the next hop and collaboratively allocate tasks to neighbors in a multi-hop transmission path. Specifically, offloading decisions made by an individual node are influenced not only by its immediate neighbors but also by other nodes along the multi-hop path, referred to in this paper as the effect value. Additionally, the heterogeneity in computing resources and link delays among network nodes further increases the difficulty. To address these challenges, we first apply a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict and update the neighbors for each node while considering effect values, allowing them to independently adapt to environmental changes. Then, we design a two-layer Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm for network nodes to make decisions. The first-layer DRL algorithm is implemented by RSUs to determine task offloading modes. When an RSU decides to offload tasks to multiple vehicles for collaborative computing, the second-layer DRL algorithm is used by a vehicle to select its next hop vehicle and allocate tasks. Simulation results show that our proposed approach effectively adapts to topology changes in complex and highly dynamic network environments. Compared with existing methods, this approach significantly improves task completion ratio and reduces processing delay.},

  abstract     = {In the realm of intelligent transportation systems (ITSs), safeguarding the resilience of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) with vulnerable interactions is imperative, particularly amidst the rapid spread of cyber-attack effects within the system. This paper introduces a pioneering Neural Network-based Cooperative Adaptive Resilient Control (NNCARC) approach that seamlessly integrates adaptive neural networks and resilient control mechanisms to counteract the impacts of nonlinearity, cyber-attacks, and external disturbances. The methodology commences with the development of an adaptive neural network to precisely estimate system nonlinearity, followed by the proposal of a cooperative adaptive resilient control strategy leveraging the Lyapunov theorem for stability analysis and adaptive laws. To the authors&#39; knowledge, this is the first time that a NNCARC is proposed which ensures all vehicles within a platoon, with any type of network topology, adhere safely to the leader&#39;s time-varying profile, without necessitating additional controller switching algorithms in the event of a cyber-attack. By eliminating restrictive assumptions like the Lipschitz condition on nonlinear components, the proposed methodology enhances its versatility and robustness. Theoretical analyses validate system stability and objective achievement, while simulation studies across diverse network topologies, cyber-attack scenarios, and external disturbances substantiate the efficacy of the approach in controlling CAVs within a platoon. This paper constitutes a significant advancement in resilient control methodologies for CAVs, offering a comprehensive solution to mitigate cyber-attack and disturbance effects while ensuring system stability and performance.},

Effective throughput (ET) is employed as the key performance metric in this study to explore the trade-off between the decoding error probability and achievable rate. A mixed-integer non-convex problem is formulated to jointly optimize power allocation, rate control, and user grouping. To tackle this challenge, the achievable ET is approximated using a lower bound, and a decomposition approach is developed to decouple the optimization variables. Specifically, for a given user grouping scheme, an iteration-based concave-convex programming (CCCP) method and an iteration-free lower-bound approximation (LBA) method are proposed for power allocation and rate control. Furthermore, a greedy search-based scheme and a minimum correlation user grouping (MCUG) scheme are designed for the user grouping problem. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the CCCP and LBA methods in power allocation and rate control and the MCUG method in user grouping when compared to the greedy and random methods. Besides, the superiority of RSMA for URLLC services is demonstrated when compared to spatial division multiple access.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates sensing-assisted predictive beamforming for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication by exploiting integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) functionalities at the base station (BS). In the existing ISAC framework, the vehicle is usually treated as a point target and only the backscattered echo is used for sensing. However, in practice, the vehicle is an extended target composed of different reflecting/scattering surfaces, and hence the BS may receive multiple echoes. In this paper, by exploiting the directive scattering (DS) model for the incident signal at the vehicle surface, we demonstrate that the multipath echoes are substantial or even stronger, as compared with the backscattered echo. To capitalize on this observation, we develop a sensing-assisted predictive beamforming scheme with multipath echoes, where both the backscattered echo and multipath echoes are utilized for vehicle tracking. To accurately estimate the motion parameters of vehicles, we propose a particle filtering based tracking algorithm where the likelihood probabilities are designed based on the geometrical relationships of the multipath echoes. The beamforming vectors are then designed based on the predicted angles for establishing the communication links. Moreover, we present a particle swarm optimization (PSO) based algorithm to estimate the locations of the roadside scatterers when the prior information is unavailable. Extensive simulations are conducted to verify the superiorities of the proposed scheme.},

This paper investigates the performance of UC D-mMIMO systems enabled by a swarm of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Specifically, it presents a comprehensive study on the deployment and trajectory optimization of UAVs as aerial transmission and reception points (TRPs) of D-mMIMO systems, considering systems composed solely of aerial TRPs and those implemented combining aerial and terrestrial TRPs. Moreover, user equipment (UE) mobility is modeled using a discrete-time Markov chain, and a novel approach to heuristically optimize the positions of aerial TRPs is proposed, considering the continuous movement of UEs in the coverage area. The proposed approach optimizes the three-dimensional location of each UAV under a time discretization framework, with the positioning of the UAVs being adjusted periodically, allowing for iterative trajectory optimization to improve the spectral efficiency (SE) performance of the UEs. Simulation results reveal that the proposed UAV trajectory optimization allows for significant SE improvement, especially for a low UE density scenario. Specifically, comparing the proposed method with a fixed position setup, an up to 47.84% increase in average SE is achieved.},

  abstract     = {Streaming applications like smart monitoring and real-time data processing are characterized by long data-collecting duration and delay stringent computation. Mobile edge computing can enable mobile devices to execute such applications more smoothly. However, achieving timely completion of streaming applications necessitates processing a flow of computation tasks in an assembly-line fashion, which requires an unprecedented system model and thus needs further study. This work addresses the above concern by investigating a scenario where multiple mobile devices run streaming tasks and offload them to a nearby BS for edge computing through a cooperative node. In this system, the duration of data collection, task offloading and edge computation together with multiuser offloading ratio and bandwidth allocation are jointly optimized to achieve low power consumption of the mobile devices and the cooperative node. The introduction of streaming tasks and cooperation mechanisms turns the task execution into multi-stage process and thus greatly exacerbate the complexity of overall solution. To this end, Dinkelbach method is first utilized for problem transformation. Subsequently, a hybrid approach of block coordinate descent (BCD) and Lagrangian multiplier method is employed to find local optimal solution when the BS has abundant computation capacity and difference of convex algorithm (DCA) is leveraged to attain convergent solution when the BS has finite computation capacity. Finally, numerical results are demonstrated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods and offer some insightful results about our proposed strategy.},

The vertically polarized element (VPE) is composed of a top-loaded metal disk, four bent arms and a round ground, which has a low profile of 0.049λL (λL represents the free space wavelength at the lowest operating frequency) and a broad band of 1.66 GHz to 4 GHz. It is evolved from a mono-conical antenna and eventually achieved an ultra-low profile while remaining the broad band by replacing the complete cone with four metal arms, adding a top-loaded metal disk and grounding structures, and the multiple bents of the four arms. After that, two horizontally polarized elements (HPEs) are meticulously designed and embedded in the ground and the top disk of the VPE, respectively. Benefiting from the low profile VPE, the planar HPEs and the compact embedding scheme, the proposed antenna has a profile of only 0.053λL. To verify the design, a prototype is manufactured and measured. The results indicate that the prototype has overlapping bands of 1.63-2.7 GHz and 3.22-3.82 GHz, gain variation in omnidirectional plane of below 2.4 dB, and isolation between ports of better than 25 dB.},

To this end, using channel state information (CSI), we propose a novel IS-based DPD algorithm by introducing a source classification step before generating position realizations. A more appropriate importance function is also developed. Specifically, rather than processing all sources independently, the new importance function assumes that the closely-located radio sources are uniformly distributed around a central point. The simulation results validate the robustness of the developed importance function. Furthermore, the results clearly show that the proposed algorithm can achieve a better estimation accuracy than state-of-the-art DPD techniques.},

Vehicle Edge Computing (VEC) emerges as a promising solution by offloading computational tasks to edge servers positioned near vehicles. However, the limited computing capacity of these edge servers necessitates the efficient allocation of resources to adequately meet the demands of all vehicles. In this paper, we introduce a multi-vehicle VEC offloading framework that considers both the execution time of tasks and the costs incurred when utilizing edge server resources and transmitting tasks between Roadside Units (RSUs). Building on this framework, we design an optimization problem to minimize the average weighted cost, modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). To address this, we propose a DDPG-based Resource Allocation and Offloading Decision Algorithm (DRAODA). This algorithm enables the control center to generate resource allocation strategies while allowing individual vehicles to make task offloading decisions independently, based solely on their own data and the edge server&#39;s status, without relying on information from other vehicles. Additionally, we propose an Optimal Task Offloading Destination Selection Algorithm (OTODSA) to further minimize the average weighted cost, enhancing the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the resource allocation process.},

Employing torque vectoring capabilities, the proposed controller is able to stabilise the vehicle in evasive manoeuvres at the limit of handling. A nonlinear double-track vehicle model, together with an extended Fiala tyre model, is used to capture the nonlinear coupled longitudinal and lateral dynamics. The optimised control inputs are the steering angle and the four longitudinal wheel forces to minimise the tracking error in safe situations and maximise the vehicle-to-obstacle distance in emergency manoeuvres. These optimised longitudinal forces generate an additional direct yaw moment, enhancing the vehicle&#39;s lateral agility and aiding in obstacle avoidance and stability maintenance. The longitudinal tyre forces are constrained using the tyre friction cycle. The proposed controller has been tested on rapid prototyping hardware to prove real-time capability. In a high-fidelity simulation environment validated with experimental data, our proposed approach successfully avoids obstacles and maintains vehicle stability. It outperforms two baseline controllers: one without torque vectoring and another one without collision avoidance prioritisation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness of the proposed approach to vehicle parameter variations, road friction, perception, and localisation errors. The influence of each variation is statistically assessed to evaluate its impact on the performance, providing guidelines for future controller design.},

However, achieving dynamic and intelligent network slice configuration to accommodate diverse service types remains a critical challenge in advanced network orchestration. With the advent of 6G, which is characterized by its highly dynamic and robust nature, there is an urgent need for an intelligent and slice-compatible assignment approach to meet the evolving demands of next-generation networks. In this context, this work introduces an end-to-end network slicing framework that spans from the user to the Centralized Unit, within a system model incorporating an Open Radio Access Network and Cell-Free massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output architecture. Our contribution begins with a detailed review of the anticipated 6G Key Performance Indicators and their implications for network slicing. We then propose a novel approach that leverages Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) to enable a single intelligent agent to address multiple service requirements through a unified training phase. By replacing multiple specialized agents with a single MORL agent, our approach significantly improves the scalability, reduces the complexity, and enhances the practicality of network slicing orchestration-while maintaining optimal system performance. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed MORL-based solution. The trained agent not only ensures the Quality of Service for diverse user service requests but also successfully manages the coexistence of conflicting service types. This includes accommodating the stringent requirements of Extremely Reliable and Low-Latency Communications alongside Further-Enhanced Mobile Broadband services within the same network environment.},

  abstract     = {Physical layer security (PLS) technique is expected to play a crucial part in the vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks, by offering secure transmission to protect confidential information from potential eavesdropper. Considering a hybrid active-passive reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs)-enhanced integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, this paper proposes a novel secure scheme for transmitting confidential information and performing radar sensing, where vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links share the spectrum resource preoccupied by vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links. We aim to optimize the sum secrecy rate of V2I links by jointly designing the transmit beamforming of RSU, the radio spectrum reuse scheme of V2X links, and active and passive reflection beamforming of hybrid RIS. With above optimization, the proposed approach can enhance secure communication performance of V2I links while guaranteeing the communication quality of V2V links and target sensing capacity of RSU. Since the system model is dynamic, and it is difficult to handle the nonconvex problem, an efficient hierarchical twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (HTD3) method is developed to learn the secure beamforming and spectrum sharing strategies against potential eavesdropping. The proposed method decomposes the spectrum allocation into the deep Q-network procedure and designs the secure beamforming variables by employing the TD3 algorithm. Numerical results exhibit that given a sufficient power budget of hybrid RIS, our HTD3-based method enhances both the secure communication performance of V2I links and radar detection capability of RSU compared with the existing learning methods.},

  abstract     = {This study explores the promising potential of integrating sensing capabilities into multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based networks through innovative multi-sensor fusion techniques, tracking algorithms, and resource management. A novel data fusion technique is proposed within the MIMO-OFDM system, which promotes cooperative sensing among monostatic (JSC) base stations by sharing range-angle maps with a central fusion center. To manage data sharing and control network overhead introduced by cooperation, an excision filter is introduced at each base station. After data fusion, the framework employs a three-step clustering procedure combined with a tracking algorithm to effectively handle point-like and extended targets. Delving into the sensing/communication trade-off, resources such as transmit power, frequency, and time are varied, providing valuable insights into their impact on the overall system performance. Additionally, a sophisticated channel model is proposed, accounting for complex urban propagation scenarios and addressing multipath effects and multiple reflection points for extended targets like vehicles. Evaluation metrics, including (OSPA), downlink sum rate, and bit rate, offer a comprehensive assessment of the system&#39;s localization and communication capabilities, as well as network overhead.},

Operating such a mobile network requires a coordinated design of both the radio access and backhaul networks. The flows transmitted by the trains are accessed through HAPs and routed by the LEO satellite to reach the destination trains. Our objective is to maximize the number of scheduled flows while satisfying quality of service (QoS) requirements.

In time-varying channels, the initially-estimated LF becomes inconsistent with the true LF owing to channel variation. To mitigate this inconsistency, the LF can be learned by using input-output samples obtained from the MIMO detection. However, the input-output samples inevitably have some uncertainties due to detection errors. To address this challenge, we consider a Markov decision process (MDP) to minimize the mismatch between the true and learned LFs under sample uncertainty. Subsequently, we propose a computationally efficient LF learning method to solve the MDP. In the proposed method, we first simplify an LF update model in the MDP, which efficiently captures temporal channel variations by considering the expectation of the channel model noise. Based on the LF update model, we obtain the optimal policy in a closed-form solution by considering the most probable state transition.

The incoherent interferences between automotive frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radars can significantly increase the noise level, leading to the degeneration of target detection. To address the problem, this article proposes an interference suppression approach based on the Fractional Fourier Transform (FRFT). It is noted that the interference component in the intermediate frequency (IF) signal exhibits chirp-like characteristics, which shows the energy concentration in a FRFT domain. Therefore, the interference component can be easily filtered out in the FRFT domain. Additionally, to decrease the computational cost in the presence of multiple interferences, a two-dimensional (2-D) constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detector is utilized to detect interference components. The proposed approach is also effective in scenarios with a large proportion of interference samples. Both simulations and field experiments demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach},

These technological improvements have enabled Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) to transmit data through robust maritime communication networks. However, despite these advancements, AIS data often contain significant missing data due to limitations in both devices and network coverage. To overcome these limitations, this research presents an innovative approach for reconstructing missing points. In this paper, we first extracted the geometric shape and motion characteristics of vessels and constructed a decision tree using an adaptive sparse constraint mechanism to classify four types of vessel trajectories. Then, the vessel classification findings serve as input and the vessel acceleration features are constructed using the heading and velocity features of the trajectories at both ends. Finally, We employ a bidirectional Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU) network to simultaneously train on historical trajectory data. The method progressively shortens the reconstructed trajectory, thereby enhancing the accuracy of the reconstruction. In this paper, comparative experiments are conducted with several algorithms across various dimensions, including algorithm performance, trajectory types, and navigation scenarios. It is indicated by the experimental results that the algorithm discussed in this study outperforms baselines. Significant methodological advancements in vessel trajectory reconstruction are represented by this study, which also shows promising potential for application in intelligent maritime transportation systems.},

The composite observer and radial basis function neural networks (RBF NNs) are established to estimate the yaw angular velocity, system uncertainties, and disturbances.

  abstract     = {In wireless sensor networks, sensor relative localization is a crucial technique. Most of the existing methods utilize ultra-wide band (UWB) ranging signals to obtain internode measurements. However, when the sensor bandwidth is limited, the ranging measurement is of low-precision and leads to poor localization performance. Carrier phase positioning is critical for precise positioning in narrowband positioning systems such as Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and radio interferometric positioning systems (RIPS). However, carrier phase positioning faces the challenge of unknown carrier phase ambiguity resolution, which is more complicated in sensor cooperative relative localization. To address the problem about the utilization of carrier phase in cooperative relative localization, we propose a carrier phase-based positioning method consisting of a four-stage framework. Firstly, we exploit the low-rank property embedded in matrices at multiple epochs and obtain a rough float estimate of ambiguities via a Gauss-Newton low-rank approximation algorithm. Then the proposed method uses multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) to accomplish the rough estimation of the sensor coordinates in the second stage. In the third stage, the float estimates of ambiguities and sensor coordinates are refined by solving the nonlinear least square problem. Finally, partial ambiguity resolution (PAR) is realized by the LAMBDA method and the fixed solution of sensor coordinates can be obtained. We derive the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and utilize numerical simulations to verify that that the performance of the refined float solution can reach the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB). This method results in the fixed solution of sensor coordinates obtained by PAR being more precise. Furthermore, the proposed method has robustness to the ambiguity initial error and the carrier phase measurement noise, resulting in the localization performance achieving centimeter-level accuracy in general cases.},

The UAV is required to complete the sensing of all IoT nodes before returning to the starting position. However, several challenges arise in designing this system, including unknown IoT node positions, a non-convex optimization problem, constrained resources, a dynamic environment, and complex resource allocation.

We formulate a UAV trajectory optimization problem that aims to maximize the radar estimation rate and minimize the UAV flight time, while adhering to constraints on radar sensing performance, information rate, and sensing all the nodes. However, solving this problem using standard optimization techniques is challenging due to the lack of information about the locations of IoT nodes and the non-convex nature of the problem.

However, most current studies primarily focus on generating covariance-like matrices associated with higher dimensional difference co-arrays, neglecting the valuable information embedded in pseudo covariance matrices relevant to sum co-arrays when noncircular (NC) components are present in impinging signals. This leads to suboptimal estimation performance. To address this limitation and well leverage both covariance and pseudo covariance matrices, we propose a two-stage reconstruction-based sequential decoupled (TR-SD) approach using both sum and difference co-arrays corresponding to the deployed sparse symmetric planar array (SSPA). This approach enables the estimation of 2D DOAs of impinging signals and NC phases of NC signals simultaneously. The TR pre-procedures are developed to efficiently reconstruct the conjugate augmented covariance matrix corresponding to the uniform counterpart of the SSPA. Subsequently, SD post-procedures are devised with low computational complexity, maintaining high identifiability and the capability to estimate the NC phases. Numerical simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposed TR-SD approach in diverse signal scenarios, demonstrating enhanced identifiability, improved detection probability, increased estimation accuracy, and high angular resolution.},

However, it remains an open problem that how the EDoF is influenced by the directional radiation pattern of antenna elements. In this work, empowered by the wavenumber-domain channel representation, we analyze the EDoF in a general case where the directivity of antennas, determined by the antenna structure and element spacing, is considered. Specifically, we first reveal the uneven distribution of directivity-aware wavenumber-domain coupling coefficients, i.e., channel gain towards different directions, in the isotropic Rayleigh fading channel. EDoF is then calculated based on such distribution of coupling coefficients. A numerical method is also provided to obtain coupling coefficients via full-wave EM simulations. Due to the influence of antenna directivity, how EDoF and ergodic channel capacity vary with the element spacing are explored via simulations for different antenna types.},

Firstly, we propose a general signal model adapted to the RIS-assisted MIMO radar, where the RIS is far-field deployed, and orthogonal waveforms are employed by the MIMO radar. Based on the signal model, a non-coherent detection scheme that requires no phase synchronization and is relatively easy to be implemented, and a coherent detection scheme that obtains a detection performance gain by exploiting the phase information, are proposed. Furthermore, we analyze the detection probability and false alarm probability of proposed detection schemes, and optimization algorithms for the phase shift settings of the RIS elements are formulated using the Neyman-Pearson criterion. Simulation results demonstrate that the RIS-assisted MIMO radar outperforms the traditional MIMO radar.},

A nested U-shaped convolutional neural network (U2Net, where the superscript 2 refers to the nesting level) is exploited to predict the directions of two sources scattered in a 120-degree space. The highlights of U2Net are to design an inner U-net for local features and another outer U-net to fuse local features for global feature patterns. The DOA problem is designed as a multi-label classification task with on-grid patterns, and train data set is generated at low SNR regimes by specifying sample covariance matrix as input features and source direction as labels. Simulation results demonstrate that the U2Net achieves excellent and robust performances in multiple-target DOA estimation tasks, especially under challenging conditions with high noise levels, small snapshots and coherent sources. Moreover, the U2Net has a potential to resolve source angles within grid resolution. Finally, comparative studies verified that the U2Net outperforms traditional DOA methods as well as convolutional neural network with low SNR, limited snapshots and coherent sources presented.},

  abstract     = {The implementation of the partitioned edge learning (PARTEL) framework in practical fast-fading wireless systems with time-varying channels is investigated in this paper. By exploiting the benefit of only training and transmitting a light-size sub-model on devices, PARTEL enjoys both enhanced computation and communication efficiency compared to federated edge learning framework where each device needs to train and transmit all model parameters. In this work, we aim at further enhancing the learning efficiency via minimizing the training latency of each training round in practical fast fading channels, where each round includes multiple channel time-coherence time durations. The challenges arise from the unknown channel state information (CSI) of future durations and the coupling between load balancing and bandwidth allocation among devices. To this end, an equivalent Markov decision process (MDP) problem is derived, where each decision step corresponds to one channel coherence-time duration. The learning load balancing is first determined based on an existing design for static channels by using the expected channel gains. Then, the bandwidth allocation for uploading the local sub-model updates in each duration is sequentially determined by the proposed optimization algorithm. The spectrum efficiency is enhanced since the bandwidth is adaptively allocated to all devices according to their communication and computation statuses in each coherence-time duration. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to show the superiority of our proposed algorithms over the existing benchmarks. Specifically, the proposed algorithm can reduce the one-round latency by up to 25.51% for the bandwidth of 70 MHz.},

  abstract     = {Controller area network (CAN) bus is the most widely used protocol for in-vehicle networks, but it lacks security mechanism in design and is susceptible to various attacks. In addition, the on-board diagnostic port (OBD-II) is the physical access point of the CAN bus. However, adversaries can inject messages into the CAN bus through this port, thereby maliciously controlling the vehicle. Aiming at the above problems, this paper proposes a novel authentication and key agreement scheme for in-vehicle networks. Specifically, the proposed scheme considers the issue of secure communication on the CAN bus and the device access issue of the OBD-II port. Static random access memory physical unclonable function (SRAM PUF) is used to perform electronic control unit (ECU) authentication, group key distribution and data frame authentication, ensuring the authenticity of the ECU and the confidentiality and integrity of the data frame. It can also resist replay, physical and other attacks. Besides, we design the authentication and key agreement protocols of external devices in two scenarios respectively to prevent external devices from injecting malicious messages into the CAN bus through the OBD-II port. Finally, we use Scyther and Go language to verify the proposed scheme. The verification results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is not only able to achieve various security goals, but also proves the correctness of its logic. Compared with existing group-based schemes, this scheme has moderate computational and communication overhead overall, but has obvious advantages in key update and authentication of external devices, which can fulfill the low-latency and resource-constrained requirements of in-vehicle networks.},

This framework can learn the operating policy of small base stations in an ultra-dense heterogeneous network, resulting in maximum energy savings while respecting quality of service (QoS) constraints. Additionally, the use of federated learning enhances the security of the system as only the model parameters are shared among the entities, rather than the raw and potentially sensitive data. In other words, in the event of a data breach or eavesdropping, only the parameters of the developed artificial intelligence model would be compromised. This approach ensures that the network remains secure against attacks targeting confidential and sensitive data. The performance evaluation reveals that the proposed framework can achieve an energy saving that is about 77% more than that of the state-of-the-art solutions while respecting the QoS constraints of the network.},

  abstract     = {Age of Information (AoI) is a critical metric that can be used to assess the freshness of information in highly dynamic low-earth orbit (LEO) terrestrial-satellite communications. In most existing research on the AoI of wireless transmissions, the packet transmission rate rarely changes. However, over a given period of time and without perfect transmit power control, the transmission rate of LEO terrestrial-satellite links cannot remain constant. This is due to the time-varying path loss fading experienced by the transmitted signal over the LEO terrestrial-satellite links, as the LEO satellites can travel at speeds exceeding Mach 10 and complete 12-16 Earth orbits per day. Inspired by this observation, this paper investigates the effects of the swift motion of LEO satellites on the freshness of information in LEO terrestrial-satellite uplink transmissions. At the same time, the Slotted Aloha protocol is considered to manage the process of multiple ground nodes accessing the LEO satellites. The closed-form expression for the average AoI of the LEO terrestrial-satellite uplink transmissions is explicitly derived for the single ground node scenario. Furthermore, a model for analyzing the average AoI in the multi-ground node scenario is proposed accordingly. Finally, numerical results are presented to validate the proposed analysis models of the average AoI and to investigate the AoI variation in the target LEO terrestrial-satellite transmission systems.},

Several deep learning-based Semantic Communication (SC) models have been proposed to reduce feature transmission overhead and mitigate channel noise interference. Previous research has demonstrated that Spiking Neural Network (SNN)-based SC models exhibit greater robustness on digital channels compared to Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based SC models. However, the existing SNN-based SC models require fixed time steps, resulting in fixed transmission bandwidths that cannot be adaptively adjusted based on channel conditions. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel SC model called SNN-SC-HARQ, which combines the SNN-based SC model with the Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ) mechanism. SNN-SC-HARQ comprises an SNN-based SC model that supports the transmission of features at varying bandwidths, along with a policy model that determines the appropriate bandwidth. Experimental results show that SNN-SC-HARQ can dynamically adjust the bandwidth according to the channel conditions without performance loss.},

Service providers can dynamically update their caches to improve the system offloading efficiency. To maximize the offloading efficiency, we formulate the TSCU problem as a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem and develop an improved discrete cuckoo search algorithm to solve the optimization problem. Our proposed algorithm explores the global environment via Levy flight. On the other hand, the algorithm convergence rate is accelerated by generating the initial population based on a greedy algorithm and its variants and updating the discard probability. Simulation results show that our proposal has achieved an up to 12% improvement in offloading efficiency compared to the benchmark schemes.},

In this paper, a novel GNSS multi-fault detection and correction method is developed that achieves a balance between computational complexity and performance. The proposed method incorporates an Expectation Maximization (EM) framework to jointly estimate an approximate maximum likelihood of states and latent model parameters in the presence of observation outliers, i.e., faults. However, the EM algorithm is known for its high computational complexity. To reduce the computational complexity of EM, an importance sampling step based on unsupervised clustering is introduced. As demonstrated by the results and analysis herein, the proposed method outperforms the existing Least-squares Residuals method, achieving an average improvement of up to 48% in positioning accuracy. Additionally, the computational complexity of the proposed method is an order of magnitude lower than the state-of-the-art Solution Separation method. The method enhances positioning reliability at a lower computational cost and does not require additional infrastructure, hence, can be readily integrated into standalone real-time GNSS applications.},

Tire capacity, which refers to the grip margin of the tire, represents the maximum additional force that a tire can exert under current conditions. It determines whether the vehicle is capable of executing additional steering, braking, and driving maneuvers while ensuring safety. This study proposes a direct tire capacity estimation method, which represents an advance in the field of tire capacity identification method. This method utilizes an end-to-end architecture to train the network, enabling direct utilization of signals from on-board sensors for estimating tire capacity, irrespective of whether the tires operate under pure or combined slip conditions. Additionally, it mitigates the issues of error transfer and accumulation often found in traditional layered estimation methods that overly rely on intermediate states. Outputs from the single-track (2-DOF) vehicle model are integrated as features to enhance the network&#39;s learning capability and interpretability. Additionally, a long-short-term memory (LSTM) based network is constructed to capture the nonlinear relationship and address the phase difference between features. The results of the validation and test sets show high identification accuracy, while the cosimulation of real driving scenarios is used for further verification. The results indicate that the proposed method accurately captures tire capacity information during whole tire working regions and exhibits robust generalization ability.},

  abstract     = {Edge computing (EC) has emerged as an important technology to support the low-delay request of massive devices nowadays. Task offloading is an essential part in EC because it can influence the use of network resources and network performance dramatically. Most existing task offloading works are only from the view of users. To effectively considering the features and objectives of both users and edge nodes from their different perspectives, a Stackelberg game-based joint computing resource allocation and task offloading method is proposed in this paper. For the nature in EC where edge nodes and users play different roles, the problem is formulated as a bi-level optimization model with multiple leaders and multiple followers. The edge nodes can be seen as leaders and the users are followers. When jointly allocating computing resource and offloading tasks, edge nodes and users have different objectives. The objective of edge nodes is to achieve the most revenue and least energy cost, and the objective of users is to obtain short delay, consume little energy and pay less. Further, considering the particular features of EC, unlike existing Stackelberg game-based task offloading research, we focus on the computing resource allocation rather than pricing. The edge nodes decide the amount of computing resources to be allocated to each user. The users will then react according to such allocation to decide task offloading strategies. Interference, delay, energy, and payoff are all considered. Evolutionary optimization method BLEAQ-II is applied to solve the designed Stackelberg game-based task offloading model.

  abstract     = {This article investigates the problem of practical predefined-time formation tracking for multiple unmanned surface vehicles facing the case of lumped uncertainties (namely, model uncertainties, external disturbances, and actuator failures). An estimator-based adaptive fuzzy control algorithm is designed to handle this complex problem, comprising two integral components: 1) a predefined-time distributed estimator and 2) an adaptive fuzzy formation tracking controller. The distributed estimator is designed to accurately estimate the target state within a predefined time. By utilizing filtering techniques to define the filtered errors, and combining fuzzy logic systems with adaptive compensation methods, an adaptive fuzzy controller is developed to achieve the time-varying formation tracking task. Sufficient conditions for achieving practical predefined-time convergence of the tracking errors are derived using Lyapunov stability analysis. Finally, numerical simulations involving multiple Cyber-Ships II are conducted to validate the primary results.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we establish a unified mathematical approach that connects the ergodic capacity of a wireless channel to the iterated Laplace transform of the channel&#39;s statistical characteristics. Particularly, we show that the ergodic capacity of any wireless channel can be interpreted as the iterated Laplace transform of the complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) of the effective channel power gain. Building on this intriguing result, we analyze and exemplify the ergodic capacity of a very general class of wireless channels whose CCDF is expressed in terms of a product of a power function and a Fox H-function. Interestingly, the ergodic capacity of such a class of wireless channels can be straightforwardly obtained by means of the iterated Laplace transform, thereby circumventing the task of solving intricate integrals that are typically indispensable to quantifying the ergodic capacity. Furthermore, we extend our iterated Laplace transform approach to analyze and exemplify the ergodic capacity in various communication settings, including diversity combining receivers, double fading channels, mobility, and communication in the presence of co-channel interference. Our approach not only simplifies the evaluation of ergodic capacity across these settings but also provides a novel perspective that underscores its merit across a wide range of applications.},

Rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) has emerged as a promising technology for achieving high spectral efficiency and maintaining reliable connectivity in mobile scenes. Inspired by the idea of distributed computing, an RSMA-assisted distributed computation offloading scheme (RDCOS) in vehicular networks is designed, where various computation auxiliary nodes (CANs) are introduced in a stochastic geometry approach to alleviate the computation dilemma of the task vehicle. After analyzing the CAN pairing and the successful accessing probability (SAP), the total offloaded tasks maximization problem of the task vehicle is investigated. Then a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based computation offloading optimization algorithm (SCOOA) is developed to obtain the solution. The results of the performance evaluation not only verify the plausibility of the proposed model but also indicate that the RSMA can significantly promote the total offloaded tasks under moving conditions, which confirms the superiority of the proposed scheme through simulations.},

The equalizer employs the unitary approximate message passing (UAMP) algorithm, while the unitary transformation is implemented using the fast Fourier transform (FFT) with the aid of a cyclic prefix (CP), thereby achieving low computational complexity while with high performance. For CPM demodulation and channel decoding, with belief propagation (BP), we design a message passing-based maximum a posteriori (MAP) algorithm, and the message exchange between the demodulator, decoder and equalizer is elaborated. With proper message passing schedules, the receiver can achieve fast convergence. Simulation results show that compared with existing turbo receivers, the proposed receiver delivers significant performance enhancement with low computational complexity.},

The challenges of long-range spectrum prediction stem from the long-time dependencies, intricate nonlinear correlations, and multi-scale characteristics of electromagnetic spectrum data. This paper proposes the Multi-Scale Time Fusion Transformer (MSTFformer) architecture, which not only deeply mines the spectrum occupancy characteristics, but also designs a pyramid attention mask to effectively reduce the computational complexity of the multi-head attention mechanism. The MSTFformer consists of three components, namely the Trend Building Net (TRENDNET), Time Series Encoding Net (TENET), and Pyramid Attention Mechanism Decoding Net (PADNET). The TRENDNET is employed to capture the long-range trend features of electromagnetic spectrum data over varying time lengths. The TENET leverages BiLSTM memory units to enhance the nonlinear attributes of local temporal information and utilizes Gating Propagation (GP) and Gating Residual (GR) components to regulate information flow. The PADNET automatically constructs a multi-scale pyramid to extract correlation information within and between scales, thereby promoting the interaction of cross-scale information, and using pyramid masks to reduce model complexity. Experimental results show that compared with the other ten methods, the MSTFformer ranks third in inference speed, while surpassing the second-best method in prediction accuracy with reductions in MSE, RMSE, and MAE by 71.4%, 43.2%, and 26.6%, respectively.},

To address these challenges, we propose a collaborative framework that leverages device-to-device (D2D) communication and multiple UAVs to enhance MEC performance. We aim to minimize the system average latency by jointly optimizing content caching, task offloading, UAV trajectory planning, and computational resource allocation. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem and decomposed into three subproblems. An iterative algorithm based on penalty successive convex approximation (P-SCA) and Lagrangian duality is developed to alternately optimize these subproblems until convergence. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our algorithm significantly reduces system average latency and enhances network performance across various scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Oil spills represent significant environmental hazards in ocean ecosystems, requiring rapid and accurate detection and response mechanisms. Due to its efficacy, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an important tool for remote monitoring of ocean environments. However, operational constraints such as communication time between low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites and ground stations (GS), as well as finite buffers, pose challenges. To address these issues, this paper proposes a space-air-ground-integrated network (SAGIN) scenario comprising LEO satellites, high altitude platforms (HAPs), and ground stations (GSs), suitable for rapid and accurate oil spill detection using SAR images. In addition, a novel three-step algorithm is proposed to facilitate SAR image transmission effectively. The first step of the proposed algorithm focuses on maximizing the transmission of ocean SAR images from the LEO satellites to the HAPs. This optimization involves the neural Myerson auction (NMA)-based scheduler, a second-price auction mechanism with deep learning methodologies for truthfulness, distributed computation, and low computational complexity. In addition, the pathloss is also considered for effective communication system design. The second step algorithm aims to maximize data transmission efficiency from HAPs to GSs, employing scheduling strategies based on the Markov decision process (MDP). This algorithm enables optimal decision-making over time steps, considering the throughput of each GS and the age of the information (AoI) ratio. Finally, an image compression rate control algorithm based on Lyapunov optimization is employed at the GSs to enhance detection accuracy while ensuring queue stability. The performance of the proposed three-step algorithm is intensively evaluated against various benchmark algorithms, demonstrating its superiority in oil spill detection efficacy.},

Intermediate decision variables are introduced to enable the high-level RL policy to provide an interaction-aware reference, for guiding low-level model predictive control (MPC) and further enhancing the generalization ability of the proposed framework. By leveraging the structured nature of self-driving at unsignalized intersections, the training problem of the RL policy is modeled as a bilevel curriculum learning task, which is addressed by the proposed Exp3.S-based BiMAB algorithm. It is noteworthy that the training curricula are dynamically adjusted, thereby facilitating the sample efficiency of the RL training process. Comparative experiments are conducted in the high-fidelity CARLA simulator, and the results indicate that our approach achieves superior performance compared to all baseline methods. Furthermore, experimental results in two new urban driving scenarios clearly demonstrate the commendable generalization performance of the proposed method.},

In this paper, we proposed a privacy-preserving matching scheme based on threshold private set intersection, which can protect the location privacy in the malicious model. To reduce computational overhead, we designed a new efficient method for the cardinality test of the route intersection size, based on symmetric-key primitives and a constant number of public-key operations. In addition, our privacy-preserving matching scheme uses geographic indistinguishability to generate virtual points as input sets of privacy-preserving matching scheme, and the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) uses the output of privacy-preserving matching scheme to match the appropriate vehicle for the user.

For the performance, it is the first FPC antenna integrated with duplex and multi-beam radiation. It is the first endeavor to apply a wideband FPC to a duplex antenna with two channels, aiming at significantly enhancing their realized gains and subsequently achieving three switchable directive beams. Firstly, a low-profile duplex slot antenna with two isolated channels (9.4 and 10.7 GHz) is designed. Then, to enhance the realized gains for two channels simultaneously, a wideband FPC with a stepped reflective ground is designed and combined with the proposed duplex slot antenna. The upper ground of the duplex antenna can be reused as the reflector for FPC. Even there three duplex sources on the ground, it will not affect the reflectivity of the wave in FPC due to the relatively small radiation aperture of the slot. By utilizing this method, the experimental results show that the realized gains of two channels are increased to 15.2 and 16.2 dBi, respectively, which are improved by more than 12 dB. Finally, three duplex slot antennas are placed on the bottom of the FPC, and excited individually. For two channels, the H-plane directive beams can be switched at −18°, 0°, and 18° relative to its broadside direction. The proposed antenna is a good candidate for vehicular communications systems such as vehicle-satellite and low-altitude communication where requires low profile, wide coverage range and long-distance data transmission.},

Here, we introduce a new triple-band high-gain antenna, which produces the operating frequencies at sub-6, K-and Ka- bands for the first time.

  abstract     = {Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) is envisioned as a highly promising modulation technique due to its superior performance in high-mobility scenarios. Meanwhile, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) stands out as a key contender for enhancing spectral efficiency and reducing transmission delay. In this paper, we amalgamate the pattern division multiple access (PDMA), recognized as an appealing NOMA scheme, with OTFS, coined as OTFS-PDMA, to leverage the benefits of both technologies and address the low-latency and massive connectivity demands of sixth-generation (6 G) networks. Specifically, we first reformulate the input-output relations in the delay-Doppler domain for localized and distributed-mapping-based OTFS-PDMA systems featuring various PDMA pattern allocation schemes. Then, we propose a low-complexity power vector expectation propagation detection algorithm (PV-EPA) for OTFS-PDMA schemes operating in spatially correlated channels. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed OTFS-PDMA scheme offers substantial performance improvements over the conventional OTFS-OMA scheme. For irregular PDMA patterns, localized mapping-based OTFS-PDMA schemes exhibit superior performance relative to their distributed counterparts. Additionally, the proposed PV-EPA receiver shows remarkable robustness against channel correlation and achieves a favorable trade-off between performance and complexity.},

  abstract     = {To mitigate the impact of human-driven vehicles (HDVs) on connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) in mixed traffic environments, the implementation of dedicated lanes has been proposed to achieve partial separation between CAVs and HDVs, thereby improving the operational efficiency of both CAVs and the road segment. The lane management policy, where dedicated lanes for HDV (HDLs) and general lanes (GLs) coexist on a road segment, is referred to as the (G, H) policy. This paper proposes a multi-lane fundamental diagram model for mixed traffic flow and aims to investigate the effects of HDL configuration on the efficiency of road segments under the (G, H) policy. Firstly, different car-following modes in mixed traffic flow are analyzed, and various car-following models are employed to characterize the mixed traffic flow. Secondly, two lane selection principles are introduced to describe the lane choice behavior of HDVs under the (G, H) policy. Based on these principles, five equilibrium states that may exist on the road segment under the (G, H) policy are analyzed. Subsequently, a multi-lane fundamental diagram model incorporating HDL is derived based on the lane selection principles of HDV. Finally, numerical analysis is conducted to investigate the influence of lane configuration schemes under the (G, H) policy on the distribution of equilibrium states, fundamental diagram, and capacity. The results indicate that: (1) Based on the lane choice behavior of vehicles, the equilibrium states of road segment can be classified into five types. The distribution of each equilibrium state under different traffic conditions only depends on the proportion of HDL to the total number of lanes on road segment. A higher number of HDL leads to a reduced applicability of the (G, H) policy under different traffic conditions. (2) Under different penetration rates, as density increases, the overall traffic volume of road segment initially increases and then decreases until reaching the critical jammed density. (3) In a three-lane scenario, compared to the absence of HDL, the optimal HDL configuration scheme can increase the traffic volume of road segment by approximately 11%. (4) With HDL deployment, the capacity of road segment initially increases and then decreases with an increase in CAVs penetration rate.},

To obtain the best tradeoff between communication and sensing performance, we maximize the sum of downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) transmission rates under the constraints of Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and the maximal transmit power by jointly optimizing the power/subcarrier allocation and APs mode selection. To deal with the proposed nonconvex problem, we adopt the alternating optimization (AO) method to divide the original problem into two subproblems. The first subproblem is related to power/subcarriers allocation, which is equivalently transformed into a Semidefinite Programming (SDP) problem and eventually solved by the penalized convex-concave procedure (PCCP) method. The second subproblem is a quadratic integer problem related to APs mode selection, which is transformed into a convex quadratic integer problem that can be efficiently solved by the convex optimization toolbox. The numerical results demonstrate the tradeoff between the total transmission rate and sensing performance with different parameter configurations. Compared with existing schemes, our proposed scheme has significant advantages in terms of tradeoff performance.},

  abstract     = {As maritime activities increase, the demand for high-speed, low-latency communications and efficient task processing in maritime communication networks (MCNets) intensifies. Currently, sea-surface communications and tasks mainly depend on on-shore base stations, which have limited coverage, and marine satellites, which offer broader reach but cannot provide high-speed connections and are costly. Motivated by the above, we investigate the deployment of air base stations (ABSs) in MCNets to offer flexible coverage and handle maritime-specific tasks. ABS-aided MCNets benefit from the integration of mobile edge computing (MEC) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) techniques. Specifically, by optimizing the task offloading and resource allocation, we formulate a total task processing delay minimization problem under the constraints of task time-to-live (TTL) and successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding threshold. Since the formulated problem is non-convex, we decouple it and solve it iteratively. The channel allocation, power control, offloading ratio, and computation resource allocation are tackled in turn. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms existing schemes in reducing the total task processing delay. Notably, the incorporation of NOMA markedly enhances the task offloading rate, further decreasing the total task processing delay. The proposed scheme cuts the total task processing delay by at least 7.7% compared to the state-of-the-art schemes and by 40.9% against the local computing benchmark. Additionally, the performance of the proposed scheme, including its complexity, convergence, and the performance loss due to iterative optimization, is analyzed.},

A lightweight resilient formation control framework based on watermarks is proposed to achieve the desired formation configuration without extra monitoring attack status. Since deception attacks are covert, the shared information is watermarked before transmission to establish the protocol among networked UAVs. To facilitate the resilient formation controller design, a decoder is first developed to decipher the inverse transformation of deception attacks, where the watermark is the criterion for approximating the inverse transformation. The Gauss error function is introduced to eliminate some unrealistic input commands under deception attacks, obtaining the predefined input performance. Then, a resilient formation controller is developed to guarantee the global boundedness of all signals within the inner-loop and outerloop system, while the formation error converges to a small neighborhood of zero by solving the linear matrix inequality. Two challenging deception attack examples in simulations and experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness and performance of the proposed resilient formation control framework},

However, the link budget shortage resulting from long propagation length limits the capacity of communications. Distributed beamforming is a solution that provides high power gain by utilizing multiple transmitters simultaneously. This work presents a novel distributed beamforming scheme for LEO satellites direct connectivity services that can provide high power gain for multiple ground UEs with arbitrary locations and numbers. Firstly, an algorithm is designed for static satellites. By selecting satellites from a set of available ones and optimizing the transmit phases of electromagnetic waves on satellites, all the ground UEs can receive power gains improvement. Furthermore, this work considers satellite motions by proposing a fast algorithm that adjusts phases according to changing satellite locations. Finally, a satellite re-selection process is designed to ensure stable power improvement when satellites become unavailable due to their motions. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our design. For four static satellites and 10 UEs, we examine 20 cases with different satellite and UE locations. Results show that UEs receive an average of at least 7dB power gain in most cases. The condition of four moving satellites is also tested, and results demonstrate that all 10 UEs can have consistent receiving power gain as satellites move quickly.},

In this paper, an uplink ANOMA based on MSK -type signals with imperfect channel state information and successive interference cancellation over generalized fading channels is proposed, and its ergodic capacity is investigated. Specifically, the system model is first established. Then, a moment generating function (MGF)-based ergodic capacity expression applicable to general fading channels with known MGF is derived. Based on the expression, the integral expressions for the ergodic capacity over Rayleigh and Rician fading channels are exactly derived, respectively, and their closed-form expressions are also provided by exploiting the Gauss-Laguerre method. Further, their expressions with perfect conditions, asymptotic expressions at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and high SNR slopes are also derived. The accuracy of the expression is verified by numerical and simulation results. It also shows the superiority of the proposed scheme over conventional OMA and ANOMA with linear modulation, and the relationship between system performance and time offsets, imperfect conditions, channel differences, and modulation formats.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we focus on minimizing the total energy consumption of multi-cell massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks while simultaneously guaranteeing user quality of service (QoS). This is achieved by optimizing the multi-level advanced sleep modes (ASM), antenna switching, and user association of the base stations (BSs). Due to the interdependence of user association and inter-cell interference in the network, collaborative efforts among individual BSs become imperative. The problem is modeled as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (DEC-POMDP) and a multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) algorithm is proposed to obtain a collaborative BS control policy. Simulation results demonstrate that the obtained policy can significantly improve network energy efficiency, adaptively switch the BSs into different depths of sleep, reduce inter-cell interference, and maintain good QoS compared to the two benchmark algorithms. The results also validate that enabling user offloading among BSs can improve both user QoS and system performance. The superiority of MAPPO is further affirmed by comparing it with the single-agent deep Q network (DQN) algorithm.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel joint weight design scheme for pre/post-coding in multiuser massive multiple-input multiple-output (MU-mMIMO) downlink in time-varying channel environments. It combines Null-Space Expansion (NSE) and Maximum Eigenmode Beamforming (MEB), mainly focusing on user terminals (UTs) with multiple antenna elements. NSE steers additional nulls for interfering UTs using multiple past channel state information (CSI). Since NSE does not predict future channels, it performs excellent interference suppression in high-mobility environments for UTs. However, the limited antenna degrees of freedom (DoF) on the base station (BS) side make it challenging to form nulls effectively for interference suppression in NSE. Therefore, this paper utilizes maximum eigenmode beamforming (MEB). MEB utilizes singular value decomposition (SVD) to form a single stream corresponding to the maximum singular value on the UT side. MEB can supplement the beamforming gain reduction on BS side caused by NSE. Moreover, when a dominant line-of-sight (LoS) component exists in the channel, MEB also performs beamforming for this LoS component on each UT side. Since the LoS component is not highly sensitive to channel fluctuations, the nullification by NSE works more effectively. Computer simulations demonstrate that NSE incorporated with MEB can significantly enhance the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) performance compared to conventional channel prediction-based precoding schemes. Its improvement is particularly notable in high-speed UT movement scenarios. This study presents MEB-NSE as an effective solution for stable multiuser spatial multiplexing in mobility environments.},

  abstract     = {Lane-changing decisions, which are crucial for autonomous vehicle path planning, face practical challenges due to rule-based constraints and limited data. Deep reinforcement learning has become a major research focus due to its advantages in data acquisition and interpretability. However, current models often overlook collaboration, which affects not only impacts overall traffic efficiency but also hinders the vehicle&#39;s own normal driving in the long run. To address the aforementioned issue, this paper proposes a method named Mix Q-learning for Lane Changing (MQLC) that integrates a hybrid value Q network, taking into account both collective and individual benefits for the greater good. At the collective level, our method coordinates the individual Q and global Q networks by utilizing global information. This enables agents to effectively balance their individual interests with the collective benefit. At the individual level, we integrate a deep learning-based intent recognition module into our observation and enhance the decision network. These changes provide agents with richer decision information and more precise feature extraction for improved lane-changing decisions. This strategy enables the multi-agent system to learn and formulate optimal decision-making strategies effectively. Our MQLC model, through extensive experimental results, impressively outperforms other state-of-the-art multi-agent decision-making methods, effectively improving the overall efficiency.},

This study introduces a novel, privacy-preserving robust SOH estimation for heterogeneous batteries using customized federated learning (FL). The approach aggregates local SOH models into a global model while preserving data privacy at the source. It leverages statistical and system utility indicators for battery management system client selection, incorporating the Epsilon-Greedy method to dynamically include new clients and adjust the participant count based on global model efficacy. Additionally, a performance-discrepancy weighted aggregation mechanism is designed by using the L2 distance and loss indices as weights for local models. A discrepancy-based personalization method further refines the number of personalization layers, enhancing local model performance. Through detailed case analysis, the proposed algorithm is shown to surpass conventional FL, centralized, and local training methods across scenarios of varied battery types, data inaccuracies, communication errors, and operational risks, demonstrating superior adaptability and robustness.},

Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal is a mainstream candidate ISAC waveform. However, there are inter-symbol interference (ISI) and inter-carrier interference (ICI) when the round-trip delay exceeds the cyclic prefix (CP) duration for OFDM signals, which limits the maximum sensing range of ISAC system. When detecting a long-range target, the wide beam inevitably covers the close-range target, of which the echo&#39;s power is much larger than that of the long-range target. In order to tackle the above problem, a multiple signal classification (MUSIC) and least squares (LS)-based spatial signal separation method is proposed to separate the echo signals reflected from different targets. Moreover, a coherent compensation-based sensing signal processing method at the receiver is proposed to enhance the signal to interference plus noise power ratio (SINR) of the OFDM block for generating the range-Doppler map (RDM) with higher SINR. Simulation results reveal that the proposed method greatly enhances the SINR of RDM by 10 dB for a target at 500 m compared with two-dimensional fast Fourier transform (2D-FFT) method. Besides, the detection probability is also significantly improved compared to the benchmarking method.},

  abstract     = {The implementation of intelligent driving technology is inseparable from reliable wireless communication and efficient cache scheduling in Vehicle Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs). The purpose of cache scheduling in VANETs is to provide efficient and fast data services to vehicles. In response to difficult to handle wireless communication interference and high requirements for communication delay and energy consumption optimization in vehicle-road cooperation, we propose a new communication model of “Retrieving-Cast” to simplify the cache scheduling process oriented by data requirements. In V2I mode, consider the uplink of all roadside units(RSUs) retrieving data from vehicles, and prioritize data retrieving based on factors such as the number, density, and urgency of vehicles within the communication coverage range of RSUs. We hope that as many high-priority RSUs as possible to complete cached data retrieving as soon as possible under wireless communication interference. To overcome the limitations of traditional heuristic algorithms with low scheduling efficiency and deep learning methods requiring a large amount of training data, we propose a double-$\varepsilon$ online reinforcement learning method, which efficiently solves the cache retrieval scheduling problem. Through experiments and analysis, our method achieved better scheduling results compared to traditional approximation algorithms and single $\varepsilon$-greedy Deep Q-learning methods. The designed data transformation method also addresses the issue of requiring a large amount of training data, enabling rapid computation of scheduling requests in the network at an extremely low training cost, meeting the low-latency computation requirements in VANETs.},

Different 5 G NR codebooks incur varying overheads and exhibit performance disparities under diverse channel conditions, necessitating codebook adaptation based on channel conditions to reduce feedback overhead while enhancing performance. However, existing methods of 5 G NR codebooks adaptation require significant overhead for model training and feedback or fall short in performance. To address these limitations, this letter introduces a federated reservoir computing framework designed for efficient codebook adaptation in computationally and feedback resource-constrained mobile devices. This framework utilizes a novel series of indicators as input training data, striking an effective balance between performance and feedback overhead. Compared to conventional models, the proposed codebook adaptation via federated reservoir computing (CA-FedRC), achieves rapid convergence and significant loss reduction in both speed and accuracy. Extensive simulations under various channel conditions demonstrate that our algorithm not only reduces resource consumption of users but also accurately identifies channel types, thereby optimizing the trade-off between spectrum efficiency, computational complexity, and feedback overhead.},

Specifically, a round-trip multipath propagation model is established. Firstly, under the assumption of $H_{0}$, the 0-1 non-coherent threshold for noise and multipath is calculated based on the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detection method. Secondly, the signal and noise in the radar&#39;s received echo are separated using this 0-1 threshold, leading to the proposal of a 0-1 non-coherent binary accumulation imaging method. Finally, a two-stage NLOS target positioning method is introduced to address issues of false alarms and missed detections, and simulation and experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

In this paper, we propose a vector quantization (VQ) framework for DL-based CSI feedback to provide an efficient finite-bit representation of the latent vector. In our framework, a trainable VQ module is employed after the encoder network, and entropy coding is applied to the output of the VQ module. To jointly train the encoder and decoder networks with the VQ codebook, we design a quantization criterion and loss function of vector-quantized variational autoencoder based on the rate-distortion theory. We also devise two practical strategies to make the proposed framework applicable under a strict bit budget constraint. Using simulations, we demonstrate that DL-based CSI feedback with the proposed framework outperforms existing quantization-aware DL-based CSI feedback methods.},

To address these issues, we propose the Task-Centric Multi-User Semantic Communication (TCMSC) solution, designed to meet the energy consumption and transmission time delay requirements in line with the new paradigm of semantic communication. Our solution introduces a task-centric semantic processing model aimed at improving Semantic Spectral Efficiency (S-SE).

Moreover, we propose a novel method using Stochastic Network Calculus (SNC) to accurately model semantic task delay and calculate the upper bound of Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) delay-bound violation probability. However, to tackle the increased optimization complexity from SNC while simultaneously enhancing feature extraction, we propose the Transformer Advantage Actor Critic (TR-A2C) algorithm. This algorithm leverages the Transformer to capture dynamic vehicle parameters across scenarios, accelerating the TCMSC solution. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional single-service vehicle dispatch, TCMSC improves delay violation probability by ${2.88\%}$ and reduces power consumption by ${31.1\%}$, all while effectively enhancing S-SE in complex traffic environments.},

We formulate this as a multi-objective, non-convex Non-Linear Mixed Integer Programming (NLMIP) problem, incorporating both deployment and resource allocation practical constraints. To manage the problem&#39;s complexity, we decompose it into two sub-problems: FBS deployment and resource allocation optimization. To optimize the 2D deployment of FBSs in horizontal space, we propose a general, low-complexity heuristic method based on a statistical variant of the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm, named Evolutionary Bayesian SOM (EBSOM). Then, utilizing a Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) communication scheme between FBSs and SGUs, we maximize the downlink sum rate while adhering to constraints on FBS positions, transmission power, and bandwidth availability. In this stage, the deployment of FBSs is further refined to enhance resource allocation by dividing the problem into two non-convex sub-problems, which are solved iteratively using Surrogate Optimization (SO). Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy, particularly in reducing the number of active FBSs, minimizing overlapping areas, and improving network sum rates.},

Predicting the QoS in a timely manner is of high importance, especially for safety-critical applications as in the case of vehicular communications. Although until recent years the QoS prediction has been carried out by centralized Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, a number of privacy, computational, and operational concerns have emerged. Alternative solutions have surfaced (e.g. Split Learning, Federated Learning), distributing AI tasks of reduced complexity across nodes, while preserving the privacy of the data. However, new challenges rise when it comes to scalable distributed learning approaches, taking into account the heterogeneous nature of future wireless networks. The current work proposes DISTINQT, a novel multi-headed input privacy-aware distributed learning framework for QoS prediction. Our framework supports multiple heterogeneous nodes, in terms of data types and model architectures, by sharing computations across them. This enables the incorporation of diverse knowledge into a sole learning process that will enhance the robustness and generalization capabilities of the final QoS prediction model. DISTINQT also contributes to data privacy preservation by encoding any raw input data into highly complex, compressed, and irreversible latent representations before any transmission. Evaluation results showcase that DISTINQT achieves a statistically identical performance compared to its centralized version, while also proving the validity of the privacy preserving claims. DISTINQT manages to achieve a reduction in prediction error of up to 65% on average against six state-of-the-art centralized baseline solutions presented in the Tele-Operated Driving use case.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a symbol-level channel pattern optimization (SLCPO) scheme for pattern reconfigurable (PR) multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) communication systems. Unlike existing transmission schemes that treat the channel as invariant, this work proposes to actively adjust the radiation power of each scattering path of the wireless channel by adjusting the radiation pattern of the transmit array, thereby removing the limitations that communications can only adapt to the wireless channel passively. We separate the optimization into two stages. In the first stage, an optimization problem on the channel matrix aimed at maximizing the worst user&#39;s quality-of service (QoS) without investing additional signal power is formulated. Given the non-convex nature of the formulated problem, we design an alternating optimization algorithm, and obtain the channel covariance matrix that achieves optimal performance for each transmission symbol slot. This structure, proven to be optimal, provides key theoretical insights into the ideal channel conditions for symbol-level precoding (SLP). In the second stage, we propose the radiation pattern design in reconfigurable MU-MISO communication systems, where communication channels are jointly decided by the radiation pattern of the transmit array and the physical propagation channel, aligning the practical pattern channel with the theoretical optimal channel. Numerical results verify the superiority of the proposed SLCPO scheme in PR MU-MISO systems in terms of error rate over state-of-the-art.},

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of accurately localizing $N$ unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in 3D space where the UAVs are part of a swarm and communicate with each other through orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) modulated signals. The OTFS communication system operates in the delay-Doppler domain and can simultaneously provide range and velocity information about the scatterers in the channels at no additional cost. Each receiving UAV estimates the multipath wireless channel on each link formed by the line-of-sight (LoS) transmission and by the single reflections from the remaining $N{-}2$ UAVs. The estimated channel delay profiles are communicated to an edge server to estimate the location and velocity of the UAVs from the relative echo delay (RED) measurements between the LoS and the non-LoS paths. To accurately obtain such estimations, we propose a solution called Turbo Iterative Positioning (TIP), initialized by a belief-propagation approach. Enabling a full cold start (no prior knowledge of initial positions), the belief propagation first provides a map associating each echo to a reflecting UAV. The localization of the $N$ UAVs is then derived by iteratively alternating a gradient descent optimization and a refinement of the association maps between UAVs and echos. Given that the OTFS receivers also acquire the Doppler shifts of each path, the UAV&#39;s velocities can be sensed jointly with communication. Our numerical results, obtained also using real-world traces, show how the multipath links are beneficial to achieving very accurate position and velocity for all UAVs, even with a limited delay-Doppler resolution. The robustness of our scheme is proven by its performance approaching the Cramér-Rao bound.},

However, state-of-the-art grant-free massive NOMA schemes for mMIMO systems require accurate estimation of random access channels to perform activity detection and the following coherent data demodulation, which suffers from excessive pilot overhead and access latency. To address this, we propose a pre-equalization aided grant-free massive access scheme for mMIMO systems, where an iterative detection scheme is conceived. Specifically, the base station (BS) firstly activates one of its antennas (i.e., beacon antenna) to broadcast a beacon signal, which facilitates the user equipment (UEs) to perform downlink channel estimation and pre-equalize the uplink random access signal with respect to the channels associated with the beacon antenna. During the uplink transmission stage, the BS detects UEs&#39; activity and data by using the proposed iterative detection algorithm, which consists of three modules: coarse data detection (DD), data-aided channel estimation (CE), and fine DD. In the proposed algorithm, the joint activity and DD is firstly performed based on the signals received by the beacon antenna. Subsequently, the DD is further refined by iteratively performing data-aided CE module and fine DD module using signals received by all BS antennas. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms state-of-the-art mMIMO-based grant-free massive NOMA schemes with the same access latency.},

The performance metrics for the link, including the average bit error rate (BER), outage probability and ergodic capacity are formulated and employed to assess the performance of inter-orbital ISC at THz band. Simulation results demonstrate that an increase in the variance of the beam misalignment angle reduces the accuracy of the ISC link, resulting in a higher average BER and outage probability. Furthermore, optimal central frequency selection is essential to achieve the highest ergodic capacity for different variances, with the potential for reaching tens or even hundreds of gigabits per second (Gbps).},

In this paper, we introduce Software-Defined Multicast (SDM) to broadband LEO constellations and propose a robust SDM policy capable of effectively managing the dynamic nature of LEO constellation networks. To address the obstacle avoidance requirements, we develop an Obstacle-Avoiding Rectilinear Steiner Tree (OA-RST) algorithm and construct an intelligent multicast routing tree. Additionally, we present a resilient multicast management strategy to ensure seamless maintenance and management of multicast groups, even in the face of frequent satellite switching, dynamic membership updates, and resource contention among multiple groups. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed routing tree construction algorithm and management scheme in minimizing the total multicast tree length, conserving network bandwidth resources, and maintaining stable routing in the network.},

In this paper, a generic framework is proposed for arbitrary beam pattern synthesis for mmWave RIS with discrete phase shifts, which is divided into two stages. Specifically, an initial solution is obtained by applying the principles of segmentation and superposition. Subsequently, an iterative optimization algorithm is employed after quantization to refine the discrete phase shifts for improved performance. Given target beam requirements, simulations demonstrate the ability of the proposed algorithm to synthesize any expected beam pattern. Finally, the obtained phase coding is experimentally validated on a fabricated mmWave RIS through a measurement campaign, confirming the practicability and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

As link quality is closely related to LoRa physical layer (PHY) parameters and soil characteristics, it is necessary to carefully configure parameters to maintain reliable connectivity and high EE in the dynamic underground environment. To this end, we propose EnergySaver, which utilizes soil moisture to estimate the underground path loss, derives signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to characterize the packet delivery rate (PDR), and finally calculates EE. The combination that maximizes EE is the best configuration for current channel state. In addition, for the case of densely deployed buried LoRa nodes, we propose a low-complexity collision decoding scheme in EnergySaver that utilizes packet time offsets to decompose concurrent transmissions. The simulation results confirm that EnergySaver improves EE by at least two times without sacrificing high link quality, and effectively reduces packet loss during concurrent data transmission with excellent scalability.},

The key challenge involves how to efficiently execute tasks offloaded from IoT devices, given limited on-board computation capabilities of UAVs and delay constraints of tasks. To address it, UAVs are first allowed to adjust their trajectories to accommodate as many tasks as possible from IoT devices. Subsequently, UAVs compute a portion of these tasks while delegating the rest to LEO satellites for further execution. Accordingly, we formulate a joint optimization problem including UAV trajectory planning, task offloading, and bandwidth allocations, aiming to maximize the long-term energy efficiency of UAVs and LEO satellites (i.e., the total data size in computation offloading divided by energy consumption of UAVs and LEO satellites). Considering the interactions among intelligent UAVs, this problem is reformulated as a set of interconnected multi-agent stochastic games, and the existence of corresponding Nash Equilibrium (NE) is theoretically proved. To obtain the NE, a multi-agent reinforcement learning-based algorithm, namely UTPTR, is developed concerning system dynamics and uncertainties.

  abstract     = {The concept of vehicular edge computing (VEC) has recently been envisioned as a promising paradigm to satisfy the quality of service (QoS) requirement of delay-sensitive intelligent applications in future networks. However, the limited radio frequency communication range necessitates the dense deployment of communication infrastructures to accommodate the increasing number of connected vehicles and data traffic. This could lead to growing equipment and energy costs, hindering the full realization of the VEC system. To address such limitations, we introduce a double roadside reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted VEC network in this paper, where RISs are deployed inside the coverage gaps between two RSUs to extend the service range. The research goal is to maximize the sum offloading efficiency by jointly optimizing offloading decisions, computation resource allocation, and phase shift vectors of RISs. Since the original problem is a challenging mixed-integer non-linear problem (MINLP), we decompose it into a top-problem for optimizing offloading destinations and phase shift vectors, and a sub-problem for optimizing offloading ratios and computation resources. We propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm for quickly obtaining near-optimal offloading decisions and phase shift vectors, alongside a Dinkelbach-based method for obtaining optimal offloading ratios and computation resource allocation. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm achieves near-optimal performance compared to other benchmarks and enables real-time decision-making.},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-assisted Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-enabled Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems have received wide attention due to flexible mobility of UAVs and auxiliary links provided by RIS. However, the existing works usually neglect the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), a key communication performance metric that reflects amplifier efficiency, interference levels, and equipment costs. Motivated by this, we consider PAPR constraints in RIS-assisted UAV-enabled ISAC system. An optimization for joint beamforming and RIS phase-shift matrices design is established, with the goal of minimizing the weighted sum of the multiuser interference (MUI) for communication and sensing beam pattern mismatch (BPM), subject to PAPR constraints, power constraints, ideal beam direction approximation constraints, and constant mode constraints on the phase-shift matrices. To tackle this non-convex problem, a multivariate cyclic iterative alternating-direction multiplier method (MCI-ADMM) is adopted to decouple the original problem into three sub-problems regarding three variables. Some mathematical techniques are adopted to solve these sub-problems, including augmented lagrangian, constraint reconstruction method based on orthogonal Procrustes problem, manifold optimization, quadratic representation, and variable substitution. The experimental results show inherent trade-offs between dual functionalities under PAPR constraints. In addition, the consideration of PAPR performs better system performance compared with baselines. Also, the stability and reliability under different parameters settings are verified.},

  abstract     = {Low-cost reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are being considered as promising physical-layer technology for next-generation wireless networks due to their ability to re-engineer the propagation environment by tuning their elements. Although RIS-aided systems have many advantages, one of their major bottlenecks is that they can provide coverage only in front of the surface. Fortunately, simultaneous transmitting and reflecting surface (STARS)-assisted systems have emerged to fill this gap by providing $ 360^{\circ }$ wireless coverage. In parallel, full-duplex (FD) communication offers a higher achievable rate through efficient spectrum utilization compared to the half-duplex (HD) counterpart. Moreover, two-way/bi-directional communications in an FD system can further enhance the system&#39;s spectral efficiency. Hence, in this paper, we propose a STARS-enabled massive MIMO deployment in an FD two-way communication network for highly efficient spectrum utilization, while covering the dead zones around the STARS. This model enables simultaneous information exchange between multiple nodes, while potentially doubling the spectral efficiency (SE). By invoking the use-and-then-forget (UaTF) combining scheme, we derive a closed-form expression for an achievable SE at each user of the system considering both uplink and downlink communications based on statistical channel state information (CSI), while also accounting for imperfect CSI and correlated fading conditions. Moreover, we formulate an optimization problem to obtain an optimal passive beamforming matrix design at the STARS that maximizes the sum achievable SE. The considered problem is non-convex and we propose a provably-convergent low-complexity algorithm, termed as projected gradient ascent method (ProGrAM), to obtain a stationary solution. Extensive numerical results are provided to establish the performance superiority of the FD STARS-enabled system over the HD STARS-enabled and FD conventional RIS (cRIS)-enabled counterparts, and also to show the effect of different parameters of interest on the system performance.},

  abstract     = {Radio frequency fingerprint (RFF) technology has emerged as a prominent research direction within the field of wireless security because it uses the distinctive hardware characteristics of individual devices for identity authentication. In the context of the Gaussian Filtered Minimum Shift Keying (GMSK) modulation mode, this research introduces an RFF identification framework centered on the analysis of eye diagram, and proposes an RFF feature extraction method based on eye diagram traces deviation (EDTD). In practical applications, considering that the presence of synchronization errors leads to the divergence of the eye diagram traces (EDT) obtained through baseband demodulation, a frame folding synchronization algorithm is proposed, which enhances the generation of the EDT. The eye diagram traces density plot generated from EDT is further utilized to obtain the probability density curve with peak clustering characteristics. Furthermore, recognizing the significance of the time-bandwidth product ($BT$) in shaping the GMSK baseband signal eye diagram, a $BT$ parameter estimation algorithm based on probability density curves is proposed, and then an inversion calculation is applied to attain the ideal EDT. By scrutinizing the statistical attributes of the EDTD, which represents the disparity between the measured signal&#39;s EDT and the theoretically ideal EDT derived through inversion, a 27-dimensional RFF feature vector is constructed. This feature vector is combined with a lightweight classifier to accomplish the task of wireless device identification. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, two types of devices utilizing GMSK modulation methods were used to construct separate datasets, which are marine automatic identification system (AIS) devices and internet of things (IoT) modules utilizing the global system for mobile (GSM) communications technology. And it was tested and compared with intelligent feature extraction methods based on deep learning. The results show that with only 150 training samples per device, our solution can achieve $99\%$ identification accuracy for AIS devices composed of independent radio frequency circuits, and over $80\%$ for GSM IoT devices composed of integrated circuits.},

  abstract     = {In aerial reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted networks, parameters of air-to-ground (A2G) channel, such as Rician factors and path-loss exponents, are largely dependent on the three-dimensional (3D) position of RIS-mounted platform, and the inevitable 3D jitter of the aerial platform will cause further phase errors in signal propagation, which results in a 3D imperfect reflection of RIS. However, most existing works only consider invariant channel parameters without jitter during the movement of RIS, which is unrealistic. This paper proposes a more practical unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted RIS-assisted communication scheme, where an elevation angle-dependent 3D channel model with UAV jitter is established and the max-min rate problem is effectively solved. Specifically, modeling the Rician factors and the path loss exponents as functions of 3D elevation angles, we reestablish an A2G channel model suitable for 3D reflections containing angular deviations caused by UAV jitter. Furthermore, by rigorously dealing with the difficulties caused by angle dependence, an innovative algorithm is designed for static/mobile RIS-UAV scheme via the joint optimization of BS beamforming, RIS coefficients, and UAV 3D position/trajectory. Additionally, in mobile RIS-UAV scheme, we extra develop a fast algorithm for solving the 0–1 binary integer scheduling factor, which first approximates the solution and then precisely reconstructs it. Simulation results show the robustness of our proposed schemes to angle errors compared with other baselines.},

Specifically, an auxiliary stabilizable control law based on adaptive sliding mode surface (ASMC) and extended state observer (ESO) is first designed. Considering that the traditional ESO-ASMC approach has a slow convergence rate and unsatisfied stability characteristics, a rolling time horizon optimization technique is incorporated, and the new ESO-DASMPC control scheme is designed, which greatly improves the stability and the convergence of the formation system while inheriting the robustness of the existing auxiliary controller. The recursive feasibility and stability of the ESO-DASMPC algorithm are guaranteed by constructing the constraints of the auxiliary controller and associated Lyapunov function.

However, the existing task offloading schemes still have various gaps and face challenges that should be addressed because task offloading problems are usually multi-objective optimization problems (MOOP) and NP-hard problems. In this respect, we formulate a new multi-objective model for vehicle-centered task offloading tacking into account the queuing and computing processes of tasks. The minimization of the average delay time, average energy consumption, and average payment cost for each vehicle is defined as a MOOP. We propose an efficient collaborative offloading approach based on task triage strategy and multi-objective optimization to address the model. Specifically, this approach can be decomposed into two stages. First, a task triage strategy is developed based on a comprehensive analysis of task urgency and task criticality to make offloading decisions for triaged tasks with extreme characteristics. Then, we propose a novel multi-objective optimization framework for the MOOP. Finally, we develop a multi-objective hybrid genetic algorithm that integrates the associative learning immediate memory strategy and genetic operations to solve the MOOP. Extensive experiments and performance evaluations based on real-world traces of taxis demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results indicate that the approach outperforms six other well-known multi-objective algorithms in solving the MOOP.},

  abstract     = {The vehicular Metaverse represents an emerging paradigm that merges vehicular communications with virtual environments, integrating real-world data to enhance in-vehicle services. However, this integration faces critical security challenges, particularly in the data collection layer where malicious sensing IoT (SIoT) devices can compromise service quality through data poisoning attacks. The security aspects of the Metaverse services should be well addressed both when creating the digital twins of the physical systems and when delivering the virtual service to the vehicular Metaverse users (VMUs). This paper introduces vehicular Metaverse guard (VMGuard), a novel four-layer security framework that protects vehicular Metaverse systems from data poisoning attacks. Specifically, when the virtual service providers (VSPs) collect data about physical environment through SIoT devices in the field, the delivered content might be tampered. Malicious SIoT devices with moral hazard might have private incentives to provide poisoned data to the VSP to degrade the service quality (QoS) and user experience (QoE) of the VMUs. The proposed framework implements a reputation-based incentive mechanism that leverages user feedback and subjective logic modeling to assess the trustworthiness of participating SIoT devices. More precisely, the framework entails the use of reputation scores assigned to participating SIoT devices based on their historical engagements with the VSPs. These scores are calculated from feedback provided by the VMUs to the VSPs regarding the content they receive and are managed utilizing a subjective logic model. Ultimately, we validate our proposed model using comprehensive simulations. Our key findings indicate that our mechanism effectively prevents the initiation of poisoning attacks by malicious SIoT devices. Additionally, our system ensures that reliable SIoT devices, previously misclassified, are not barred from participating in future rounds of the market. This work provides a crucial security solution for the emerging vehicular Metaverse, enabling trustworthy data collection and reliable service delivery.},

To deal with this challenge, we propose the two stage beam management consisting of beam training and beam tracking. In first phase, DFT beam training is proposed, especially with a phase rotation matrix to extract the actual AoA information by eliminating the DFO term. In second phase, Kalman filter (KF) beam tracking is proposed with monopulse signal to reduce the linearization loss.

  abstract     = {Modern vehicular applications heavily rely on accurate Position, Velocity, and Timing (PVT) information provided by the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). However, the vulnerability of GNSS to spoofing attacks presents a significant threat to vehicle safety and efficiency. Rapid detection of spoofing attacks is thus vital for ensuring the security of vehicular navigation. Among existing methods, Doppler shift emerges as a typical means of spoofing detection in vehicular applications, as the anomalous Doppler bias associated with the user&#39;s real state serves as a distinctive indicator of spoofing. Conventional approaches, however, focus on directly observing Doppler bias, which remains embedded within raw measurements and necessitates additional complexities, thereby limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, we introduce Doppler-based Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (D-RAIM) as a practical method for GNSS spoofing detection in vehicular applications. In contrast to direct monitoring methods, D-RAIM indirectly detects spoofing by assessing the impact of Doppler bias on Doppler positioning integrity. Operating without the need for external sensors, D-RAIM performs integrity monitoring by leveraging residuals derived from Doppler positioning equations, offering a flexible approach for standalone GNSS receivers. Through simulation experiments and field tests, we validate the effectiveness of D-RAIM, demonstrating its broader applicability and robustness compared to previous methods. Overall, the proposed D-RAIM method offers a practical solution for GNSS spoofing detection in vehicular applications, characterized by its flexibility, robustness, and wider applicability in enhancing vehicular navigation security.},

Since obtaining perfect CSI related to an RIS is difficult in practice, a robust transmission design is proposed in this paper to tackle the channel uncertainty issue, which will be more severe for active RIS-aided systems. To account for the worst-case scenario, the minimum achievable rate of each user is derived under a statistical CSI error model. Subsequently, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the sum of the minimum achievable rate. Since the objective function is non-concave, the formulated problem is transformed into a tractable lower bound maximization problem, which is solved using an alternating optimization method. Numerical results show that the proposed robust design outperforms a baseline scheme that only exploits estimated CSI.},

To avoid high-cost channel estimation, the phase shifting of the RIS is designed only based on the channel state information of the cascaded backscatter channel which is easy to obtain. Outage probabilities of the backscatter device (BD) and the ambient transmission, both in parasitic and commensal modes, are derived based on Lyapunov&#39;s theorem and Hermite-Gauss quadrature. Simulation results illustrate that the BD outage performance is highly sensitive to the number of RIS reflection elements ($N$) both in parasitic and commensal modes. When $N$ is sufficiently large, its further increment has little impact on the outage probability of the ambient system, although the phase shift is designed merely to enhance the BD transmission. It also offers a guideline in coordinating $N$ with the ambient transmit power to balance between the outage performance of the ambient system and that of the backscatter system.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider the bistatic coprime MIMO radar in which the receive array is assembled on a movable platform and research the issue of jointly estimating the direction of departure (DOD) and direction of arrival (DOA). Specifically, we propose a dilated coprime array with nested motions (DCANM) that exploits the nested motions of the dilated coprime array to enlarge the virtual array in view of the synthetic sum-difference coarray (SDCA) concept. However, the holes in the synthetic SDCA of the bistatic coprime MIMO radar cause the performance loss of subspace-based coarray methods. To address this problem, we interpolate the holes of synthetic SDCA and propose a spatially smoothed interpolated coarray completion (SSICC) method to solve the rank deduction problem caused by the whole missing slices of SDCA, which helps to enhance the uniform DOFs and identifiability. Finally, extensive simulation results are carried out to demonstrate the superiorities of the proposed methods in estimation accuracy and resolution.},

However, due to the line-of-sight transmission, confidential task information is highly susceptible to interception by malicious UAV eavesdroppers, posing a significant security challenge. To overcome this challenge, we aim to design a joint resource and trajectory optimization scheme to enhance the secure performance of the IRS-assisted UAV-MEC system. Specifically, the minimum secrecy capacity of users is maximized by optimizing time allocation, transmit power, local computation CPU frequency, IRS phase shifts, and UAV trajectory while satisfying users&#39; task processing capacity requirements. To address the non-convex optimization problem, we first employ mathematical techniques to simplify it into a more tractable form, and subsequently decompose it into several sub-problems. These sub-problems can be solved iteratively through combining phase alignment with successive convex approximation. Simulation results verify that our proposed scheme can improve the secrecy capacity performance of the considered IRS-assisted UAV-MEC system compared with benchmarks.},

Instead of following the traditional method of channel estimation and beamforming optimization, in this paper we employ a deep-learning technique to optimize the beamformers at the BS based on a loss function. Specifically, in this paper we introduce a graph neural network (GNN) designed to map the received pilot signals to optimized beamforming matrices and to model interactions among user equipment within the network.

Finally, STGNN optimizes the number and location of access points (APs) based on the maximal BCR criterion so that the CF mMIMO networks can achieve on-demand service capability with minimum deployment cost.

Interference-to-noise ratio (I/N) is an important evaluation index to measure the level of mutual interference, and its probability distribution is usually obtained by extrapolating the satellite orbit position and counting the time proportion of different I/N values. However, the traditional propagation method has the problems of long simulation time and low calculation efficiency. This paper proposes a new method to calculate the I/N of large-scale non-geostationary orbit constellation. By modeling large-scale constellation as uniformly distributed in space, Fibonacci grid method is used to calculate satellite position coordinate. In addition, equivalent number of satellites is defined to take into account the number of visible satellites at different latitudes. The expression of I/N is derived, and the probability distribution of I/N is obtained. On this basis, the effect of parameters of the constellations and the latitude of Earth Station on the I/N distribution is analyzed.

To achieve secure communication against a potential eavesdropper, we design the sensing signal in a dual-functional form, serving both to detect the target and to generate artificial noise (AN) that disrupts the eavesdropper. With fixed subarray architectures, the security and sensing performance are analyzed, including the impact of imperfect channel state information (CSI). Moreover, the design of analog and digital beamformers is formulated as the problem of minimizing transmit power while satisfying the constraints of sensing beampattern and secrecy rate. To solve the non-convex problem, semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques are employed to transform the original problem and obtain the solution. For the scenario with imperfect CSI, the robust hybrid beamforming is designed based on S-procedure. Additionally, to optimally utilize spatial domain resources provided by multiple antennas, a dynamic subarray architecture is introduced, along with two dynamic subarray partitioning algorithms. This flexible architecture can be dynamically adjusted according to the CSI, ensuring a bidirectional alignment with the actual channels and the proposed scheme. Specifically, the greedy algorithm and the secrecy rate increment maximization (SRIM) algorithm are designed to partition the dynamic subarray, and the alternating optimization is utilized to further improve the quality of the solution.

The scheme assesses jamming levels through a module based on average channel quality indicator (CQI) and adaptively selects the appropriate anti-jamming policies by utilizing the resouces of power-domain, frequency-domain, or a combination of power-frequency domain. This approach overcomes the limitations of fixed-domain policies in dynamic and complex jamming scenarios. To optimize resource allocation, a discrete soft actor-critic (DSAC) algorithm with an adjustable temperature coefficient is employed, addressing sample inefficiencies in traditional actor-critic methods and enhancing policy robustness. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme improves convergence speed under intelligent jamming (IJ) by 55%, 62%, 65%, 75%, and 60% compared to trusted region policy optimization (TRPO), deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), proximal policy optimization (PPO), deep reinforcement learning with dual action network (DRL-DAN) and soft actor critic with fixed temperature coefficient (SAC-FTC)-based schemes, respectively. The scheme achieves evasion rates of 99% against periodic comb jamming (PCJ), 98.7% against sweep jamming (SJ), 95% against combined jamming (CJ), and 90.8% against IJ.

As a result, it is observed that connected cars could pass through multiple traffic lights when the green or yellow signals are turned on, resulting in the minimization of the entire trip time. The proposed method is comprehensively verified through simulations under various situations, and, the behavior of the connected cars is observed similar to that of experienced human drivers, particularly in the dilemma zone.

Unlike most existing works, we address both the issues of the IRSs placement and elements allocation. To this end, we first introduce an orthogonal placement strategy to mitigate channel correlation, thereby enabling interference-free multi-stream transmission. Subsequently, we propose a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based approach to jointly optimize the IRS elements and power allocation. Our theoretical analysis unveils that equal IRS elements/power allocation scheme becomes asymptotically optimal as the number of IRS elements and transmit power tend to be infinite.

To address the issue of cross-band scattering and its impact on higher band performance, we employ an innovative method that involves reducing the aperture size and incorporating lumped or distributed inductors. These inductors function as frequency-selective structures, permitting low-frequency currents to pass while blocking high-frequency currents. Consequently, at high frequencies, these inductors act as open circuits, making the low-frequency antenna radiator resemble multiple discontinuous small metal strips. This approach achieves an electromagnetic transparent (EMT) bandwidth of over 82.9%, making it highly suitable for mobile base station applications. By integrating this low-scattering LB antenna with four bandwidth-optimized cross dipoles, we achieve a dual-band interleaved array. The measured results confirm that the dual-band array operates effectively within the 0.85-0.98 GHz and 1.4-2.7 GHz frequency ranges, maintaining stable radiation performance. The superior performance of this design makes it an ideal choice for vehicle-based base stations.},

As the initial study on this waveform, its performance is analyzed and evaluated in single-user uplink multiple access communications, using a delay-Doppler channel model with independent and identically distributed path amplitudes and different integer delays. By chirping DFT-s-OFDM in the time domain, it maintains the low peak-to-average-power ratio of DFT-s-OFDM. Thanks to full-band transmission and symbols retransmission enabled by chirping and discrete Fourier transform precoding, it enhances noise suppression of linear minimum mean square error equalization. By using pairwise error probability analysis, the derived bit error rate upper bound is close to the simulated ones and the diversity order analysis confirms that it achieves full frequency diversity.},

However, the large-scale deployment of such a network results in poor energy efficiency (EE) and higher deployment cost. Recently, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are being considered to improve the energy efficiency of the CF-mMIMO network. In this work, we investigate the extent to which the EE can be improved by varying the proportions of APs and RISs in the network. We analyze the trade-offs for the centralized and distributed processing schemes under a generic power consumption model and quantify the optimal number of APs and RISs required. Results unveil that the RIS aided CF-mMIMO can significantly enhance the EE gains if the APs and RISs are employed in an optimal proportion.},

Moreover, channel estimation errors and imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) are considered in the system analysis. To characterize the covert performance, the detection error probability (DEP) and the average minimum detection error probability (AMDEP) are first derived. Then, the closed-form solutions of the outage probability (OP) for the users are obtained. Finally, the maximum effective covert rate (ECR) subject to the covertness constraint and non-interruption constraint is studied. The numerical simulation results show that: 1) the detection performance of Willie (warden) deteriorates as the channel estimation errors increase; 2) when the transmitter power exceeds the threshold, communication in the main network is interrupted; 3) under a certain transmit power, the maximum ECR increases with the increasing of the number of STAR-RIS reflection elements.},

To this end, the network function virtualization technology is introduced and can be implemented via service function chains (SFCs) deployment. However, urgent unexpected tasks may bring conflicts and resource competition during SFC deployment, and how to schedule the SFCs of multiple tasks in SAGIN is a key issue. In this paper, we address the dynamic and complexity of SAGIN by presenting a reconfigurable time extension graph and further propose the dynamic SFC scheduling model. Then, we formulate the SFC scheduling problem to maximize the number of successful deployed SFCs within limited resources and time horizons. Since the problem is in the form of integer linear programming and intractable to solve, we propose the algorithm by incorporating deep reinforcement learning.

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a packet collision avoidance resource selection (PCA-RS) scheme to enhance the standardized SPS scheme. The proposed PCA-RS scheme introduces three enhancement mechanisms, which aims to alleviate merging collisions and hidden-node collisions in intra-platoon message delivery. A resource partition mechanism is introduced to divide frequency-time resources in a selection window into two sets in order for vehicles (both platoon and non-platoon vehicles) moving in opposite directions to select different frequency-time resources and thus avoid potential merging collisions; an intra-platoon cooperative mechanism is introduced to enable the leader of a platoon to know the resource occupation status on the hidden nodes of the platoon according to the messages received from the last platoon member of the same platoon and thus avoid potential hidden-node collisions; and a merging collision detection mechanism is introduced to enable a non-platoon vehicle to detect the status of the frequency-time resources it currently occupies after the non-platoon vehicle changes a lane and thus avoids potential merging collisions among non-platoon vehicles due to lane-change maneuvers.

Recently developed symbol-level precoding (SLP) demonstrates significant potential for ISAC waveform design due to its superior capacity to enhance both communication and radar sensing capabilities by simultaneously leveraging temporal and spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs). To address the high complexity challenges associated with SLP designs, this paper proposes two efficient deep learning algorithms to tackle the complex SLP-based ISAC waveform design problem. The first algorithm employs a supervised data-driven training strategy that reformulates the original problem as a solvable linear regression issue, while the second algorithm utilizes a gradient-based procedure to fine-tune the trained network, enhancing communication and radar sensing performance. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight SLP-Inception-Net to mitigate computational complexity at the network structural level, incorporating a phase-based activation function to ensure the satisfaction of equality constraints. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our proposed deep learning algorithms achieve comparable communication and sensing performance to optimization-based approaches, while delivering a remarkable 1000-fold reduction in computational complexity in terms of average execution time. Furthermore, they outperform classical learning-based schemes at the same level of floating point operations per second (FLOPs).},

  abstract     = {With the widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), accurately predicting the degradation trajectory of batteries has become crucial to ensure the safe and reliable operation of EVs. In this study, a novel battery degradation trajectory prediction method based on actual EVs operational data is proposed. Firstly, the state of health of the battery is estimated using Coulomb counting methodology, refined through analysis of noise sources and charging pattern, and further denoised through Empirical Mode Decomposition. Moreover, a Transformer-based battery degradation trajectory prediction method is introduced, which demonstrates significantly higher prediction accuracy compared to various existing methods. To address the scarcity of real-world aging data, a data augmentation method based on Variational Auto-encoder (VAE) is proposed. Through data augmentation, diverse and representative battery aging data are generated, enhancing the prediction performance of all neural networks. Following data augmentation, the Transformer still exhibits the lowest Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.5813% and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.7012%. This indicates that the VAE enhances the accuracy and reliability of battery degradation trajectory prediction. Additionally, the high accuracy of the VAE-Transformer in early prediction scenarios is validated. A comprehensive analysis of the resource consumption of the neural networks further demonstrates the high applicability of the proposed method in practical applications.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present a novel three-dimensional (3D) path loss model for vehicle-to-vehicle visible light communication (VLC) systems. The proposed model is a function of various system and channel parameters including the longitudinal distance separating the vehicles, horizontal (lateral) shifts, vertical displacement between the headlight and photodetector, angular rotation differences, the spacing of the vehicle&#39;s headlights, photodetector aperture diameter, and the weather-dependent extinction coefficient. We validate the proposed path loss model through extensive non-sequential ray tracing simulations and explore how various system and channel parameters influence path loss. Our findings show that while lateral shifts mainly impact path loss at shorter distances, vertical displacement has a substantial effect over both short and long ranges. Moreover, the results indicate that angular rotation significantly affects path loss, especially for angles greater than $5^{\circ }$, which commonly occur during lane changes and turns.},

  abstract     = {Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC) has imposed significant challenges on the Internet of Things (IoT) networks due to its stringent Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, especially in practical scenarios with unfavorable propagation environments and non-ideal hardware. As a promising technology in future communication systems, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been expected to improve the system performance by reconfiguring the propagation environment. In this paper, we investigate a practical aerial RIS-assisted URLLC system in the presence of transceiver hardware impairments where the RIS is mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). We aim to maximize the weighted sum spectral efficiency (WSSE) by jointly optimizing the transmit power, the passive beamforming, and the UAV&#39;s location. As the primal problem is non-convex with coupled variables, the problem is first reformulated by using fractional programming (FP), and decomposed to subproblems with decoupled variables. An alternative optimization (AO) algorithm is then proposed to jointly optimize the passive beamforming, the position of UAV, and transmit power at the IoT devices. Simulation results verify that the proposed robust design can significantly improve the WSSE performance compared to the conventional non-robust scheme. And we reveal hardware impairments at the IoT devices have more impact on WSSE than the control center (CC).},

  abstract     = {Advanced vehicular communication systems extensively employ random access protocols to facilitate massive machine-type communications (MTC) with burst transmissions. Recent investigations have significantly reduced the decoding error rates in MTC. However, for random access, before a receiver decodes a packet, it has to first detect its arrival, since the presence of the packet at a particular point in time is not known beforehand. Packet detection, as opposed to packet decoding, could become a significant bottleneck, especially when considering that the widely used Schmidl-and-Cox (S&amp;C) detection algorithm dates back several decades. This paper re-evaluates the S&amp;C algorithm and presents several key improvements. First, we introduce a new “compensated autocorrelation” packet-detection metric that enables precise analytical expressions of false alarm and missed-detection probabilities, enhancing the rigor of performance assessment. Second, we establish a Pareto comparison principle that allows for a comprehensive and fair evaluation of packet detection algorithms by simultaneously accounting for both false alarms and missed detections. Third, we show that the performance of S&amp;C can be significantly improved by considering only the real component of the autocorrelation, giving rise to a new real-part S&amp;C (RP-S&amp;C) scheme. Fourth, and perhaps most importantly, we leverage the newly introduced compensated autocorrelation to extend the single-antenna S&amp;C algorithm for application in the multi-antenna setting. Two optimization problems, minimizing false-alarm and missed detection probabilities respectively, are formulated and addressed with rigorous solutions. Overall, this study holds considerable implications for the design and deployment of packet-detection schemes in vehicular random-access networks.},

The use of subterahertz (THz) bands is envisioned as a means to achieve higher data rates in sixth-generation (6G) systems. However, in this network setup, the power consumption at TRPs&#39; radio components packed with several antenna elements significantly increases due to the very high processing burden in such a wide bandwidth. A TRP-side DTX method is proposed to avoid overheating issues, which controls the amount of downlink slot transmissions while guaranteeing cell-specific reference signaling. Simulation results considering different DTX settings and traffic loads are presented and discussed. Results show that the considered sub-THz system with the proposed DTX method can provide higher data rates and close to the same spectral efficiency compared to a typical baseline millimeter wave (mmWave) system operating at 28 GHz with 400 MHz bandwidth. It was possible to reach close to 7 times higher data rates in the simulated system utilizing the dynamic DTX method, compared to a theoretical data rate increase of 7.6 times based solely on bandwidth comparison.},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication has emerged as a crucial solution for providing reliable data services to vehicles on the road. However, in delay-sensitive or high-mobility communications, the rapid movement of vehicles can lead to random scattering in the environment and time-selective fading in the channel. In view of this, we investigate in this paper an innovative linear model with low-complexity transmitter signal design and receiver detection methods, which boost stability in fast-fading environments and reduce channel training overhead. Specifically, considering the differences in hardware design and signal processing at the receiving end between uplink and downlink communication systems, distinct solutions are proposed. Accordingly, we first integrate the Rician channel introduced by the RIS with the corresponding signal processing algorithms to model the RIS-aided downlink communication system as a Doppler-robust linear model. Inspired by this property, we design a precoding scheme based on the linear model to reduce the complexity of precoding. Then, by leveraging the linear model and the large-scale antenna array at the base station (BS) side, we improve the linear model for the uplink communication system and derive its asymptotic performance in closed-form. Simulation results demonstrate the performance advantages of the proposed RIS-aided high-mobility communication system compared to other benchmark schemes.},

The tightness of the UatF bound is, however, ensured in channel environments where the channel hardening manifests. It has been often reported that the channel hardening may not always be strongly observed in some channel environments. In such cases, the UatF bound seriously underestimates rates for users experiencing weak channel hardening. To address the issues associated with the UatF bound, we develop a new lower bound offering a more accurate estimate of the achievable rate for uplink in CF-mMIMO networks regardless of the extent of channel hardening. The claim is substantiated by applying the proposed bound to the joint optimization of power control and large-scale fading decoding (LSFD) coefficients for the design of CF-mMIMO networks on spatially correlated Rician fading channels. To facilitate the optimization, we also develop an approximation of the proposed bound in a more computationally amenable form. We conduct extensive performance evaluations and comparisons for CF-mMIMO networks designed with the proposed and UatF bounds. The comparisons highlight that the design based on the proposed bound leads to considerable performance improvement in the fairness. In addition, for the first time, we reveal with the new lower bound that an widely held belief based on the UatF bound is incorrect.},

While the extended Kalman filter (EKF) remains the predominant nonlinear algorithm in SINS/GNSS integration, it suffers from performance degradation due to covariance inconsistency issues. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel nonlinear state error-based Lie group extended Kalman filter (LG-EKF) for tightly coupled SINS/GNSS integrated navigation. The study first presents a tutorial example illustrating the necessity of transformed nonlinear state error and then provides detailed derivations of LG-EKF equations using both right invariant error (LG-EKF-R) and left invariant error (LG-EKF-L). Through Monte Carlo simulations and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) field tests, the research demonstrates the performance differences in system dynamics between LG-EKF-R and LG-EKF-L. The results indicate that LG-EKF-R, operating at a lower propagation rate, achieves comparable accuracy to LG-EKF-L with a higher propagation rate, offering a more efficient solution for integrated navigation systems.},

In this framework, a server can aggregate the IoV data from clusters without inferring the raw data, real identity and trajectories of vehicles. Notably, we avoid incorporating the widely-accepted techniques such as homomorphic encryption and digital pseudonym to avoid introducing high computation cost to vehicles. We propose a novel concept, data approval, based on the Schnorr signature scheme. With the approval, the fake data injection attack carried out by a cluster head can be defended against.

In order to solve this weakness and improve the practicability of VANETs, we adopted Confidential Computing technology and proposed a secure authentication scheme.

  abstract     = {Aerial hybrid reconfigurable intelligent surface (AHRIS) -assisted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has recently emerged as a promising candidate for practical deployment in the sixth generation (6G) wireless networks. System design and gain rely heavily on accurately modeling of the underlying channel characteristics, which is challenging due to the high mobility of AHRIS and the unique properties of ISAC. This paper aims to propose a novel three-dimensional (3D) non-stationary geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM) for AHRIS-assisted ISAC systems. Firstly, a novel GBSM considering the non-stationarity caused by the unavoidable jitter of AHRIS and the correlations between sensing and communication channels is proposed. For the former, both the random jitter vector and the jitter factor are introduced to model the impacts of the jitter of AHRIS on its velocity vector. For the latter, the channel characteristics of sensing, including forward scattering and backward scattering, are introduced into the communication channel model, in which the non-line-of-sight (NLoS) transmission are divided into single-clusters scattering and twin-clusters scattering. Then, in order to create a favorable propagation environment and make full use of the channel information sensed by the AHRIS, two AHRIS phase-shift design methods based on sensing channels are proposed. Finally, the impacts of several factors, e.g., the AHRIS speed and jittery, AHRIS phase-shift design methods, AHRIS non-ideality and clusters distribution, on the statistical properties of the proposed channel model are studied, which include the spatial-temporal correlation function (STCF), Doppler power spectral density (PSD) and spectral efficiency. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model can accurately capture the channel characteristics, thus providing valuable insights for the future deployment of AHRIS-assisted ISAC systems.},

The former focuses on achieving high performance while the latter emphasizes efficiency. The effectiveness of both CObI and HbSAI methods is validated through simulation results, demonstrating their ability to enhance the achievable secrecy rate.},

  abstract     = {Precise localization is essential for enabling advanced applications in dynamic environments, such as autonomous systems and mobile robotics. As automation technologies evolve, the requirements for higher accuracy, reliability, energy efficiency, rapid updates, and minimal latency in position estimation have intensified. In this paper, we propose the exploitation of backscattering from retro-directive antenna arrays (RAAs) to address these imperatives. Two RAA-based architectures are introduced and evaluated for a range of applications, including network localization and navigation. These architectures enable swift and simple angle-of-arrival estimation by using signals backscattered from RAAs. They also leverage multiple antennas to capitalize on multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) gains, thereby addressing the challenges posed by the inherent path loss in backscatter communication, particularly at high frequencies. This approach enables angle-based localization with remarkably low latency, making it suitable for vehicular applications. To achieve this, ad-hoc signaling and processing schemes are developed and their performance is analytically assessed. Numerical results highlight the potential of these schemes, delivering precise, ultra-low-latency localization with low-complexity, energy-efficient devices.},

  abstract     = {Mobile edge computing (MEC) provides stable and powerful computing services, and vehicle computing provides rich sensing services. Therefore, we develop vehicle-assisted mobile edge computing (VAMEC), integrating MEC and vehicle computing to maximize their advantages and broaden their applications. We address the resource allocation and pricing problem in VAMEC, in which the vehicle, as a resource provider, collaborates with the MEC servers to provide services to users. To enable MEC servers and vehicles to work in cooperation, we propose a mixed auction model that consists of two-step auctions: the first one-way auction and the second double auction. We consider three types of users based on their characteristics, where users participate in different auctions depending on the types. Users and vehicles are self-interested and may submit untrue values to harm the system&#39;s profits. Therefore, we propose the overall truthfulness for the mixed auction model, that is users or vehicles that cannot obtain higher utility by declaring untrue values regardless of which auction they participate in. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study proposing the overall truthfulness and showing how to design the mechanism that achieves it. We then propose an overall truthfulness mechanism and show it achieves individual rationality, budget balance, and consumer sovereignty. Simulation results indicate that the proposed mechanism can increase social welfare by at least 24%, compared with other mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {Recently, Federated Learning (FL) has been advanced for Vehicular Crowdsensing (VCS), termed F-VCS, to enable collaborative learning without sharing private data, thus promoting privacy. However, the mobility of Intelligent Connected Vehicles (ICVs) leads to dynamic changes among FL participants, becoming one of the main challenges limiting F-VCS performance, as these dynamics can affect model training stability and accuracy. Current research primarily addresses these dynamics through ICV selection and resource optimization mechanisms. However, due to the lack of an effective method for characterizing ICV mobility, these approaches often rely on making binary judgments based on certain constraints (e.g., learning delay) rather than comparing the ICVs&#39; mobility characteristics. As a result, they may not yield the most efficient outcomes for adapting to vehicular network dynamics, affecting overall system performance. This paper introduces a Grid-Assisted FL framework for VCS, named VCS_GAFL, which measures ICV mobility using a grid-cell model. Unlike traditional binary selection methods, our approach utilizes participation probabilities to capture the mobility differences among individual ICVs, guiding more precise and effective ICV selection and enhancing the VCS system&#39;s overall performance and adaptability. Specifically, we introduce an MMP-V model to predict ICV participation probabilities in F-VCS tasks. We then derive expressions for the impact of ICV participation probabilities on expected FL loss and ineffective energy consumption and formulate an optimization problem to jointly optimize ICV participation probabilities, wireless resource allocation, and ICV selection to minimize these impacts. By solving this problem, we derive a closed-form solution for wireless resource allocation and propose a probability-guided ICV selection strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that VCS_GAFL significantly enhances global accuracy, highlighting its potential and value in improving F-VCS services.},

For a UAV mounted with directional antennas, its tilting effect has a crucial impact on the communication performance, which is however ignored in the related studies. In this paper, we first characterize the relationship between the tilting effect of the UAV and its flight status based on force analysis. Then, we investigate a UAV-enabled downlink communication system, where the UAV, equipped with a directional antenna, provides communication services to ground users (GUs). We formulate an energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem that optimizes the UAV trajectory under the consideration of the tilting effect. The formulated problem is challenging to solve due to the complicated expressions of the directional antenna radiation pattern and the adopted propulsion energy consumption model of the UAV. To tackle this, by utilizing the successive convex approximation technique, we propose an approximate antenna radiation pattern that serves as a convex lower bound of the original antenna gain, and develop an efficient algorithm to obtain a suboptimal solution. Simulation results show that the negative impact of the tilting effect on the EE can be efficiently mitigated and the UAV flight can be made more steady under the tilting effect. In addition, the proposed algorithm allows the UAV to achieve a substantially higher EE compared to the benchmark schemes.},

  abstract     = {During the evolution from 5G to 6G, integrated space-air-ground communication has become a hotspot for research. Among them, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication and millimeter-wave (mmW) technology play important roles. UAV communication requires high-gain, wide-angle coverage, and flexible beam-steering antenna arrays. In this paper, we propose a compact antenna array with wide coverage and beam steering capability for mmW applications. The array is composed of three layers and fed through substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) with three ports. The antenna features a simple, horizontally symmetrical structure. By independently exciting each of the three ports, and combinations where port 2 is excited simultaneously with port 1 or port 3, the antenna generates currents that complement equivalent magnetic currents to produce beams pointing in different directions. The wide beams of the antenna can steer and cover a total range from -${60}^{\circ }$ to ${240}^{\circ }$ across five states. Based on this design, a four-element array is fabricated and tested. Measurement results demonstrate the gains of 10.03, 10.8, and 10.5 dBi within the operational frequency range (23.7-28 GHz), with a radiation efficiency of 87.3%. The proposed antenna features a low-profile and compact structure, achieving a coverage range of approximately 300 degrees. It is highly suitable for UAVs, and small mobile devices when integrated with an integrated chip circuit. Additionally, if matched with a phase shifter, the antenna can achieve two-dimensional scanning capability.},

Specifically, the uplink cascaded channel of the system can be represented as a low-rank sparse channel tensor in the angle-delay domain due to the limited scattering paths. Leveraging such representation, the scheme contains two steps. First, the scheme designs the sensing matrices, i.e., the base station combining matrix and the RIS reflection matrix, to meet the proposed uniqueness condition that guarantees the one-to-one correspondence between the high-dimensional channel tensor and lower-dimensional channel observation. The sensing matrices design is formulated as a power/constant module-constrained matrix optimization problem. Second, the scheme reconstructs the channel tensor from the channel observation, which is formulated as a low-rank constrained tensor optimization problem. The above problems are solved using manifold optimization techniques, which convert the original problem with non-convex constraints into an unconstrained optimization problem on manifolds, eliminating the need for relaxation of the non-convex constraints and achieving higher accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate superior performance in terms of channel estimation accuracy.},

The spatial beams configured to meet the communication rate requirements of NF users are simultaneously leveraged to sense an additional NF target. A key innovation lies in its flexibility to select a subset of users for decoding the common stream, enhancing interference management and system performance. The system is designed by minimizing the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) for joint distance and angle estimation through optimized power allocation, common rate allocation, and user selection. This leads to a discrete, non-convex optimization problem. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the preconfigured beams are sufficient for target sensing, eliminating the need for additional probing signals. To solve the optimization problem, an iterative algorithm is proposed combining the quadratic transform and simulated annealing. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms conventional RSMA and space division multiple access (SDMA), reducing distance and angle estimation errors by approximately 100% and 20%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the problem of optimizing the rate performance in a downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system with intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) capable of operating in diagonal (D) or non-diagonal (ND) configuration. The objective is to maximize the minimum signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR), which is equivalent to maximizing the data rates for all users based on fairness. To cater multiple number of users two user pairing scheme is considered. Firstly, we propose a sub optimal optimization (SO) approach to jointly optimize the phase shifts and power allocation coefficients. Further, we compare the data rate performance of different IRS configurations and user pairing schemes under various transmit signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. We propose a novel hybrid IRS configuration that selects diagonal or non-diagonal mode of IRS configuration. We also compare our results with optimal greedy search method. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in data rates using the hybrid IRS configuration with SO approach (SO-hybrid) compared to traditional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) schemes for higher value of IRS elements ($M&amp;gt;64$). For instance, with two users setting, at an SNR of 20dB with $M=225$, the proposed SO-hybrid method achieves data rates up to 6.3bps/Hz, compared to 5.3bps/Hz and 5.4bps/Hz for OMA with diagonal and non-diagonal IRS configurations, respectively. At a SNR of 10dB, the SO-hybrid reaches up to 4.3bps/Hz, outperforming OMA-ND scheme that achieves up to 3.7bps/Hz. Additionally, we analyze the impact of imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) and channel state information (CSI) on system performance. Simulations reveal that the hybrid NOMA scheme consistently outperforms OMA, even under adverse conditions of imperfect SIC and CSI, showcasing its robustness and potential for enhancing wireless communication systems.},

Furthermore, a SAOP minimization problem is proposed by considering reliability, security and RIS unit modulus constraints. For the non-convex problem with coupling variables, we decompose it into blocklength and RIS phase shift optimization subproblem through the alternating optimization algorithm. In particular, for the stochastic RIS phase shift optimization, a momentum stochastic successive convex approximation (M-SSCA) algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal solution, which introduces a momentum disturbance factor to accelerate convergence.

They enhance the capacity and coverage of satellite communication systems using amplifying relays deployed in high-altitude platform stations (HAPS) in the air. Free-space optical (FSO) communication, which offers larger capacity compared to conventional radiofrequency (RF) communication, can enhance the capacity of SAGIN to meet the requirements of sixth-generation (6 G) systems. This study assumes a hybrid FSO/RF SAGIN, where high-capacity but atmospherically unstable FSO communications and low-capacity but atmospherically stable RF communications are used in a complementary manner in the satellite-HAPS-ground link. For the SAGIN coverage area to expand, the transmission capacity of the system needs to be further improved. Therefore, efficient use of the limited RF link frequency bandwidth is crucial, and the satellite and HAPS must cooperate to share and meet ground traffic requirements by controlling the areas they each cover. In addition, HAPS placement significantly impacts the spectral efficiency of the system because the positional relationship between the satellite and HAPS affects the transmission capacity. Therefore, this study proposes a combined control method for optimizing HAPS placement and coverage area of the satellite and HAPS. Furthermore, a solution space reduction method is incorporated into the proposed method for efficient exploration of the optimal control parameters.

  abstract     = {Internet of vehicle (IoV) is essential in intelligent transportation systems by enabling interaction and integration of information. However, IoV is vulnerable to tamper and forgery attacks without secure authentication. Identity-based aggregate signature (IBAS) is crucial in guaranteeing identity authentication and information integrity, thereby building secure authentications. With signature compression and batch verification, IBAS improves the efficiency of signatures transmission and verification, thereby reducing computing and storage demands on machines. Unfortunately, Snowden revealed that powerful adversaries replaced pure cryptographic algorithms with subverted ones to corrupt machines and undermine their security. To address this issue, we propose a fully and universal identitybased aggregate signature with reverse firewalls (FU-IBAS-RF), vehicles and the private key generator (PKG) are equipped with RFs to sanitize information transmitted throughout the entire process. Additionally, we propose an identity-based aggregate signature with reverse firewalls (IBAS-RF), RFs are deployed for each vehicle to sanitize information generated during the signing phase. Moreover, we prove that both FU-IBAS-RF and IBAS-RF not only inherit the security and functional property of IBAS but also are subversion-resistant. Finally, we conduct experiments and indicate that RFs accounts for approximately 18% of computation costs across three distinct security levels in both schemes. Therefore, both FU-IBAS-RF and IBAS-RF achieve stronger security with efficiency compared with existing IBAS.},

  abstract     = {Developing powertrain control functions is time-consuming and resource-intensive, often leading to sub-optimal solutions. Reinforcement Learning (RL) allows agents to perform complex control tasks with minimal human involvement, but is often confined to simulations due to testing costs and safety concerns. To effectively apply RL in embedded powertrain control, agents must be able to handle real-world scenarios, particularly through direct interaction with real actuators and control systems. Therefore, this research applies Transfer Learning (TL) and X-in-the-Loop (XiL) simulations to develop agents that can seamlessly transition and perform robustly in real-world environments. For transient exhaust gas re-circulation control of an internal combustion engine, the process begins with a computationally inexpensive Model-in-the-Loop (MiL) simulation to select a suitable algorithm, fine-tune hyperparameters, and conduct preliminary training. In the next step, pre-trained agents are transferred to an advanced Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) system with real hardware using TL for further training. Compared to agents trained entirely on HiL systems, transferred agents required significantly less real-world training time (up to 5.9 times shorter) while outperforming the series production Engine Control Unit (ECU). The results highlight that for real-world effectiveness, integrating actual hardware into training is essential, reward fine-tuning plays a critical role in optimizing these interactions, and the maturity of the policy significantly influences both training duration and overall performance.},

  abstract     = {In industrial wireless networks, the decentralized redundant design for sensing, communication, and control, as well as the frequent interaction among massive intelligent machines, result in the challenges such as high communication overhead and low production capacity. To address these problems, we propose a closed-loop control scheme based on integrated sensing, communication and control (ISCC). Firstly, to accurately model the closed-loop control process of automated guided vehicle (AGV) in automobile assembly workshops, we establish a novel ISCC system. Then, to reduce communication overhead while ensuring the system stability, we propose a networked multi-node control method with coordinated active-passive control. Through sensing workshop environment, AGVs flexibly perform different control instructions between active local decision-making and passive reception of base station (BS) decision-making. AGVs can respond quickly to the environment and achieve high-speed movement without the requirement for frequent communication with the BS. Furthermore, we design a novel communication scheme with adaptive closed-loop interaction cycle, by deriving stability conditions for the multi-node control method and upper bound for the closed-loop interaction cycle. Through dynamically adjusting the AGVs closed-loop interaction cycle based on real-time closed-loop control status, it significantly reduces the frequency of AGV accessing BS and communication overhead, extending the controllable AGV quantity, and enhancing production capacity. Simulation results reveal that the proposed scheme improved production capacity by a minimum of 62.6% compared to conventional schemes, significantly improving communication and control performance.},

  abstract     = {In the 5th generation (5 G) and beyond, massive machine-type communication (mMTC) has been one of the most important technologies to support the Internet of Things (IoT). However, the random access (RA) throughput is limited by the scarce RA resources (e.g., preambles). Massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) can provide spatial degrees of freedom, which can be utilized for RA resource extension. In this paper, we propose a novel beamspace RA scheme, which achieves fully spatial preamble reuse. Specifically, the cell is divided into several beam zones via directional beams, and preambles are fully reused per beam. To mitigate preamble collision and side-lobe interference, we combine the access class barring (ACB) method with preamble reuse, which efficiently improves RA throughput. Meanwhile, an efficient algorithm is proposed to determine these multiple ACB factors. The proposed scheme is applicable to both grant-based and grant-free RA procedures. Through detailed analysis and simulation results, the proposed scheme can significantly improve the RA performance in bursty traffic model.},

  abstract     = {Constrained by weak signal strength and significant inter-cell interference, users located at the cell edge in a cellular network suffer from inferior service quality. Recently, cell-free massive MIMO (CFmMIMO) has gained considerable attention due to its capability to offer uniform quality of service, alleviating the cell-edge problem. In contrast to previous studies focused on narrow-band CFmMIMO systems, this paper studies wideband CFmMIMO communications against channel frequency selectivity. By exploiting the frequency-domain flexibility offered by orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), and leveraging a particular spatial characteristic in the cell-free structure – namely, the near-far effect among distributed access points (APs) – we propose an opportunistic approach to boost spectral efficiency. The core concept lies in opportunistically activating nearby APs for certain users across their assigned OFDM subcarriers while deactivating distant APs to prevent power wastage and lower inter-user interference. Furthermore, this approach enables the use of downlink pilots by reducing the number of active APs per subcarrier to a small subset, thereby substantially improving downlink performance through coherent detection at the user receiver. Verified by numerical results, our proposed approach demonstrates considerable performance improvement compared to the two benchmark approaches.},

However, existing methods face significant limitations, such as geometric-based approaches generating paths rather than trajectories, mass point models failing in tiny berths, and full-dimensional models with large-scale constraints lead to time-intensive computations. To address these issues, this paper proposes an anytime trajectory optimizer for accurately parking an autonomous vehicle in tiny spaces cluttered with obstacles. The proposed method incorporates differentiable collision-avoidance constraints and a trust region strategy to improve computational efficiency. It can also iteratively refine the solution, enabling the optimizer to converge to a new minimum by breaking previous constraints and establishing new ones. Extensive simulations show the proposed method outperforms mainstream planners, effectively handling cluttered environments and tiny parking slots where others fail, or outperforming them in speed when they succeed. It reduces runtime by 90.19% compared to the baseline, while ensuring feasibility and continuous optimization.},

  abstract     = {Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technology, robust against frequency-selective fading channels, is widely applied in the fifth-generation (5G) communication systems, which makes automatic modulation classification (AMC) tasks critical for OFDM communication systems in military and civilian applications. This paper proposes a self-supervised learning framework, named cross-view prediction with automatic augmentation (CPAA). Unlike existing supervised methods requiring substantial labeled data, CPAA leverages massive unlabeled samples and minimal labeled data. Initially, an automatic data augmentation module is incorporated with traditional augmentation methods. Subsequently, the unlabeled pairwise signals are utilized for self-supervised pertaining through the cross-view prediction (CP) module. Finally, supervised fine-tuning using well-trained encoder is conducted on a small amount of labeled datasets. The proposed framework is capable of identifying five different OFDM modulation formats and enhancing performance through automatic data augmentation, which effectively retains data identity and generates diverse views. Simulation results indicate that CPAA can achieve robust classification performance with massive unlabeled samples and extremely limited labeled samples. Moreover, the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels and demonstrates better generalization capabilities under low SNR conditions. Based on the simulation results, the CPAA framework achieves a classification accuracy of over $\bm {85\%}$ at SNR $\bm {&amp;gt;}$ 8dB with only one labeled sample per SNR for each modulation scheme. Moreover, the automatic data augmentation module enhances the performance of self-supervised learning when limited labeled data are available, yielding an approximate average performance gain of $\bm {48.78\%}$ and demonstrating good transferability on the existing self-supervised learning algorithms.},

This paper presents an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)-based CKM prototype system, demonstrating the mutualistic relationship between ISAC and CKM. The system consists of an ISAC base station (BS), a user equipment (UE), and a server. By using a shared orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform over the millimeter wave (mmWave) band, the ISAC BS is able to communicate with the UE while simultaneously sensing the environment and acquiring the UE&#39;s location. The prototype showcases the complete process of the construction and application of the ISAC-based CKM. For CKM construction phase, the BS stores the UE&#39;s channel feedback information in a database indexed by the UE&#39;s location, including beam indices and channel gain. For CKM application phase, the BS looks up the best beam index from the CKM based on the UE&#39;s location to achieve training-free mmWave beam alignment. The experimental results show that ISAC can be used to construct or update CKM while communicating with UEs, and the pre-learned CKM can assist ISAC for training-free beam alignment.},
