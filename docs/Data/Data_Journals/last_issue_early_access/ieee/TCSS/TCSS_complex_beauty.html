  abstract     = {The distributed network utilizing the integrity-based resilient machine learning (DRML) approach offers a robust methodology to address challenges associated with complex Internet of Things (IoT) applications, computational resource limitations, and environmental sustainability. In heterogeneous cloud computing environments, where edge and central clouds collaborate to meet diverse demands in various sectors, significant challenges arise in task offloading. This research proposes an IoT and cloud computing framework integrated with a distributed and resilient deep learning (DLRTO) model to optimize system utility and bandwidth allocation for local controller devices (LCDs). The DLRTO model is designed to generate near-optimal offloading decisions for LCDs, edge cloud servers, and central cloud servers, thus maximizing both system utility and bandwidth allocation. Additionally, we introduce the RL-NN integrated round robin-based dynamic task scheduling (RNRRDTS) algorithm on edge and cloud servers to address job scheduling issues, with a focus on renewable energy generation and job migration. Extensive simulations were conducted using real-world IoT application tasks, renewable energy data, and grid electricity pricing data to evaluate the proposed model. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the DLRTO model compared with existing methods. This research provides valuable insights and advances toward the creation of sustainable, resilient, and optimized IoT systems applicable across various domains.},

  abstract     = {The growing threat of physical inactivity to human health has highlighted the rising importance of community sports organizations, which play a crucial role in promoting physical activity and improving overall public health. However, the limited understanding of human behavior leads to suboptimal resource utilization, highlighting the necessity for a scientific understanding of human behavior within such social systems to optimize resource allocation, enhance participation levels, and improve public health. In this study, we aim to gain insights into the possible mechanisms behind user participation in community sports activities and reveal the role of external incentives on individual engagement. We study the participation behavior of 2,956 members over a 6-year period in a community sports organization, and demonstrate that the participation frequency adheres to a power-law distribution. We then propose a mathematical model called habit formation and behavioral inertia (HFBI), and through experiments, we demonstrate that the data generated by the model shows a robust fit to the distribution of empirical data. We also analyze the effects of different types of activities, and find that periods of high activity participation often begin with rewarded activities, suggesting the importance of incentives to sustain long-term participation. Our study provides a scientific foundation for developing optimized strategies to enhance community sports participation. The HFBI model may also be used to understand data exhibiting power-law distributions beyond the domain of community sports.},

  abstract     = {The demand, technologies, and market all put forward the request for platformization of the vehicle logistics industry. In China, a few logistics companies have plans but only one has initially built a platform for vehicle logistics. This platform has also attracted a considerable number of service providers to join, which has led to competition between service providers and the platform. To promote the platformization of the vehicle logistics industry and attract more customers to use platform-based services, how to leverage the incentive effect of subsidies is a topic of concern for the government. Motivated by the above, this article discusses whether the exogenous subsidies (provided to customers for platform service or providers service) can accelerate the process of the vehicle logistics industry. We explore the role of subsidies by developing a model (a hotelling line) that describes the differentiated competition between the platform and service providers. Our study found that subsidies do not always work as expected. The effectiveness of the subsidy depends on service advantages and customer preferences. Subsidies may even be counterproductive if customers prefer service providers or if platform services lack advantages. This is a reminder for both the government and industry that to accelerate the platformization of the vehicle logistics industry, it is necessary to combine reality and not blindly subsidize.},

  abstract     = {Sentiment propagation plays a crucial role in the continuous emergence of social public opinion and network group events. By analyzing the maximum Influence of sentiment propagation, we can gain a better understanding of how network group events arise and evolve. Influence maximization (IM) is a critical fundamental issue in the field of informatics, whose purpose is to identify the collection of individuals and maximize the specific information’s influence in real-world social networks, and the sentiments expressed by nodes with the greatest influence can significantly impact the emotions of the entire group. The IM issue has been established to be an NP-hard (nondeterministic polynomial) challenge. Although some methods based on the greedy framework can achieve ideal results, they bring unacceptable computational overhead, while the performance of other methods is unsatisfactory. In this article, we explicate the IM problem and design a local influence evaluation function as the objective function of the IM to estimate the influence spread in the cascade diffusion models. We redefine particle parameters, update rules for IM problems, and introduce learning automata to realize multiple search modes. Then, we propose a multisearch particle Swarm optimization algorithm (MSPSO) to optimize the objective function. This algorithm incorporates a heuristic-based initialization strategy and a local search scheme to expedite MSPSO convergence. Experimental results on five real-world social network datasets consistently demonstrate MSPSO’s superior efficiency and performance compared with baseline algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Social media platforms such as Weibo and TikTok have become more influential than traditional media. Sentiment in social media comments reflects users’ attitudes and impacts society, making sentiment analysis (SA) crucial. AI driven models, especially deep-learning models, have achieved excellent results in SA tasks. However, most existing models are not interpretable enough. First, deep learning models have numerous parameters, and their transparency is insufficient. People cannot easily understand how the models extract features from input data and make sentiment judgments. Second, most models lack intuitive explanations. They cannot clearly indicate which words or phrases are key for emotion prediction. Moreover, extracting sentiment factors from comments is challenging because a comment often contains multiple sentiment characteristics. To address these issues, we propose a dual-branch combination network (DCN) for SA of social media short comments, achieving both word-level and sentence-level interpretability. The network includes a key word feature extraction network (KWFEN) and a key word order feature extraction network (KWOFEN). KWFEN uses popular emotional words and SHAP for word-level interpretability. KWOFEN employs position embedding and an attention layer to visualize attention weights for sentence-level interpretability. We validated our method on the public dataset weibo2018 and TSATC. The results show that our method effectively extracts positive and negative sentiment factors, establishing a clear mapping between model inputs and outputs, demonstrating good interpretability performance.},

A reversed process of Role-Based Collaboration (RBC) is proposed for emergence studies. The Environments–Classes, Agents, Roles, Groups, and Objects (E-CARGO) model is the fundamental model of RBC. A well extended E-CARGO (EE-CARGO) model is proposed to modeling a social system with emergent properties. The system is abstracted into agent-role level, roles are modeled as a tree structure and role emergence is identified and analyzed at multiple scales. Then we derive that the masses are primary, and the individual agent is secondary to understanding the emergence forming. A case study is accomplished to verify the effectiveness of proposed approach (i.e., the reversed RBC process and EE-CARGO model). The results are revealed that the role emergence fits a cubic curve estimation by time and at a moderate scale, the role emergence happens easily. Role performances at a small scale affect super-role emergence at a large scale statistically, and vice versa. The proposed approach can be applied to investigate emergence in a variety of areas, such as social evolution.},

  abstract     = {Happiness prediction based on large-scale online data and machine learning models is an emerging research topic that underpins a range of issues, from personal growth to social stability. Many advanced machine learning (ML) models with explanations are used for happiness online assessment while maintaining high accuracy of results. However, expert feedback and sociological theory may be absent from these models, which limits the association between prediction results and the right reasons for why they occurred. Sociological studies have shown that primary and secondary relations are inherent in happiness factors, which can be used as domain knowledge to guide model training. Inspired by such insights, this article attempts to provide new insights into the explanation consistency from an empirical study perspective. Then this article studies how to represent and introduce domain knowledge constraints to make ML models more trustworthy. We achieve this by 1) proving that multiple prediction models with additive factor attributions will have the desirable property of primary and secondary relations consistency; and 2) showing that factor relations with quantity can be represented as an importance distribution for encoding domain knowledge. Factor explanation difference is penalized by the Wasserstein distance among prediction models. Experimental results using two online datasets show that domain knowledge of stable factor relations exists. Using this knowledge not only improves happiness prediction accuracy but also reveals more significant happiness factors for assisting decisions.},

  abstract     = {Interval fuzzy preference relations (IFPRs) offer a concise and intuitive representation of the uncertain cognition of decision makers (DMs). Discussions on consistency and consensus are crucial in group decision-making with IFPRs. Consistency prevents self-contradictory judgments, while consensus restricts the disparities among DM assessments within a predetermined threshold. Both have a significant impact on decision quality. Hence, the Shapley consistency and consensus mechanism (SHAP-CCM), which endows the adjustment to DMs by considering their marginal contributions to the minimum total adjustments of all corresponding coalitions, is introduced. Under each DM’s Shapley consensus adjustment, personalized judgment adjustment strategies are considered due to DMs’ intrinsic characteristic differences. In rare scenarios where the Shapley value may fall below zero, this could result in other DMs bearing a greater adjustment. Thus, we propose the Nash-bargaining consensus adjustment based on max–min marginal contribution. This method effectively addresses the issue associated with SHAP-CCM, enhancing the reliability of the analysis. With these mechanisms, the corresponding group decision methods are given. Meanwhile, numerical and comparative discussions show the concrete application and superiority of the new results.},

This approach raises privacy security concerns, particularly in application based on centralized artificial intelligence systems. To address these issues, blockchain-enabled federated learning (BEFL) offers a decentralized solution, improving robustness and privacy but facing challenges such as privacy attacks and heterogeneous crypto system. In response, a novel PKI and identity-based heterogeneous authenticated asymmetric group key agreement (PKI-IB-HAAGKA) protocol was proposed, which resolves crypto system heterogeneity issues. What’s more, a PKI and identity-based heterogeneous batch multisignature (PKI-IB-HBMS) was proposed as a building block of PKI-IB-HAAGKA. This article presents the heterogeneous privacy-preserving blockchain-enabled federated learning (HPP-BEFL) system, designed to enhance privacy, security, and efficiency in social fintech applications. It effectively mitigates man-in-the-middle and inference attacks while improving overall system performance. Through security analysis and experiment results, it is demonstrated that the proposed PKI-IB-HAAGKA, PKI-IB-HBMS, and HPP-BEFL are provably secure and highly efficient, which can be applied to large-scale heterogeneous privacy-preserving model training scenarios.},

Given the complexity of signed community structures and the NP-hard challenge of achieving optimal partitions, modularity optimization using memetic algorithms has emerged as a promising approach. However, the identified signed partitions still face challenges in modularity quality and precision, with many misassigned nodes or being stuck at local optima, particularly in ambiguous and complex structures. To address this issue, this article introduces a new concept: central-node signed motif, a higher order local topological feature that effectively identifies signed communities, providing richer and more efficient topological information. Furthermore, we utilize these central-node signed motifs to improve community detection through a framework named higher order local search assisted memetic modularity (HLSMM). In HLSMM, we design a central-node signed motif-based local search strategy to optimize node assignments and improve modularity quality and structural balance of optimized signed communities. Experimental results from synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the local search strategy in enhancing accuracy and modularity quality. HLSMM exhibits a general advantage in modularity quality over currently representative methods on real-world datasets, particularly in ambiguous and complex community structures.},

We dive into the most widely adoptable DAO launchpad, Snapshot, which covers 95% of the wild DAO projects for data collection and analysis. By integrating extensively enrolled DAOs and corresponding data measurements, we explore statistical resources from Snapshot and analyze data from 581 DAO projects, encompassing 16 246 proposals over the course of 3+ years. Our empirical research has uncovered a multitude of previously unknown facts about DAOs, spanning topics such as their status, features, performance, threats, and ways of improvement. We have distilled these findings into a series of key insights and takeaway messages, emphasizing their significance.

Furthermore, for more accurate results, we have selected three different sets of historical data for five large cap sectors (Alphabet, Apple, Blackrock, JP Morgan, and IBM) after which we observed the R-square values along with all the performance evaluation and error evaluation results for all the individual dataset in two phases, i.e., before and after using the Boruta feature selection method for 5, 10, and 15 years data, we observed the best results for LSTM (0.9443) and RNN (0.9752). Liquid neural networks, being the most efficient and accurate, gave the best R-square value of 0.9835.},

  abstract     = {Subjective tasks involve annotating instances according to personal opinions, emotions, and feelings. The neural network model must learn about human thought and expression complexity. Handling instances with different annotation opinions is the main challenge in subjective tasks. Existing methods focus on majority voting or integrating opinions from a few assigned annotators, leading to biased decisions and limited performance. To address this issue, this article proposes a cascade perspective network (CPNet) to uncover reliable disagreement for subjective tasks. Specifically, CPNet learns each annotator’s personalized knowledge from annotation disagreement and stores them in an annotator bank through the personal perspective module for abundant disagreement information. Then, CPNet obtains consistent opinions by referring to all annotators’ opinions from the annotator bank through the comprehensive perspective module to reduce bias caused by noise. CPNet improves decision-making by considering the diversity and comprehensiveness of all annotators’ opinions. Moreover, it performs well in subjective tasks with limited or numerous annotators. The state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on subjective datasets from different domains demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of CPNet.},

By constructing an academic collaboration network and optimizing the transfer probability matrix to reflect scholars’ relationships, the system captures scholars’ collaborative tendencies and potential connections. A key innovation of this work is the proposed Muls-IRWR algorithm, which improves traditional random walk with restart (RWR) by integrating various similarity measures. Using a subset of the DBLP citation data, we develop our academic collaboration network to calculate precise scholar similarities. Experimental results demonstrate that our system significantly outperforms existing models in terms of recommendation accuracy and efficiency, highlighting its practical value and potential for use in real-world academic applications.},

  abstract     = {The emotional support conversation (ESC) system is tailored to reduce the distress of individuals who are experiencing emotional challenges. To achieve this goal, the system must fully understand the emotional state of the user and employ appropriate strategies to provide effective emotional support. However, most existing methods predominantly focus on the user’s psychological state and the causes of user’s emotional problem, neglecting key cues, e.g., topics of conversation and listener’s psychological state. This leads to an incomplete understanding of the user’s situation and ineffective emotional support. This article presents a novel method that utilizes prompt learning with multiperspective cues (PMPC) to generate emotional support responses. Specifically, we extract multiperspective cues from the dialogue history and the causes of user’s emotional problem. To fully utilize the different cues within the ESC system, we categorize them into two groups: semantic enhancement cues and semantic constraint cues. Subsequently, we construct two prompts based on different categories of cues, which are designed to thoroughly understand user’s emotional predicament and generate an engaging support response, respectively. Experimental results on the ESConv dataset demonstrate that our proposed PMPC can surpass other approaches in both automatic and human evaluation metrics, providing compelling evidence of its efficacy and potential impact in real-world applications.},

In the recent era, due to the increase in the number of users and movies on OTT platforms such as Amazon Prime, its services, including personalized movie recommendations, become challenging. This article proposes a novel approach M2RM2UL, which stands for multimodal movie recommendation with multitasking and movie–user learning. The initial phase involves preprocessing multimodal movie data to extract features encompassing visual and textual information. Subsequently, a multitasking architecture is employed, simultaneously undertaking classification and regression tasks to acquire user and movie representations. The learned representations are used to make personalized and accurate movie recommendations. Additionally, the Netflix Prize dataset has been augmented to include textual and visual features, rendering it multimodal. We conducted extensive experiments on three real-world multimodal movie datasets (Movielens-100K, MMTF-14K, and Netflix Prize) and compared our approach with several state-of-the-art movie recommendation algorithms. The experimental results illustrate that our approach outperforms the baseline methods in terms of recommendation accuracy and diversity. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in different scenarios, such as cold-start and sparse data. Our empirical study provides strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed approach in multimodal movie recommendation.},

Existing methods measure users’ conformity factors to reduce the impact of popularity bias. However, these methods do not consider the differences in users’ conformity behavior in the long-term and short-term. To address this, we propose LSDRec, a novel debiased SR method structured around three key tasks: degree-centrality conformity awareness, dual-scale interest encoding, and adaptive conformity information fusing. The degree-centrality conformity awareness task constructs a multiuser interaction graph, employs a graph convolutional network (GCN) to obtain global user conformity representations, and uses the degree centrality algorithm to compute users’ long-term and short-term conformity factors. The dual-scale interest encoding task models users’ long-term and short-term interests separately, obtaining corresponding interest representations and further enhancing them through the adaptive conformity information fusing task. The adaptive conformity information fusing task contrasts global conformity representations with long-term and short-term interest representations, adaptively integrating conformity factors and dynamically adjusting the degree of conformity information transfer. Together, these three tasks effectively mitigate popularity bias and improve the accuracy of user interest modeling. Our extensive evaluations of four diverse datasets demonstrate LSDRec’s superior performance over current state-of-the-art methods.},

First, the latent diffusion model (L-diffusion) and parametric topological noise reduction network (PTDNet) were introduced as view generators to improve the limited representation ability and mitigate noise. Second, dual-view contrastive learning was constructed to alleviate the limitations of high-quality data in the recommendation system and the problem of model collapse in the training process. Third, a hard negative sampling strategy was proposed to improve the self-supervised signal. We extensively compared our method with 14 popular baselines on four public datasets (Yelp, BeerAdvocate, Gowalla, and LastFM). Experiments show an improvement of recommendation quality (e.g., that on the BeerAdocate dataset, NDCG@40 is improved by 3.6% and Recall@40 is improved by 3.3% on BeerAdvocate dataset).},
