  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a novel modulation scheme named Sparse Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (S-OTFS), which sparsely maps data symbols in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain. The proposed S-OTFS is designed for use as a secondary user (SU) waveform in an underlay cognitive radio (CR) system. While the primary system divides the entire spectrum into subbands and allocates them to primary users (PUs), the S-OTFS spreads the data symbols across the entire frequency-time (FT) domain, effectively reducing interference power levels to the primary system. To mitigate the interference from PUs at the underlay S-OTFS receiver, we propose modified linear minimum mean square error (M-LMMSE) equalizers in both time and FT domains. To this end, we rigorously derive the necessary statistical properties of the PU&#39;s interference as the explicit functions of the PU&#39;s subband location. We investigate various sparse patterns for the proposed S-OTFS and demonstrate through simulations that the scattered-type sparse patterns exhibit superior performance compared to the clustered-type sparse patterns. Most importantly, the proposed S-OTFS-based CR system with the scattered-type sparse patterns consistently demonstrates substantially improved performance compared to conventional underlay CR systems where multicarrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA) is employed for a SU, especially in high-speed mobile environments.},

We adopt a dynamic trajectory tracking approach, wherein a subject vehicle (SV), modeled by the nonlinear dynamic bicycle model, must follow the desired dynamics governed by the dynamic lane-change trajectory planning (DLTP) model, for changing lanes efficiently. We design a robust and adaptive Coupled Multiple Sliding Mode Control (CMSMC) law that ensures trajectory tracking despite time-varying disturbances acting on the SV. The controller accepts position and velocity inputs from the neighboring vehicles, through vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. The design is initially validated for an ideal communication channel that does not drop any data packets. Subsequently, we derive a sufficient condition that ensures the boundedness of the tracking error even when the communication channel exhibits packet drops. Using an appropriate model for packet drops, we derive an upper bound on the packet-transmission interval for each vehicle communicating with the SV, and also outline the associated condition for update of the controller. The DLTP model is validated using real-world field traffic data extracted from NGSIM; and the analytical results are substantiated through numerical computations, and simulations performed on SUMO. Our study contributes towards the co-design of controller and communication algorithms for connected vehicles under unreliable communication.},

However, the cost of using mmWave base stations (BSs) to completely cover the HSR lines is unaffordable in practice. In this paper, we introduc the airship-assisted train-to-ground communications in space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN), aiming to maximize the number of scheduling flows that satisfy quality of service (QoS) requirements. Then we formulate an optimization problem by configuring the number of networks, QoS requirements of flows, and the number of time slots (TSs) in each frame for transmission schedule. To address the problem, we first propose a network selection algorithm to help the airship and BSs select the right MRs, and determine whether the number of TSs occupied by flows can satisfy the QoS requirements. Furthermore, to enhance the number of scheduling flows, we propose a flow scheduling algorithm to optimizing the scheduling order of flows in different networks, and we also consider the flow scheduling when there is no network switching in certain frames. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve the number of scheduling flows and transmitted bits. We also verify that the proposed algorithm can further improve the system performance with different periods of network switching compared to other algorithms.},

Unlike the typical HVPSs results, the complete prior knowledge of the system parameters is not required. Firstly, to address the “explosion of complexity” challenge, an enhanced nonlinear PT filter is presented, which reduces the requirement of design parameter and improves the precision of linear filter. Then, an adaptive control strategy is proposed via backstepping technique and fuzzy approximation theory, which can realize the practical PT stability (PPTS) of HVPSs, and the asymptotic convergence of spacing errors is guaranteed by introducing smoothing function while meeting the constraint imposed by the performance funnel. Importantly, the complex Lyapunov function often associated with barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) technique can be avoided in this work. Finally, the validity of the theoretical results is verified by simulation of HVPSs under the predecessor-following communication topology.},

  abstract     = {Roadside units (RSUs) with strong sensing abilities enhance the viability of the RSU-to-Everything (R2X) paradigm, offering crucial infrastructure support for Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) that enables real-time data processing and reduced delay. Since RSUs collect a large volume of data but have limited computing capability, data analysis tasks are usually offloaded to other network nodes, such as the cloud, other RSUs, or even vehicles. The multi-hop distributed collaborative task offloading scheme is expected to achieve high resource utilization efficiency and low task delay in this scenario, despite increasing energy consumption in data transmission. However, the highly dynamic nature of the R2X network topology makes it challenging for a node to independently select the next hop and collaboratively allocate tasks to neighbors in a multi-hop transmission path. Specifically, offloading decisions made by an individual node are influenced not only by its immediate neighbors but also by other nodes along the multi-hop path, referred to in this paper as the effect value. Additionally, the heterogeneity in computing resources and link delays among network nodes further increases the difficulty. To address these challenges, we first apply a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict and update the neighbors for each node while considering effect values, allowing them to independently adapt to environmental changes. Then, we design a two-layer Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm for network nodes to make decisions. The first-layer DRL algorithm is implemented by RSUs to determine task offloading modes. When an RSU decides to offload tasks to multiple vehicles for collaborative computing, the second-layer DRL algorithm is used by a vehicle to select its next hop vehicle and allocate tasks. Simulation results show that our proposed approach effectively adapts to topology changes in complex and highly dynamic network environments. Compared with existing methods, this approach significantly improves task completion ratio and reduces processing delay.},

  abstract     = {In the realm of intelligent transportation systems (ITSs), safeguarding the resilience of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) with vulnerable interactions is imperative, particularly amidst the rapid spread of cyber-attack effects within the system. This paper introduces a pioneering Neural Network-based Cooperative Adaptive Resilient Control (NNCARC) approach that seamlessly integrates adaptive neural networks and resilient control mechanisms to counteract the impacts of nonlinearity, cyber-attacks, and external disturbances. The methodology commences with the development of an adaptive neural network to precisely estimate system nonlinearity, followed by the proposal of a cooperative adaptive resilient control strategy leveraging the Lyapunov theorem for stability analysis and adaptive laws. To the authors&#39; knowledge, this is the first time that a NNCARC is proposed which ensures all vehicles within a platoon, with any type of network topology, adhere safely to the leader&#39;s time-varying profile, without necessitating additional controller switching algorithms in the event of a cyber-attack. By eliminating restrictive assumptions like the Lipschitz condition on nonlinear components, the proposed methodology enhances its versatility and robustness. Theoretical analyses validate system stability and objective achievement, while simulation studies across diverse network topologies, cyber-attack scenarios, and external disturbances substantiate the efficacy of the approach in controlling CAVs within a platoon. This paper constitutes a significant advancement in resilient control methodologies for CAVs, offering a comprehensive solution to mitigate cyber-attack and disturbance effects while ensuring system stability and performance.},

Effective throughput (ET) is employed as the key performance metric in this study to explore the trade-off between the decoding error probability and achievable rate. A mixed-integer non-convex problem is formulated to jointly optimize power allocation, rate control, and user grouping. To tackle this challenge, the achievable ET is approximated using a lower bound, and a decomposition approach is developed to decouple the optimization variables. Specifically, for a given user grouping scheme, an iteration-based concave-convex programming (CCCP) method and an iteration-free lower-bound approximation (LBA) method are proposed for power allocation and rate control. Furthermore, a greedy search-based scheme and a minimum correlation user grouping (MCUG) scheme are designed for the user grouping problem. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the CCCP and LBA methods in power allocation and rate control and the MCUG method in user grouping when compared to the greedy and random methods. Besides, the superiority of RSMA for URLLC services is demonstrated when compared to spatial division multiple access.},

In the existing ISAC framework, the vehicle is usually treated as a point target and only the backscattered echo is used for sensing. However, in practice, the vehicle is an extended target composed of different reflecting/scattering surfaces, and hence the BS may receive multiple echoes. In this paper, by exploiting the directive scattering (DS) model for the incident signal at the vehicle surface, we demonstrate that the multipath echoes are substantial or even stronger, as compared with the backscattered echo. To capitalize on this observation, we develop a sensing-assisted predictive beamforming scheme with multipath echoes, where both the backscattered echo and multipath echoes are utilized for vehicle tracking. To accurately estimate the motion parameters of vehicles, we propose a particle filtering based tracking algorithm where the likelihood probabilities are designed based on the geometrical relationships of the multipath echoes. The beamforming vectors are then designed based on the predicted angles for establishing the communication links. Moreover, we present a particle swarm optimization (PSO) based algorithm to estimate the locations of the roadside scatterers when the prior information is unavailable. Extensive simulations are conducted to verify the superiorities of the proposed scheme.},

Specifically, it presents a comprehensive study on the deployment and trajectory optimization of UAVs as aerial transmission and reception points (TRPs) of D-mMIMO systems, considering systems composed solely of aerial TRPs and those implemented combining aerial and terrestrial TRPs. Moreover, user equipment (UE) mobility is modeled using a discrete-time Markov chain, and a novel approach to heuristically optimize the positions of aerial TRPs is proposed, considering the continuous movement of UEs in the coverage area. The proposed approach optimizes the three-dimensional location of each UAV under a time discretization framework, with the positioning of the UAVs being adjusted periodically, allowing for iterative trajectory optimization to improve the spectral efficiency (SE) performance of the UEs. Simulation results reveal that the proposed UAV trajectory optimization allows for significant SE improvement, especially for a low UE density scenario.

  abstract     = {Streaming applications like smart monitoring and real-time data processing are characterized by long data-collecting duration and delay stringent computation. Mobile edge computing can enable mobile devices to execute such applications more smoothly. However, achieving timely completion of streaming applications necessitates processing a flow of computation tasks in an assembly-line fashion, which requires an unprecedented system model and thus needs further study. This work addresses the above concern by investigating a scenario where multiple mobile devices run streaming tasks and offload them to a nearby BS for edge computing through a cooperative node. In this system, the duration of data collection, task offloading and edge computation together with multiuser offloading ratio and bandwidth allocation are jointly optimized to achieve low power consumption of the mobile devices and the cooperative node. The introduction of streaming tasks and cooperation mechanisms turns the task execution into multi-stage process and thus greatly exacerbate the complexity of overall solution. To this end, Dinkelbach method is first utilized for problem transformation. Subsequently, a hybrid approach of block coordinate descent (BCD) and Lagrangian multiplier method is employed to find local optimal solution when the BS has abundant computation capacity and difference of convex algorithm (DCA) is leveraged to attain convergent solution when the BS has finite computation capacity. Finally, numerical results are demonstrated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods and offer some insightful results about our proposed strategy.},

It is evolved from a mono-conical antenna and eventually achieved an ultra-low profile while remaining the broad band by replacing the complete cone with four metal arms, adding a top-loaded metal disk and grounding structures, and the multiple bents of the four arms. After that, two horizontally polarized elements (HPEs) are meticulously designed and embedded in the ground and the top disk of the VPE, respectively. Benefiting from the low profile VPE, the planar HPEs and the compact embedding scheme, the proposed antenna has a profile of only 0.053λL. To verify the design, a prototype is manufactured and measured. The results indicate that the prototype has overlapping bands of 1.63-2.7 GHz and 3.22-3.82 GHz, gain variation in omnidirectional plane of below 2.4 dB, and isolation between ports of better than 25 dB.},

  abstract     = {This work presents a maximum likelihood direct position determination (DPD) technique for multiple stationary radio sources emitting or reflecting identical waveforms. Conventional importance sampling (IS)-based DPD approaches are designed under the assumption of large distances between the sources, thus suffering from accuracy degradation when some of the sources are closely spaced. To this end, using channel state information (CSI), we propose a novel IS-based DPD algorithm by introducing a source classification step before generating position realizations. A more appropriate importance function is also developed. Specifically, rather than processing all sources independently, the new importance function assumes that the closely-located radio sources are uniformly distributed around a central point. The simulation results validate the robustness of the developed importance function. Furthermore, the results clearly show that the proposed algorithm can achieve a better estimation accuracy than state-of-the-art DPD techniques.},

  abstract     = {With the rise of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), a growing number of in-vehicle applications have been developed, significantly enhancing the driving experience, while simultaneously imposing excessive higher demands on computing resources. Vehicle Edge Computing (VEC) emerges as a promising solution by offloading computational tasks to edge servers positioned near vehicles. However, the limited computing capacity of these edge servers necessitates the efficient allocation of resources to adequately meet the demands of all vehicles. In this paper, we introduce a multi-vehicle VEC offloading framework that considers both the execution time of tasks and the costs incurred when utilizing edge server resources and transmitting tasks between Roadside Units (RSUs). Building on this framework, we design an optimization problem to minimize the average weighted cost, modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). To address this, we propose a DDPG-based Resource Allocation and Offloading Decision Algorithm (DRAODA). This algorithm enables the control center to generate resource allocation strategies while allowing individual vehicles to make task offloading decisions independently, based solely on their own data and the edge server&#39;s status, without relying on information from other vehicles. Additionally, we propose an Optimal Task Offloading Destination Selection Algorithm (OTODSA) to further minimize the average weighted cost, enhancing the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the resource allocation process.},

Employing torque vectoring capabilities, the proposed controller is able to stabilise the vehicle in evasive manoeuvres at the limit of handling. A nonlinear double-track vehicle model, together with an extended Fiala tyre model, is used to capture the nonlinear coupled longitudinal and lateral dynamics. The optimised control inputs are the steering angle and the four longitudinal wheel forces to minimise the tracking error in safe situations and maximise the vehicle-to-obstacle distance in emergency manoeuvres. These optimised longitudinal forces generate an additional direct yaw moment, enhancing the vehicle&#39;s lateral agility and aiding in obstacle avoidance and stability maintenance. The longitudinal tyre forces are constrained using the tyre friction cycle. The proposed controller has been tested on rapid prototyping hardware to prove real-time capability. In a high-fidelity simulation environment validated with experimental data, our proposed approach successfully avoids obstacles and maintains vehicle stability. It outperforms two baseline controllers: one without torque vectoring and another one without collision avoidance prioritisation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness of the proposed approach to vehicle parameter variations, road friction, perception, and localisation errors. The influence of each variation is statistically assessed to evaluate its impact on the performance, providing guidelines for future controller design.},

However, achieving dynamic and intelligent network slice configuration to accommodate diverse service types remains a critical challenge in advanced network orchestration. With the advent of 6G, which is characterized by its highly dynamic and robust nature, there is an urgent need for an intelligent and slice-compatible assignment approach to meet the evolving demands of next-generation networks. In this context, this work introduces an end-to-end network slicing framework that spans from the user to the Centralized Unit, within a system model incorporating an Open Radio Access Network and Cell-Free massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output architecture. Our contribution begins with a detailed review of the anticipated 6G Key Performance Indicators and their implications for network slicing. We then propose a novel approach that leverages Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) to enable a single intelligent agent to address multiple service requirements through a unified training phase. By replacing multiple specialized agents with a single MORL agent, our approach significantly improves the scalability, reduces the complexity, and enhances the practicality of network slicing orchestration-while maintaining optimal system performance. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed MORL-based solution. The trained agent not only ensures the Quality of Service for diverse user service requests but also successfully manages the coexistence of conflicting service types. This includes accommodating the stringent requirements of Extremely Reliable and Low-Latency Communications alongside Further-Enhanced Mobile Broadband services within the same network environment.},

  abstract     = {Physical layer security (PLS) technique is expected to play a crucial part in the vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks, by offering secure transmission to protect confidential information from potential eavesdropper. Considering a hybrid active-passive reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs)-enhanced integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, this paper proposes a novel secure scheme for transmitting confidential information and performing radar sensing, where vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links share the spectrum resource preoccupied by vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links. We aim to optimize the sum secrecy rate of V2I links by jointly designing the transmit beamforming of RSU, the radio spectrum reuse scheme of V2X links, and active and passive reflection beamforming of hybrid RIS. With above optimization, the proposed approach can enhance secure communication performance of V2I links while guaranteeing the communication quality of V2V links and target sensing capacity of RSU. Since the system model is dynamic, and it is difficult to handle the nonconvex problem, an efficient hierarchical twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (HTD3) method is developed to learn the secure beamforming and spectrum sharing strategies against potential eavesdropping. The proposed method decomposes the spectrum allocation into the deep Q-network procedure and designs the secure beamforming variables by employing the TD3 algorithm. Numerical results exhibit that given a sufficient power budget of hybrid RIS, our HTD3-based method enhances both the secure communication performance of V2I links and radar detection capability of RSU compared with the existing learning methods.},

To manage data sharing and control network overhead introduced by cooperation, an excision filter is introduced at each base station. After data fusion, the framework employs a three-step clustering procedure combined with a tracking algorithm to effectively handle point-like and extended targets. Delving into the sensing/communication trade-off, resources such as transmit power, frequency, and time are varied, providing valuable insights into their impact on the overall system performance. Additionally, a sophisticated channel model is proposed, accounting for complex urban propagation scenarios and addressing multipath effects and multiple reflection points for extended targets like vehicles.

To mitigate this inconsistency, the LF can be learned by using input-output samples obtained from the MIMO detection. However, the input-output samples inevitably have some uncertainties due to detection errors. To address this challenge, we consider a Markov decision process (MDP) to minimize the mismatch between the true and learned LFs under sample uncertainty. Subsequently, we propose a computationally efficient LF learning method to solve the MDP. In the proposed method, we first simplify an LF update model in the MDP, which efficiently captures temporal channel variations by considering the expectation of the channel model noise. Based on the LF update model, we obtain the optimal policy in a closed-form solution by considering the most probable state transition.

To address the problem, this article proposes an interference suppression approach based on the Fractional Fourier Transform (FRFT). It is noted that the interference component in the intermediate frequency (IF) signal exhibits chirp-like characteristics, which shows the energy concentration in a FRFT domain. Therefore, the interference component can be easily filtered out in the FRFT domain. Additionally, to decrease the computational cost in the presence of multiple interferences, a two-dimensional (2-D) constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detector is utilized to detect interference components.

These technological improvements have enabled Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) to transmit data through robust maritime communication networks. However, despite these advancements, AIS data often contain significant missing data due to limitations in both devices and network coverage. To overcome these limitations, this research presents an innovative approach for reconstructing missing points. In this paper, we first extracted the geometric shape and motion characteristics of vessels and constructed a decision tree using an adaptive sparse constraint mechanism to classify four types of vessel trajectories. Then, the vessel classification findings serve as input and the vessel acceleration features are constructed using the heading and velocity features of the trajectories at both ends. Finally, We employ a bidirectional Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU) network to simultaneously train on historical trajectory data. The method progressively shortens the reconstructed trajectory, thereby enhancing the accuracy of the reconstruction. In this paper, comparative experiments are conducted with several algorithms across various dimensions, including algorithm performance, trajectory types, and navigation scenarios. It is indicated by the experimental results that the algorithm discussed in this study outperforms baselines. Significant methodological advancements in vessel trajectory reconstruction are represented by this study, which also shows promising potential for application in intelligent maritime transportation systems.},

This article presents a neural network-based adaptive optimized attitude control approach for an FWEPAUV system, considering unmeasurable yaw angular velocity, system uncertainties, and external disturbances. The composite observer and radial basis function neural networks (RBF NNs) are established to estimate the yaw angular velocity, system uncertainties, and disturbances. The estimated signals are then jointly utilized to compensate for the redundant signals in the control channel, thereby enhancing robustness. A composite-observer-actor-critic reinforcement learning architecture is proposed to learn the optimal value function, generate the control torque, and achieve the balance between the control accuracy and cost.

  abstract     = {In wireless sensor networks, sensor relative localization is a crucial technique. Most of the existing methods utilize ultra-wide band (UWB) ranging signals to obtain internode measurements. However, when the sensor bandwidth is limited, the ranging measurement is of low-precision and leads to poor localization performance. Carrier phase positioning is critical for precise positioning in narrowband positioning systems such as Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and radio interferometric positioning systems (RIPS). However, carrier phase positioning faces the challenge of unknown carrier phase ambiguity resolution, which is more complicated in sensor cooperative relative localization. To address the problem about the utilization of carrier phase in cooperative relative localization, we propose a carrier phase-based positioning method consisting of a four-stage framework. Firstly, we exploit the low-rank property embedded in matrices at multiple epochs and obtain a rough float estimate of ambiguities via a Gauss-Newton low-rank approximation algorithm. Then the proposed method uses multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) to accomplish the rough estimation of the sensor coordinates in the second stage. In the third stage, the float estimates of ambiguities and sensor coordinates are refined by solving the nonlinear least square problem. Finally, partial ambiguity resolution (PAR) is realized by the LAMBDA method and the fixed solution of sensor coordinates can be obtained. We derive the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and utilize numerical simulations to verify that that the performance of the refined float solution can reach the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB). This method results in the fixed solution of sensor coordinates obtained by PAR being more precise. Furthermore, the proposed method has robustness to the ambiguity initial error and the carrier phase measurement noise, resulting in the localization performance achieving centimeter-level accuracy in general cases.},

  abstract     = {As an emerging technology, Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) is expected to be applied to UAV-assisted Internet of Things (IoT) systems to sense and acquire information from IoT devices in complex environments. In this paper, we design a UAV-ISAC assisted IoT system, where the UAV senses the IoT nodes in unknown locations and simultaneously forwards the sensing information to the ground base station (BS). The UAV is required to complete the sensing of all IoT nodes before returning to the starting position. However, several challenges arise in designing this system, including unknown IoT node positions, a non-convex optimization problem, constrained resources, a dynamic environment, and complex resource allocation. We propose using radar estimation rate as the measure for evaluating the UAV sensing performance. We formulate a UAV trajectory optimization problem that aims to maximize the radar estimation rate and minimize the UAV flight time, while adhering to constraints on radar sensing performance, information rate, and sensing all the nodes. However, solving this problem using standard optimization techniques is challenging due to the lack of information about the locations of IoT nodes and the non-convex nature of the problem. To address this challenge, we propose an algorithm by adopting multi-step learning Dueling Double Deep Q-learning network (DDQN) based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to solve this intractable optimization problem. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm achieves stable convergence under different constraint thresholds. Furthermore, we verify the superiority of our algorithm by comparing it with other benchmark algorithms.},

Although there have been several efforts to assess, schedule, and model the load of fast electric vehicle charging stations (FEVCSs), they are inappropriate for charging stations in EVPLs. This paper proposes a novel comprehensive probabilistic approach to calculate the parking lot power and energy for battery and hybrid electric vehicles. At first, a decision is made for the operation mode of an EV arriving at the PL, using an algorithm considering ten affective random variables. Then, the aggregated parking lot power and energy are determined using Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, the Gaussian Mixture Model is used to estimate the parameters of the output probability density functions, where the maximum likelihood estimation is employed to find model components. The proposed approach is applied to a sample parking lot, and its performance is demonstrated by comparing it to a base case study and one of the pioneering techniques introduced in the literature. Finally, a thorough sensitivity analysis is applied to assess the robustness of the outputs under different scenarios.

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation using sparse arrays shows advantages in reducing hardware costs and enhancing degrees-of-freedom. However, most current studies primarily focus on generating covariance-like matrices associated with higher dimensional difference co-arrays, neglecting the valuable information embedded in pseudo covariance matrices relevant to sum co-arrays when noncircular (NC) components are present in impinging signals. This leads to suboptimal estimation performance. To address this limitation and well leverage both covariance and pseudo covariance matrices, we propose a two-stage reconstruction-based sequential decoupled (TR-SD) approach using both sum and difference co-arrays corresponding to the deployed sparse symmetric planar array (SSPA). This approach enables the estimation of 2D DOAs of impinging signals and NC phases of NC signals simultaneously. The TR pre-procedures are developed to efficiently reconstruct the conjugate augmented covariance matrix corresponding to the uniform counterpart of the SSPA. Subsequently, SD post-procedures are devised with low computational complexity, maintaining high identifiability and the capability to estimate the NC phases. Numerical simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposed TR-SD approach in diverse signal scenarios, demonstrating enhanced identifiability, improved detection probability, increased estimation accuracy, and high angular resolution.},

In this work, empowered by the wavenumber-domain channel representation, we analyze the EDoF in a general case where the directivity of antennas, determined by the antenna structure and element spacing, is considered. Specifically, we first reveal the uneven distribution of directivity-aware wavenumber-domain coupling coefficients, i.e., channel gain towards different directions, in the isotropic Rayleigh fading channel. EDoF is then calculated based on such distribution of coupling coefficients. A numerical method is also provided to obtain coupling coefficients via full-wave EM simulations. Due to the influence of antenna directivity, how EDoF and ergodic channel capacity vary with the element spacing are explored via simulations for different antenna types.},

The highlights of U2Net are to design an inner U-net for local features and another outer U-net to fuse local features for global feature patterns. The DOA problem is designed as a multi-label classification task with on-grid patterns, and train data set is generated at low SNR regimes by specifying sample covariance matrix as input features and source direction as labels. Simulation results demonstrate that the U2Net achieves excellent and robust performances in multiple-target DOA estimation tasks, especially under challenging conditions with high noise levels, small snapshots and coherent sources. Moreover, the U2Net has a potential to resolve source angles within grid resolution.

  abstract     = {The implementation of the partitioned edge learning (PARTEL) framework in practical fast-fading wireless systems with time-varying channels is investigated in this paper. By exploiting the benefit of only training and transmitting a light-size sub-model on devices, PARTEL enjoys both enhanced computation and communication efficiency compared to federated edge learning framework where each device needs to train and transmit all model parameters. In this work, we aim at further enhancing the learning efficiency via minimizing the training latency of each training round in practical fast fading channels, where each round includes multiple channel time-coherence time durations. The challenges arise from the unknown channel state information (CSI) of future durations and the coupling between load balancing and bandwidth allocation among devices. To this end, an equivalent Markov decision process (MDP) problem is derived, where each decision step corresponds to one channel coherence-time duration. The learning load balancing is first determined based on an existing design for static channels by using the expected channel gains. Then, the bandwidth allocation for uploading the local sub-model updates in each duration is sequentially determined by the proposed optimization algorithm. The spectrum efficiency is enhanced since the bandwidth is adaptively allocated to all devices according to their communication and computation statuses in each coherence-time duration. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to show the superiority of our proposed algorithms over the existing benchmarks. Specifically, the proposed algorithm can reduce the one-round latency by up to 25.51% for the bandwidth of 70 MHz.},

  abstract     = {Controller area network (CAN) bus is the most widely used protocol for in-vehicle networks, but it lacks security mechanism in design and is susceptible to various attacks. In addition, the on-board diagnostic port (OBD-II) is the physical access point of the CAN bus. However, adversaries can inject messages into the CAN bus through this port, thereby maliciously controlling the vehicle. Aiming at the above problems, this paper proposes a novel authentication and key agreement scheme for in-vehicle networks. Specifically, the proposed scheme considers the issue of secure communication on the CAN bus and the device access issue of the OBD-II port. Static random access memory physical unclonable function (SRAM PUF) is used to perform electronic control unit (ECU) authentication, group key distribution and data frame authentication, ensuring the authenticity of the ECU and the confidentiality and integrity of the data frame. It can also resist replay, physical and other attacks. Besides, we design the authentication and key agreement protocols of external devices in two scenarios respectively to prevent external devices from injecting malicious messages into the CAN bus through the OBD-II port. Finally, we use Scyther and Go language to verify the proposed scheme. The verification results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is not only able to achieve various security goals, but also proves the correctness of its logic. Compared with existing group-based schemes, this scheme has moderate computational and communication overhead overall, but has obvious advantages in key update and authentication of external devices, which can fulfill the low-latency and resource-constrained requirements of in-vehicle networks.},

This framework can learn the operating policy of small base stations in an ultra-dense heterogeneous network, resulting in maximum energy savings while respecting quality of service (QoS) constraints. Additionally, the use of federated learning enhances the security of the system as only the model parameters are shared among the entities, rather than the raw and potentially sensitive data. In other words, in the event of a data breach or eavesdropping, only the parameters of the developed artificial intelligence model would be compromised. This approach ensures that the network remains secure against attacks targeting confidential and sensitive data. The performance evaluation reveals that the proposed framework can achieve an energy saving that is about 77% more than that of the state-of-the-art solutions while respecting the QoS constraints of the network.},

  abstract     = {Age of Information (AoI) is a critical metric that can be used to assess the freshness of information in highly dynamic low-earth orbit (LEO) terrestrial-satellite communications. In most existing research on the AoI of wireless transmissions, the packet transmission rate rarely changes. However, over a given period of time and without perfect transmit power control, the transmission rate of LEO terrestrial-satellite links cannot remain constant. This is due to the time-varying path loss fading experienced by the transmitted signal over the LEO terrestrial-satellite links, as the LEO satellites can travel at speeds exceeding Mach 10 and complete 12-16 Earth orbits per day. Inspired by this observation, this paper investigates the effects of the swift motion of LEO satellites on the freshness of information in LEO terrestrial-satellite uplink transmissions. At the same time, the Slotted Aloha protocol is considered to manage the process of multiple ground nodes accessing the LEO satellites. The closed-form expression for the average AoI of the LEO terrestrial-satellite uplink transmissions is explicitly derived for the single ground node scenario. Furthermore, a model for analyzing the average AoI in the multi-ground node scenario is proposed accordingly. Finally, numerical results are presented to validate the proposed analysis models of the average AoI and to investigate the AoI variation in the target LEO terrestrial-satellite transmission systems.},

Several deep learning-based Semantic Communication (SC) models have been proposed to reduce feature transmission overhead and mitigate channel noise interference. Previous research has demonstrated that Spiking Neural Network (SNN)-based SC models exhibit greater robustness on digital channels compared to Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based SC models. However, the existing SNN-based SC models require fixed time steps, resulting in fixed transmission bandwidths that cannot be adaptively adjusted based on channel conditions. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel SC model called SNN-SC-HARQ, which combines the SNN-based SC model with the Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ) mechanism. SNN-SC-HARQ comprises an SNN-based SC model that supports the transmission of features at varying bandwidths, along with a policy model that determines the appropriate bandwidth. Experimental results show that SNN-SC-HARQ can dynamically adjust the bandwidth according to the channel conditions without performance loss.},

Service providers can dynamically update their caches to improve the system offloading efficiency. To maximize the offloading efficiency, we formulate the TSCU problem as a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem and develop an improved discrete cuckoo search algorithm to solve the optimization problem. Our proposed algorithm explores the global environment via Levy flight. On the other hand, the algorithm convergence rate is accelerated by generating the initial population based on a greedy algorithm and its variants and updating the discard probability. Simulation results show that our proposal has achieved an up to 12% improvement in offloading efficiency compared to the benchmark schemes.},

  abstract     = {The advancement of communication technologies significantly enhances the capabilities for cooperative control among connected vehicles. In terms of platooning, this paper proposes a delay-dependent cloud-based nonlinear model predictive control algorithm for fuel-saving platoons which requires maintaining a desired longitudinal inter-vehicle gap. Firstly, the platoon is modeled with longitudinal dynamics, considering the constraints of physical limitations and rear-end collision avoidance based on information topology. For random communication delay compensation, a delay-dependent control algorithm is designed and combined with a cloud control strategy to achieve platoon performance and improve fuel economy. This paper conducts a comprehensive analysis of the proposed method&#39;s asymptotic stability and string stability, employing Lyapunov techniques for validation. The simulation of a 10-vehicle platoon shows high tracking accuracy and quick consensus convergence as well as high fuel efficiency under the random time delay process and networked control protocol. Finally, the real-vehicle platooning test is conducted, demonstrating that the space errors are maintained within 1 m under high-speed scenarios with realistic communication delays.},

Except a covert user monitored by the warden, there are multiple public users existing in the service area. For the purpose of evaluating the efficacy of the covert communication system, a covert constraint is derived measuring the minimum detection error probability of the warden through the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. Then an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the convert rate, while ensuring the constraints of covertness, transmit power and quality of service (QoS) for public users. A two-step iterative algorithm jointly designing the active and passive beamforming, is put forth to efficiently resolve this non-convex optimization problem. Additionally, the numerical results clearly demonstrate that the proposed RIS-assisted scheme can significantly enhance the covert communication performance on the premise of guaranteeing the public communication performance of the system.},

The existing GNSS-only FDM methods are ineffective in scenarios involving multiple faulty observations due to either their theoretical model limitations or high computational costs. In this paper, a novel GNSS multi-fault detection and correction method is developed that achieves a balance between computational complexity and performance. The proposed method incorporates an Expectation Maximization (EM) framework to jointly estimate an approximate maximum likelihood of states and latent model parameters in the presence of observation outliers, i.e., faults. However, the EM algorithm is known for its high computational complexity. To reduce the computational complexity of EM, an importance sampling step based on unsupervised clustering is introduced. As demonstrated by the results and analysis herein, the proposed method outperforms the existing Least-squares Residuals method, achieving an average improvement of up to 48% in positioning accuracy. Additionally, the computational complexity of the proposed method is an order of magnitude lower than the state-of-the-art Solution Separation method. The method enhances positioning reliability at a lower computational cost and does not require additional infrastructure, hence, can be readily integrated into standalone real-time GNSS applications.},

  abstract     = {Accurate tire capacity information is crucial to maintaining vehicle handling stability and optimizing safety control systems. Tire capacity, which refers to the grip margin of the tire, represents the maximum additional force that a tire can exert under current conditions. It determines whether the vehicle is capable of executing additional steering, braking, and driving maneuvers while ensuring safety. This study proposes a direct tire capacity estimation method, which represents an advance in the field of tire capacity identification method. This method utilizes an end-to-end architecture to train the network, enabling direct utilization of signals from on-board sensors for estimating tire capacity, irrespective of whether the tires operate under pure or combined slip conditions. Additionally, it mitigates the issues of error transfer and accumulation often found in traditional layered estimation methods that overly rely on intermediate states. Outputs from the single-track (2-DOF) vehicle model are integrated as features to enhance the network&#39;s learning capability and interpretability. Additionally, a long-short-term memory (LSTM) based network is constructed to capture the nonlinear relationship and address the phase difference between features. The results of the validation and test sets show high identification accuracy, while the cosimulation of real driving scenarios is used for further verification. The results indicate that the proposed method accurately captures tire capacity information during whole tire working regions and exhibits robust generalization ability.},

  abstract     = {Edge computing (EC) has emerged as an important technology to support the low-delay request of massive devices nowadays. Task offloading is an essential part in EC because it can influence the use of network resources and network performance dramatically. Most existing task offloading works are only from the view of users. To effectively considering the features and objectives of both users and edge nodes from their different perspectives, a Stackelberg game-based joint computing resource allocation and task offloading method is proposed in this paper. For the nature in EC where edge nodes and users play different roles, the problem is formulated as a bi-level optimization model with multiple leaders and multiple followers. The edge nodes can be seen as leaders and the users are followers. When jointly allocating computing resource and offloading tasks, edge nodes and users have different objectives. The objective of edge nodes is to achieve the most revenue and least energy cost, and the objective of users is to obtain short delay, consume little energy and pay less. Further, considering the particular features of EC, unlike existing Stackelberg game-based task offloading research, we focus on the computing resource allocation rather than pricing. The edge nodes decide the amount of computing resources to be allocated to each user. The users will then react according to such allocation to decide task offloading strategies. Interference, delay, energy, and payoff are all considered. Evolutionary optimization method BLEAQ-II is applied to solve the designed Stackelberg game-based task offloading model. Numerical results have shown the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Particularly, we show that the ergodic capacity of any wireless channel can be interpreted as the iterated Laplace transform of the complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) of the effective channel power gain. Building on this intriguing result, we analyze and exemplify the ergodic capacity of a very general class of wireless channels whose CCDF is expressed in terms of a product of a power function and a Fox H-function. Interestingly, the ergodic capacity of such a class of wireless channels can be straightforwardly obtained by means of the iterated Laplace transform, thereby circumventing the task of solving intricate integrals that are typically indispensable to quantifying the ergodic capacity. Furthermore, we extend our iterated Laplace transform approach to analyze and exemplify the ergodic capacity in various communication settings, including diversity combining receivers, double fading channels, mobility, and communication in the presence of co-channel interference. Our approach not only simplifies the evaluation of ergodic capacity across these settings but also provides a novel perspective that underscores its merit across a wide range of applications.},

This paper proposes the Multi-Scale Time Fusion Transformer (MSTFformer) architecture, which not only deeply mines the spectrum occupancy characteristics, but also designs a pyramid attention mask to effectively reduce the computational complexity of the multi-head attention mechanism. The MSTFformer consists of three components, namely the Trend Building Net (TRENDNET), Time Series Encoding Net (TENET), and Pyramid Attention Mechanism Decoding Net (PADNET). The TRENDNET is employed to capture the long-range trend features of electromagnetic spectrum data over varying time lengths. The TENET leverages BiLSTM memory units to enhance the nonlinear attributes of local temporal information and utilizes Gating Propagation (GP) and Gating Residual (GR) components to regulate information flow. The PADNET automatically constructs a multi-scale pyramid to extract correlation information within and between scales, thereby promoting the interaction of cross-scale information, and using pyramid masks to reduce model complexity. Experimental results show that compared with the other ten methods, the MSTFformer ranks third in inference speed, while surpassing the second-best method in prediction accuracy with reductions in MSE, RMSE, and MAE by 71.4%, 43.2%, and 26.6%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Oil spills represent significant environmental hazards in ocean ecosystems, requiring rapid and accurate detection and response mechanisms. Due to its efficacy, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an important tool for remote monitoring of ocean environments. However, operational constraints such as communication time between low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites and ground stations (GS), as well as finite buffers, pose challenges. To address these issues, this paper proposes a space-air-ground-integrated network (SAGIN) scenario comprising LEO satellites, high altitude platforms (HAPs), and ground stations (GSs), suitable for rapid and accurate oil spill detection using SAR images. In addition, a novel three-step algorithm is proposed to facilitate SAR image transmission effectively. The first step of the proposed algorithm focuses on maximizing the transmission of ocean SAR images from the LEO satellites to the HAPs. This optimization involves the neural Myerson auction (NMA)-based scheduler, a second-price auction mechanism with deep learning methodologies for truthfulness, distributed computation, and low computational complexity. In addition, the pathloss is also considered for effective communication system design. The second step algorithm aims to maximize data transmission efficiency from HAPs to GSs, employing scheduling strategies based on the Markov decision process (MDP). This algorithm enables optimal decision-making over time steps, considering the throughput of each GS and the age of the information (AoI) ratio. Finally, an image compression rate control algorithm based on Lyapunov optimization is employed at the GSs to enhance detection accuracy while ensuring queue stability. The performance of the proposed three-step algorithm is intensively evaluated against various benchmark algorithms, demonstrating its superiority in oil spill detection efficacy.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we present BiM-ACPPO, a bilevel multi-armed bandit-based hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for interaction-aware decision-making and planning at unsignalized intersections. Essentially, it proactively takes the uncertainties associated with surrounding vehicles (SVs) into consideration, which encompass those stemming from the driver&#39;s intention, interactive behaviors, and the varying number of SVs. Intermediate decision variables are introduced to enable the high-level RL policy to provide an interaction-aware reference, for guiding low-level model predictive control (MPC) and further enhancing the generalization ability of the proposed framework. By leveraging the structured nature of self-driving at unsignalized intersections, the training problem of the RL policy is modeled as a bilevel curriculum learning task, which is addressed by the proposed Exp3.S-based BiMAB algorithm. It is noteworthy that the training curricula are dynamically adjusted, thereby facilitating the sample efficiency of the RL training process. Comparative experiments are conducted in the high-fidelity CARLA simulator, and the results indicate that our approach achieves superior performance compared to all baseline methods. Furthermore, experimental results in two new urban driving scenarios clearly demonstrate the commendable generalization performance of the proposed method.},

To protect the location privacy in the ride-sharing process, a variety of privacy-preserving matching schemes were proposed. However, the existing matching schemes incur high computational overhead, and cannot resist the attack of malicious adversaries. In this paper, we proposed a privacy-preserving matching scheme based on threshold private set intersection, which can protect the location privacy in the malicious model. To reduce computational overhead, we designed a new efficient method for the cardinality test of the route intersection size, based on symmetric-key primitives and a constant number of public-key operations. In addition, our privacy-preserving matching scheme uses geographic indistinguishability to generate virtual points as input sets of privacy-preserving matching scheme, and the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) uses the output of privacy-preserving matching scheme to match the appropriate vehicle for the user. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed scheme is efficient for IoV-enabled ride-sharing services.},

  abstract     = {A high-gain duplex antenna with multibeam radiation based on a Fabry-Pérot Cavity (FPC) is proposed in this paper. For the performance, it is the first FPC antenna integrated with duplex and multi-beam radiation. It is the first endeavor to apply a wideband FPC to a duplex antenna with two channels, aiming at significantly enhancing their realized gains and subsequently achieving three switchable directive beams. Firstly, a low-profile duplex slot antenna with two isolated channels (9.4 and 10.7 GHz) is designed. Then, to enhance the realized gains for two channels simultaneously, a wideband FPC with a stepped reflective ground is designed and combined with the proposed duplex slot antenna. The upper ground of the duplex antenna can be reused as the reflector for FPC. Even there three duplex sources on the ground, it will not affect the reflectivity of the wave in FPC due to the relatively small radiation aperture of the slot. By utilizing this method, the experimental results show that the realized gains of two channels are increased to 15.2 and 16.2 dBi, respectively, which are improved by more than 12 dB. Finally, three duplex slot antennas are placed on the bottom of the FPC, and excited individually. For two channels, the H-plane directive beams can be switched at −18°, 0°, and 18° relative to its broadside direction. The proposed antenna is a good candidate for vehicular communications systems such as vehicle-satellite and low-altitude communication where requires low profile, wide coverage range and long-distance data transmission.},

Existing and coming wireless networks allowing vehicles connect to terrestrial base stations (BS), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), and satellites networks are the key to accomplish this ambitious goal of IoV connectivity. The wireless industry as well as the vehicle leaders are now seeking antenna innovations to support the integration of sub-6 GHz (vehicles-to-UAV), 24 GHz (vehicles-to-BS), and 20/30 GHz (vehicles-to-satellites) networks. Here, we introduce a new triple-band high-gain antenna, which produces the operating frequencies at sub-6, K-and Ka- bands for the first time. The triple-band performance is realized on a shared-aperture configuration by hybridizing a sub-6 GHz Fabry-Perot Cavity antenna (FPCA), a K-band folded reflectarray antenna (FRA) and a Ka-band reflectarray antenna (RA). Three kinds of meta-atoms (MAs) with distinct functions at different frequency bands are used to constitute the respective three functional metasurfaces of the proposed shared-aperture antenna. For demonstration, a prototype is fabricated and measured. The measured effective bandwidths (for the reflection coefficient ≤ -10 dB and the gain variation ≤ 3 dB) are 5.62 to 5.94 GHz, 19.5 to 26 GHz, and 29.5 to 35 GHz with the peak gain of 16 dBi, 27.4 dBi and 30.9 dBi at three bands, respectively.},

Meanwhile, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) stands out as a key contender for enhancing spectral efficiency and reducing transmission delay. In this paper, we amalgamate the pattern division multiple access (PDMA), recognized as an appealing NOMA scheme, with OTFS, coined as OTFS-PDMA, to leverage the benefits of both technologies and address the low-latency and massive connectivity demands of sixth-generation (6 G) networks. Specifically, we first reformulate the input-output relations in the delay-Doppler domain for localized and distributed-mapping-based OTFS-PDMA systems featuring various PDMA pattern allocation schemes. Then, we propose a low-complexity power vector expectation propagation detection algorithm (PV-EPA) for OTFS-PDMA schemes operating in spatially correlated channels. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed OTFS-PDMA scheme offers substantial performance improvements over the conventional OTFS-OMA scheme. For irregular PDMA patterns, localized mapping-based OTFS-PDMA schemes exhibit superior performance relative to their distributed counterparts. Additionally, the proposed PV-EPA receiver shows remarkable robustness against channel correlation and achieves a favorable trade-off between performance and complexity.},

  abstract     = {To mitigate the impact of human-driven vehicles (HDVs) on connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) in mixed traffic environments, the implementation of dedicated lanes has been proposed to achieve partial separation between CAVs and HDVs, thereby improving the operational efficiency of both CAVs and the road segment. The lane management policy, where dedicated lanes for HDV (HDLs) and general lanes (GLs) coexist on a road segment, is referred to as the (G, H) policy. This paper proposes a multi-lane fundamental diagram model for mixed traffic flow and aims to investigate the effects of HDL configuration on the efficiency of road segments under the (G, H) policy. Firstly, different car-following modes in mixed traffic flow are analyzed, and various car-following models are employed to characterize the mixed traffic flow. Secondly, two lane selection principles are introduced to describe the lane choice behavior of HDVs under the (G, H) policy. Based on these principles, five equilibrium states that may exist on the road segment under the (G, H) policy are analyzed. Subsequently, a multi-lane fundamental diagram model incorporating HDL is derived based on the lane selection principles of HDV. Finally, numerical analysis is conducted to investigate the influence of lane configuration schemes under the (G, H) policy on the distribution of equilibrium states, fundamental diagram, and capacity. The results indicate that: (1) Based on the lane choice behavior of vehicles, the equilibrium states of road segment can be classified into five types. The distribution of each equilibrium state under different traffic conditions only depends on the proportion of HDL to the total number of lanes on road segment. A higher number of HDL leads to a reduced applicability of the (G, H) policy under different traffic conditions. (2) Under different penetration rates, as density increases, the overall traffic volume of road segment initially increases and then decreases until reaching the critical jammed density. (3) In a three-lane scenario, compared to the absence of HDL, the optimal HDL configuration scheme can increase the traffic volume of road segment by approximately 11%. (4) With HDL deployment, the capacity of road segment initially increases and then decreases with an increase in CAVs penetration rate.},

To deal with the proposed nonconvex problem, we adopt the alternating optimization (AO) method to divide the original problem into two subproblems. The first subproblem is related to power/subcarriers allocation, which is equivalently transformed into a Semidefinite Programming (SDP) problem and eventually solved by the penalized convex-concave procedure (PCCP) method. The second subproblem is a quadratic integer problem related to APs mode selection, which is transformed into a convex quadratic integer problem that can be efficiently solved by the convex optimization toolbox. The numerical results demonstrate the tradeoff between the total transmission rate and sensing performance with different parameter configurations.

  abstract     = {As maritime activities increase, the demand for high-speed, low-latency communications and efficient task processing in maritime communication networks (MCNets) intensifies. Currently, sea-surface communications and tasks mainly depend on on-shore base stations, which have limited coverage, and marine satellites, which offer broader reach but cannot provide high-speed connections and are costly. Motivated by the above, we investigate the deployment of air base stations (ABSs) in MCNets to offer flexible coverage and handle maritime-specific tasks. ABS-aided MCNets benefit from the integration of mobile edge computing (MEC) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) techniques. Specifically, by optimizing the task offloading and resource allocation, we formulate a total task processing delay minimization problem under the constraints of task time-to-live (TTL) and successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding threshold. Since the formulated problem is non-convex, we decouple it and solve it iteratively. The channel allocation, power control, offloading ratio, and computation resource allocation are tackled in turn. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms existing schemes in reducing the total task processing delay. Notably, the incorporation of NOMA markedly enhances the task offloading rate, further decreasing the total task processing delay. The proposed scheme cuts the total task processing delay by at least 7.7% compared to the state-of-the-art schemes and by 40.9% against the local computing benchmark. Additionally, the performance of the proposed scheme, including its complexity, convergence, and the performance loss due to iterative optimization, is analyzed.},

A lightweight resilient formation control framework based on watermarks is proposed to achieve the desired formation configuration without extra monitoring attack status. Since deception attacks are covert, the shared information is watermarked before transmission to establish the protocol among networked UAVs. To facilitate the resilient formation controller design, a decoder is first developed to decipher the inverse transformation of deception attacks, where the watermark is the criterion for approximating the inverse transformation. The Gauss error function is introduced to eliminate some unrealistic input commands under deception attacks, obtaining the predefined input performance. Then, a resilient formation controller is developed to guarantee the global boundedness of all signals within the inner-loop and outerloop system, while the formation error converges to a small neighborhood of zero by solving the linear matrix inequality. Two challenging deception attack examples in simulations and experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness and performance of the proposed resilient formation control framework},

  abstract     = {This paper analyzes the influence of power and dimension of artificial noise (AN) on security performance of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with multiple randomly located eavesdroppers. We derive the closed-form expressions of the secrecy outage probability (SOP) and the optimal secrecy capacity by utilizing the irrelevance among transmission channels, and the orthogonality between AN and the basis vectors of the legitimate channel matrix&#39;s null space. We use the Poisson point process to determine the number and location of eavesdroppers, then analyze the security performance of the communication system under the 3D channel condition of probability-based line-of-sight (LoS) or non-line-of-sight (NLoS) channel. The simulation results show the following conclusions. When the AN dimension reaches 1/4 highest dimension (i.e., one quarter of the number of transmitting antennae less than one) and the power splitter factor (PSF) falls in the open interval (0.6, 0.9), we can achieve a trade-off between secrecy capacity and design complexity.},

  abstract     = {Among LEO satellites communications, satellite direct connectivity to User Equipment (UE) has drawn much attention for its ability of providing basic emergent services. However, the link budget shortage resulting from long propagation length limits the capacity of communications. Distributed beamforming is a solution that provides high power gain by utilizing multiple transmitters simultaneously. This work presents a novel distributed beamforming scheme for LEO satellites direct connectivity services that can provide high power gain for multiple ground UEs with arbitrary locations and numbers. Firstly, an algorithm is designed for static satellites. By selecting satellites from a set of available ones and optimizing the transmit phases of electromagnetic waves on satellites, all the ground UEs can receive power gains improvement. Furthermore, this work considers satellite motions by proposing a fast algorithm that adjusts phases according to changing satellite locations. Finally, a satellite re-selection process is designed to ensure stable power improvement when satellites become unavailable due to their motions. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our design. For four static satellites and 10 UEs, we examine 20 cases with different satellite and UE locations. Results show that UEs receive an average of at least 7dB power gain in most cases. The condition of four moving satellites is also tested, and results demonstrate that all 10 UEs can have consistent receiving power gain as satellites move quickly.},

Considering the demands of resource-constrained wireless communications and green communications, power-efficient minimum shift keying -type (MSK -type) signals have also been introduced into uplink ANOMA, but they are only for a basic flat fading channel and perfect conditions. In this paper, an uplink ANOMA based on MSK -type signals with imperfect channel state information and successive interference cancellation over generalized fading channels is proposed, and its ergodic capacity is investigated. Specifically, the system model is first established. Then, a moment generating function (MGF)-based ergodic capacity expression applicable to general fading channels with known MGF is derived. Based on the expression, the integral expressions for the ergodic capacity over Rayleigh and Rician fading channels are exactly derived, respectively, and their closed-form expressions are also provided by exploiting the Gauss-Laguerre method. Further, their expressions with perfect conditions, asymptotic expressions at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and high SNR slopes are also derived. The accuracy of the expression is verified by numerical and simulation results. It also shows the superiority of the proposed scheme over conventional OMA and ANOMA with linear modulation, and the relationship between system performance and time offsets, imperfect conditions, channel differences, and modulation formats.},

Specifically, a time-frequency dual expansion (TFDE) framework, which exploits the channel state information (CSI) containing the entirety of the motion samplings and subcarrier information, is designed to construct a synthetic virtual array with an expanded aperture. With this TFDE framework, two array configurations are proposed and then analyzed, which can generate more virtual elements than the stationary MlMO array. Subsequently, taking into account the issues of parameter coupling, a reduced-complexity multiple signal classification with two-step decoupling (TSD-RC MUSIC) algorithm is pertinently designed to estimate the direction of arrival (DOA) and time of arrival (TOA) of targets while ensuring high estimation accuracy and low complexity.

Due to the interdependence of user association and inter-cell interference in the network, collaborative efforts among individual BSs become imperative. The problem is modeled as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (DEC-POMDP) and a multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) algorithm is proposed to obtain a collaborative BS control policy. Simulation results demonstrate that the obtained policy can significantly improve network energy efficiency, adaptively switch the BSs into different depths of sleep, reduce inter-cell interference, and maintain good QoS compared to the two benchmark algorithms. The results also validate that enabling user offloading among BSs can improve both user QoS and system performance.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel joint weight design scheme for pre/post-coding in multiuser massive multiple-input multiple-output (MU-mMIMO) downlink in time-varying channel environments. It combines Null-Space Expansion (NSE) and Maximum Eigenmode Beamforming (MEB), mainly focusing on user terminals (UTs) with multiple antenna elements. NSE steers additional nulls for interfering UTs using multiple past channel state information (CSI). Since NSE does not predict future channels, it performs excellent interference suppression in high-mobility environments for UTs. However, the limited antenna degrees of freedom (DoF) on the base station (BS) side make it challenging to form nulls effectively for interference suppression in NSE. Therefore, this paper utilizes maximum eigenmode beamforming (MEB). MEB utilizes singular value decomposition (SVD) to form a single stream corresponding to the maximum singular value on the UT side. MEB can supplement the beamforming gain reduction on BS side caused by NSE. Moreover, when a dominant line-of-sight (LoS) component exists in the channel, MEB also performs beamforming for this LoS component on each UT side. Since the LoS component is not highly sensitive to channel fluctuations, the nullification by NSE works more effectively. Computer simulations demonstrate that NSE incorporated with MEB can significantly enhance the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) performance compared to conventional channel prediction-based precoding schemes. Its improvement is particularly notable in high-speed UT movement scenarios. This study presents MEB-NSE as an effective solution for stable multiuser spatial multiplexing in mobility environments.},

  abstract     = {Lane-changing decisions, which are crucial for autonomous vehicle path planning, face practical challenges due to rule-based constraints and limited data. Deep reinforcement learning has become a major research focus due to its advantages in data acquisition and interpretability. However, current models often overlook collaboration, which affects not only impacts overall traffic efficiency but also hinders the vehicle&#39;s own normal driving in the long run. To address the aforementioned issue, this paper proposes a method named Mix Q-learning for Lane Changing (MQLC) that integrates a hybrid value Q network, taking into account both collective and individual benefits for the greater good. At the collective level, our method coordinates the individual Q and global Q networks by utilizing global information. This enables agents to effectively balance their individual interests with the collective benefit. At the individual level, we integrate a deep learning-based intent recognition module into our observation and enhance the decision network. These changes provide agents with richer decision information and more precise feature extraction for improved lane-changing decisions. This strategy enables the multi-agent system to learn and formulate optimal decision-making strategies effectively. Our MQLC model, through extensive experimental results, impressively outperforms other state-of-the-art multi-agent decision-making methods, effectively improving the overall efficiency.},

This study introduces a novel, privacy-preserving robust SOH estimation for heterogeneous batteries using customized federated learning (FL). The approach aggregates local SOH models into a global model while preserving data privacy at the source. It leverages statistical and system utility indicators for battery management system client selection, incorporating the Epsilon-Greedy method to dynamically include new clients and adjust the participant count based on global model efficacy. Additionally, a performance-discrepancy weighted aggregation mechanism is designed by using the L2 distance and loss indices as weights for local models. A discrepancy-based personalization method further refines the number of personalization layers, enhancing local model performance. Through detailed case analysis, the proposed algorithm is shown to surpass conventional FL, centralized, and local training methods across scenarios of varied battery types, data inaccuracies, communication errors, and operational risks, demonstrating superior adaptability and robustness.},

Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal is a mainstream candidate ISAC waveform. However, there are inter-symbol interference (ISI) and inter-carrier interference (ICI) when the round-trip delay exceeds the cyclic prefix (CP) duration for OFDM signals, which limits the maximum sensing range of ISAC system. When detecting a long-range target, the wide beam inevitably covers the close-range target, of which the echo&#39;s power is much larger than that of the long-range target. In order to tackle the above problem, a multiple signal classification (MUSIC) and least squares (LS)-based spatial signal separation method is proposed to separate the echo signals reflected from different targets. Moreover, a coherent compensation-based sensing signal processing method at the receiver is proposed to enhance the signal to interference plus noise power ratio (SINR) of the OFDM block for generating the range-Doppler map (RDM) with higher SINR. Simulation results reveal that the proposed method greatly enhances the SINR of RDM by 10 dB for a target at 500 m compared with two-dimensional fast Fourier transform (2D-FFT) method. Besides, the detection probability is also significantly improved compared to the benchmarking method.},

The purpose of cache scheduling in VANETs is to provide efficient and fast data services to vehicles. In response to difficult to handle wireless communication interference and high requirements for communication delay and energy consumption optimization in vehicle-road cooperation, we propose a new communication model of “Retrieving-Cast” to simplify the cache scheduling process oriented by data requirements. In V2I mode, consider the uplink of all roadside units(RSUs) retrieving data from vehicles, and prioritize data retrieving based on factors such as the number, density, and urgency of vehicles within the communication coverage range of RSUs. We hope that as many high-priority RSUs as possible to complete cached data retrieving as soon as possible under wireless communication interference. To overcome the limitations of traditional heuristic algorithms with low scheduling efficiency and deep learning methods requiring a large amount of training data, we propose a double-$\varepsilon$ online reinforcement learning method, which efficiently solves the cache retrieval scheduling problem. Through experiments and analysis, our method achieved better scheduling results compared to traditional approximation algorithms and single $\varepsilon$-greedy Deep Q-learning methods. The designed data transformation method also addresses the issue of requiring a large amount of training data, enabling rapid computation of scheduling requests in the network at an extremely low training cost, meeting the low-latency computation requirements in VANETs.},

Secondly, the signal and noise in the radar&#39;s received echo are separated using this 0-1 threshold, leading to the proposal of a 0-1 non-coherent binary accumulation imaging method.

  abstract     = {Deep-learning (DL)-based channel state information (CSI) feedback has attracted a great deal of attention due to its effectiveness in compressing CSI in massive multiple-input multiple-output systems. This technique harnesses an autoencoder architecture, where an encoder network transforms CSI into a low-dimensional latent vector, and a decoder network reconstructs the CSI from the latent vector. In this paper, we propose a vector quantization (VQ) framework for DL-based CSI feedback to provide an efficient finite-bit representation of the latent vector. In our framework, a trainable VQ module is employed after the encoder network, and entropy coding is applied to the output of the VQ module. To jointly train the encoder and decoder networks with the VQ codebook, we design a quantization criterion and loss function of vector-quantized variational autoencoder based on the rate-distortion theory. We also devise two practical strategies to make the proposed framework applicable under a strict bit budget constraint. Using simulations, we demonstrate that DL-based CSI feedback with the proposed framework outperforms existing quantization-aware DL-based CSI feedback methods.},

  abstract     = {With the application of 5 G in in-vehicle network scenarios, the inevitable crisis of scarcity of communication resources is deepening. At the same time, considering the high demands for communication delay in vehicular network scenarios, it is essential to meet the requirements for reliable information transmission in high-speed mobility environments. To address these issues, we propose the Task-Centric Multi-User Semantic Communication (TCMSC) solution, designed to meet the energy consumption and transmission time delay requirements in line with the new paradigm of semantic communication. Our solution introduces a task-centric semantic processing model aimed at improving Semantic Spectral Efficiency (S-SE). The TCMSC solution is tailored for multi-service vehicle scenarios, optimizing power consumption and enhancing reliability, making it well-suited for challenging environments. Moreover, we propose a novel method using Stochastic Network Calculus (SNC) to accurately model semantic task delay and calculate the upper bound of Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) delay-bound violation probability. However, to tackle the increased optimization complexity from SNC while simultaneously enhancing feature extraction, we propose the Transformer Advantage Actor Critic (TR-A2C) algorithm. This algorithm leverages the Transformer to capture dynamic vehicle parameters across scenarios, accelerating the TCMSC solution. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional single-service vehicle dispatch, TCMSC improves delay violation probability by ${2.88\%}$ and reduces power consumption by ${31.1\%}$, all while effectively enhancing S-SE in complex traffic environments.},

Our objectives are to minimize the number of active FBSs, reduce overlapping coverage areas, and increase data rates for SGUs. We formulate this as a multi-objective, non-convex Non-Linear Mixed Integer Programming (NLMIP) problem, incorporating both deployment and resource allocation practical constraints. To manage the problem&#39;s complexity, we decompose it into two sub-problems: FBS deployment and resource allocation optimization. To optimize the 2D deployment of FBSs in horizontal space, we propose a general, low-complexity heuristic method based on a statistical variant of the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm, named Evolutionary Bayesian SOM (EBSOM). Then, utilizing a Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) communication scheme between FBSs and SGUs, we maximize the downlink sum rate while adhering to constraints on FBS positions, transmission power, and bandwidth availability. In this stage, the deployment of FBSs is further refined to enhance resource allocation by dividing the problem into two non-convex sub-problems, which are solved iteratively using Surrogate Optimization (SO). Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy, particularly in reducing the number of active FBSs, minimizing overlapping areas, and improving network sum rates.},

  abstract     = {Beyond 5 G and 6 G networks are expected to support new and challenging use cases and applications that depend on a certain level of Quality of Service (QoS) to operate smoothly. Predicting the QoS in a timely manner is of high importance, especially for safety-critical applications as in the case of vehicular communications. Although until recent years the QoS prediction has been carried out by centralized Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, a number of privacy, computational, and operational concerns have emerged. Alternative solutions have surfaced (e.g. Split Learning, Federated Learning), distributing AI tasks of reduced complexity across nodes, while preserving the privacy of the data. However, new challenges rise when it comes to scalable distributed learning approaches, taking into account the heterogeneous nature of future wireless networks. The current work proposes DISTINQT, a novel multi-headed input privacy-aware distributed learning framework for QoS prediction. Our framework supports multiple heterogeneous nodes, in terms of data types and model architectures, by sharing computations across them. This enables the incorporation of diverse knowledge into a sole learning process that will enhance the robustness and generalization capabilities of the final QoS prediction model. DISTINQT also contributes to data privacy preservation by encoding any raw input data into highly complex, compressed, and irreversible latent representations before any transmission. Evaluation results showcase that DISTINQT achieves a statistically identical performance compared to its centralized version, while also proving the validity of the privacy preserving claims. DISTINQT manages to achieve a reduction in prediction error of up to 65% on average against six state-of-the-art centralized baseline solutions presented in the Tele-Operated Driving use case.},

Unlike existing transmission schemes that treat the channel as invariant, this work proposes to actively adjust the radiation power of each scattering path of the wireless channel by adjusting the radiation pattern of the transmit array, thereby removing the limitations that communications can only adapt to the wireless channel passively. We separate the optimization into two stages. In the first stage, an optimization problem on the channel matrix aimed at maximizing the worst user&#39;s quality-of service (QoS) without investing additional signal power is formulated. Given the non-convex nature of the formulated problem, we design an alternating optimization algorithm, and obtain the channel covariance matrix that achieves optimal performance for each transmission symbol slot. This structure, proven to be optimal, provides key theoretical insights into the ideal channel conditions for symbol-level precoding (SLP). In the second stage, we propose the radiation pattern design in reconfigurable MU-MISO communication systems, where communication channels are jointly decided by the radiation pattern of the transmit array and the physical propagation channel, aligning the practical pattern channel with the theoretical optimal channel. Numerical results verify the superiority of the proposed SLCPO scheme in PR MU-MISO systems in terms of error rate over state-of-the-art.},

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of accurately localizing $N$ unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in 3D space where the UAVs are part of a swarm and communicate with each other through orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) modulated signals. The OTFS communication system operates in the delay-Doppler domain and can simultaneously provide range and velocity information about the scatterers in the channels at no additional cost. Each receiving UAV estimates the multipath wireless channel on each link formed by the line-of-sight (LoS) transmission and by the single reflections from the remaining $N{-}2$ UAVs. The estimated channel delay profiles are communicated to an edge server to estimate the location and velocity of the UAVs from the relative echo delay (RED) measurements between the LoS and the non-LoS paths. To accurately obtain such estimations, we propose a solution called Turbo Iterative Positioning (TIP), initialized by a belief-propagation approach. Enabling a full cold start (no prior knowledge of initial positions), the belief propagation first provides a map associating each echo to a reflecting UAV. The localization of the $N$ UAVs is then derived by iteratively alternating a gradient descent optimization and a refinement of the association maps between UAVs and echos. Given that the OTFS receivers also acquire the Doppler shifts of each path, the UAV&#39;s velocities can be sensed jointly with communication. Our numerical results, obtained also using real-world traces, show how the multipath links are beneficial to achieving very accurate position and velocity for all UAVs, even with a limited delay-Doppler resolution. The robustness of our scheme is proven by its performance approaching the Cramér-Rao bound.},

However, state-of-the-art grant-free massive NOMA schemes for mMIMO systems require accurate estimation of random access channels to perform activity detection and the following coherent data demodulation, which suffers from excessive pilot overhead and access latency. To address this, we propose a pre-equalization aided grant-free massive access scheme for mMIMO systems, where an iterative detection scheme is conceived. Specifically, the base station (BS) firstly activates one of its antennas (i.e., beacon antenna) to broadcast a beacon signal, which facilitates the user equipment (UEs) to perform downlink channel estimation and pre-equalize the uplink random access signal with respect to the channels associated with the beacon antenna. During the uplink transmission stage, the BS detects UEs&#39; activity and data by using the proposed iterative detection algorithm, which consists of three modules: coarse data detection (DD), data-aided channel estimation (CE), and fine DD. In the proposed algorithm, the joint activity and DD is firstly performed based on the signals received by the beacon antenna. Subsequently, the DD is further refined by iteratively performing data-aided CE module and fine DD module using signals received by all BS antennas. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms state-of-the-art mMIMO-based grant-free massive NOMA schemes with the same access latency.},

The performance metrics for the link, including the average bit error rate (BER), outage probability and ergodic capacity are formulated and employed to assess the performance of inter-orbital ISC at THz band. Simulation results demonstrate that an increase in the variance of the beam misalignment angle reduces the accuracy of the ISC link, resulting in a higher average BER and outage probability.

With tunable reflection phase shifts, RIS can improve the mmWave channel conditions. However, the degrees of freedom of mmWave RISs are limited by hardware constraints, often restricted to only 1-bit phase control, which significantly increases the difficulty of beam synthesis. In this paper, a generic framework is proposed for arbitrary beam pattern synthesis for mmWave RIS with discrete phase shifts, which is divided into two stages. Specifically, an initial solution is obtained by applying the principles of segmentation and superposition. Subsequently, an iterative optimization algorithm is employed after quantization to refine the discrete phase shifts for improved performance. Given target beam requirements, simulations demonstrate the ability of the proposed algorithm to synthesize any expected beam pattern. Finally, the obtained phase coding is experimentally validated on a fabricated mmWave RIS through a measurement campaign, confirming the practicability and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Long Range (LoRa)-based wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs) have attracted much attention due to their long-range communication capability and easiness of deployment. Since it is difficult to replace batteries in buried end nodes, energy efficiency (EE) needs to be improved to extend the lifespan. As link quality is closely related to LoRa physical layer (PHY) parameters and soil characteristics, it is necessary to carefully configure parameters to maintain reliable connectivity and high EE in the dynamic underground environment. To this end, we propose EnergySaver, which utilizes soil moisture to estimate the underground path loss, derives signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to characterize the packet delivery rate (PDR), and finally calculates EE. The combination that maximizes EE is the best configuration for current channel state. In addition, for the case of densely deployed buried LoRa nodes, we propose a low-complexity collision decoding scheme in EnergySaver that utilizes packet time offsets to decompose concurrent transmissions. The simulation results confirm that EnergySaver improves EE by at least two times without sacrificing high link quality, and effectively reduces packet loss during concurrent data transmission with excellent scalability.},

The algorithm optimizes the sigmoid function by introducing the $\alpha$ parameter and combines it with the $L_{2}$ constraint, which accelerates the convergence speed when color signals are input to the system, and enhances the robustness to impulse interference. Through theory analysis and simulation experiments, the superior performance for our constructed $\alpha$SAP in dealing with highly correlated input signals and impulse disturbances, as well as its advantages in ensuring stability and minimizing the steady-state excess-mean-square-error (EMSE) are demonstrated. Simulated results obtained from the in-car echo-cancellation and channel-estimation show that the $\alpha$SAP algorithm outperforms the commonly used AP algorithms under different impulse interferences and provides better tracking performance at the same time.},

Different from the conventional LPI waveform design strategies, the cyclic frequency sidelobe level (CFSL) is adopted as the LPI performance metric. We also employ the integrated sidelobe level (ISL) optimization to improve the sensing performance. Consequently, a new LPI ISAC waveform design is proposed with the objective of minimizing the weighted sum of the CFSL and ISL under the constraints of energy budget and peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR), as well as the similarity constraint to assure the communication quality. Then, to further enhance the sensing capability, a joint design of the transmit waveform and radar receive filter is proposed. As the formulated schemes require solving high-dimensional non-convex problems, efficient algorithms based on the majorization-minimization (MM) and alternating iteration are respectively developed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed schemes is verified by simulation experiments.},

The key challenge involves how to efficiently execute tasks offloaded from IoT devices, given limited on-board computation capabilities of UAVs and delay constraints of tasks. To address it, UAVs are first allowed to adjust their trajectories to accommodate as many tasks as possible from IoT devices. Subsequently, UAVs compute a portion of these tasks while delegating the rest to LEO satellites for further execution. Accordingly, we formulate a joint optimization problem including UAV trajectory planning, task offloading, and bandwidth allocations, aiming to maximize the long-term energy efficiency of UAVs and LEO satellites (i.e., the total data size in computation offloading divided by energy consumption of UAVs and LEO satellites). Considering the interactions among intelligent UAVs, this problem is reformulated as a set of interconnected multi-agent stochastic games, and the existence of corresponding Nash Equilibrium (NE) is theoretically proved. To obtain the NE, a multi-agent reinforcement learning-based algorithm, namely UTPTR, is developed concerning system dynamics and uncertainties. Simulations evaluate the performance of the UTPTR and demonstrate its superiority compared to existing approaches.},

However, the limited radio frequency communication range necessitates the dense deployment of communication infrastructures to accommodate the increasing number of connected vehicles and data traffic. This could lead to growing equipment and energy costs, hindering the full realization of the VEC system. To address such limitations, we introduce a double roadside reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted VEC network in this paper, where RISs are deployed inside the coverage gaps between two RSUs to extend the service range. The research goal is to maximize the sum offloading efficiency by jointly optimizing offloading decisions, computation resource allocation, and phase shift vectors of RISs. Since the original problem is a challenging mixed-integer non-linear problem (MINLP), we decompose it into a top-problem for optimizing offloading destinations and phase shift vectors, and a sub-problem for optimizing offloading ratios and computation resources. We propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm for quickly obtaining near-optimal offloading decisions and phase shift vectors, alongside a Dinkelbach-based method for obtaining optimal offloading ratios and computation resource allocation. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm achieves near-optimal performance compared to other benchmarks and enables real-time decision-making.},

Motivated by this, we consider PAPR constraints in RIS-assisted UAV-enabled ISAC system. An optimization for joint beamforming and RIS phase-shift matrices design is established, with the goal of minimizing the weighted sum of the multiuser interference (MUI) for communication and sensing beam pattern mismatch (BPM), subject to PAPR constraints, power constraints, ideal beam direction approximation constraints, and constant mode constraints on the phase-shift matrices. To tackle this non-convex problem, a multivariate cyclic iterative alternating-direction multiplier method (MCI-ADMM) is adopted to decouple the original problem into three sub-problems regarding three variables. Some mathematical techniques are adopted to solve these sub-problems, including augmented lagrangian, constraint reconstruction method based on orthogonal Procrustes problem, manifold optimization, quadratic representation, and variable substitution. The experimental results show inherent trade-offs between dual functionalities under PAPR constraints. In addition, the consideration of PAPR performs better system performance compared with baselines. Also, the stability and reliability under different parameters settings are verified.},

  abstract     = {Low-cost reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are being considered as promising physical-layer technology for next-generation wireless networks due to their ability to re-engineer the propagation environment by tuning their elements. Although RIS-aided systems have many advantages, one of their major bottlenecks is that they can provide coverage only in front of the surface. Fortunately, simultaneous transmitting and reflecting surface (STARS)-assisted systems have emerged to fill this gap by providing $ 360^{\circ }$ wireless coverage. In parallel, full-duplex (FD) communication offers a higher achievable rate through efficient spectrum utilization compared to the half-duplex (HD) counterpart. Moreover, two-way/bi-directional communications in an FD system can further enhance the system&#39;s spectral efficiency. Hence, in this paper, we propose a STARS-enabled massive MIMO deployment in an FD two-way communication network for highly efficient spectrum utilization, while covering the dead zones around the STARS. This model enables simultaneous information exchange between multiple nodes, while potentially doubling the spectral efficiency (SE). By invoking the use-and-then-forget (UaTF) combining scheme, we derive a closed-form expression for an achievable SE at each user of the system considering both uplink and downlink communications based on statistical channel state information (CSI), while also accounting for imperfect CSI and correlated fading conditions. Moreover, we formulate an optimization problem to obtain an optimal passive beamforming matrix design at the STARS that maximizes the sum achievable SE. The considered problem is non-convex and we propose a provably-convergent low-complexity algorithm, termed as projected gradient ascent method (ProGrAM), to obtain a stationary solution. Extensive numerical results are provided to establish the performance superiority of the FD STARS-enabled system over the HD STARS-enabled and FD conventional RIS (cRIS)-enabled counterparts, and also to show the effect of different parameters of interest on the system performance.},

  abstract     = {Radio frequency fingerprint (RFF) technology has emerged as a prominent research direction within the field of wireless security because it uses the distinctive hardware characteristics of individual devices for identity authentication. In the context of the Gaussian Filtered Minimum Shift Keying (GMSK) modulation mode, this research introduces an RFF identification framework centered on the analysis of eye diagram, and proposes an RFF feature extraction method based on eye diagram traces deviation (EDTD). In practical applications, considering that the presence of synchronization errors leads to the divergence of the eye diagram traces (EDT) obtained through baseband demodulation, a frame folding synchronization algorithm is proposed, which enhances the generation of the EDT. The eye diagram traces density plot generated from EDT is further utilized to obtain the probability density curve with peak clustering characteristics. Furthermore, recognizing the significance of the time-bandwidth product ($BT$) in shaping the GMSK baseband signal eye diagram, a $BT$ parameter estimation algorithm based on probability density curves is proposed, and then an inversion calculation is applied to attain the ideal EDT. By scrutinizing the statistical attributes of the EDTD, which represents the disparity between the measured signal&#39;s EDT and the theoretically ideal EDT derived through inversion, a 27-dimensional RFF feature vector is constructed. This feature vector is combined with a lightweight classifier to accomplish the task of wireless device identification. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, two types of devices utilizing GMSK modulation methods were used to construct separate datasets, which are marine automatic identification system (AIS) devices and internet of things (IoT) modules utilizing the global system for mobile (GSM) communications technology. And it was tested and compared with intelligent feature extraction methods based on deep learning. The results show that with only 150 training samples per device, our solution can achieve $99\%$ identification accuracy for AIS devices composed of independent radio frequency circuits, and over $80\%$ for GSM IoT devices composed of integrated circuits.},

However, most existing works only consider invariant channel parameters without jitter during the movement of RIS, which is unrealistic. This paper proposes a more practical unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted RIS-assisted communication scheme, where an elevation angle-dependent 3D channel model with UAV jitter is established and the max-min rate problem is effectively solved. Specifically, modeling the Rician factors and the path loss exponents as functions of 3D elevation angles, we reestablish an A2G channel model suitable for 3D reflections containing angular deviations caused by UAV jitter. Furthermore, by rigorously dealing with the difficulties caused by angle dependence, an innovative algorithm is designed for static/mobile RIS-UAV scheme via the joint optimization of BS beamforming, RIS coefficients, and UAV 3D position/trajectory. Additionally, in mobile RIS-UAV scheme, we extra develop a fast algorithm for solving the 0–1 binary integer scheduling factor, which first approximates the solution and then precisely reconstructs it.

However, the existing task offloading schemes still have various gaps and face challenges that should be addressed because task offloading problems are usually multi-objective optimization problems (MOOP) and NP-hard problems. In this respect, we formulate a new multi-objective model for vehicle-centered task offloading tacking into account the queuing and computing processes of tasks. The minimization of the average delay time, average energy consumption, and average payment cost for each vehicle is defined as a MOOP. We propose an efficient collaborative offloading approach based on task triage strategy and multi-objective optimization to address the model. Specifically, this approach can be decomposed into two stages. First, a task triage strategy is developed based on a comprehensive analysis of task urgency and task criticality to make offloading decisions for triaged tasks with extreme characteristics. Then, we propose a novel multi-objective optimization framework for the MOOP. Finally, we develop a multi-objective hybrid genetic algorithm that integrates the associative learning immediate memory strategy and genetic operations to solve the MOOP. Extensive experiments and performance evaluations based on real-world traces of taxis demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results indicate that the approach outperforms six other well-known multi-objective algorithms in solving the MOOP.},

  abstract     = {The vehicular Metaverse represents an emerging paradigm that merges vehicular communications with virtual environments, integrating real-world data to enhance in-vehicle services. However, this integration faces critical security challenges, particularly in the data collection layer where malicious sensing IoT (SIoT) devices can compromise service quality through data poisoning attacks. The security aspects of the Metaverse services should be well addressed both when creating the digital twins of the physical systems and when delivering the virtual service to the vehicular Metaverse users (VMUs). This paper introduces vehicular Metaverse guard (VMGuard), a novel four-layer security framework that protects vehicular Metaverse systems from data poisoning attacks. Specifically, when the virtual service providers (VSPs) collect data about physical environment through SIoT devices in the field, the delivered content might be tampered. Malicious SIoT devices with moral hazard might have private incentives to provide poisoned data to the VSP to degrade the service quality (QoS) and user experience (QoE) of the VMUs. The proposed framework implements a reputation-based incentive mechanism that leverages user feedback and subjective logic modeling to assess the trustworthiness of participating SIoT devices. More precisely, the framework entails the use of reputation scores assigned to participating SIoT devices based on their historical engagements with the VSPs. These scores are calculated from feedback provided by the VMUs to the VSPs regarding the content they receive and are managed utilizing a subjective logic model. Ultimately, we validate our proposed model using comprehensive simulations.

  abstract     = {In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications, beam management is of vital importance for establishing and maintaining a directional link between a base station (BS) and multi-UAVs. However, it is challenging to acquire an actual angle of arrival (AoA) due to the Doppler frequency offset (DFO) caused by the mobility of UAV in high-speed. To deal with this challenge, we propose the two stage beam management consisting of beam training and beam tracking. In first phase, DFT beam training is proposed, especially with a phase rotation matrix to extract the actual AoA information by eliminating the DFO term. In second phase, Kalman filter (KF) beam tracking is proposed with monopulse signal to reduce the linearization loss. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme accurately estimates the actual AoA during beam training phase and is well tracking the AoA in high-speed scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Modern vehicular applications heavily rely on accurate Position, Velocity, and Timing (PVT) information provided by the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). However, the vulnerability of GNSS to spoofing attacks presents a significant threat to vehicle safety and efficiency. Rapid detection of spoofing attacks is thus vital for ensuring the security of vehicular navigation. Among existing methods, Doppler shift emerges as a typical means of spoofing detection in vehicular applications, as the anomalous Doppler bias associated with the user&#39;s real state serves as a distinctive indicator of spoofing. Conventional approaches, however, focus on directly observing Doppler bias, which remains embedded within raw measurements and necessitates additional complexities, thereby limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, we introduce Doppler-based Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (D-RAIM) as a practical method for GNSS spoofing detection in vehicular applications. In contrast to direct monitoring methods, D-RAIM indirectly detects spoofing by assessing the impact of Doppler bias on Doppler positioning integrity. Operating without the need for external sensors, D-RAIM performs integrity monitoring by leveraging residuals derived from Doppler positioning equations, offering a flexible approach for standalone GNSS receivers. Through simulation experiments and field tests, we validate the effectiveness of D-RAIM, demonstrating its broader applicability and robustness compared to previous methods. Overall, the proposed D-RAIM method offers a practical solution for GNSS spoofing detection in vehicular applications, characterized by its flexibility, robustness, and wider applicability in enhancing vehicular navigation security.},

The proposed STBC-SI-DCSK scheme also demonstrates superior BER performance in ultra-wide bandwidth (UWB) channels while simplifying the permutation operation.

By exploiting the amplifying capability of active RISs, noticeable performance improvement can be expected when precise channel state information (CSI) is available. Since obtaining perfect CSI related to an RIS is difficult in practice, a robust transmission design is proposed in this paper to tackle the channel uncertainty issue, which will be more severe for active RIS-aided systems. To account for the worst-case scenario, the minimum achievable rate of each user is derived under a statistical CSI error model. Subsequently, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the sum of the minimum achievable rate. Since the objective function is non-concave, the formulated problem is transformed into a tractable lower bound maximization problem, which is solved using an alternating optimization method. Numerical results show that the proposed robust design outperforms a baseline scheme that only exploits estimated CSI.},

To avoid high-cost channel estimation, the phase shifting of the RIS is designed only based on the channel state information of the cascaded backscatter channel which is easy to obtain. Outage probabilities of the backscatter device (BD) and the ambient transmission, both in parasitic and commensal modes, are derived based on Lyapunov&#39;s theorem and Hermite-Gauss quadrature. Simulation results illustrate that the BD outage performance is highly sensitive to the number of RIS reflection elements ($N$) both in parasitic and commensal modes. When $N$ is sufficiently large, its further increment has little impact on the outage probability of the ambient system, although the phase shift is designed merely to enhance the BD transmission. It also offers a guideline in coordinating $N$ with the ambient transmit power to balance between the outage performance of the ambient system and that of the backscatter system.},

Specifically, the minimum secrecy capacity of users is maximized by optimizing time allocation, transmit power, local computation CPU frequency, IRS phase shifts, and UAV trajectory while satisfying users&#39; task processing capacity requirements. To address the non-convex optimization problem, we first employ mathematical techniques to simplify it into a more tractable form, and subsequently decompose it into several sub-problems.

This paper proposes a new method to calculate the I/N of large-scale non-geostationary orbit constellation. By modeling large-scale constellation as uniformly distributed in space, Fibonacci grid method is used to calculate satellite position coordinate. In addition, equivalent number of satellites is defined to take into account the number of visible satellites at different latitudes.

Moreover, the design of analog and digital beamformers is formulated as the problem of minimizing transmit power while satisfying the constraints of sensing beampattern and secrecy rate. To solve the non-convex problem, semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques are employed to transform the original problem and obtain the solution. For the scenario with imperfect CSI, the robust hybrid beamforming is designed based on S-procedure. Additionally, to optimally utilize spatial domain resources provided by multiple antennas, a dynamic subarray architecture is introduced, along with two dynamic subarray partitioning algorithms. This flexible architecture can be dynamically adjusted according to the CSI, ensuring a bidirectional alignment with the actual channels and the proposed scheme. Specifically, the greedy algorithm and the secrecy rate increment maximization (SRIM) algorithm are designed to partition the dynamic subarray, and the alternating optimization is utilized to further improve the quality of the solution. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an adaptive anti-jamming resource allocation scheme to address both external malicious jamming and internal interference in dynamic multi-user communication environments. The scheme assesses jamming levels through a module based on average channel quality indicator (CQI) and adaptively selects the appropriate anti-jamming policies by utilizing the resouces of power-domain, frequency-domain, or a combination of power-frequency domain. This approach overcomes the limitations of fixed-domain policies in dynamic and complex jamming scenarios. To optimize resource allocation, a discrete soft actor-critic (DSAC) algorithm with an adjustable temperature coefficient is employed, addressing sample inefficiencies in traditional actor-critic methods and enhancing policy robustness. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme improves convergence speed under intelligent jamming (IJ) by 55%, 62%, 65%, 75%, and 60% compared to trusted region policy optimization (TRPO), deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), proximal policy optimization (PPO), deep reinforcement learning with dual action network (DRL-DAN) and soft actor critic with fixed temperature coefficient (SAC-FTC)-based schemes, respectively. The scheme achieves evasion rates of 99% against periodic comb jamming (PCJ), 98.7% against sweep jamming (SJ), 95% against combined jamming (CJ), and 90.8% against IJ. When the jammer alternates between regular jamming (RJ) and IJ, the proposed scheme responds quickly, demonstrating robustness in dynamic jamming environments.},

By exploiting the upcoming signal-phase-and-timing information of multiple traffic lights via vehicle connectivity technologies, a connected car optimizes the speed trajectory, leading to reduced stops in the dilemma zone compared to the vehicles that strictly comply with traffic rules. As a result, it is observed that connected cars could pass through multiple traffic lights when the green or yellow signals are turned on, resulting in the minimization of the entire trip time. The proposed method is comprehensively verified through simulations under various situations, and, the behavior of the connected cars is observed similar to that of experienced human drivers, particularly in the dilemma zone.

In the vehicular metaverses, Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) technology as a powerful content generation tool, is capable of providing an immersive experience for Vehicular Metaverse Users (VMUs). Due to limited computational resources within vehicles, VMUs rely on AIGC Service Providers (ASPs) to execute resource-intensive AIGC tasks within vehicular metaverses. However, large-scale AIGC service requests can lead to resource scarcity within the ASP, ultimately leading to declining service quality for VMUs. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel Stackelberg game framework utilizing the Generative Diffusion Model (GDM) for AIGC services, in which we experimentally reveal a relationship between image quality and diffusion steps. A Transformer-based Deep Reinforcement Learning (TDRL) algorithm is employed to find the optimal Stackelberg equilibrium under incomplete information. Numerical results indicate that our method converges to equilibrium efficiently, with superior utilities compared to baseline approaches.},

Unlike most existing works, we address both the issues of the IRSs placement and elements allocation. To this end, we first introduce an orthogonal placement strategy to mitigate channel correlation, thereby enabling interference-free multi-stream transmission. Subsequently, we propose a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based approach to jointly optimize the IRS elements and power allocation. Our theoretical analysis unveils that equal IRS elements/power allocation scheme becomes asymptotically optimal as the number of IRS elements and transmit power tend to be infinite. Numerical results demonstrate that when the total number of IRS elements or the power exceeds a certain threshold, a multi-IRS assisted system outperforms a single IRS configuration.},

The array integrates a lower band (LB) antenna with four higher band (HB) antennas. To address the issue of cross-band scattering and its impact on higher band performance, we employ an innovative method that involves reducing the aperture size and incorporating lumped or distributed inductors. These inductors function as frequency-selective structures, permitting low-frequency currents to pass while blocking high-frequency currents. Consequently, at high frequencies, these inductors act as open circuits, making the low-frequency antenna radiator resemble multiple discontinuous small metal strips. This approach achieves an electromagnetic transparent (EMT) bandwidth of over 82.9%, making it highly suitable for mobile base station applications. By integrating this low-scattering LB antenna with four bandwidth-optimized cross dipoles, we achieve a dual-band interleaved array. The measured results confirm that the dual-band array operates effectively within the 0.85-0.98 GHz and 1.4-2.7 GHz frequency ranges, maintaining stable radiation performance. The superior performance of this design makes it an ideal choice for vehicle-based base stations.},

  abstract     = {Reliable intra-platoon communication is critical for safety-related message delivery within a platoon of connected and automated vehicles. However, the intra-platoon communi- cation is challenged by packet collisions due to hidden nodes and merging collisions due to vehicle mobility. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a packet collision avoidance resource selection (PCA-RS) scheme to enhance the standardized SPS scheme. The proposed PCA-RS scheme introduces three enhancement mechanisms, which aims to alleviate merging collisions and hidden-node collisions in intra-platoon message delivery. A resource partition mechanism is introduced to divide frequency-time resources in a selection window into two sets in order for vehicles (both platoon and non-platoon vehicles) moving in opposite directions to select different frequency-time resources and thus avoid potential merging collisions; an intra-platoon cooperative mechanism is introduced to enable the leader of a platoon to know the resource occupation status on the hidden nodes of the platoon according to the messages received from the last platoon member of the same platoon and thus avoid potential hidden-node collisions; and a merging collision detection mechanism is introduced to enable a non-platoon vehicle to detect the status of the frequency-time resources it currently occupies after the non-platoon vehicle changes a lane and thus avoids potential merging collisions among non-platoon vehicles due to lane-change maneuvers. Simulation results demonstrate that compared with the standardized SPS scheme, the proposed PCA-RS scheme can improve the reliability of intra-platoon message delivery in terms of the intra-platoon packet delivery ratio.},

This paper applies the active STARS (ASTARS) to aid in non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) covert communications over cascaded rice fading channels, where two wardens are located on the opposite sides of ASTARS to monitor the transmission information. More specifically, we derive approximate expressions for detection error probability of two wardens. The optimal detection threshold and minimum detection error probability are presented in the worst covert scenarios. The covert transmission rate expressions for a coupe of covert users are further deduced by taking into account imperfect/perfect successive interference cancellation. The experimental simulation results are presented to confirm that: 1) The detection error probability of ASTARS-NOMA networks is superior to that of ASTARS assisted-orthogonal multiple access (ASTARS-OMA) and PSTARS aided NOMA networks; 2) As the number of active elements increases, the covert transmission rates of ASTARS-NOMA networks become larger relative to ASTARS-OMA; and 3) ASTARS-NOMA has ability to provide the enhanced system throughput in delay-tolerant transmission mode.},

Exploiting the near-field beamfocusing capability, a far-to-near successive interference cancellation (SIC) operation is employed to facilitate the secure NOMA communications. Based on this, the trade-off between security and fairness is characterized by maximizing the weighted sum of security capacity and minimum capacity. An alternating optimization based algorithm is developed to solve this highly coupled problem, where RIS beamforming and power allocation are optimized using semidefinite relaxation and successive convex approximation methods, respectively. Numerical results demonstrate: (1) The secure communication for the far user can be achieved in the near field but is impossible in the far field; (2) As the distance between two users increases, the security capacity initially increases and then decreases, while the minimum capacity continuously declines.},

  abstract     = {Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is emerging as a critical enabling technology for 6G communication systems, with increasing attention on dual-functional waveform design to facilitate various applications. Recently developed symbol-level precoding (SLP) demonstrates significant potential for ISAC waveform design due to its superior capacity to enhance both communication and radar sensing capabilities by simultaneously leveraging temporal and spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs). To address the high complexity challenges associated with SLP designs, this paper proposes two efficient deep learning algorithms to tackle the complex SLP-based ISAC waveform design problem. The first algorithm employs a supervised data-driven training strategy that reformulates the original problem as a solvable linear regression issue, while the second algorithm utilizes a gradient-based procedure to fine-tune the trained network, enhancing communication and radar sensing performance. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight SLP-Inception-Net to mitigate computational complexity at the network structural level, incorporating a phase-based activation function to ensure the satisfaction of equality constraints. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our proposed deep learning algorithms achieve comparable communication and sensing performance to optimization-based approaches, while delivering a remarkable 1000-fold reduction in computational complexity in terms of average execution time. Furthermore, they outperform classical learning-based schemes at the same level of floating point operations per second (FLOPs).},

  abstract     = {With the widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), accurately predicting the degradation trajectory of batteries has become crucial to ensure the safe and reliable operation of EVs. In this study, a novel battery degradation trajectory prediction method based on actual EVs operational data is proposed. Firstly, the state of health of the battery is estimated using Coulomb counting methodology, refined through analysis of noise sources and charging pattern, and further denoised through Empirical Mode Decomposition. Moreover, a Transformer-based battery degradation trajectory prediction method is introduced, which demonstrates significantly higher prediction accuracy compared to various existing methods. To address the scarcity of real-world aging data, a data augmentation method based on Variational Auto-encoder (VAE) is proposed. Through data augmentation, diverse and representative battery aging data are generated, enhancing the prediction performance of all neural networks. Following data augmentation, the Transformer still exhibits the lowest Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.5813% and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.7012%. This indicates that the VAE enhances the accuracy and reliability of battery degradation trajectory prediction. Additionally, the high accuracy of the VAE-Transformer in early prediction scenarios is validated. A comprehensive analysis of the resource consumption of the neural networks further demonstrates the high applicability of the proposed method in practical applications.},

We validate the proposed path loss model through extensive non-sequential ray tracing simulations and explore how various system and channel parameters influence path loss. Our findings show that while lateral shifts mainly impact path loss at shorter distances, vertical displacement has a substantial effect over both short and long ranges.

As a promising technology in future communication systems, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been expected to improve the system performance by reconfiguring the propagation environment. In this paper, we investigate a practical aerial RIS-assisted URLLC system in the presence of transceiver hardware impairments where the RIS is mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). We aim to maximize the weighted sum spectral efficiency (WSSE) by jointly optimizing the transmit power, the passive beamforming, and the UAV&#39;s location. As the primal problem is non-convex with coupled variables, the problem is first reformulated by using fractional programming (FP), and decomposed to subproblems with decoupled variables. An alternative optimization (AO) algorithm is then proposed to jointly optimize the passive beamforming, the position of UAV, and transmit power at the IoT devices. Simulation results verify that the proposed robust design can significantly improve the WSSE performance compared to the conventional non-robust scheme. And we reveal hardware impairments at the IoT devices have more impact on WSSE than the control center (CC).},

  abstract     = {Advanced vehicular communication systems extensively employ random access protocols to facilitate massive machine-type communications (MTC) with burst transmissions. Recent investigations have significantly reduced the decoding error rates in MTC. However, for random access, before a receiver decodes a packet, it has to first detect its arrival, since the presence of the packet at a particular point in time is not known beforehand. Packet detection, as opposed to packet decoding, could become a significant bottleneck, especially when considering that the widely used Schmidl-and-Cox (S&amp;C) detection algorithm dates back several decades. This paper re-evaluates the S&amp;C algorithm and presents several key improvements. First, we introduce a new “compensated autocorrelation” packet-detection metric that enables precise analytical expressions of false alarm and missed-detection probabilities, enhancing the rigor of performance assessment. Second, we establish a Pareto comparison principle that allows for a comprehensive and fair evaluation of packet detection algorithms by simultaneously accounting for both false alarms and missed detections. Third, we show that the performance of S&amp;C can be significantly improved by considering only the real component of the autocorrelation, giving rise to a new real-part S&amp;C (RP-S&amp;C) scheme. Fourth, and perhaps most importantly, we leverage the newly introduced compensated autocorrelation to extend the single-antenna S&amp;C algorithm for application in the multi-antenna setting. Two optimization problems, minimizing false-alarm and missed detection probabilities respectively, are formulated and addressed with rigorous solutions. Overall, this study holds considerable implications for the design and deployment of packet-detection schemes in vehicular random-access networks.},

However, in this network setup, the power consumption at TRPs&#39; radio components packed with several antenna elements significantly increases due to the very high processing burden in such a wide bandwidth. A TRP-side DTX method is proposed to avoid overheating issues, which controls the amount of downlink slot transmissions while guaranteeing cell-specific reference signaling. Simulation results considering different DTX settings and traffic loads are presented and discussed. Results show that the considered sub-THz system with the proposed DTX method can provide higher data rates and close to the same spectral efficiency compared to a typical baseline millimeter wave (mmWave) system operating at 28 GHz with 400 MHz bandwidth.

However, in delay-sensitive or high-mobility communications, the rapid movement of vehicles can lead to random scattering in the environment and time-selective fading in the channel. In view of this, we investigate in this paper an innovative linear model with low-complexity transmitter signal design and receiver detection methods, which boost stability in fast-fading environments and reduce channel training overhead. Specifically, considering the differences in hardware design and signal processing at the receiving end between uplink and downlink communication systems, distinct solutions are proposed. Accordingly, we first integrate the Rician channel introduced by the RIS with the corresponding signal processing algorithms to model the RIS-aided downlink communication system as a Doppler-robust linear model. Inspired by this property, we design a precoding scheme based on the linear model to reduce the complexity of precoding. Then, by leveraging the linear model and the large-scale antenna array at the base station (BS) side, we improve the linear model for the uplink communication system and derive its asymptotic performance in closed-form. Simulation results demonstrate the performance advantages of the proposed RIS-aided high-mobility communication system compared to other benchmark schemes.},

The tightness of the UatF bound is, however, ensured in channel environments where the channel hardening manifests. It has been often reported that the channel hardening may not always be strongly observed in some channel environments. In such cases, the UatF bound seriously underestimates rates for users experiencing weak channel hardening. To address the issues associated with the UatF bound, we develop a new lower bound offering a more accurate estimate of the achievable rate for uplink in CF-mMIMO networks regardless of the extent of channel hardening. The claim is substantiated by applying the proposed bound to the joint optimization of power control and large-scale fading decoding (LSFD) coefficients for the design of CF-mMIMO networks on spatially correlated Rician fading channels. To facilitate the optimization, we also develop an approximation of the proposed bound in a more computationally amenable form. We conduct extensive performance evaluations and comparisons for CF-mMIMO networks designed with the proposed and UatF bounds. The comparisons highlight that the design based on the proposed bound leads to considerable performance improvement in the fairness. In addition, for the first time, we reveal with the new lower bound that an widely held belief based on the UatF bound is incorrect.},

While the extended Kalman filter (EKF) remains the predominant nonlinear algorithm in SINS/GNSS integration, it suffers from performance degradation due to covariance inconsistency issues. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel nonlinear state error-based Lie group extended Kalman filter (LG-EKF) for tightly coupled SINS/GNSS integrated navigation. The study first presents a tutorial example illustrating the necessity of transformed nonlinear state error and then provides detailed derivations of LG-EKF equations using both right invariant error (LG-EKF-R) and left invariant error (LG-EKF-L). Through Monte Carlo simulations and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) field tests, the research demonstrates the performance differences in system dynamics between LG-EKF-R and LG-EKF-L. The results indicate that LG-EKF-R, operating at a lower propagation rate, achieves comparable accuracy to LG-EKF-L with a higher propagation rate, offering a more efficient solution for integrated navigation systems.},

We present a distributed event-triggered formation control algorithm via hierarchical framework, which achieves the formation control objective with weak assumptions on switching topologies. In particular, we develop a distributed control force that enables the achievement of the target formation, which only relies on the neighbors&#39; position information under event-triggering mechanism. The proposed algorithm can maintain smooth characteristics when confronted with discontinuities stemming from event-triggering mechanism and switching interactions among agents. Additionally, the boundedness of the command control force can be guaranteed by employing an auxiliary system. Subsequently, we develop an attitude tracking control algorithm to guarantee that the attitude error almost globally exponentially converges to zero. Finally, a numerical example is carried out to validate the theoretical results.},

Aiming at tackling the challenges and solving the remaining limitations of existing works, this paper introduces a novel Schnorr approval-based IoV data aggregation framework based on a two-layered architecture. In this framework, a server can aggregate the IoV data from clusters without inferring the raw data, real identity and trajectories of vehicles. Notably, we avoid incorporating the widely-accepted techniques such as homomorphic encryption and digital pseudonym to avoid introducing high computation cost to vehicles. We propose a novel concept, data approval, based on the Schnorr signature scheme. With the approval, the fake data injection attack carried out by a cluster head can be defended against. The separation of liability is achieved as well. The evaluation shows that the framework is secure and lightweight for vehicles in terms of the computation and communication costs.},

Because the driving information of a vehicle is transmitted via the public channels of VANETs, the driving information is vulnerable to eavesdropping and tampering. Therefore, ensuring the security of VANETs is particularly important. However, most works assume that the environment of roadside units and on-board units is completely safe, which is an unreasonable stance to take as VANETs are evidently vulnerable to privileged user attack and malware attack. In order to solve this weakness and improve the practicability of VANETs, we adopted Confidential Computing technology and proposed a secure authentication scheme. Our scheme adopted decentralized network architecture and achieved dynamic authentication credentials. In addition, we not only proposed a lightweight vehicle-to-infrastructure authentication scheme, but also proposed the vehicle-to-vehicle authentication scheme. We adopted ROR, AVISPA tools and rigorously informal security analysis to prove the security of the proposed scheme. In addition, we analyzed the detailed overheads and adopted NS-3 to conduct the performance analysis.

  abstract     = {Aerial hybrid reconfigurable intelligent surface (AHRIS) -assisted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has recently emerged as a promising candidate for practical deployment in the sixth generation (6G) wireless networks. System design and gain rely heavily on accurately modeling of the underlying channel characteristics, which is challenging due to the high mobility of AHRIS and the unique properties of ISAC. This paper aims to propose a novel three-dimensional (3D) non-stationary geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM) for AHRIS-assisted ISAC systems. Firstly, a novel GBSM considering the non-stationarity caused by the unavoidable jitter of AHRIS and the correlations between sensing and communication channels is proposed. For the former, both the random jitter vector and the jitter factor are introduced to model the impacts of the jitter of AHRIS on its velocity vector. For the latter, the channel characteristics of sensing, including forward scattering and backward scattering, are introduced into the communication channel model, in which the non-line-of-sight (NLoS) transmission are divided into single-clusters scattering and twin-clusters scattering. Then, in order to create a favorable propagation environment and make full use of the channel information sensed by the AHRIS, two AHRIS phase-shift design methods based on sensing channels are proposed. Finally, the impacts of several factors, e.g., the AHRIS speed and jittery, AHRIS phase-shift design methods, AHRIS non-ideality and clusters distribution, on the statistical properties of the proposed channel model are studied, which include the spatial-temporal correlation function (STCF), Doppler power spectral density (PSD) and spectral efficiency. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model can accurately capture the channel characteristics, thus providing valuable insights for the future deployment of AHRIS-assisted ISAC systems.},

Based on this power, we propose a pair of solution approaches: convex optimization-based iteration (CObI) and heuristics-based semi-analytic iteration (HbSAI). The former focuses on achieving high performance while the latter emphasizes efficiency. The effectiveness of both CObI and HbSAI methods is validated through simulation results, demonstrating their ability to enhance the achievable secrecy rate.},

As automation technologies evolve, the requirements for higher accuracy, reliability, energy efficiency, rapid updates, and minimal latency in position estimation have intensified. In this paper, we propose the exploitation of backscattering from retro-directive antenna arrays (RAAs) to address these imperatives. Two RAA-based architectures are introduced and evaluated for a range of applications, including network localization and navigation. These architectures enable swift and simple angle-of-arrival estimation by using signals backscattered from RAAs. They also leverage multiple antennas to capitalize on multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) gains, thereby addressing the challenges posed by the inherent path loss in backscatter communication, particularly at high frequencies. This approach enables angle-based localization with remarkably low latency, making it suitable for vehicular applications. To achieve this, ad-hoc signaling and processing schemes are developed and their performance is analytically assessed. Numerical results highlight the potential of these schemes, delivering precise, ultra-low-latency localization with low-complexity, energy-efficient devices.},

Therefore, we develop vehicle-assisted mobile edge computing (VAMEC), integrating MEC and vehicle computing to maximize their advantages and broaden their applications. We address the resource allocation and pricing problem in VAMEC, in which the vehicle, as a resource provider, collaborates with the MEC servers to provide services to users. To enable MEC servers and vehicles to work in cooperation, we propose a mixed auction model that consists of two-step auctions: the first one-way auction and the second double auction. We consider three types of users based on their characteristics, where users participate in different auctions depending on the types. Users and vehicles are self-interested and may submit untrue values to harm the system&#39;s profits. Therefore, we propose the overall truthfulness for the mixed auction model, that is users or vehicles that cannot obtain higher utility by declaring untrue values regardless of which auction they participate in. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study proposing the overall truthfulness and showing how to design the mechanism that achieves it. We then propose an overall truthfulness mechanism and show it achieves individual rationality, budget balance, and consumer sovereignty. Simulation results indicate that the proposed mechanism can increase social welfare by at least 24%, compared with other mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {Recently, Federated Learning (FL) has been advanced for Vehicular Crowdsensing (VCS), termed F-VCS, to enable collaborative learning without sharing private data, thus promoting privacy. However, the mobility of Intelligent Connected Vehicles (ICVs) leads to dynamic changes among FL participants, becoming one of the main challenges limiting F-VCS performance, as these dynamics can affect model training stability and accuracy. Current research primarily addresses these dynamics through ICV selection and resource optimization mechanisms. However, due to the lack of an effective method for characterizing ICV mobility, these approaches often rely on making binary judgments based on certain constraints (e.g., learning delay) rather than comparing the ICVs&#39; mobility characteristics. As a result, they may not yield the most efficient outcomes for adapting to vehicular network dynamics, affecting overall system performance. This paper introduces a Grid-Assisted FL framework for VCS, named VCS_GAFL, which measures ICV mobility using a grid-cell model. Unlike traditional binary selection methods, our approach utilizes participation probabilities to capture the mobility differences among individual ICVs, guiding more precise and effective ICV selection and enhancing the VCS system&#39;s overall performance and adaptability. Specifically, we introduce an MMP-V model to predict ICV participation probabilities in F-VCS tasks. We then derive expressions for the impact of ICV participation probabilities on expected FL loss and ineffective energy consumption and formulate an optimization problem to jointly optimize ICV participation probabilities, wireless resource allocation, and ICV selection to minimize these impacts. By solving this problem, we derive a closed-form solution for wireless resource allocation and propose a probability-guided ICV selection strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that VCS_GAFL significantly enhances global accuracy, highlighting its potential and value in improving F-VCS services.},

For a UAV mounted with directional antennas, its tilting effect has a crucial impact on the communication performance, which is however ignored in the related studies. In this paper, we first characterize the relationship between the tilting effect of the UAV and its flight status based on force analysis. Then, we investigate a UAV-enabled downlink communication system, where the UAV, equipped with a directional antenna, provides communication services to ground users (GUs). We formulate an energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem that optimizes the UAV trajectory under the consideration of the tilting effect. The formulated problem is challenging to solve due to the complicated expressions of the directional antenna radiation pattern and the adopted propulsion energy consumption model of the UAV. To tackle this, by utilizing the successive convex approximation technique, we propose an approximate antenna radiation pattern that serves as a convex lower bound of the original antenna gain, and develop an efficient algorithm to obtain a suboptimal solution. Simulation results show that the negative impact of the tilting effect on the EE can be efficiently mitigated and the UAV flight can be made more steady under the tilting effect. In addition, the proposed algorithm allows the UAV to achieve a substantially higher EE compared to the benchmark schemes.},

Among them, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication and millimeter-wave (mmW) technology play important roles. UAV communication requires high-gain, wide-angle coverage, and flexible beam-steering antenna arrays. In this paper, we propose a compact antenna array with wide coverage and beam steering capability for mmW applications. The array is composed of three layers and fed through substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) with three ports. The antenna features a simple, horizontally symmetrical structure. By independently exciting each of the three ports, and combinations where port 2 is excited simultaneously with port 1 or port 3, the antenna generates currents that complement equivalent magnetic currents to produce beams pointing in different directions. The wide beams of the antenna can steer and cover a total range from -${60}^{\circ }$ to ${240}^{\circ }$ across five states. Based on this design, a four-element array is fabricated and tested. Measurement results demonstrate the gains of 10.03, 10.8, and 10.5 dBi within the operational frequency range (23.7-28 GHz), with a radiation efficiency of 87.3%. The proposed antenna features a low-profile and compact structure, achieving a coverage range of approximately 300 degrees. It is highly suitable for UAVs, and small mobile devices when integrated with an integrated chip circuit. Additionally, if matched with a phase shifter, the antenna can achieve two-dimensional scanning capability.},

Specifically, the uplink cascaded channel of the system can be represented as a low-rank sparse channel tensor in the angle-delay domain due to the limited scattering paths. Leveraging such representation, the scheme contains two steps. First, the scheme designs the sensing matrices, i.e., the base station combining matrix and the RIS reflection matrix, to meet the proposed uniqueness condition that guarantees the one-to-one correspondence between the high-dimensional channel tensor and lower-dimensional channel observation. The sensing matrices design is formulated as a power/constant module-constrained matrix optimization problem. Second, the scheme reconstructs the channel tensor from the channel observation, which is formulated as a low-rank constrained tensor optimization problem. The above problems are solved using manifold optimization techniques, which convert the original problem with non-convex constraints into an unconstrained optimization problem on manifolds, eliminating the need for relaxation of the non-convex constraints and achieving higher accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate superior performance in terms of channel estimation accuracy.},

  abstract     = {This letter presents a flexible rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) framework for near-field (NF) integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). The spatial beams configured to meet the communication rate requirements of NF users are simultaneously leveraged to sense an additional NF target. A key innovation lies in its flexibility to select a subset of users for decoding the common stream, enhancing interference management and system performance. The system is designed by minimizing the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) for joint distance and angle estimation through optimized power allocation, common rate allocation, and user selection. This leads to a discrete, non-convex optimization problem. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the preconfigured beams are sufficient for target sensing, eliminating the need for additional probing signals. To solve the optimization problem, an iterative algorithm is proposed combining the quadratic transform and simulated annealing. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms conventional RSMA and space division multiple access (SDMA), reducing distance and angle estimation errors by approximately 100% and 20%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the problem of optimizing the rate performance in a downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system with intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) capable of operating in diagonal (D) or non-diagonal (ND) configuration. The objective is to maximize the minimum signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR), which is equivalent to maximizing the data rates for all users based on fairness. To cater multiple number of users two user pairing scheme is considered. Firstly, we propose a sub optimal optimization (SO) approach to jointly optimize the phase shifts and power allocation coefficients. Further, we compare the data rate performance of different IRS configurations and user pairing schemes under various transmit signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. We propose a novel hybrid IRS configuration that selects diagonal or non-diagonal mode of IRS configuration. We also compare our results with optimal greedy search method. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in data rates using the hybrid IRS configuration with SO approach (SO-hybrid) compared to traditional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) schemes for higher value of IRS elements ($M&amp;gt;64$). For instance, with two users setting, at an SNR of 20dB with $M=225$, the proposed SO-hybrid method achieves data rates up to 6.3bps/Hz, compared to 5.3bps/Hz and 5.4bps/Hz for OMA with diagonal and non-diagonal IRS configurations, respectively. At a SNR of 10dB, the SO-hybrid reaches up to 4.3bps/Hz, outperforming OMA-ND scheme that achieves up to 3.7bps/Hz. Additionally, we analyze the impact of imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) and channel state information (CSI) on system performance. Simulations reveal that the hybrid NOMA scheme consistently outperforms OMA, even under adverse conditions of imperfect SIC and CSI, showcasing its robustness and potential for enhancing wireless communication systems.},

  abstract     = {In order to maintain information freshness in passive eavesdropping scenarios of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted short packet communications (SPC), this paper proposes a physical layer security communication scheme that considers information freshness. Specifically, with the moment generating function in stochastic network calculus (SNC), the approximate closed-form expression for the upper bound of secrecy age outage probability (SAOP) under statistical channel state information (CSI) is derived. Besides, the effects of blocklength and decoding error probability on SAOP are analyzed. The average blocklength and decoding error probability satisfying minimum SAOP are derived. Furthermore, a SAOP minimization problem is proposed by considering reliability, security and RIS unit modulus constraints. For the non-convex problem with coupling variables, we decompose it into blocklength and RIS phase shift optimization subproblem through the alternating optimization algorithm. In particular, for the stochastic RIS phase shift optimization, a momentum stochastic successive convex approximation (M-SSCA) algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal solution, which introduces a momentum disturbance factor to accelerate convergence. In simulation results, the effects of main system parameters on SAOP are given. Compared with the traditional convex optimization schemes, the algorithm proposed in this paper reduces SAOP more effectively and has better convergence performance according to simulation results.},

  abstract     = {Space–air–ground integrated networks (SAGIN) have attracted considerable attention owing to their capability extending telecommunication coverage via satellite communication. They enhance the capacity and coverage of satellite communication systems using amplifying relays deployed in high-altitude platform stations (HAPS) in the air. Free-space optical (FSO) communication, which offers larger capacity compared to conventional radiofrequency (RF) communication, can enhance the capacity of SAGIN to meet the requirements of sixth-generation (6 G) systems. This study assumes a hybrid FSO/RF SAGIN, where high-capacity but atmospherically unstable FSO communications and low-capacity but atmospherically stable RF communications are used in a complementary manner in the satellite-HAPS-ground link. For the SAGIN coverage area to expand, the transmission capacity of the system needs to be further improved. Therefore, efficient use of the limited RF link frequency bandwidth is crucial, and the satellite and HAPS must cooperate to share and meet ground traffic requirements by controlling the areas they each cover. In addition, HAPS placement significantly impacts the spectral efficiency of the system because the positional relationship between the satellite and HAPS affects the transmission capacity. Therefore, this study proposes a combined control method for optimizing HAPS placement and coverage area of the satellite and HAPS. Furthermore, a solution space reduction method is incorporated into the proposed method for efficient exploration of the optimal control parameters. The solution exploration efficiency and data transmission performance using the proposed method are evaluated through simulations.},

To address this, we investigate a novel prioritized RA control technique for massive IoT networks that cooperatively identifies adaptive access class barring (ACB) factors and preamble allocations, taking into account IoT devices&#39; heterogeneity and limited RA resources. We derived the closed-form expression for the preamble utilization ratio (PAUR), incorporating the reusable colliding preambles and the early-stage collision detection (es-CD) technique. Two priority-guided RA request transition models are established, precisely translating RA priorities into a flexible backoff window size. Our Markov-Chain-based analytical model enables a comprehensive RA performance evaluation, demonstrating the superior performance of the proposed QoS-Aware Joint Access Control and Resource Allocation (QA-JACRA) in terms of PAUR, access delay, and throughput. This is achieved at a lower computational complexity compared to existing RA control schemes, providing a promising design approach for the activation of massive IoT devices.},

To address the computational time and black-box issues associated with RL, an adaptive preview controller was used to simplify the state inputs and improve computational efficiency, and a safety control strategy was implemented to mitigate the safety risks posed by the black-box nature of the model. Simulation tests on actual mining paths show the RL controller achieves an average lateral error under 0.05 m with an average execution time under 10ms, and the safety layer effectively intervenes when network control fails. Field experiment results show a maximum lateral error under 0.22m with an average execution time under 20ms, ensuring safe driving even in complete network control failure.},

  abstract     = {Internet of vehicle (IoV) is essential in intelligent transportation systems by enabling interaction and integration of information. However, IoV is vulnerable to tamper and forgery attacks without secure authentication. Identity-based aggregate signature (IBAS) is crucial in guaranteeing identity authentication and information integrity, thereby building secure authentications. With signature compression and batch verification, IBAS improves the efficiency of signatures transmission and verification, thereby reducing computing and storage demands on machines. Unfortunately, Snowden revealed that powerful adversaries replaced pure cryptographic algorithms with subverted ones to corrupt machines and undermine their security. To address this issue, we propose a fully and universal identitybased aggregate signature with reverse firewalls (FU-IBAS-RF), vehicles and the private key generator (PKG) are equipped with RFs to sanitize information transmitted throughout the entire process. Additionally, we propose an identity-based aggregate signature with reverse firewalls (IBAS-RF), RFs are deployed for each vehicle to sanitize information generated during the signing phase. Moreover, we prove that both FU-IBAS-RF and IBAS-RF not only inherit the security and functional property of IBAS but also are subversion-resistant. Finally, we conduct experiments and indicate that RFs accounts for approximately 18% of computation costs across three distinct security levels in both schemes. Therefore, both FU-IBAS-RF and IBAS-RF achieve stronger security with efficiency compared with existing IBAS.},

  abstract     = {Developing powertrain control functions is time-consuming and resource-intensive, often leading to sub-optimal solutions. Reinforcement Learning (RL) allows agents to perform complex control tasks with minimal human involvement, but is often confined to simulations due to testing costs and safety concerns. To effectively apply RL in embedded powertrain control, agents must be able to handle real-world scenarios, particularly through direct interaction with real actuators and control systems. Therefore, this research applies Transfer Learning (TL) and X-in-the-Loop (XiL) simulations to develop agents that can seamlessly transition and perform robustly in real-world environments. For transient exhaust gas re-circulation control of an internal combustion engine, the process begins with a computationally inexpensive Model-in-the-Loop (MiL) simulation to select a suitable algorithm, fine-tune hyperparameters, and conduct preliminary training. In the next step, pre-trained agents are transferred to an advanced Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) system with real hardware using TL for further training. Compared to agents trained entirely on HiL systems, transferred agents required significantly less real-world training time (up to 5.9 times shorter) while outperforming the series production Engine Control Unit (ECU). The results highlight that for real-world effectiveness, integrating actual hardware into training is essential, reward fine-tuning plays a critical role in optimizing these interactions, and the maturity of the policy significantly influences both training duration and overall performance.},

  abstract     = {In industrial wireless networks, the decentralized redundant design for sensing, communication, and control, as well as the frequent interaction among massive intelligent machines, result in the challenges such as high communication overhead and low production capacity. To address these problems, we propose a closed-loop control scheme based on integrated sensing, communication and control (ISCC). Firstly, to accurately model the closed-loop control process of automated guided vehicle (AGV) in automobile assembly workshops, we establish a novel ISCC system. Then, to reduce communication overhead while ensuring the system stability, we propose a networked multi-node control method with coordinated active-passive control. Through sensing workshop environment, AGVs flexibly perform different control instructions between active local decision-making and passive reception of base station (BS) decision-making. AGVs can respond quickly to the environment and achieve high-speed movement without the requirement for frequent communication with the BS. Furthermore, we design a novel communication scheme with adaptive closed-loop interaction cycle, by deriving stability conditions for the multi-node control method and upper bound for the closed-loop interaction cycle. Through dynamically adjusting the AGVs closed-loop interaction cycle based on real-time closed-loop control status, it significantly reduces the frequency of AGV accessing BS and communication overhead, extending the controllable AGV quantity, and enhancing production capacity. Simulation results reveal that the proposed scheme improved production capacity by a minimum of 62.6% compared to conventional schemes, significantly improving communication and control performance.},

Massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) can provide spatial degrees of freedom, which can be utilized for RA resource extension. In this paper, we propose a novel beamspace RA scheme, which achieves fully spatial preamble reuse. Specifically, the cell is divided into several beam zones via directional beams, and preambles are fully reused per beam. To mitigate preamble collision and side-lobe interference, we combine the access class barring (ACB) method with preamble reuse, which efficiently improves RA throughput. Meanwhile, an efficient algorithm is proposed to determine these multiple ACB factors. The proposed scheme is applicable to both grant-based and grant-free RA procedures.

Recently, cell-free massive MIMO (CFmMIMO) has gained considerable attention due to its capability to offer uniform quality of service, alleviating the cell-edge problem. In contrast to previous studies focused on narrow-band CFmMIMO systems, this paper studies wideband CFmMIMO communications against channel frequency selectivity. By exploiting the frequency-domain flexibility offered by orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), and leveraging a particular spatial characteristic in the cell-free structure – namely, the near-far effect among distributed access points (APs) – we propose an opportunistic approach to boost spectral efficiency. The core concept lies in opportunistically activating nearby APs for certain users across their assigned OFDM subcarriers while deactivating distant APs to prevent power wastage and lower inter-user interference. Furthermore, this approach enables the use of downlink pilots by reducing the number of active APs per subcarrier to a small subset, thereby substantially improving downlink performance through coherent detection at the user receiver. Verified by numerical results, our proposed approach demonstrates considerable performance improvement compared to the two benchmark approaches.},

To address these issues, this paper proposes an anytime trajectory optimizer for accurately parking an autonomous vehicle in tiny spaces cluttered with obstacles. The proposed method incorporates differentiable collision-avoidance constraints and a trust region strategy to improve computational efficiency. It can also iteratively refine the solution, enabling the optimizer to converge to a new minimum by breaking previous constraints and establishing new ones. Extensive simulations show the proposed method outperforms mainstream planners, effectively handling cluttered environments and tiny parking slots where others fail, or outperforming them in speed when they succeed.

  abstract     = {Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technology, robust against frequency-selective fading channels, is widely applied in the fifth-generation (5G) communication systems, which makes automatic modulation classification (AMC) tasks critical for OFDM communication systems in military and civilian applications. This paper proposes a self-supervised learning framework, named cross-view prediction with automatic augmentation (CPAA). Unlike existing supervised methods requiring substantial labeled data, CPAA leverages massive unlabeled samples and minimal labeled data. Initially, an automatic data augmentation module is incorporated with traditional augmentation methods. Subsequently, the unlabeled pairwise signals are utilized for self-supervised pertaining through the cross-view prediction (CP) module. Finally, supervised fine-tuning using well-trained encoder is conducted on a small amount of labeled datasets. The proposed framework is capable of identifying five different OFDM modulation formats and enhancing performance through automatic data augmentation, which effectively retains data identity and generates diverse views. Simulation results indicate that CPAA can achieve robust classification performance with massive unlabeled samples and extremely limited labeled samples. Moreover, the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels and demonstrates better generalization capabilities under low SNR conditions. Based on the simulation results, the CPAA framework achieves a classification accuracy of over $\bm {85\%}$ at SNR $\bm {&amp;gt;}$ 8dB with only one labeled sample per SNR for each modulation scheme. Moreover, the automatic data augmentation module enhances the performance of self-supervised learning when limited labeled data are available, yielding an approximate average performance gain of $\bm {48.78\%}$ and demonstrating good transferability on the existing self-supervised learning algorithms.},

This paper presents an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)-based CKM prototype system, demonstrating the mutualistic relationship between ISAC and CKM. The system consists of an ISAC base station (BS), a user equipment (UE), and a server. By using a shared orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform over the millimeter wave (mmWave) band, the ISAC BS is able to communicate with the UE while simultaneously sensing the environment and acquiring the UE&#39;s location. The prototype showcases the complete process of the construction and application of the ISAC-based CKM. For CKM construction phase, the BS stores the UE&#39;s channel feedback information in a database indexed by the UE&#39;s location, including beam indices and channel gain. For CKM application phase, the BS looks up the best beam index from the CKM based on the UE&#39;s location to achieve training-free mmWave beam alignment. The experimental results show that ISAC can be used to construct or update CKM while communicating with UEs, and the pre-learned CKM can assist ISAC for training-free beam alignment.},

  abstract     = {This article focuses on the security control problem for the networked unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) under the network environment, where the malicious attacks (DoS attack and FDI attack) and external/internal uncertainties are taken into account. In the sensor-control channel, the eventsampled unit is involved to overcome the design problem of intermittent transmission signal caused by the DoS attack, and a novel event-sampled adaptive neural state observer (ESANSO) is developed to recover the velocity of USVs. In the controlactuator channel, a self-triggering control mechanism is proposed to save the communication resources. In the control design, with aid of the ESANSO and an adaptive neural approach utilizing a single-parameter leaning technique, a novel adaptive neural output feedback security control solution is developed. This approach effectively mitigates the impact of malicious attacks. The theoretical analysis shows that all signals are bounded, and the Zeno phenomenon can be avoided. Finally, the effectiveness of proposed control scheme is validated by simulation and experiments.},
