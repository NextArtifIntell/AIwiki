  abstract     = {In the past few decades, many multiobjective evolutionary optimization algorithms (MOEAs) have been proposed to find a finite set of approximate Pareto solutions for a given problem in a single run. However, in many real-world applications, it could be desirable to have structure constraints on the entire optimal solution set, which define the patterns shared among all solutions. The current population-based MOEAs cannot properly handle such requirements. In this work, we make a first attempt to add structure constraints on the solution set. Specifically, we propose to model such a multiobjective optimization problem as a set optimization problem with structure constraints. The structure constraints define some patterns that all the solutions are required to share. Such patterns can be fixed components shared by all solutions, specific relations among decision variables, and the required shape of the Pareto set. In addition, we develop a simple yet efficient evolutionary stochastic optimization method to learn the set model, which only requires a low computational budget similar to classic MOEAs. With our proposed method, the decision-makers can easily trade off the Pareto optimality with preferred structures, which is not supported by other MOEAs. A set of experiments on benchmark test suites and real-world application problems demonstrates that our proposed method is effective.},

  abstract     = {Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a combinatorial optimization problem, serving as basis for many real-world applications (e.g., transportation planning, circuit board design, and DNA sequencing). In TSP, it is common to encounter some dynamic events, for example, traffic jam and roadworks in transportation planning. To deal with such Dynamic TSP (DTSP) scenarios, numerous techniques have been designed over decades. In this paper, we take a different perspective to study DTSP. Instead of focusing only on algorithm design for DTSP, we investigate how dynamic events in DTSP affect its fitness landscape (e.g., the location of local optimal solutions and the ruggedness level of search space). We consider three dynamic events, including node addition, node deletion and weight changes, and analyze how they affect the TSP with respect to the overall landscape structure and solution optimality. Experimental results show that the weight change event has great effect on the problemâ€™s fitness landscape, introducing more local optima and reducing the basin of attraction for the global optimum. This may suggest that search algorithms need to have stronger exploration capability when handling weight change dynamic events. Furthermore, our experimental studies also demonstrate that the dynamic solution adaptation strategy on the original global optimum is effective for tracking the new optimum after dynamic changes.},

  abstract     = {Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for optimization have received wide attention due to their robustness and practicality. However, the traditional way of asynchronously handling bi-level optimization problems (BLOPs) ignores the benefits brought by effective upper-and lower-level collaboration. To address this issue, this paper proposes a collaborative multi-objective transformation (MOT)-based evolutionary algorithm (MOTEA-II). In MOTEA-II, the BLOP is handled within a decomposition-based multi-objective optimization paradigm using a two-stage collaborative MOT strategy. The stage-1 MOT focuses on multiple lower-level optimizations and collaboration, while stage-2 collaborates the upper-level optimization with lower-level optimization, which makes simultaneously horizontal and vertical optimization information sharing in bi-level optimization possible. In addition, a dynamic decomposition strategy is further proposed to reconstruct the hierarchy relationship in collaborative multi-objective optimization, facilitating the adaptive and flexible importance control of the upper-level objective optimization and lower-level optimality satisfaction for better bi-level search efficiency. Empirical studies are conducted on two groups of commonly used BLOP benchmark suites and four practical applications. Experimental results show that the proposed collaborative MOTEA-II can achieve performance comparable to that of the previous MOTEA and three other representative EA-based bi-level optimization approaches, but using much fewer computational resources.},

Local search is an effective approach for obtaining a high-quality subset in this problem. However, local search requires high computational cost, especially as the size of the point set and the number of objectives increase. To address this issue, this paper proposes a candidate list strategy for local search in the indicator-based subset selection problem. In the proposed strategy, each point in a given point set has a candidate list. During search, each point is only eligible to swap with unselected points in its associated candidate list. This restriction drastically reduces the number of swaps at each iteration of local search. We consider two types of candidate lists: nearest neighbor and random neighbor lists. This paper investigates the effectiveness of the proposed candidate list strategy on various Pareto fronts. The results show that the proposed strategy with the nearest neighbor list can significantly speed up local search on continuous Pareto fronts without significantly compromising the subset quality. The results also show that the sequential use of the two lists can address the discontinuity of Pareto fronts.},

To address EFJSP-AGV, both exact and approximate methods were developed. The exact method employs a novel mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model, capable of producing optimal Pareto solutions for small-sized instances using the epsilon method. EFJSP-AGV is an NP-hard problem that involves three subproblems: operation sequencing, machine selection, and AGV selection. To overcome these challenges, a novel approximate method called imitation learning (IL)-assisted multi-population evolutionary algorithm (ILMPEA) was proposed. The multi-population evolutionary framework assigns distinct search regions to populations to improve the efficiency of solution space exploration. To further enhance search accuracy, IL is applied to select search operators, guiding the Pareto front toward a better approximation of the true front. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of both the MILP model and ILMPEA.},

Considering these different solutions can provide users with richer decisions, the search of multiple PSs is crucial when solving MMOPs. To this end, many multimodal multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MMOEAs) often employ intricate mechanisms to maintain the diversity of the offspring in mating selection, but ignore to learn PSs. In this paper, a data-driven evolutionary algorithm based on inductive graph neural networks (DEA-IGNN) is proposed to solve MMOPs, which successfully learns the PSs topology by the graph structure to generate offspring with good performance. Specifically, a graph topology construction method based on Euclidean distance in the decision space is designed. It determines the neighborhood by calculating the Euclidean distance of individuals in the decision space and establishes the topological relationships to construct the graphs representing of population distribution. On this basis, a model based on inductive graph neural networks is constructed to assist offspring reproduction, which can learn unknown nodes by sampling and aggregating existing information. Moreover, a data-driven reproduction strategy is proposed to predict offspring with the good diversity and convergence, which uses the traditional variation operators to generate training data and adopts these data to train the model. The proposed DEA-IGNN is implemented and compared with eleven competitive MMOEAs on three test suites and a practical problem. The experimental results show that DEA-IGNN has good performance.},

This paper addresses the dynamic cascaded flowshop joint scheduling problem, which integrates a distributed permutation flowshop in Phase 1 and a hybrid flowshop in Phase 2. The challenge involves both initial scheduling and dynamic response mechanisms for new job insertions. We propose an evolutionary greedy algorithm (EGA) aimed at minimizing total flowtime. The EGA employs a multi-start cooperative framework tailored to problem characteristics, alternating between a population-based evolutionary greedy algorithm for Phase 1 and an elitist-based greedy algorithm for Phase 2 to generate a robust and complete schedule. Upon new job insertions, three heuristic-driven response strategies enhance solution stability and adaptability. Additionally, phase-specific hybrid local search operators and an adaptive insertion strategy, leveraging knowledge-based problem properties, further improve solution quality and search efficiency. The experimental results indicate that the EGA outperforms five state-of-the-art algorithms, achieving an average improvement of 39% in RPI values across 480 instances. Moreover, the proposed local search mechanisms and dynamic response strategies significantly enhance its performance. Thus, the EGA is well-suited for addressing the studied problem.},

  abstract     = {As a cornerstone in the Evolutionary Computation (EC) domain, Differential Evolution (DE) is known for its simplicity and effectiveness in handling challenging black-box optimization problems. While the advantages of DE are well-recognized, achieving peak performance heavily depends on its hyperparameters such as the mutation factor, crossover probability, and the selection of specific DE strategies. Traditional approaches to this hyperparameter dilemma have leaned towards parameter tuning or adaptive mechanisms. However, identifying the optimal settings tailored for specific problems remains a persistent challenge. In response, we introduce MetaDE, an approach that evolves DEâ€™s intrinsic hyperparameters and strategies using DE itself at a meta-level. A pivotal aspect of MetaDE is a specialized parameterization technique, which endows it with the capability to dynamically modify DEâ€™s parameters and strategies throughout the evolutionary process. To augment computational efficiency, MetaDE incorporates a design that leverages parallel processing through a GPU-accelerated computing framework. Within such a framework, DE is not just a solver but also an optimizer for its own configurations, thus streamlining the process of hyperparameter optimization and problem-solving into a cohesive and automated workflow. Extensive evaluations on the CEC2022 benchmark suite demonstrate MetaDEâ€™s promising performance. Moreover, when applied to robot control via evolutionary reinforcement learning, MetaDE also demonstrates promising performance.

  abstract     = {For expensive multiobjective optimization problems, there exists useful knowledge, e.g., the trained surrogate models, can be transferred to assist the optimization of a target optimization problem, which is termed as multi-problem surrogates. Stacking transfer is able to combine the pretrained source surrogate models and the preliminary target model with a meta-regression algorithm to transfer knowledge from source to target. However, when large-scale source models are involved in the many-problem scenarios, the less correlated sources may hurt the target performance, which is known as negative transfer. In this paper, sparse representation of the coefficients of meta-regression is considered to automatically select the most relevant source models for largely avoiding negative transfer. In the proposed many-problem surrogates, the coefficients of the source and target models are assumed to be sparse under the non-negativity and sum-to-one constraints. Then a sparse transfer stacking model is established with l1-norm of the coefficients. Next, the alternating direction method of multipliers is employed to solve the resulting constrained optimization problem by converting it into several much simpler problems. Most of the previous works assume that the costs for evaluation have no much difference and this assumption rarely holds in the real-world applications. In order to further reduce the total costs, an improved surrogate model with a cost-sensitive measure is designed to estimate the cost and select new solutions for real evaluation based on their estimated fitness, uncertainty and cost. Experimental results on synthetic and practical problems have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed many-problem surrogates.},

Among these techniques, generating grid-based maps is notable for simplifying the path planning process, especially in complex environments. This study introduces a novel optimization approach, the modified ant colony optimization and genetic algorithm (MACOGA), which is tailored for path planning in grid environments. MACOGA combines ant colony optimization (ACO) with genetic algorithm (GA) to efficiently navigate grid spaces. First, ACO identifies potential routes within a grid map, and GA optimizes them to find the optimal route. A key feature of MACOGA is its probabilistic prediction mechanism, which improves node selection by integrating the heuristic factors and probabilistic calculations of feasible potential paths, which significantly increases the likelihood of generating feasible initial paths and attains higher success rates in various environmental tests. The enhanced GA in the MACOGA incorporates ACOâ€™s pheromones and heuristic factors, and introduces adaptive probability crossover and mutation operations. Additionally, a path reconnection operation ensures favorable length and smoothness. To evaluate MACOGAâ€™s effectiveness, six planar models of varying sizes and complexities were studied. Results show MACOGAâ€™s superiority in path length and execution time, achieving the shortest path and planning time in several environments. The shortest path can be optimized to yield an improvement of up to 6%. Regarding runtime, even in the complex scenarios, it executes in just 0.3 seconds, outperforming other comparative algorithms. Furthermore, the success rate can reach 100% in relatively complex environments.},

The DFJSSP involves scheduling jobs in a highly dynamic and uncertain manufacturing environment where new tasks are continually introduced, further complicating the scheduling process. In this study, the DFJSSP is extended to incorporate single crane transportation and sequence-dependent setup times, reflecting real-world manufacturing constraints. To tackle this multifaceted problem, we introduce a novel approach, i.e., a multipopulation-based evolutionary multi-task optimization(EMTO) framework. Additionally, the genetic programming algorithm is employed as a generative hyperheuristic to deal with the dynamic uncertainties in the shop floor. Two components are collaborated to optimize two objectives, i.e., minimizing the maximum completion time and the total tardiness. Furthermore, a dynamic transfer ratio is proposed, allowing the proportion of knowledge transfer to adapt throughout the iteration process, balancing convergence speed with population diversity. The results demonstrate that both the EMTO framework and the dynamic transfer ratio significantly enhance the performance of the algorithm. Compared to well-known constructive heuristics and reinforcement learning algorithm, the proposed approach enables parallel resolution of multiple optimization objectives, leading to enhanced scheduling efficiency and adaptability in dynamic manufacturing environments.},

  abstract     = {Traditional large-scale evolutionary algorithms are limited in their ability to solve certain real-world applications with high-dimensional, black-box, and computationally expensive objectives due to their need for numerous objective evaluations. Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) have shown effective for expensive black-box optimization by relying on inexpensive surrogate models. However, large-scale optimization remains challenging for SAEAs due to the exponentially growing search space and the presence of multiple local optima, resulting in difficulty in training a proper model due to the lack of samples. To address these challenges, we propose constructing an initial surrogate model on randomly selected dimensions and calculating a Gaussian distribution for each sampled dimension. The surrogate then provides predictions when perturbing each sampled dimension by sampling from the distribution, enabling the identification of the most important variables for constructing an active sub-problem to reduce the search space. A secondary surrogate model, built for the active sub-problem, guides the offspring generation and environmental selection for a modified particle swarm optimization algorithm to effectively explores the sub-space while escaping local optima in large-scale problems. Experimental results on CECâ€™2013 and CECâ€™2010 benchmark problems show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in addressing large-scale expensive optimization problems. The efficiency of the proposed method is further verified on CECâ€™2010 benchmark problems extended to 2000 dimensions.},

  abstract     = {Most existing constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (CMOEAs) experience a dramatic performance degradation when solving large-scale constrained multi-objective optimization problems (LSCMOPs), since they converge very slowly and easily get trapped in local optima due to the loss of diversity. To enhance the efficiency of tackling LSCMOPs, this paper proposes an indicator-based evolutionary algorithm, referred to as ILCMO. In ILCMO, two complementary indicators are proposed to assess the contribution of each individual to feasibility, convergence, and diversity. The first is a feasibility-oriented indicator designed to drive the population towards the feasible regions. The second is an infeasibility-assisted dynamic indicator, which comprises two relaxed constraint boundaries. Theoretical studies demonstrate that this dynamic indicator can effectively guide the population to focus on evenly searching the infeasible regions around feasible solutions to enhance local diversity. In addition, a variable grouping-based differential evolution (VGDE) strategy, which includes a group-based intra-learning operator and a group-based inter-learning operator, is devised to improve the quality of reproduction in large-scale search spaces. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated through comprehensive experiments on four benchmarks and a microgrid dispatch problem against seven state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The performance of population-based multiobjective optimization algorithms is usually evaluated using indicators assessing the quality of the approximation set generated according to convergence, cardinality, spread, and uniformity (the combination of the last two known as diversity). Since not all quality indicators can capture all these properties, we propose to aggregate already-existing indicators into a single measure informing about the algorithmâ€™s performance from a general perspective. To synthesize the desired quality indicators, we build three composite quality indicators (weak, strong, and mixed) based on the reference point approach. This approach enables the use of desirable value ranges for the aggregated quality indicators, defined by aspiration and reservation levels, that allow knowing which algorithms perform better, within, or worse than the desired limits. Each of the composite quality indicators proposed enables a different compensation degree among the aggregated indicators, and their joint use permits a deep insight into the algorithmsâ€™ performance. In addition, we show that the weak and mixed composite indicators are Pareto-compliant, and the strong one is weakly Pareto-compliant if at least one of the aggregated indicators is Pareto-compliant. Finally, we demonstrate the benefits of our proposal when comparing many population-based algorithms on three-, five-, and eight-objective optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {Multi-label classification (MLC) involves assigning multiple labels to each instance from a predefined set of labels. With the increasing prevalence of multi-label datasets in real-world problems, MLC has become a popular area of research. These datasets frequently contain irrelevant, redundant, or noisy features, highlighting the importance of feature selection in MLC tasks. As a result, numerous multi-label feature selection (MLFS) approaches have been introduced in the literature. Given their effective search capabilities, evolutionary computation (EC) techniques have been adopted to develop MLFS approaches. However, there is a notable absence of a comprehensive survey dedicated to EC-based MLFS approaches to MLC tasks. Although few attempts have been made to address this gap, they do not provide detailed discussions on EC-based approaches. They also tend to overlook the strengths and weaknesses of existing approaches, especially regarding search, optimization, and evaluation processes. This paper aims to fill this gap by presenting a comprehensive survey of EC-based MLFS approaches, focusing on the latest advancements, current challenges, and future directions. To be specific, we categorize EC-based MLFS approaches based on different criteria and provide detailed descriptions for each category.},

  abstract     = {In bilevel optimization, the upper-level optimization problem (ULOP) requires to be solved under the constraint of the inner lower-level optimization problem (LLOP). However, it is computationally expensive to always consider the constraint caused by the LLOP in a higher priority because heavy evaluation budgets are required for validating the constraint satisfaction. From this aspect, this paper investigates bilevel evolutionary multi-objective optimization with multiple lower-level search modes (BLEMO-MLS). Assisted by self-learning and reinforcement, BLEMO-MLS could adaptively adjust the priority of considering more on the upper-level objective optimization or the constraint caused by the LLOP. In BLEMO-MLS, three lower-level search modes are designed to handle the constraint caused by the LLOP. The former two search modes have higher priorities on the satisfaction of the constraint caused by the LLOP, where lower-level decisions of solutions are optimized by a hybrid lower-level search method, while the last search mode has a higher priority on the upper-level objective optimization with the constraint caused by the LLOP temporarily ignored. Through self-learning and reinforcement, BLEMO-MLS dynamically selects proper lower-level search modes in the bilevel optimization process, aiming to obtain approximate bilevel Pareto-optimal solutions fulfilling the constraint caused by the LLOP as much as possible. Compared with five existing bilevel evolutionary algorithms, BLEMO-MLS could effectively solve bilevel multi-objective optimization problems with function evaluations saved in both levels.},

  abstract     = {How to simultaneously locate multiple global peaks and achieve certain accuracy on the found peaks are two key challenges in solving multimodal optimization problems (MMOPs). In this article, a landscape-aware differential evolution (LADE) algorithm is proposed for MMOPs, which utilizes landscape knowledge to maintain sufficient diversity and provide efficient search guidance. In detail, the landscape knowledge is efficiently utilized in the following three aspects. First, a landscape-aware peak exploration helps each individual evolve adaptively to locate a peak and simulates the regions of the found peaks according to search history to avoid an individual re-locating an already found peak. Second, a landscape-aware peak distinction distinguishes whether an individual locates a new global peak, a new local peak, or an already found peak. Accuracy refinement can thus only be conducted on the global peaks to enhance the search efficiency. Third, a landscape-aware reinitialization specifies the initial position of an individual adaptively according to the distribution and distinction of the found peaks, which helps explore more peaks. The experiments are conducted on the widely-used benchmark MMOPs and multimodal nonlinear equation system problems. Experimental results show that LADE obtains generally better or competitive performance compared with seven well-performing recent algorithms and four winner algorithms in the IEEE CEC competitions for multimodal optimization.},
