  abstract     = {The platoon technology is gradually applied in the intelligent transportation systems to improve the safety, efficiency, energy saving, and emission reduction of vehicles during driving. However, in contrast to the traditional ramp merging scenario that consists of individual vehicles, the existing platoons from the upstream bring new challenges to the merging problem on ramps. Without an effective coordination strategy, the unnecessary congestion and disintegration of the existing platoons will lead to an increase in driving costs and safety risk. Therefore, this paper optimizes the merging strategy of vehicle sequences involving platoons on highway ramps. A merging strategy, based on an adaptive headway threshold, is first proposed, where the comprehensive economic benefit is considered as its optimization objective while taking into account the decrements of the time, fuel, and carbon emission costs. The vehicle sequence merging is then modeled as a Markov decision process to derive the optimal threshold, where the action set includes three actions: accelerating, decelerating, and maintaining the constant cruising speed. Afterwards, the constraints are brought to the decision-making to ensure the safety of the merging process. The calculation of the action value, combining the derived optimal threshold and constraint, is then detailed. Finally, the results of the simulation are evaluated, and a comparison between the proposed strategy and other existing methods is conducted, which demonstrates that the proposed approach improves the comprehensive economic benefits.},

  abstract     = {Recently, graph reinforcement learning (GRL)-based methods have demonstrated superior performance in solving decision-making issues. However, existing GRL-based methods encounter challenges in adequately integrating driving environment information and accurately capturing vehicular interactions. Resolving these issues is crucial for enhancing the safety and efficiency of intelligent transportation systems. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel multi-modal failure-aware graph representation (MM-FA-GR) approach. The objective is to enhance the completeness and stability of graph representation techniques in the GRL-based setting, thereby improving the decision-making performance of CAVs operating in mixed autonomy traffic. Initially, a risk assessment invariant feature extractor (RA-IFE) is introduced to efficiently and selectively aggregate vehicle driving features into the node feature matrix. Subsequently, a multi-modal interaction model (MIM) is developed to comprehensively represent the mutual effects among vehicles and construct a multi-dimensional adjacency matrix. Moreover, a dynamic failure model (DFM) is incorporated to assess the sensing and communication failures of CAVs, enhancing the model’s robustness in non-ideal driving environments. Finally, a GRL model is established to solve the optimized driving strategies for CAVs. The proposed MM-FA-GR method has large potential to advance the graph representation technology, thereby enhancing decision-making performance in mixed autonomy traffic and improving robustness in non-ideal driving conditions. Comprehensive experiments are conducted with three typical traffic scenarios. Results show that our proposed MM-FA-GR method outperforms several baselines regarding safety, efficiency, and stability, highlighting the effectiveness of the core components within the proposed method. Moreover, the quantitative experiment validates the generalization capability of the proposed method in addressing the decision-making challenges of CAVs across diverse scenarios and traffic densities.},

  abstract     = {Technological advancements focus on developing comfortable and acceptable driving characteristics in autonomous vehicles. Present driving functions predominantly possess predefined parameters, and there is no universally accepted driving style for autonomous vehicles. While driving may be technically safe and the likelihood of road accidents is reduced, passengers may still feel insecure due to a mismatch in driving styles between the human and the autonomous system. Incorporating driving style preferences into automated vehicles enhances acceptance, reduces uncertainty, and poses the opportunity to expedite their adoption. Despite the increased research focus on driving styles, there remains a need for comprehensive studies investigating how variations in the driving context impact the assessment of automated driving functions. Therefore, this work evaluates lateral driving style preferences for autonomous vehicles on rural roads, considering different weather and traffic situations. A controlled study was conducted with a variety of German participants utilizing a high-fidelity driving simulator. The participants experienced four different driving styles, including mimicking of their own driving behavior under two weather conditions. A notable preference for a more passive driving style became evident based on statistical analyses of participants’ responses during and after the drives. This study could not confirm the hypothesis that people prefer to be driven by mimicking their own driving behavior. Furthermore, the study illustrated that weather conditions and oncoming traffic substantially influence the perceived comfort during autonomous rides. The gathered dataset is openly accessible at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jhaselberger/idcld-subject-study-on-driving-style-preferences.},

Through a driving simulator experiment, this study thoroughly investigated the relationship between participants’ eye movement behaviors and subjective perceptions. 37 participants each experienced 48 different automated lane changes in the experiment. Their subjective feedback on situational trust and system aggressiveness was collected through questionnaires, and eye movements related to gaze, blink, saccade, fixation, pupil diameter, and eyelid opening were monitored. The analysis identified 25 significant eye movement features. The experimental results show that lower situational trust during automated lane changes correlated with increased attention to side mirrors, decreased attention to the front vehicle in the original lane, reduced blink frequency and suppressed saccade amplitude which increased the duration of effective visual information acquisition, smaller pupil diameter and greater fluctuations indicating increased cognitive load. The extracted features proved effective in building predictive models for drivers’ subjective evaluations. This study provides practical recommendations for selecting eye movement features and implementing personalized automated lane-change systems through eye movement monitoring. Future research will focus on expanding the dataset, improving predictive model performance, and exploring the application of these models.},

  abstract     = {Safety is of vital importance to transportation cyber-physical systems (T-CPS). With the deeper integration of automated vehicles (AVs) in road traffic, safe control algorithms for AVs have become a crucial demand for maintaining the overall safety of T-CPS. One of the major concerns with respect to the DRL-based cyber systems of AVs is the lack of safety guarantees, which may cause physical collisions. Safe reinforcement learning (SRL) is a promising way to enhance the safety performance of traditional DRL. However, current SRL methods are designed in a time-triggered (TT) paradigm, where the controller is uniformly triggered in the time domain. Despite the safety enhancement, this TT-SRL paradigm lacks data efficiency in safety-critical scenarios, and most importantly, still cannot guarantee safety during the intervals between time steps. The main objective of this paper is to address the safety issue of the existing TT-SRL methods while improving the data efficiency by proposing an event-triggered SRL (ET-SRL) framework. In the proposed method, safety is guaranteed by designing an additional safe controller to correct the unsafe actions generated by DRL. Event-triggered control barrier functions (CBFs) are used to provide safety constraints in a discrete manner. A state and dynamics synchronization module is also designed to estimate model uncertainties considering both the state dynamics and the input dynamics. The proposed method is trained and applied in simulated car-following experiments. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by comparison to both DRL-based and model-based baselines in both artificial safety-critical scenarios and a real trajectory dataset.},

  abstract     = {Blockchain-based Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) is widely considered a secure communication architecture for a connected transportation system. With the advent of quantum computing, there are concerns regarding the vulnerability of this architecture against attack algorithms implemented in a quantum computer. In this study, a potential threat is investigated in a blockchain-based VANET with an impersonation attack utilizing Shor’s algorithm implemented in a quantum computer. Specifically, the impersonation attack using Shor’s algorithm is created by compromising the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) encrypted digital signatures of VANET, and thus a threat to the trust-based blockchain scheme of VANET is successfully established. We implemented an integrated simulation platform combining OMNET++, vehicles-in-network simulation (VEINS), and simulation of urban mobility (SUMO) traffic simulator. In addition, we incorporated vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication in OMNET++ using the extended INET library. An impersonation attack on a blockchain-based VANET is implemented using IBM Qiskit, which is an open-source quantum software development kit. The findings reveal that an impersonation attack is feasible on the Blockchain-based VANET, which compromises the trust chain of a blockchain-based VANET. This research highlights the need for a quantum-secured blockchain for VANET.},

  abstract     = {Binocular stereo matching is a crucial task in autonomous driving for accurately estimating the depth information of objects and scenes. This task, however, is challenging due to various ill-posed regions within binocular image pairs, such as repeated textures and weak textures which present complex correspondences between the points. Existing methods extract features from binocular input images mainly by relying on deep convolutional neural networks with a substantial number of convolutional layers, which may incur high memory and computation costs, thus making it hard to deploy in real-world applications. Additionally, previous methods do not consider the correlation between view unary features during the construction of the cost volume, thus leading to inferior results. To address these issues, a novel lightweight binocular-separated feature extraction module is proposed that includes a view-shared multi-dilation fusion module and a view-specific feature extractor. Our method leverages a shallow neural network with a multi-dilation modeling module to provide similar receptive fields as deep neural networks but with fewer parameters and better computational efficiency. Furthermore, we propose incorporating the correlations of view-shared features to dynamically select view-specific features during the construction of the cost volume. Extensive experiments conducted on two public benchmark datasets show that our proposed method outperforms the deep model-based baseline method (i.e., 13.6% improvement on Scene Flow and 2.0% on KITTI 2015) while using 29.7% fewer parameters. Ablation experiments show that our method achieves superior matching performance in weak texture and edge regions. The source code will be made publicly available.},

First, few models consider the potential influence of historical and future auxiliary information, such as weather and holidays, on complex traffic patterns. Second, the computational complexity of dynamic graph convolution operations grows quadratically with the number of traffic nodes, limiting model scalability. To address these challenges, this study proposes a deep encoder-decoder model named AIMSAN, which comprises an auxiliary information-aware module (AIM) and a sparse cross-attention-based graph convolutional network (SAN). From historical or future perspectives, AIM prunes multi-attribute auxiliary data into diverse time frames, and embeds them into one tensor. SAN employs a cross-attention mechanism to merge traffic data with historical embedded data in each encoder layer, forming dynamic adjacency matrices. Subsequently, it applies diffusion GCN to capture rich spatial-temporal dynamics from the traffic data. Additionally, AIMSAN utilizes the spatial sparsity of traffic nodes as a mask to mitigate the quadratic computational complexity of SAN, thereby improving overall computational efficiency. In the decoder layer, future embedded data are fused with feed-forward traffic data to generate prediction results. Experimental evaluations on three public traffic datasets demonstrate that AIMSAN achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, while reducing GPU memory consumption by 41.24%, training time by 62.09%, and validation time by 65.17% on average.},

We propose an intelligent dynamic task crowdsourcing scheme that manages the swarm scale and membership configuration of multiple UAV swarms based on theoretical evaluation results. The architecture constructs DTs of UAV swarms and shifts the scheduling of traffic flow paths to the virtual world, thereby sidestepping the overhead of routing configuration and network reorganisation. With the aid of a traffic flow allocation algorithm based on Stochastic Network Calculus (SNC), the virtual swarm pre-schedules traffic flows and assesses end-to-end delay theoretically, so as to achieve a collaborative deployment of sensing, computational, and communication resources within the swarm. The simulation results substantiate that our architecture can uphold a 90% achievement ratio for task requirements while keeping UAV costs comparable to other algorithms.},

However, directly applying traditional single-authority CP-ABE schemes may result in single-point performance bottleneck. Besides, the secrets of the whole system may be leaked if any node is attacked. To solve these challenging tasks, we proposed MA-CP-ABE-CRF, a multi-authority CP-ABE scheme with cryptographic reverse firewalls.

Besides, load balancing of authorization in distributed systems is achieved based on the characteristic of multi-authority.

As the first scheme with the above features for Internet of vehicles, the system achieves adaptive CPA-security and ASA-security.

  abstract     = {Blended traffic, comprising autonomous buses (ABs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs), is becoming increasingly common, yet the lane change decision-making for ABs remains challenging due to complex interactions with heterogeneous HDVs. To address the challenge above, this paper proposes a game theory-based harmonious decision-making (GTHD) algorithm considering nuance of driving styles of HDVs, achieving human-like performance in interactions with HDVs. Technically, a game theoretic model of the GTHD uses predictions of the opposing vehicle’s motion and the information from preplanned trajectories. Besides, a prior estimation for driving styles is obtained utilizing clustering of historical data, and refined in real time through Bayesian estimation. Then, the driving style estimation is utilized to modify the game theoretic model. The modified model provides a closer depiction of the opponent’s preferences, meanwhile adjusts self-preferences to adapt to the opponent. The efficacy of GTHD is validated using a hardware and human in loop simulator and datasets in MLC scenarios. It is shown that the GTHD achieves human-like performance with 91.50%-98.50% accuracy compared with human bus driver under different conditions, better than several lane change models based on data driven methods.

  abstract     = {We will apply dual three-phase permanent magnet synchronous motors (DTP-PMSM) to the road sensing unit of the steer-by-wire system to improve redundancy and fault tolerance performance, meeting the requirements of intelligent transportation systems. However, open circuit faults inevitably lead to periodic torque ripple, parameter mismatch, and current harmonics, which pose a huge threat to drivers and traffic participants. Therefore, this article proposes a dynamic balancing strategy that can operate stably under both motor health and fault conditions. Firstly, this strategy does not require diagnostic fault information, thereby fundamentally avoiding performance degradation caused by diagnostic accuracy, time, model reconstruction, and strategy switching. The torque control module (TCM) is based on adaptive iterative learning control with a forgetting factor, which achieves torque tracking and suppression of periodic ripple after faults. The current control module (CCM) is based on ultra local model free predictive current control and extended state observer to track current and suppress the effects of parameter mismatch and current harmonics. Based on the multi-variable multi-objective sliding mode extreme value search strategy, the internal parameters and external weights of the two modules are dynamically adjusted to achieve dynamic balance between health and fault operation of TCM and CCM. The experimental results show that this strategy effectively improves the robustness of the system in a healthy state and the fault tolerance performance in a faulty state, effectively suppressing the periodic torque ripple and current harmonics caused by faults. Compared with the dynamic balancing strategy based on NSGA-II, this strategy increases the THD of torque by 13.45% and reduces the THD of current harmonics by 9.83%.},

  abstract     = {Electric Vehicles (EVs) have become popular in the domain of Intelligent Transportation Systems for their ability to mitigate increasing environmental concerns by reducing carbon footprints and conserving fossil fuels. Due to the scarcity of static charging stations, Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) charge sharing can facilitate the on-demand charging requirement of EVs. However, most of the V2V charge-sharing solutions are either centralized or semi-centralized, causing long waiting times, huge message overhead, and high infrastructural costs. For a large network, assigning a suitable donor EV for an acceptor EV as well as maximizing the matching cardinality in a distributed environment is a challenging problem. In this paper, the problem of V2V matching for charge sharing is mapped to the classical stable matching problem in bipartite graphs. The problem is formulated using integer linear programming that considers flexible decision making for EVs based on multiple charging criteria and constraints. However, as EVs have limited communication ranges, an EV can’t possess knowledge about the entire vehicular network. So we propose two sets of distributed heuristics under the name of Vehicle to Vehicle Distributed Charge Sharing (V2VDisCS), which yield a sub-optimal solution with lower computational and message complexities compared to existing distributed solutions. We analyze the average case matching probabilities and prove the sub-optimality of our approach. Simulation studies show that our heuristics outperform the existing distributed approaches in terms of message overhead and matching percentage. They show a comparable result for matching preference with respect to the standard centralized stable matching algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Headway regularity is an essential indicator of transit reliability, directly influencing passenger waiting time and transit service quality. In this paper, we employ multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to develop a Cooperative Transit signal priority strategy with Variable phase for Headway adherence (CTVH) under a multi-intersection network. Each signalized intersection is controlled by an RL agent, which determines the next step’s signal, adapting to real-time traffic dynamics of transits and non-transits and promoting transit headway adherence. The proposed approach considers four critical aspects, i.e., complicated states with multiple conflicting bus requests, rational actions constrained by domain knowledge, comprehensive rewards balancing buses and cars, and a collaborative training scheme among agents. They are correspondingly addressed by proper state representation with estimated bus headway deviations, irrational actions masking, reward functions formulated by general traffic queue and transit headway deviation, and appropriate MARL approach with synchronous action processing. Our method also takes into account the phase transition loss by setting yellow and all-red time. Simulation results compared with the coordinated fixed-time signal (CFT) and bus holding (BH) strategy verify the merits of the proposed method in terms of improvements in transit headway adherence and influence on general traffic. Based on the results, we further discuss the BH method’s limitations due to bus bay length and various holding lines and the CTVH method’s benefits in the three-intersection environment and the entire-line network. The proposed method has a promising application in practice to improve transit reliability.},

To address this challenge, this study proposes lightweight optimization strategies for decision-making models from the aspects of parameter size, training memory usage, and inference speed. Specifically, an innovative solution is proposed to achieve lightweight parameters. The Video Swin Transformer is employed to simultaneously extract temporal and spatial features, with the network trained using a Prioritized Replay Deep Q-Network (PRDQN) that incorporates risk assessment. To further reduce training memory usage, the Q-target network in PRDQN is removed, and the mellowmax operator is integrated to enhance the training process, resulting in the PRDeepMellow Swin Transformer. After analyzing the inference speed problems encountered by the algorithm in practical applications, the vanilla self-attention is replaced by a linear self-attention based on double softmax, namely Double Softmax Linear Video Swin Transformer (DSLVS Transformer) which improves the inference speed for long sequences. The proposed methods were evaluated across three high-speed lane change scenarios (a static scenario, a dynamic scenario, and a randomly changing scenario). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods can still maintain excellent decision performance after the corresponding lightweight optimizations.},

  abstract     = {The digitalization of traffic networks has spurred the development of intelligent transportation systems. By utilizing reinforcement learning for dynamic traffic optimization, it efficiently handles real-world traffic complexities. However, as the demand for real-time, high-efficiency tasks increases, relying solely on reinforcement learning struggles to meet both goals. Integrating reinforcement learning with mobile communication technology offers a promising solution for efficient, low-overhead traffic networks. As an important physical layer technology for Integrated Sensing and Communications Systems, Spectrally Efficient Frequency Division Multiplexing (SEFDM) addresses the communication overhead challenge in reinforcement learning-enabled optimization. However, the main challenge of SEFDM is eliminating the inter-carrier interference (ICI) caused by non-orthogonal modulation. Considering that existing post-interference cancellation methods fail due to the ill-conditioning of the generalized channel matrix, which cannot be directly inverted, we propose a nonlinear precoding algorithm at the transmitter, instead of post-cancellation, that effectively eliminates interference and improves transmission reliability. We firstly use a nonlinear feedback structure to avoid power boost and error propagation. Besides that, Geometric Mean Decomposition (GMD) based interference matrix decomposition algorithm is used in the proposed precoding scheme to avoid matrix singularity and obtain diversity gain. Finally, the numerical results show that the proposed precoding method can achieve higher order QAM SEFDM signaling with higher spectral efficiency and get comparative BER performance.},

  abstract     = {In urban areas, roads with dedicated cycle lanes play a vital role in cyclist safety. However, accidents can still occur when vehicles cross the cycle lane at intersections. Accidents mostly occur due to failure of the driver to see a cyclist on the cycle lane, particularly when the cyclist is going straight through the intersection, and the vehicle is turning. For safe driving, it is critical that the drivers visually scan the area in the vicinity of the junction and the car, particularly using the wing-mirror, prior to making turns. This paper describes results from a set of test drives using in-vehicle non-invasive eye-tracking and in-vehicle CAN bus sensors to determine driver behaviour. In total, 20 drivers were monitored through 5 different intersections with cycle lanes. The study found that approximately 83% of drivers did not check their wing mirror prior to, or during their turning manoeuvre, potentially putting pedestrian, cyclists, scooter and hoverboard users in danger. An algorithm was developed to analyse driver gaze during the turning manoeuvre to identify cases where they failed to look at the wing mirror. The gaze pattern and gaze concentration on the mirror helps to identify safe and unsafe driving behaviour. This information can then be used to improve Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) to create a safer environment for all road users.},

As prominent carriers of the IoV, intelligent vehicles (IVs), that bear the promising potential for alleviating traffic congestion, have become the core road traffic participants. However, the mixed-traffic environment escalates the risk of IVs, as the discretionary lane change behaviors of nearby human-driven vehicles may result in collisions with IVs, compromising the robust performance of the IoV. Recent studies have utilized advanced deep learning techniques to achieve proactive lane change intention prediction, including Recurrent Neural Networks and Transformer. Although attaining reasonable prediction performance, they adopt the data-driven paradigm, which excessively focuses on learning from data while neglecting the domain knowledge. Against this background, we propose to employ the knowledge-driven paradigm and design KLEP, a knowledge-driven lane change prediction framework. KLEP incorporates driving knowledge into lane change modeling, presenting the top-down hierarchical cognitive process of drivers when performing lane change maneuvers. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world natural driving datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of KLEP. Compared to state-of-the-art lane change prediction baselines, KLEP consistently outperforms them and achieves average improvements of 6.2-7.1% and 53.0-67.2% on intention classification and intention forecast tasks across different datasets, respectively. We also validate that KLEP has strong interpretability that aligns with real-world physical laws in lane change scenarios and is lightweight enough to fulfill online prediction.},

  abstract     = {Discriminative correlation filter (DCF)-based tracking algorithms continue to advance in the field of UAV tracking due to their computational efficiency. The idea of integrating the advantages of historical information and response adjustments into the CF tracking framework is continuously being developed. However, maintaining the stability of mobile video tracking in highly dynamic environments is extremely challenging. This difficulty arises from frequent changes in targets and backgrounds, as well as the stochastic noise generated by the photon-counting process in sensors. In addition, the inconsistent rates of these changes are often overlooked and require further scrutiny. In this paper, we propose a dynamic sensitivity enhanced correlation filter with adaptive second-order difference spatial regularization to address the issue of inconsistent motion rates in dynamic videos. We use the non-local means algorithm to denoise template images before feature extraction, improving the discriminative power of target contours. Then, we incorporate the proposed dynamic-sensitivity error method into CF learning and employ a novel adaptive second-order difference spatial regularization to simultaneously optimize the filter coefficients and spatial regularization weights. This regularization effectively works in synergy with the dynamic-sensitivity error strategy. Furthermore, an additional ADMM optimizer is introduced to derive the solution, thereby improving the convergence and computational efficiency of the algorithm. This algorithm supports the adjustment of filter updates in dynamic environments by balancing consistency with previous filter templates and flexibility to accommodate rapid target changes. By conducting extensive experiments on three challenging UAV tracking databases, we compare the proposed model with existing models. The experimental results demonstrate our superior performance.

This study introduces a novel approach, specifically a dynamic control authority allocation method, for implementing shared control in autonomous vehicles. Unlike conventional mixed-initiative control techniques that blend human and vehicle inputs with weights determined by predefined index, the proposed method utilizes optimization-based techniques to obtain an optimal dynamic allocation for human and vehicle inputs that satisfies safety constraints. Specifically, a convex quadratic programm (QP) is constructed incorporating control barrier functions (CBF) for safety and control Lyapunov functions (CLF) for satisfying automated control objectives. The cost function of the QP is designed such that human weight increases with the magnitude of human input. A smooth control authority transition is obtained by optimizing over the change rate of the weight instead of the weight itself. The proposed method is verified in lane-changing scenarios with human-in-the-loop (HmIL) and hardware-in-the-loop (HdIL) experiments. Results show that the proposed method outperforms index-based control authority allocation method in terms of agility, safety and comfort.},

In this paper, we consider it is crucial to learn node-specific parameters and adaptive graphs with complete edge information. To show this, we design a model based on graph structure that decouples nodes and edges into two modules. Each module extracts temporal and spatial features simultaneously. The adaptive node optimization module is used to learn the specific parameter patterns of all nodes, and the adaptive edge optimization module aims to mine the interdependencies among different nodes. Then we propose a Decoupled Adaptive Graph Convolution Attention Network for Traffic Forecasting (DAGCAN), which relies on the above two modules to dynamically capture the fine-grained spatio-temporal relationships in traffic data.

  abstract     = {Bike Sharing Systems (BSS) represent a sustainable and efficient urban transportation solution. A major challenge in BSS is repositioning bikes to avoid shortage events when users encounter empty or full bike lockers. Existing algorithms unrealistically rely on precise demand forecasts and tend to overlook substantial operational costs associated with reallocations. This paper introduces a novel Cost-aware Adaptive Bike Repositioning Agent (CABRA), which harnesses advanced deep reinforcement learning techniques in dock-based BSS. By analyzing demand patterns, CABRA learns adaptive repositioning strategies aimed at reducing shortages and enhancing truck route planning efficiency, significantly lowering operational costs. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation of CABRA utilizing real-world data from Dublin, London, Paris, and New York. The reported results show that CABRA achieves operational efficiency that outperforms or matches very challenging baselines, obtaining a significant cost reduction. Its performance on the largest city comprising 1765 docking stations highlights the efficiency and scalability of the proposed solution even when applied to BSS with a great number of docking stations.},

The problem of cooperative interception is formulated as a leader-follower optimal tracking control problem based on the differential graphical game subject to a nonautonomous leading vehicle with bounded control inputs. Utilizing the backstepping method, the guidance law is divided into a feedforward part for generating the desired state signals and compensates for the impact of input saturation, and a data-driven feedback part based on the differential graphical game that regulates tracking errors due to unknown target maneuvers while optimizing interactive performance indices. The uniform ultimate bounded property of the tracking errors in the closed-loop system can be guaranteed and the predefined interactive cost function can be optimized by the proposed guidance law. Simulation examples of cooperative interception are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

In this paper, we present a lightweight anonymous authenticated key agreement (LWAKA) scheme for VANETs, supporting lightweight anonymous authentication and key agreement between vehicles and RSUs simultaneously. In particular, vehicles’ authentication information is synchronized to target RSUs in advance for accelerating authentication, and lightweight cryptographic operations (i.e., hash function, hash-based message authentication, physical unclonable function, fuzzy extractor and symmetric encryption) are employed to ensure the high efficiency of AKA in terms of computation and communication overheads. The system efficiency and privacy are balanced through modeling the relationship between the frequency of pseudonym updates and the unlinkability of the vehicles’ new and old pseudonyms. Security analysis shows that LWAKA not only achieves anonymity, conditional privacy, pseudonym unlinkability, key escrow freeness, and physical security, but also resists against most known attacks. Comparative experimental results demonstrate that LWAKA outperforms existing schemes in terms of lightweight design.},

  abstract     = {Map matching is crucial to facilitating location-based services, and recent advancements in map matching have demonstrated excellent performance with high-quality data. However, the use of low-precision devices often introduces high measurement noise, and the slow update rate of maps may result in errors in digital maps. Consequently, multiple types of noise significantly impact the performance of map matching algorithms. To tackle this issue, this paper presents a novel multi-noise perception framework, named MPF, aiming to enhance the performance and robustness of existing map matching algorithms. The main challenge lies in detecting anomalies during map matching, identifying the root causes, and devising appropriate solutions. Firstly, we propose a matching quality assessment (MQA) method that assesses abnormal variance in matching probability. Secondly, we introduce a multiple noise discrimination (MND) mechanism to effectively differentiate between measurement noise and map errors. Thirdly, we present a missing segment generation (MSG) scheme that dynamically fills in map gaps to prevent significant detours. To validate the effectiveness of MPF, we conduct experiments using real-world taxi trajectories from four cities, covering a total distance of 79,670.6 km. MPF is compare with seven online map matching algorithms and is used to optimize their performance. The experiments show that MPF outperforms the top baselines by 15.6%-26.9% and enhances their performance by 18.7%-38.2%.},

  abstract     = {Conducting real-world train crash experiments is the most straightforward and effective method to research the train’s crashworthiness and enhance passive safety protection. As a non-contact measurement method, high-speed camera can efficiently capture the evolving motion patterns of trains under the high-speed states. Traditional data extraction methods rely on expert-based manual annotations, which are susceptible to factors such as illumination changes, scale variance, and shock debris. Inspired by the tremendous success of Deep Neural Networks in the computer vision community, we firstly collect 75 real-world train crash scenes and manually annotated them to form the Crash2024 dataset, enriching the community’s data resources. Moreover, we propose a novel Gradient-guided Joint representation loss with Adaptive neck Detection network (GJADet). At the macro level, we embed the adaptive module into the Path Aggregation Feature Pyramid Network, which combines multiple self-attention mechanisms to achieve scale-awareness, spatial-awareness, and task-awareness, improving the detector’s representation ability and alleviating the dense-small characteristics of the ‘point’ class without significant computational overhead. At the micro level, due to the extreme imbalance of ‘point’ class compared to other classes, we propose a gradient-guided joint representation classification loss to mitigate the long-tailed detection issue. Moreover, the classification and regression are joint representation to maintain consistency between training and inference phase. On the Crash2024, GJADet achieves the performance improvement of 3.5AP and significantly alleviate the accuracy loss problem for rare categories.

After a disaster, to quickly and optimally restore the damaged things, including physical systems (e.g., transport networks) and the environment, needs decision makers to own sufficient data/information. Unmanned vehicle detection systems (UVDS) are undoubtedly feasible tools in collecting such data in a harsh environment. The most important challenges in UVDS management are on modeling the UVDS data layer and multi-stage recovery strategies, which have received little research. To address such problems, this paper proposes a multi-stage control strategy for UVDS based on Internet of Things (IoT). The optimal decision is decided by utilizing four indicators: performance recovery efficiency, normal detection probability, operation cost, and economic benefit cost, respectively. The simulation results show that the proposed strategy improves the performance recovery efficiency by 12.1% and the normal detection probability by 3.9%, the operation cost declines by 58.4%, and the economic benefit cost by 75.9% compared with the general control strategy.},

By enhancing the perceptual capabilities of the model to accurately anticipate the actions of vulnerable road users, the overall driving experience can be significantly improved, ensuring higher levels of safety. Existing research efforts focusing on the prediction of pedestrians’ crossing intentions have predominantly relied on vision-based deep learning models. However, these models continue to exhibit shortcomings in terms of robustness when faced with adverse weather conditions and domain adaptation challenges. Furthermore, little attention has been given to evaluating the real-time performance of these models. To address these aforementioned limitations, this study introduces an innovative framework for pedestrian crossing intention prediction. The framework incorporates an image enhancement pipeline, which enables the detection and rectification of various defects that may arise during unfavorable weather conditions. Subsequently, a transformer-based network, featuring a self-attention mechanism, is employed to predict the crossing intentions of target pedestrians. This augmentation enhances the model’s resilience and accuracy in classification tasks. Through evaluation on the Joint Attention in Autonomous Driving (JAAD) dataset, our framework attains state-of-the-art performance while maintaining a notably low inference time. Moreover, a deployment environment is established to assess the real-time performance of the model. The results of this evaluation demonstrate that our approach exhibits the shortest model inference time and the lowest end-to-end prediction time, accounting for the processing duration of the selected inputs.},

Using actual vehicle trajectory data from a dataset, the suggested model is verified and contrasted with several well used baseline models. According to the experimental findings, the lane change intention detection technique can greatly increase prediction accuracy by fusing attention processes, reinforcement learning-based CRF, and vehicle interaction data. The system’s main components are input processing and lane-changing intention recognition. Vehicle trajectory data is cleaned, labelled, sliced, and one-hot encoded during input processing BiLSTM-F model detects driver lane-change intent, enhanced by incorporating attention mechanism to the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network, the model may give changing weights to input processing section output. This lets the model focus on lane-changing intention-affecting factors. Finally, a Reinforcement Learning-based Conditional Random Field (CRF) efficiently determines the globally optimal lane-changing intention. This field fully represents input data temporal interdependence. The model was trained and tested on the public NGSIM dataset. Validation results show it can achieve up to 97.19% accuracy and predict a vehicle’s lane change intention with 94.16% accuracy, two seconds before the actual maneuver occurs.

However, if the data in ITS is attacked, such as tampering or forgery, it will endanger public safety and cause social losses. Therefore, this paper proposes a watermarking that can verify the integrity of copyright in response to the needs of ITS, termed ITSmark. ITSmark focuses on functions such as extracting watermarks, verifying permission, and tracing tampered locations. The scheme uses the copyright information to build the multi-bit space and divides this space into multiple segments. These segments will be assigned to tokens. Thus, the next token is determined by its segment which contains the copyright. In this way, the obtained data contains the custom watermark. To ensure the authorization, key parameters are encrypted during copyright embedding to obtain cipher data. Only by possessing the correct cipher data and private key, can the user entirely extract the watermark. Experiments show that ITSmark surpasses baseline performances in data quality, extraction accuracy, and unforgeability. It also shows unique capabilities of permission verification and tampered location tracing, which ensures the security of extraction and the reliability of copyright verification. Furthermore, ITSmark can also customize the watermark embedding position and proportion according to user needs, making embedding more flexible.},

In this context, the development of a new generation of maritime intelligent supervision systems, which rely on precise information perception and machine learning-based technologies, is crucial for ensuring the safety of maritime navigation. Traditional methods for detecting abnormal ship behavior often suffer from inadequate feature extraction capabilities, leading to ineffective and inaccurate anomaly detection. To address this issue, this paper introduces a Transformer-GSA encoder detection model. This model enhances ship information data through BCE-GAN, extracts multi-layer convolutional features, and utilizes the Transformer-GSA module to capture the dependencies between trajectory features and time-series data, thereby effectively identifying abnormal ship behaviors. An evaluation conducted using AIS data from the Yantai-Qingdao route in January 2021 demonstrates that the model achieves an accuracy of 96.26%, with a reduced parameter count of 12.11M. These results confirm the model’s efficacy and superiority in detecting abnormal ship trajectories, contributing to the reduction of maritime accidents and illegal activities, alleviating the management burden on duty personnel, and enhancing the quality of intelligent ship traffic services and port operation efficiency under the maritime Internet of Things architecture.},

To detect real-time driving goals using AI for providing effective decision aids, this research introduces the Framework of Adaptive Driving (FAD), which considers cognitive activities and action strategies. We have outlined five driving goals to elucidate the connections between Situation Awareness (SA), and intentions. The study involved 31 participants and 573 driving simulation events, during which we collected both eye-tracking and kinetic data. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) identified 8 factors, categorized into SA and maneuver-related factors. Statistical and qualitative analysis follow up to specify the varying requirements among the driving foals defined. Generally, factor ‘Cognitive load’ can reflect cognitive activities, while ‘Saccade on the surroundings’ and ‘Saccade movement’ can indicate action strategies. For the goals where emerging risks are not a concern‘, Active acceleration’ signifies drivers’ intention to enhance driving efficiency. However, the diverse features in ‘Saccade on the surroundings’ imply varying driving considerations. Goals for routine tasks focus on internal vehicle operations, while goals for driving benefits management highlight adjacent surroundings. Conversely, for goals addressing emerging risks‘, Deceleration’ prevails. Furthermore‘, Steering strategy’ implies a preference for steering when SA is adequate. In this context, SA-related factors like ‘Front observation’, ‘Saccade movement’, and ‘Cognitive load’ signify efforts to enhance SA under time constraints. However, for the driving goals under extreme urgency, the factor ‘Lateral movement’ replaces ‘Steering strategy’, implying severe steering without adequate SA.},

  abstract     = {Effective multi-intersection collaboration is crucial for mitigating urban traffic congestion through reinforcement learning (RL)-based traffic signal control (TSC). Existing work mainly considers scenarios involving a single vehicle type, where cooperation is typically limited to neighboring intersections. However, in urban traffic scenarios where high priority vehicles coexist with ordinary vehicles, considering only a limited number of neighboring nodes may be insufficient to ensure the swift passage of high priority vehicles while minimizing the impact on overall traffic efficiency. Therefore, we formulate the multiple intersections’ decision-making process in urban scenarios as a Markov game and propose a novel centralized cooperative RL framework called MATLIT to solve the game. Specifically, we adopt a multi-agent transformer (MAT)-based architecture that facilitates efficient global cooperation among intersections. The attention mechanism and auto-regressive process of the MAT effectively mitigate the curse of the dimensionality problem, which guarantees MATLIT to tackle large-scale traffic scenarios. Meanwhile, the stability and sequence action generation capacity of the MAT-based architecture is further enhanced by incorporating MAT with a gated mechanism. Furthermore, considering the inherent topological constraints in urban traffic scenarios, we utilize graph attention networks (GATs) to capture graph-structured mutual influences. Additionally, in response to the urban traffic scenarios with various types of high priority vehicles that have time-varying priorities, we integrate the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm to enhance the exploration capabilities of our framework, allowing it to learn robust strategies in heterogeneous traffic conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed MATLIT framework outperforms all baselines and can reduce high priority vehicles’ waiting time by 24.57% while reducing the average waiting time of all vehicles by 18.51% in realistic urban scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Travel data containing personal identification information needs to be anonymized before being shared and analyzed for privacy considerations. While this approach protects personal privacy, it makes it difficult for researchers and planners to identify the same traveler from different databases and to construct complete multi-modal trips, which greatly reduces the value of data. To address this challenge, this paper develops TBLink, a method to match individual travelers between different modes. The underlying idea is that if a traveler makes a transfer, the spatiotemporal signatures of the previous and next trips will be similar and must satisfy certain conditions. When this pattern occurs for two travelers in the two datasets repeatedly, we can infer that the two travelers are actually the same person. The matching of travelers is regarded as a stable matching problem, and the Gale-Shapley algorithm is used to solve the problem. TBLink is demonstrated using metro and bus trip data from Chengdu City between January and March 2021. The results show that the precision, recall, and recovery rate of user matching are 80.83%, 92.82%, and 10.56% respectively, and the matching is more reliable as the dataset increases. Sensitivity analysis is performed to study the effect of several model parameters on the matching performance.},

However, its applicability in open-world scenarios is often limited due to the lack of quantifying uncertainty in both data and models. In recent years, a multitude of uncertainty quantification (UQ) approaches for neural networks have emerged and found applications in safety-critical domains such as autonomous vehicles and medical analysis. This paper aims to review the latest advancements in UQ methods and investigate their application specifically in the field of computer vision and autonomous vehicles. Initially, we identify several key qualifications, namely practicability, robustness, accuracy, scalability, and efficiency (referred to as PRASE), and employ them as evaluation criteria throughout this study. By considering these criteria as uniform measurements, we meticulously evaluate and compare the performance of different types of UQ methods, including Bayesian methods, ensemble methods, and single deterministic methods. Furthermore, we delve into the discussion of their application in diverse tasks within the autonomous vehicle domain, such as semantic segmentation, object detection, depth estimation, and end-to-end control. Through comprehensive analysis and comparison, we identify a range of challenges and propose future research directions in this field. Our findings shed light on the importance of addressing uncertainty quantification in deep learning models and provide insights into enhancing the reliability and performance of autonomous vehicles in real-world scenarios.},

Different from vehicle based trajectory recovery, it suffers from the heterogeneity and sparsity issues arising from the insufficient data labelled for distinct transportation modes (e.g., obtaining limited individual trajectories from modes like walking or cycling due to privacy concerns while obtaining rich vehicle trajectories from the mode like driving). To alleviate this, we develop a novel Cross-trAnsportation-mode Knowledge transfEr method with meta learning, coined as Cake, to first learn generalized parameters from source modes (i.e., the relatively dense modes) and then share the meta knowledge with the targets (i.e., more sparse modes), which significantly improve the recovery performance for the sparse. To achieve this, we first develop an efficient fine-GRAined Personalized trajectory rEcovery model called Grape, to incorporate the cross-granularity features with coarse-centered and fine-centered subgraph learning and learn the intrinsic characteristics of transportation modes with auto-correlation efficiently. Then we design a personalized memory to store distinct parameters for diverse interests of individual groups and read the memory for predictor’s input features according to the previous learnt features. At last, we employ the feature reuse strategy based on meta learning to iteratively make adaptions from the source to the target. Extensive experimental results on real-world dataset demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-arts for the sparse modes.},

  abstract     = {Vision-based intelligent systems are extensively used in autonomous driving, traffic monitoring, and transportation surveillance due to their high performance, low cost, and ease of installation. However, their effectiveness is often compromised by adverse conditions such as haze, fog, low light, motion blur, and low resolution, leading to reduced visibility and increased safety risks. Additionally, the prevalence of high-definition imaging in embedded and mobile devices presents challenges related to the conflict between large image sizes and limited computing resources. To address these issues and enhance visual perception for intelligent systems operating under adverse conditions, this study proposes an all-in-one isomorphic dual-branch (IDB) framework consisting of two branches with identical structures for different functions, a loss-attention (LA) learning strategy, and feature fusion super-resolution (FFSR) module. The versatile IDB network employs a simple and effective encoder-decoder structure as the backbone for both branches, which can be replaced with task-specific tailored backbones. The plug-in LA strategy differentiates the functions of the two branches, adapting them to various tasks without increasing computational demands during inference. The FFSR module concatenates multi-scale features and restores details progressively in downsampled images, producing outputs with improved visibility, brightness, edge sharpness, and color fidelity. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms several state-of-the-art methods for image dehazing, low-light enhancement, image deblurring, and super-resolution image reconstruction while maintaining low computational overhead.

  abstract     = {In the intelligent transportation system, the collected traffic data are usually incomplete. The low-rank completion models are effective in processing missing traffic data (MTD) imputation. However, the existing low-rank completion models encounter the following challenges: 1) Incorporating spatio-temporal information of traffic data often leads to significant time overhead; 2) To reduce the time overhead, some models based on the low-rank completion only embed the temporal information and discard the spatial information, thereby resulting in low imputation accuracy; 3) Missing traffic data carries complex spatio-temporal information, requiring multi-faceted analysis to extract valuable insights. To address these issues, we propose an efficient fourth-order dimension preserved tensor completion (FDPTC) with temporal constraint model. It works based on our proposed fourth-order dimension preserved (FDP) tensor decomposition model to capture the spatio-temporal information of traffic data from a high-dimensional perspective by extending dimensions. Additionally, we embed a temporal constraint into FDP tensor decomposition model to ensure consistency of MTD and introduce a non-negative constraint to accelerate convergence speed. By constructing this model, we successfully avoid direct operations on the extra information matrix/tensor, thereby optimizing efficiency. Experimental results on four real traffic datasets demonstrate that our proposed model achieves significantly higher imputation accuracy at an affordable computational burden compared with state-of-the-art models.},

In this study, we propose an innovative unified multimodal LiDAR segmentation network, named Align and Blend (A2Blend for short), which skillfully integrates three representative forms of point clouds: point view, voxel view, and range view. The core innovation of A2Blend lies in addressing two primary tasks: Align and Blend. For the “Align” task, we have carefully designed a learnable cross-modal association module, whose core is a unique “Cross-Modal Triplet Alignment Loss” mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of such a mechanism in the field of LiDAR segmentation. This mechanism applies principles from contrastive learning, promoting the tight clustering of similar semantic groups both within and across modalities, while increasing the separation between dissimilar groups by expanding the distance between similar and dissimilar sample clusters in the feature space. This significantly enhances the discriminative power and representational capacity of the feature embeddings. For the “Blend” task, we propose a fusion strategy that integrates intragroup self-attention within modalities and intergroup self-attention across modalities. This approach combines key concepts from standard self-attention and cross-self-attention mechanisms to achieve more comprehensive multimodal fusion. The segmentation performance on two large-scale outdoor datasets and one indoor dataset surpasses that of most state-of-the-art algorithms.},

This work studies the optimal real-time bidding strategy for an EV aggregator. Since the charging process of EVs is time-coupled, it is necessary for EV aggregators to consider future operational conditions (e.g., future EV arrivals) when deciding the current bidding strategy. However, accurately forecasting future operational conditions is challenging under the inherent uncertainties. Hence, there demands a real-time bidding strategy based solely on the up-to-date information, which is the main goal of this work. We start by developing an online optimal EV charging management algorithm for the EV aggregator via Lyapunov optimization. Based on this, an optimal real-time bidding strategy (bidding function and bounds) for the aggregator is derived. Then, an efficient yet practical algorithm is proposed to obtain the bidding strategy. It shows that the cost of the aggregator is nearly offline optimal with the proposed bidding strategy. Moreover, the wholesale electricity market clearing result aligns with the individual aggregator’s optimal charging strategy given the prices. Case studies against several benchmarks are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.},

However, substantial differences between CAVs and the prior knowledge can significantly diminish the evaluation efficiency. In response to this issue, existing studies predominantly concentrate on the adaptive design of testing scenarios during the CAV testing process. Yet, these methods have limitations in their applicability to high-dimensional scenarios. To overcome this challenge, we develop an adaptive testing environment that bolsters evaluation robustness by incorporating multiple surrogate models and optimizing the combination coefficients of these surrogate models to enhance evaluation efficiency. We formulate the optimization problem as a regression task utilizing quadratic programming. To efficiently obtain the regression target via reinforcement learning, we propose the dense reinforcement learning method and devise a new adaptive policy with high sample efficiency. Essentially, our approach centers on learning the values of critical scenes displaying substantial surrogate-to-real gaps. The effectiveness of our method is validated in high-dimensional overtaking scenarios, demonstrating that our approach achieves notable evaluation efficiency.},

Especially for thin and irregular cracks with random and expansive topologies, the loss functions used in current deep learning-based crack segmentation models are sensitive to single pixels, which tends to cause the model to overfit the training data, diminishing its generalization ability in real-world scenarios. Therefore, we take the loss function as a starting point and explore the introduction of proactive fault tolerance mechanisms into the training process of the crack segmentation model, which is called Proactive Fault Tolerance Loss (PFT Loss), to enhance the generalization capability of model in actual applications. Specifically, the PFT Loss function establishes correlations between the segmentation prediction pixels and the corresponding labeled pixels within the neighborhood window using Markov Random Fields (MRFs). The correlation is used as a reference for predicting relative shifts in segmented pixels. Proactive Fault Tolerance is performed on the loss between labeling and prediction to achieve a more natural and adaptive training method for crack segmentation. Full experiments are conducted on five public crack datasets and one self-constructed dataset. The experimental results indicate that the model trained with PFT Loss has better segmentation performance compared to other loss functions.},

This paper proposes an Order Processing and Robot Scheduling Problem (OPRSP), which optimizes order allocation, rack selection, and robot scheduling together. A mixed integer programming model is developed for OPRSP to minimize the system completion time of fulfilling a given set of customer orders. In OPRSP, customer orders are reorganized into multiple order batches, each allocated to a picking station and treated as an aggregated order. A multi-station visit policy is employed to allow one rack carried by a robot to visit multiple picking stations. A variable neighborhood search-based algorithm is proposed to solve OPRSP. Seven neighborhood structures are specifically devised for OPRSP. Some heuristic algorithms, including order batching algorithm, rack selection algorithm, order batch allocation algorithm, robot task assignment algorithm, and robot scheduling algorithm, are newly devised for initial solution generation and neighborhood structures. The superior performance of the proposed method is validated through a series of experiments and comparisons with other approaches. Experiments reveal that compared to optimizing robot scheduling only, integrating robot scheduling with order processing decisions can greatly improve picking efficiency.},

  abstract     = {In underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs), source nodes serving as data centers hold significant commercial value and strategic importance, and the leakage of their location information may result in immeasurable negative consequences. Presently, the methods employed to protect the location privacy of source nodes within UASNs face challenges such as limited network security duration, high node energy consumption, and prolonged data transmission delays. Additionally, security research has predominantly focused on passive attacks, with insufficient provisions against active threats. To address these issues, this study proposes a polygonal phantom source position privacy protection algorithm based on a secure zone (PPSZ) in autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)-aided UASNs. First, a polygonal secure zone is defined with the source node at its center. Phantom nodes are strategically selected from nodes situated outside this zone, leveraging the relative angles between nodes to deter passive attacks while mitigating data transmission delays. Next, the selection of relay nodes is optimized using the Q-learning algorithm, where each node adjusts its selection strategy based on real-time feedback, further lowering node energy consumption. Finally, auxiliary nodes are deployed using a nonuniform clustering strategy to collectively transmit interference signals, effectively disrupt active attacks, and ensure the secure transmission of source data. Simulation results demonstrate that the PPSZ algorithm can better balance the relationships among safety time, node energy consumption, and data transmission delays.},

However, the noise of complex environment may lead to motion-blur or occlusion problems, which raise the tough challenge to real-time recognition with high accuracy and robust. In this article, we propose IECES-network which with improved encoders and Siamese net. The three-stage approach of our method includes Efficient-CNN based encoders, Siamese backbone and the fully-connected layers. We firstly use convolutional encoders to extract and encode the traffic sign features of augmented training samples and standard images. Then, we design the Siamese neural network with Efficient-CNN based encoder and contrastive loss function, which can be trained to improve the robustness of TSR problem when facing the samples of motion-blur and occlusion by computing the distance between inputs and templates. Additionally, the template branch of the proposed network can be stopped when executing the recognition tasks after training to raise the process speed of our real-time model, and alleviate the computational resource and parameter scale. Finally, we recombined the feature code and a fully-connected layer with SoftMax function to classify the codes of samples and recognize the category of traffic signs. The results of experiments on the Tsinghua-Tencent 100K dataset and the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark dataset demonstrate the performance of the proposed IECES-network. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, in the case of motion-blur and occluded environment, the proposed method achieves competitive performance precision-recall and accuracy metric average is 88.1%, 86.43% and 86.1% with a 2.9M lightweight scale, respectively.

However, most existing vision-based railway obstacle detection algorithms are limited to stationary cameras, which restricts the monitoring range. In contrast, onboard approaches enable full-line monitoring but face more challenges in achieving high accuracy and real-time performance. To address these challenges, we developed an onboard end-to-end multitask perception model (MTP-Rail), which includes variants of different scales (S, M, L) to realize railway obstacle detection in real-time with high accuracy. Our model consists of two decoders, which can simultaneously implement the tasks of object of interest detection and track segmentation. In addition, we designed a post-processing scheme to analyze the relationship between the detected object and the track and assess the obstacle risk level. Experiments on our dataset show that one of the proposed model MTP-rail-M achieved an 89.6% classification accuracy of obstacle risk level and 54.3% on mAP, 78.6% on mPA and 64.9% on mIoU with an inference speed of 181 FPS at an input size of $640\times640$ on RTX 3060Ti.

First, by analyzing the effects of nonlinear tire dynamics on path tracking performance, the tire cornering stiffnesses are treated as unknown parameters in the modeling process, which contributes to improving the robustness of the vehicle control system. Second, to handle the unknown tire cornering stiffness in system matrices and control coefficients, an adaptive fixed-time path tracking control strategy with high-gain observer-based output feedback is developed. Different from the existing methods, the lower bounds of unknown control coefficients are incorporated into the Lyapunov function to effectively eliminate the requirement of tire cornering stiffness and their bounds information. Moreover, the full state constraints, formulated based on the vehicle stability margins, are taken into account to enhance the dynamic stability of the vehicle. Based on the barrier Lyapunov stability theory, it is proven that the designed adaptive backstepping controller guarantees the fixed-time stability of the closed-loop system, and that all vehicle states remain within the constraints of stability region. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is demonstrated through simulation and comparison results.},

  abstract     = {We propose a robust control method for vehicle platoons based on a unified spacing policy, which can be customized for different vehicles within the platoon. This spacing policy integrates the constant time headway (CTH) and constant spacing (CS) policies into a single framework with some modifications. The policy can be adjusted to resemble either a CTH-like or CS-like approach by simply tuning a weighting factor for each vehicle. To increase road throughput, the velocity difference between the current vehicle’s velocity and the preceding vehicle’s low-pass filtered velocity is introduced to the proposed policy. A second-order low-pass filter is used for the preceding vehicle’s velocity. As a result, the sliding variable for each vehicle’s spacing error only requires the current vehicle’s position, velocity, acceleration, and the preceding vehicle’s position and velocity, all of which can be measured by onboard sensors. This design reduces the platoon’s reliance on inter-vehicle communication. A predefined-time modification is introduced to eliminate nonzero initial conditions in spacing and velocity errors, thereby improving transient performance. The local controller for each vehicle is based on a third-order nonlinear system model that accounts for nonlinear disturbances and engine lag. A smoothed sliding mode robust controller is then designed for each vehicle to stabilize its spacing error. The input-to-state stability (ISS) property of the spacing error is established through rigorous theoretical analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical strong frequency domain string stability (PSFSS) of the entire vehicle platoon, focusing on signal oscillations along the platoon. Finally, extensive numerical studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Although many existing studies have made efforts to reconstruct OD flow from passenger counts at each station, few of them tracked individual passengers because it is still infeasible in practice to monitor all onboard passengers throughout their entire journeys. This study proposes a passenger reidentification method for estimating route-level bus passenger OD flow using video images at bus doors. All boarding and alighting passengers are identified and their appearance features are extracted from video images. Boarding passengers at upstream stations and alighting passengers at downstream stations are matched considering not only the similarities of their appearance features but also historical alighting probabilities. Reliable passenger matches are filtered out by a matching probability threshold. The corresponding accurate OD samples, together with the boarding and alighting counts at each station, are utilized to estimate OD flow between bus stations. A comprehensive case study was carried out on an operational bus route in Shanghai, China during morning and evening peak hours over 15 weekdays. Results of the case study showed that the proposed method is capable of generating accurate OD estimates, with cosine similarities remaining above 0.9, root mean square errors within 0.5 person, and mean absolute percentage errors of approximately 12%. The error metrics were decreased by nearly half compared to the traditional method that only uses the boarding and alighting counts.},

  abstract     = {Timely detection and treatment of road cracks are crucial to prevent further deterioration of pavement. An accurate road crack detection algorithm can significantly reduce the human resources required for pavement maintenance. However, existing CNN-based object detectors, such as the You Only Look Once (YOLO) series of algorithms, face challenges such as receptive field fixation and information loss during feature extraction, resulting in lower accuracy in road crack detection. Therefore, we propose the Selective Dynamic Feature Compensation-YOLO (SDFC-YOLO) algorithm for pavement distress detection. Firstly, we introduce the Dynamic Downsampling Module (DDM), which adaptively adjusts the sampling positions of the convolutional kernel during the feature extraction process, addressing the issue of a fixed receptive field. Secondly, we propose a novel feature fusion method compensating for lost feature information in the path aggregation network. Lastly, we design a multi-scale weight selection module based on the above feature fusion method. It aims to utilize the channel weights of high-level features to guide bottom-level features and select more important features for compensation, thereby further enhancing detection accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to the benchmark model YOLOv8s, our method improves Precision (P), Recall (R), mean Average Precision@0.5 (mAP@0.5), and F1 score on the UAPD dataset by 6.8%, 2.4%, 5.3%, and 4.3%, respectively.

  abstract     = {The accuracy and stability of motion prediction are crucial for the safe planning of autonomous driving systems. The widely used attention mechanisms effectively improve prediction accuracy. However, their computational cost grows quadratically with sequence length, presenting challenges for handling complex, large-scale scenarios. The attention patterns of motion prediction tasks exhibit significant data-related sparsity, indicating that not all scene elements are worth interaction. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel motion prediction framework that enhances the efficiency and stability of interaction fusion while achieving promising prediction accuracy. Firstly, an adaptive self-distillation attention module based on sparse interaction graph is designed. This module adaptively filters high-value sequences for each target to achieve sparse attention calculation and balance scene scale. Due to the lack of interaction labels in the original dataset, a self-distillation strategy is employed for model training. Secondly, a multi-stage dynamic anchor decoder is introduced that leverages the information filtering and aggregation capabilities of the sparse attention mechanism to improve prediction accuracy. The decoder dynamically updates the target anchor representations as the prediction progresses, ensuring consistency between interaction states and the prediction process in long-term forecasting. This approach effectively focuses attention calculation on the most relevant scene context fusion and trajectory decoding at each prediction stage. Validation results on Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive accuracy while effectively reducing computational resource consumption. The proposed method can also serve as a plug-in that can be seamlessly incorporated into standard motion prediction pipelines to optimize scene interaction, making it more friendly to low-cost devices.},

  abstract     = {Pedestrian intent prediction is critical for autonomous driving, as accurately predicting crossing intentions helps prevent collisions and ensures the safety of both pedestrians and passengers. Recent research has focused on vision-based deep neural networks for this task, but challenges remain. First, current methods suffer from low efficiency in multi-feature fusion and unreliable predictions under challenging conditions. Additionally, real-time performance is essential in practical applications, so the efficiency of the algorithm is crucial. To address these issues, we propose a novel architecture, Dual-STGAT, which uses a dual-level spatio-temporal graph network to extract pedestrian pose and scene interaction features, reducing information loss and improving feature fusion efficiency. The model captures key features of pedestrian behavior and the surrounding environment through two modules: the Pedestrian Module and the Scene Module. The Pedestrian Module extracts pedestrian motion features using a spatio-temporal graph attention network, while the Scene Module models interactions between pedestrians and surrounding objects by integrating visual, semantic, and motion information through a graph network. Extensive experiments conducted on the PIE and JAAD datasets show that Dual-STGAT achieves over 90% accuracy in pedestrian crossing intention prediction, with inference latency close to 5ms, making it well-suited for large-scale production autonomous driving systems that demand both performance and computational efficiency.},

An advanced multi-frequency impedance measurement (MFIM) system was used to operate the IL sensors. For a passing vehicle, the impedance of every IL sensor at three different operating frequencies is computed and finally recorded at a sampling frequency of 1 kHz. Each of the 12 recorded signals provides a complex-value vehicle magnetic profile (VMP). Based on the VMPs from two IL sensors positioned one after the other, an accurate measurement of vehicle speed is obtained. Furthermore, the system can capture images of vehicles. A reference database of VMPs was created for various vehicle categories. The software selects 10 statistical features from each real and imaginary VMP part. Eight machine learning algorithms were implemented using ready-made Python3 implementations. Cross-validation accuracy was tested for five feature configurations, including slim and wide IL sensors. The Random Forest (RF) algorithm, utilizing 20 features from the complex VMP, achieved an accuracy of 99.8 % for the wide IL sensor.

  abstract     = {Agent-controlled intelligent subnetworks are envisioned as an integral part of Beyond 5G (B5G) communications for automatically selecting distinct policies based on dynamic performance constraints. In the B5G era, energy efficiency will be a prominent feature of Radio Access Network (RAN) slicing for achieving sustainable networks and lowering operational costs while multiplexing users with heterogeneous Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements. Considering the importance of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) within the realm of B5G applications, in this paper, we propose the LazyRAN framework as an energy-efficient Radio Resource Block (RRB) allocation approach for multi-policy RAN slicing in B5G ITS edge networks. Initially, we focus on resource utilization efficiency and define Lazy Skip Markov Decision Process (LS-MDP) formulation for spectrum agents to individually perform fine and coarse stochastic control depending on performance requirements incorporating varying levels of laziness. Followingly, we propose LazyRAN framework that uses Bayesian Optimization (BO) based Offline Policy Selection (OPS) for optimality calculations in case of multiple slicing policies. Our framework enables efficient multi-policy evaluation employing both exploration and exploitation in the agent policy space. The OPS method utilizes a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate function combining logged data with online agent interactions before searching for the best slicing policy with BO. Using an energy-aware approach, hybrid QoS reward per energy consumption (HQEC), we compare the performance of LazyRAN framework in centralized and decentralized settings considering diverse agent policies. Our results show that the proposed scheme can significantly improve energy utilization with greater HQEC and higher throughput measurements while satisfying hybrid QoS demands.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle detection at night is a crucial task in Intelligent Transportation Systems. Due to the complex lighting environment, vehicle detection at night remains a challenging task. Headlights and taillights are essential cues to identify vehicles at night. However, existing methods struggle to effectively utilize the light information of the vehicle. This paper proposes a novel highlight-guided framework to identify vehicles, named HighlightNet, by utilizing both the illumination data from the vehicle lights and the reflective properties of vehicles. The framework combines vehicle detection and highlight area recognition via dual-branch joint learning. To ensure that both branches focus on the highlighted regions, Feature Similarity Awareness Attention (FSAA) is introduced to capture the common attention regions of different branches. Highlight Region Perception (HRP) is proposed to exclude streetlights and other reflective illuminations from the FSAA output, which generates a mask map capable of differentiating the foreground from the background of highlighted areas. It improves the allocation of feature weights and adaptively modifies the distribution within the dual-branch configuration. Furthermore, to address the severe pixel imbalance between the highlighted area and the background, Adaptive Spatial Balance (ASB) loss is introduced to allocate the attention towards prospective vehicle regions while diminishing the emphasis on background regions. Extensive experiments conducted on the BDD100K-Night dataset and a newly acquired dataset specifically designed for nighttime surveillance, called the NightVehicle dataset, demonstrate that HighlightNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for nighttime vehicle detection.},

Therefore, we integrate quantum computing techniques to enhance Vehicle Road Cooperation Systems (VRCS).

  abstract     = {Driving an Autonomous Vehicle (AV) in dynamic traffic is a critical task, as the overtaking maneuver being considered one of the most complex due to involvement of several sub-maneuvers. Recent advances in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) have resulted in AVs exhibiting exceptional performance in addressing overtaking-related challenges. However, the intricate nature of the overtaking presents difficulties for a RL agent to proficiently handle all its sub-maneuvers that include left lane change, right lane change and straight drive. Furthermore, the dynamic traffic restricts the RL agents to execute the sub-maneuvers at critical checkpoints involved in overtaking. To address this, we propose an approach inspired by semi-Markov options, called Dynamic Option Policy enabled Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning (DOP-HDRL). This innovative approach allows the selection of sub-maneuver agents using a single dynamic option policy, while employing individual DRL agents specifically trained for each sub-maneuver to perform tasks during overtaking in dynamic environments. By breaking down overtaking maneuvers into several sub-maneuvers and controlling them using a single policy, the DOP-HDRL approach reduces training time and computational load compared to classical DRL agents. Moreover, DOP-HDRL easily integrates basic traffic safety rules into overtaking maneuvers to offer more robust solutions. The DOP-HDRL approach is rigorously evaluated through multiple overtaking and non-overtaking scenarios inspired by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) pre-crash scenarios in the CARLA simulator. On an average, the DOP-HDRL approach shows 100% completion rate, 14% least collision rate, 25% optimal clearance distance, and 7% more average speed compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Traffic forecasting is the foundation of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). In recent, graph neural networks (GNNs) have successfully captured spatial-temporal dependencies to forecast traffic conditions by transforming traffic data in the graph domain. Nevertheless, the existing methods focus only on learning informative graph representations and fail to model informative graph structures, which hinders the capture of dynamic spatial-temporal dependencies caused by dynamic factors such as weather, accidents, and special events. In this paper, we propose a novel task-oriented Spatial Graph Structure Learning (SGSL) method, which aims to capture dynamic dependencies by jointly learning graph structures and graph representations. Compared to methods that use spectral graph representations, we exploit a learnable spatial graph to effectively model dynamic dependencies in traffic data. Moreover, we directly define graph convolutions on spatial relations to specify different edge weights when aggregating the information of spatial neighbours. Thus, the graph structure alterations, i.e., the relation changes, and the time-varying weights of relations can be encapsulated, thereby effectively representing dynamic dependencies. The gradient descent strategy is introduced to periodically learn a spatial graph through joint optimization with a newly designed deep graph learning model named GAT-nLSTM. In this manner, the intrinsic behaviours of nodes are learned to capture correlations across periods. Notably, the optimization process is performed under the traffic forecasting constraint to ensure that the learned spatial graph is specific to this task. Compared with those of state-of-the-art baselines, the experimental results obtained on real-world traffic datasets show significant improvement, which verifies the superiority of the proposed SGSL.},

This paper focuses on leveraging RIS to address the key obstacles encountered in vehicle communication. We propose an IoV communication system in which RIS is employed as the transmitter, operating under Nakagami-m fading channels. The basic system model consists of a radio frequency (RF) transmitter and an RIS, both serving as the transmission source. The signal is transmitted to a relay, which subsequently forwards it to multi-antenna-equipped vehicles via an amplify-and-forward (AF) scheme. We provide a thorough performance analysis of the system, deriving expressions for the outage probability and the average channel capacity.

  abstract     = {Detecting small objects in optical images and videos is a significant challenge in numerous intelligent transportation and autonomous systems. State-of-the-art generic object detection methods fail to accurately localize and identify such small objects (e.g., pedestrians, small vehicles, obstacles). Because small objects occupy only a small area in the input image (e.g., 32×32 pixels or less), the information extracted from such a small area is not always rich enough to support decision-making. Multidisciplinary strategies are being developed by researchers working at the interface of deep learning and computer vision to enhance the performance of Small Object Detection (SOD). In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of over 160 research papers published between 2017 and 2022 in order to survey this growing subject. This paper summarizes the existing literature and provides a taxonomy that illustrates the broad picture of current research. We further explore methods to boost the performance of small object detection in maritime settings, where enhanced performance is crucial for ensuring safety and managing traffic. Detecting small objects in the maritime environment requires additional considerations and the current survey aims to review the advanced techniques addressing those aspects. In addition, the popular SOD datasets for generic and maritime applications are discussed, and also well-known evaluation metrics for the state-of-the-art methods on some of the datasets are provided.

The design uses multiple computing servers and a secret sharing scheme to encrypt traffic data into several shares, each corresponding to a server. The servers then securely compute the green time plans, working directly on the encrypted data. The proposed method protects traffic data from curious computing servers and external eavesdroppers, preventing the adversaries from gaining the required information to launch a complex attack. Additionally, a detection and recovery procedure from false data injection attacks on green time signals is presented using secret reconstruction from different server combinations. Simulation results for various scenarios demonstrate the proposed method’s effectiveness in maintaining data confidentiality while achieving the same performance as an unprotected control strategy, with a reasonable addition to computation time. It also depicts a significant reduction in vulnerability against falsified green time signal attacks in terms of total travel time in the network.},

  abstract     = {Human-driven Vehicles (HVs) and Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) will inevitably coexist in the future, resulting in mixed traffic conditions. Modeling car-following behavior in such mixed traffic is crucial for better understanding the differences in driving behavior between AVs and HVs, thereby facilitating the development of AV driving strategies to enhance traffic safety. In such mixed traffic, the car-following modes typically include AVs following HVs, HVs following HVs and HVs following AVs. Previous studies have compared the driving behavior of HVs following HVs and HVs following AVs, but few have considered the driving behavior of AVs following HVs in the comparison. To bridge this gap, this paper first decomposes car-following events in mixed traffic extracted from a Lyft level-5 dataset into driving primitives using the Hidden Markov Model with Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM-HMM). Then, the Latent Dirichlet Allocation with GMM (GMM-LDA) is introduced to cluster the driving primitives into different car-following behavior patterns. Based on the identified patterns, the differences across the three car-following modes are further explored. The results show that the driving behavior under three car-following modes differs from each other. Specifically, compared to the HVs following HVs mode, in the AVs following HVs mode, AVs tend to maintain car-following behavior patterns with a longer distance gap and adopt a lower speed to ensure safety. This study offers a comprehensive understanding of car-following behavior in mixed traffic, which will facilitate the development of human-like driving strategies for AVs and enhance the safety of mixed traffic.},

However, existing array self-position determination methods show decrease in performance under multipath environments. To deal with this problem, we propose an array self-position determination method based on orthogonal grid matching with the spatial differencing method. Specifically, the direction of arrival (DOA) of direct path and multipath signals are respectively estimated by array spatial differencing method. The matching accuracy is enhanced by utilizing the prior information of direct path signal. After calculating correlation coefficients of different sources, estimated angles with high correlation are then classified into the same set. Then, the noise subspace of each angle set is reconstructed and the position is estimated by grid matching with the orthogonal property between the noise subspaces and the characteristic steering vectors. The matching results of redundant angle sets are removed as non-matching items, thus averting positioning deviations. The simulation results demonstrate that the computational complexity of the proposed method is comparable to that of the signal subspace fitting (SSF). Moreover, in terms of positioning precision, the proposed method outperforms multiple signal classification with enhanced spatial smoothing (ESSMUSIC), initial signal fitting (ISF), and SSF.},

To overcome these issues, we propose a lightweight and efficient authentication scheme that enhances vehicle privacy and security through a combination of signatures, pseudonyms, batch verification, and flexible certificate management. Our approach also employs Bloom filters to improve authentication efficiency, addressing the limitations of traditional certificate management systems that suffer from large lists and slow query times. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme ensures comprehensive security by providing two-way authentication and guaranteeing anonymity. It effectively prevents replay attacks, DoS attacks, and other potential threats. Moreover, the scheme significantly reduces both communication and computational overhead, offering an efficient and secure solution for V2R communication in VANET.},

  abstract     = {Accurate environmental perception is essential for the effective operation of autonomous vehicles. However, visual images captured in dynamic environments or adverse weather conditions often suffer from various degradations. Image restoration focuses on reconstructing clear and sharp images by eliminating undesired degradations from corrupted inputs. These degradations typically vary in size and severity, making it crucial to employ robust multi-scale representation learning techniques. In this paper, we propose Multi-Scale Feature Modulation (MSFM), a novel deep convolutional architecture for image restoration. MSFM modulates multi-scale features in both frequency and spatial domains to make features sharper and closer to that of clean images. Specifically, our multi-scale frequency attention module transforms features into multiple scales and then modulates each scale in the implicit frequency domain using pooling and attention. Moreover, we develop a multi-scale spatial modulation module to refine pixels with the guidance of local features. The proposed frequency and spatial modules enable MSFM to better handle degradations of different sizes. Experimental results demonstrate that MSFM achieves state-of-the-art performance on 12 datasets for a range of image restoration tasks, i.e., image dehazing, image defocus/motion deblurring, and image desnowing. Furthermore, the restored images significantly improve the environmental perception of autonomous vehicles.},

The method uses the edges of the color image as prior constraints to construct an image topography map as an intermediate representation and performs nonlinear adaptive reconstruction based on the image content to adjust the position and scale of the pixel-weighted neighborhood. This approach avoids incorporating depth information with different distributions when estimating missing values, resulting in a full-resolution dense depth map with sharp edges. We conducted a quantitative comparison with state-of-the-art models on the KITTI and MidAir datasets, demonstrating that our algorithm has better performance and robustness in terms of completion accuracy. We also analyzed the impact of sparsity on the algorithm’s performance and its ability to recover fine structures in dense depth results and demonstrated the reconstruction results for sparse data in real-world scenarios.},

This paper proposes a ship collision risk assessment method using radar sequential images in inland waterways or congested coastal areas. Specifically, ship targets are separated from radar images using a background subtraction algorithm, as radar echoes have limited colour, texture, and shape features. The ship trajectory is then obtained by predicting and matching the ship’s position in two adjacent frames, which provides the ship’s spatial-temporal dynamic information for collision risk assessment. The ship collision risk is quantified by integrating the Distance and Time at the Closest Point of Approach (DCPA/TCPA) indicators, and the safe and prohibited velocity space of every ship is presented to assist VTS operators in evaluating the traffic conditions and support their decisions for safe navigation. The proposed ship collision risk assessment and visualisation method is tested and verified using radar sequential images collected in the Yangtze River.},

We develop a dynamic scene graph readout model based on Global Context-Aware Attention (GCAA) to capture the spatiotemporal variability of the environment. Our approach integrates a Multi-Relational Graph Convolution Network (MR-GCN) and a Long-Short Term Memory Network (LSTM) to evaluate driver stress using field data from Nanjing, China. Results show that our model significantly improves driver stress classification, particularly for critical stress levels, with a 65.3% increase in balanced accuracy and a 38% rise in F-score compared to the baseline. The addition of GCAA enhances accuracy further, with an average improvement of 51.7%. This demonstrates our model’s superior ability to understand the contextual relationships within driving scenarios, making it highly effective for AVs to assess driver status in complex situations and interact more efficiently with human drivers. Furthermore, our model achieves a balance between accuracy and inference speed, making it suitable for real-time assessment tasks.},

  abstract     = {In complex traffic scenarios, several factors including lighting, weather, the size of the traffic participants, the distance between the traffic participants and the camera, and occlusions impact the features of the traffic participants. The impact of these factors is a huge challenge, especially for vision-based instance segmentation networks. To this end, this paper proposes an enhanced version of the RTMDet to promote the overall performance of instance segmentation in complex traffic scenarios. Firstly, an extended CSP-style backbone with large kernel convolutions of different kernel sizes is used to enhance the robustness of feature extraction capability, which contributes to obtaining more information about traffic objects of different scales. Secondly, a plugin pre-fusion module is designed to enhance the network’s robustness to multi-scale changes caused by distance changes. Additionally, instance kernel distinguish module is proposed to further highlight and distinguish different instance objects under poor lighting or weather and occlusion situations. Finally, the existing advanced image generation technology is used to expand the BDD100k dataset, enriching the dataset with severe scenarios. With an input resolution of $\mathbf{1280}\times\mathbf{720}$ on the expanded BDD100K dataset, the proposed RTMDet-R achieves an accuracy of 25.4% mAP on the instance mask and 27.8% mAP on the instance box. This surpasses other similar models in terms of accuracy. Additionally, it maintains a good inference speed of 23.1 FPS, achieving the trade-off between accuracy and speed.

However, in some unstructured environments, the point cloud registration cannot constrain the poses of the LiDAR due to its sparse geometric features, which leads to the degeneracy of multi-sensor fusion accuracy. To address this problem, we propose a novel real-time approach to sense and compensate for the degeneracy of LiDAR. Firstly, this paper introduces the degeneracy factor with clear meaning, which can measure the degeneracy of LiDAR. Then, the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) clustering method adaptively perceives the degeneracy with better environmental generalization. Finally, the degeneracy perception results are utilized to fuse LiDAR and IMU, thus effectively resisting degeneracy effects. Experiments on our dataset show the method’s high accuracy and robustness and validate our algorithm’s adaptability to different environments and LiDAR scanning modalities.},

While ensuring that each follower USV can quickly form a formation and follow the virtual leader on the desired trajectory, it reduces the execution frequency of the controller, decreases the control amplitude, and saves communication resources. Firstly, a distributed event-triggered extended state observer (ESO) is designed to observe the virtual leader’s position information, and another ESO is used to estimate the quantized state information of each USV and the uncertainty terms existing in the model. Subsequently, the kinematic guidance law and the kinetic control laws based on a time-varying threshold event-triggered mechanism are proposed in quantized environment using the hierarchical design approach. In addition, the linear splitting of the input quantization makes the designed controller no longer require a priori information on the quantization parameters. Finally, the stability of the designed distributed USV formation tracking control system with input and state quantization based on the time-varying threshold event-triggered mechanism is demonstrated by input-to-state stability theory, and the absence of Zeno behavior in the proposed control strategy is also verified.

The wheel/rail rolling-slipping performances subjected to different anti-slip control algorithms under changing wheel/rail friction conditions are compared based on train-track interaction simulations. The results demonstrate that the PID-based anti-slip controller with an optimal threshold achieves the maximum utilization of wheel/rail adhesion in the presence of low-friction conditions, outperforming the other two types of anti-slip controllers.

Given the attributes of VTCPS, the system assesses the trustworthiness of vehicle nodes within the network with an enhanced subjective logic model that integrates both direct and indirect trust, thereby building trust connections among nodes based on their contact histories. The reliability of communications is assessed based on node trust and inter-node distance, while deceptive messages and malevolent nodes inside the network are detected according to the trust evaluation outcomes. To assess the efficacy of the proposed method, four distinct assault scenarios were devised, and comparative experiments were executed on the Veins vehicular network simulation platform to evaluate the performance of the ITMS scheme under diverse attack conditions. The experimental findings indicate that the ITMS scheme can proficiently counteract diverse attacks in VTCPS and can still detect the majority of fraudulent messages and malevolent nodes, even with a 40% ratio of malicious nodes. Furthermore, the efficacy of the ITMS scheme markedly surpasses that of the baseline scheme, which consists of a subjective logic model and a distance-based weighted voting mechanism.},

  abstract     = {Spatialtemporal traffic data are collected by a wide array of data collection devices deployed in intelligent transportation systems, which play crucial roles in data-driven intelligent transportation systems. However, hardware malfunctions or software system errors can lead to the inability to collect accurate data. Incomplete data in intelligent transportation systems can cause difficulties for subsequent applications, such as traffic flow anomaly detection and forecasting. Recently, low-rank tensor-based methods that characterize the global correlation of high-dimensional data have achieved superior performance. However, the majority of tensor-based approaches primarily account for the global correlation within the target traffic data, which is not sufficient to recover some challenging missing scenarios, such as fiber missing and slice missing that often occur in real situations. In this manuscript, we suggest a flexible method to explore the global correlation, local smoothness, and nonlocal self-similar redundancy in traffic data to improve recovery accuracy. Specifically, we utilize the multidimensional tensor nuclear norm to characterize the correlation structure, the multidimensional total variation to maintain smoothness detail, and the plug-and-play term to promote nonlocal self-similarity. The primary merits of this model lie in the fact that these priors characterize data features from different perspectives and complement each other. We develop an alternating direction method of multipliers to achieve efficient optimization for each variable.

  abstract     = {The target enclosing control problem for autonomous vehicles with uncertainties necessitates simultaneous consideration of control optimality, robustness, and safety-guided performance constraints. This paper presents a performance-prescribed optimal control algorithm using control barrier function (CBF)-based reinforcement learning (RL) to address the above problem, which contains two key contributions. First, a special CBF-based argument term is developed and embedded into the reward function to characterize environmental feedback regarding the risk of violating constraints, which enables the controller to confine enclosing errors within declared boundaries with minimal intervention. Second, a critic-only neural network is utilized to synthesize the optimal control policy, where a novel fixed-time updating law is presented to accelerate the weight convergence to ideal values within a fixed settling time, thereby enhancing the online learning ability and further improving control performance. Theoretical outcomes related to learning convergence, safety, stability, and robustness are rigorously verified. Simulations reveal that the proposed strategy outperforms the previously designed enclosing controllers based on the non-RL and RL ways in terms of complying with prescribed safety constraints and optimizing long-term performance.},

To estimate the unknown system dynamics, an unknown system dynamic estimator (USDE) is designed, where the unknown system dynamic can be accurately estimated by using the input-output information, this is helpful for controller design. Then, a RL based optimal control method is developed, where the prescribed performance function (PPF) is applied, the system states can be effectively defined within a certain range. To realize the online solution for optimal control, we design a new adaptive law based on the adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) framework to online learn the critic neural network (NN) weights, because of the strong convergence, the proposed learning algorithm can be effectively applied in practical industrial systems.

  abstract     = {The gradual advancement of Internet-connected vehicles has transformed roads and highways into an intelligent ecosystem. This advancement has led to a widespread adoption of vehicular networks, driven by the enhanced capabilities of automobiles. However, managing mobility-aware computations, ensuring network security amidst instability, and overcoming resource constraints pose significant challenges in heterogeneous vehicular network applications within Fog computing. Moreover, the latency overhead remains a critical issue for tasks sensitive to latency and deadlines. The objective of this research is to develop a Mobility-aware Secured offloading and Scheduling (M-SOS) technique for a Dew-enabled vehicular Fog-Cloud computing system. This technique aims to address the issues outlined above by moving the computations closer to the edge of the network. Initially, a Dew-facilitated vehicular Fog network is proposed, leveraging heterogeneous computing nodes to handle diverse vehicular requests efficiently and ensuring uninterrupted services within the vehicular network. Further, task management is optimized using a Fuzzy logic that categorizes tasks based on their specific requirements and identifies the target layers for offloading. Besides, a cryptographic algorithm known as SHA-256 RSA enhances security. Moreover, a novel Linear Weight-based JAYA scheduling algorithm is introduced to assign tasks to appropriate computing nodes. The proposed algorithm surpasses the comparable algorithms by 23% in terms of AWT, 18% in terms of latency rate, 14% and 23% in terms of meeting the hard-deadline (H_d) and soft-deadline (S_d), and 35% in terms of average system cost, respectively.},

As T-CPS increasingly relies on visual information, such as real-time images captured by traffic cameras, for tasks like traffic sign recognition and autonomous driving, the risk of image-based backdoor attacks has grown substantially. Although various detection-based defense techniques have shown some success in identifying backdoored models, they often fail to fully eliminate backdoor effects, leaving residual security risks. To address this challenge, we propose a Frequency-Domain Hybrid Distillation (FDHD) method for backdoor defense, which effectively weakens the association between backdoor triggers and target labels by combining distillation mechanisms in both the frequency and pixel domains. Furthermore, we design a loss function that integrates feature reconstruction with adaptive alignment, enhancing the student network’s ability to mimic the teacher network and thereby bolstering the backdoor defense capability. Extensive experiments conducted by FDHD on multiple benchmark datasets against the five latest attacks demonstrate that our proposed defense method effectively reduces backdoor threats while maintaining high accuracy in predicting clean samples. This approach will protect against image-based backdoor attacks in T-CPS and lay the foundation for enhancing future traffic safety.},

However, efficiently managing the sharing and processing of large volumes of sensing data presents challenges due to restricted communication and computation resources. This study introduces an integrated sensing, communication, and computation (ISCC)-based task offloading and resource allocation (ITORA) framework, which optimizes cooperative perception by determining what data to share, which vehicles to involve, and how to process the data effectively. We develop an information value function to evaluate the data quality for each vehicle. Subsequently, we design strategies for sensing task allocation, task offloading, and resource allocation to enable value-driven data selection at a subregion level, facilitating collaborative computing among edge servers and vehicles. Additionally, we formulate an optimization problem aimed at maximizing information value while minimizing delay and energy consumption, subject to constraints on a full region of interest (RoI) coverage, delay, wireless bandwidth, and computational resources. We decompose the mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem into two subproblems, devising a sensing task allocation algorithm and a proximal policy optimization (PPO)-based task offloading and resource allocation (PTORA) algorithm to address them. Comprehensive simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed PTORA in optimizing information value, reducing task execution delay, and minimizing energy consumption.},

Exploring this global collective motion consistency to aid in 3D multi-object tracking (MOT) tasks is an under-investigated issue in existing research. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have been introduced to model interactions between targets in 3D tracking problems, achieving remarkable performance. However, existing GNN based methods usually employ neighborhood-based approaches to construct graphs which are unable to fully exploit collective relations in traffic flow. In this paper, we propose a GNN based 3D MOT method which effectively utilizes the collective motion consistency in traffic flow. Collective motion is modeled with a densely connected intra-flow graph within the collective group, allowing information to flow quickly. To build the intra-flow graph, we propose an effective collinearity condition to distinguish potential collective groups from the detected objects. For reasoning on the graph, we propose a progressive serial message-passing solver which enables the network to learn complex group movement relationships based on a thorough understanding of simple neighborhood relations. Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on public datasets: NuScenes and KITTI tracking benchmark. We have conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the comprehensive performance of our proposed method which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

We present an outdoor navigation assistive system that collaborates with infrastructure to address these limitations. Our system includes an RGB-D inertial sensor, GPS sensor, Jetson Orin NX 16GB, and bone-conduction headphones. It improves localization accuracy through semantic segmentation, depth map enhancement (Depth-Decoder), and a prior map. The proposed semantic segmentation convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed to operate on low-compute devices, achieving competitive performance with 71.2 mean Intersection of Union (mIoU) on the Cityscapes and 74.46 mIoU on the Camvid. It operates at 209 frames per second (fps) with 480×848 image resolution on the GTX 1080 desktop and 50 fps on the low-compute Jetson. Additionally, our Depth-Decoder enhances raw depth maps using geometrical loss with semantic segmentation constraints and structure-from-motion. Depth-Decoder demonstrated an average deviation of 0.66m compared to 2.23m from raw depth maps for landmarks within 10m. Notably, the outcomes of both CNNs are inferred from a single RGB image. Two visually impaired individuals assessed the technology. Participant S001 completed 6/8 trials and S002 completed 7/7 trials. Infrastructure collaboration is demonstrated by using existing prior maps and by dynamically adjusting paths based on real-time information from sensing nodes, to avoid collisions with oncoming agents not visible with the wearable camera. This research provides fundamental design principles for future outdoor navigation assistive technologies, offering insights into addressing challenges for people with visual impairment and other vulnerable road users.},

First, the generalization error bound of the Bi-LSTM, which is related to the number of samples and the bounds of the weight matrices, is proved through Rademacher complexity analysis. A Bi-LSTM-based intelligent predictor is designed to predict the position and velocity of UMVs and to estimate external disturbances. Based on this, a threshold-based attack detection and compensation scheme is proposed to determine whether the UMVs are suffering from attacks and to compensate for the compromised transmission signals. Furthermore, considering the bounds of the generalization errors of predictions, a resilient secure controller is designed using the compensation data from the proposed compensation mechanism and a data-driven discrete-time integral sliding mode control method. Compared with the data-driven control scheme, the UMVs with proposed PFDL-DDISMC can exhibit more effective trajectory tracking performance under disturbances and hybrid attacks. Theoretical analysis verifies that the proposed PFDL-DDISMC method ensures the stability of the tracking error system for UMVs subjected to hybrid attacks and external disturbances.

Along these lines, an RGB-D image based visual SLAM (vSLAM) leveraging semantic Patch-NetVLAD loop closure detection for autonomous driving vehicles in semi-static scenes is proposed. First, the lightweight SeaFormer is utilized to perform semantic segmentation on the input RGB image, and an ORB feature point extraction method based on lighting invariance is designed to obtain a high-confidence static feature point set. Then, a “coarse-to-fine” high-quality keyframe selection strategy is developed, ensuring the efficiency and real-time performance of the system for long-term operation. Further, a high-performance screening strategy of closed-loop candidate keyframes is constructed by combining structural similarity (SSIM) and cosine similarity. On this basis, a high-precision loop closure detection strategy combining semantics and patch-based multi-scale fusion of vector of locally aggregated descriptors (Patch-NetVLAD) is constructed, which effectively eliminates the closed-loop mismatching due to dynamic and invalid matching. Finally, a global semantic octree map that can be used for navigation is generated using keyframes and semantic masks.

Human error, often stemming from risky driving behaviors, contributes significantly to traffic crashes. Identifying and mitigating these behaviors through advanced technologies and data analysis has become an important concern in the field of traffic safety management. This study introduces an unsupervised learning algorithm for detecting risky driving behaviors on expressways within Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) environments, employing deep clustering techniques to analyze individual driving patterns from Probe Vehicle Data (PVD). Utilizing data from 116 vehicles, including buses and heavy trucks, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based autoencoder was employed to extract latent hierarchical features, facilitating the clustering of similar driving patterns. Elementary Driving Behaviors (EDBs) were identified for different vehicle types and driving statuses, serving as a foundation for detecting risky driving behaviors against the proposed criteria. The research revealed a clear positive correlation between detected risky driving behaviors and traffic crashes across the vehicle types. Furthermore, when comparing our model’s criteria with traditional safety indexes, our proposed model demonstrated stronger correlations with traffic crashes, indicating its effectiveness in expressway driving environments. This research not only introduces a novel method for identifying risky driving behaviors but also underscores the importance of tailored traffic safety interventions in enhancing C-ITS environments.},

We model the decision-making process as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and incorporate multiple information sources as the system state. The GRU network is used to extract temporal features from the navigation data and to address memory consumption issues commonly associated with POMDPs. And the SAC algorithm continuously adjusts the process noise covariance based on observations from the Kalman filter, allowing the algorithm to perform better in complex, dynamic, and changing navigation environments. Additionally, we provide detailed design and deployment strategies for both loosely-coupled and tightly-coupled systems.

  abstract     = {The high risks in tunnel construction underscore the critical necessity for intelligent tunnel construction. Unmanned tunnel data collection is vital for intelligent construction; additionally, semantic segmentation aids in understanding the environment. However, complex tunnel terrains are challenging for three-dimensional (3D) laser scanning, and diverse interior structures and nontunnel elements complicate accurate segmentation by subsequent networks. Therefore, this paper proposed a tunnel mobile 3D mapping system (TMMS) for complex terrain in construction tunnels using a quadruped robot and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Additionally, a deep learning-based semantic segmentation network (TUC-Net) is proposed for analysing 3D point clouds in tunnels under construction. The research presented the neighbourhood feature perception enhancement (NFPE) module to enhance the representation of local features, introduce a self-attention (SA) module and improve the loss function to improve network accuracy. The NFPE module enhances feature aggregation for unstructured objects, and the SA module improves the learning of global features, critical for tunnel point cloud segmentation. The TMMS is used to collect point cloud data from tunnels under construction, leading to the creation of the tunnels under construction point clouds (TUCPC) dataset for training and evaluating the TUC-Net network. Compared to other 3D point cloud semantic segmentation methods, the proposed method demonstrated superior performance, achieving an overall accuracy (OA) of 99.45% and a mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 94.06%, surpassing that of other methods by at least 4.41%. In addition, ablation studies were also performed on the NFPE and SA modules to validate their efficacy.},

  abstract     = {Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) can capture spatio-temporal vibration images of vehicles on expressways, which can be utilized for traffic monitoring. Compared to ubiquitously deployed cameras, DAS traffic monitoring offers advantages such as full coverage, resistance to environmental interference, low computational requirements, and cost-effectiveness. However, real-world complexities result in challenges for DAS traffic images, including low signal-to-noise ratio, signal missing, and uneven intensity. As DAS traffic applications are still in their early stages, effective solutions to these challenges are yet to be developed. This paper proposes a new deep learning method named DAS High Speed Traffic Trajectory (DAS-HTT) network, which contributes threefold: (i) Multi-Scale Context Extraction Module (MSCE) effectively enlarges the receptive field to capture long-range contextual information comprehensively; (ii) Stripe Convolution Decoder (SCD) acquires remote information along four directions, preventing irrelevant region interference in feature learning; (iii) Hierarchically Hough Transform Fusion Decoder (HHTFD) introduces the structural information of trajectory linearity, reducing the reliance on label data while enhancing trajectory continuity. We conducted experiments on an operating expressway, demonstrating that DAS-HTT outperforms existing methods across seven metrics, providing trajectories that are more consistent with ground truthes.},

  abstract     = {The operation of urban rail transit is inevitably affected by disturbances in practice, causing the original train timetable and rolling stock circulation to be infeasible. This paper addresses the real-time train rescheduling problem through a novel two-step optimization framework. To realign train operations with the original plan, the first step manages traffic flow by optimizing dispatching measures, including retiming, cancellation, short-turning, and backup rolling stock utilization. To maintain the highest possible service quality during the transition period, the second step introduces stop-skipping and further fine-tunes the train timetable. Both steps are formulated as mixed-integer nonlinear programming models, and the second-step model is heuristically decomposed. For computational tractability, mathematical models are transformed using some linearization techniques and then solved according to the prescribed procedure. Numerical experiments based on a small-scale case and real-world data of the Beijing Yizhuang Metro Line show that the proposed two-step optimization framework can satisfy the real-time requirements and outperform the current rescheduling method employed in the automatic train supervision system. Furthermore, the framework is proven to be applicable to different disturbance durations and locations.},

To handle the massive data generated by connected vehicles in 6G environments, federated learning methods are essential. However, traditional centralized federated learning approaches still face challenges related to data and device heterogeneity, which significantly affects training efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose FedCPC, a context-based adaptive pruning clustered federated learning method. Based on the positive correlation between similar data distributions and model representations, we use centralized kernel alignment (CKA) to group clients with similar data distributions, thus reducing the impact of data heterogeneity. Furthermore, we introduce a context-aware random forest multi-armed bandit method to determine appropriate pruning rates based on device capabilities and historical performance which addresses device heterogeneity concerns. Experimental results on open-source datasets demonstrate that FedCPC outperforms traditional FL methods in both learning efficiency and communication effectiveness.},

It leverages the forward invariance of control barrier functions to design a safety controller that refines the output of MPC to maintain continuous driving safety. The refined results are then used as objective function, guiding subsequent updates in the learning process.

  abstract     = {In the evolving landscape of mixed traffic environments, the interaction between Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) and Human-driven Vehicles (HVs) introduces complex dynamics that challenge traditional traffic control paradigms. The Mixed Platoon Hierarchical Control (MPHC) model innovatively addresses these dynamics by integrating advanced control strategies that optimize the coexistence of CAVs and HVs. Specifically, the model introduces two novel approaches: the Incorporate Real-time Changes in Dynamic Headway (IRC_DH), which dynamically adjusts CAV headways by utilizing real-time traffic data and road conditions, enhancing platoon efficiency and reducing headway by up to 24.35%; and the Incorporate Controls to Improve Response Speed (IC_IRS) for HVs, a multi-variable control strategy that considers vehicle states, reducing speed differentials by as much as 53.125%, thereby stabilizing platoon dynamics and significantly lowering collision risks. These strategies distinguish themselves from existing approaches by providing a more precise, adaptable, and robust solution to the dynamic challenges of mixed traffic flow, addressing both efficiency and safety. Simulation results confirm that these strategies significantly improve traffic flow efficiency and safety, providing a scalable and adaptable framework for traffic management in mixed vehicular environments. This work makes a substantial contribution to the field by emphasizing a comprehensive, real-time, and multi-dimensional approach to managing mixed traffic environments, thereby advancing the state-of-the-art in CAV-HV integration.},

Meanwhile, the impact of order splitting and delivery on customer satisfaction was analyzed from the perspective of consumers. Based on the above analysis, a multi-objective optimization model was established with the objectives of minimizing costs and maximizing customer satisfaction. Then, an improved NSGA-II algorithm was proposed to solve the model. In this algorithm, K-means and ant colony algorithm were used to obtain the optimal paths for two objectives, respectively. Then, the customer satisfaction problem caused by splitting was quantified using the information entropy TOPSIS method. Subsequently, the improved VNS algorithm was used to expand the solution sets of the two optimal paths for dual objective optimization.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate the problem of enhancing cooperative LiDAR-based perception accuracy in vehicular edge networks. The key to solving this problem is the selection of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) that can collectively provide maximum perception performance. In specific, extensive motivating experiments on an open benchmark dataset are conducted, which reveal that the cooperative perception accuracy is a submodular combination of selected CAVs, and such selection is non-trivial due to high vehicular mobility as well as unstable vehicular network conditions. Then, we develop an Edge coordinated COoperative Perception (ECOP) framework, taking into account both cooperative vehicle selection and adaptive bandwidth allocation. The novelty of the ECOP design is threefold. First, a new metric named perceptual gain is designed, which properly quantifies the individual perception contributions of each CAV without incurring additional computational overhead. Secondly, an online vehicle selection strategy, which utilizes continual learning to assess the perceptual gain of each CAV, is devised. Theoretical analysis indicates that the proposed vehicle selection strategy can achieve asymptotically diminishing learning regret, highlighting its effectiveness in adapting to vehicular mobility. Finally, an optimal bandwidth allocation method is proposed, which can adapt to heterogeneous and unstable vehicular network conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared with other benchmarks, ECOP can select vehicle sets with the highest cooperative perception accuracy and ensure real-time perception in the presence of fluctuating bandwidth. Furthermore, a case study is presented to visualize the effectiveness of the proposed ECOP framework.},

Conventional cameras with restricted FOV face difficulties in scenarios characterized by field-of-view shake or low-texture imaging areas, complicating feature extraction and matching tracking. Conversely, 360∘ panoramic cameras, which provide an expansive field of view and high pixel density, are emerging as promising alternatives. While many studies have explored motion calculation based on panoramic vision, most resort to conventional image processing methods for panoramic images, leading to inefficiencies and reduced accuracy. This article proposes a novel approach to panoramic vision motion estimation and reconstruction. The method involves projecting the panoramic image onto a fitting sphere and establishing a mapping relationship between a uniform spherical grid and the pixels of the panoramic image. This enables distortion-free mapping imaging for the entire panorama, addressing issues with matching consecutive frame images caused by distortion in the polar regions. Going beyond conventional epipolar constraints, this paper introduces a geometric constraint of epipolarity within a three-dimensional sphere and derives pose-solving equations tailored for panoramic vision, enabling motion estimation between frames. Additionally, it derives the polar arc equation of panoramic images, accelerating three-dimensional reconstruction of dense point clouds. The sliding window estimation method is used for iterative algorithm optimization, along with an optimization mechanism aligned with the panoramic camera model. Validation on public datasets and hardware experimental platforms demonstrates the proposed method’s significantly improved accuracy compared to existing optimal algorithms.},

To meet the ever-increasing charging demands of EVs, an efficient dynamic spatio-temporal allocation strategy of charging stations (CSs) is necessary. With newly allocated CSs, additional distributed generators (DGs) are required to compensate for the load increase. Given a budget to be allocated over a certain time horizon, we formulate the joint spatio-temporal CSs and DGs planning problem as a multi-objective optimization problem. During each planning period, the allocation strategy aims at minimizing the total power generation costs and CSs/DGs installation costs while satisfying budgetary and power constraints and ensuring a minimum level for the charging requests satisfaction rate. In this regard, we first predict the future power demand of EVs using a graph convolutional neural network (GCNN). Then, using the power demand forecast, we obtain the optimal number and locations of CSs and DGs at each time stage using reinforcement learning. A case study of the proposed allocation strategy over 6 time stages for the 2000-bus power grid of Texas coupled with 720 initially existing CSs is presented to illustrate the performance of the planning strategy.},

To address these challenges, this paper presents the LEE-YOLO model, a novel and lightweight solution that leverages drones within a CPS framework to enable efficient road crack detection. The model incorporates a streamlined network built upon the YOLOv8n model and introduces an innovative lightweight fusion structure, SGC2f, which uses grouped convolutions and linear operations to reduce model weight and complexity markedly. Additionally, the proposed Efficient Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (EBiFPN) optimizes output channel utilization within the feature network, enhancing the model’s capacity to detect targets at multiple scales. Furthermore, the Efficient Multi-Scale Attention (EMA) module in the model’s backbone layer is designed to reduce redundant data and improve the extraction of relevant features. Experimental results demonstrate that the LEE-YOLO model outperforms YOLOv8n, achieving a 4.3% higher precision and a 4.0% improvement in mean average precision (mAP). Importantly, it achieves a 43.5% reduction in weight and a 39.5% decrease in computational demand, effectively balancing performance and efficiency.

In this regard, the present study proposes a methodology to explore the driving styles of Indian drivers, using both the magnitude and variation exhibited in the short-term driving decisions. The real-time driving profiles of 47 professional car drivers were collected and segmented into maneuvers based on the respective driving regimes. The performance features representative of each maneuver are extracted, defining 12 measures of driving volatility. The K-means clustering was performed on the event dataset at two-levels, which resulted in four patterns of driving styles under acceleration and braking regimes. The results showed that, a driver can exhibit speedy and aggressive maneuvers in a stable as well as in a highly volatile pattern. The generated driving style profiles at individual-level highlight the behavioral changes in drivers pertained to external influencing factors, and helps to identify the aberrations performed in each trip.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the longitudinal control problem of an on-ramp vehicle merging into a platoon on the main road. To tackle this challenge, a finite-time model predictive control (MPC) algorithm with a specialized feedback control law is proposed. A constraint set of the state error is designed and based on this, a decision-making scheme is established to allow the on-ramp vehicle to assess the feasibility of the merging operation at the beginning under the designed MPC strategy. If the merging is feasible, the proposed MPC strategy will be applied to drive the on-ramp vehicle towards a small neighborhood around the desired state on the basis of platoon’s velocity and position within a finite time step before joining the platoon. Furthermore, asymptotic convergence towards the desired state is achieved by a co-designed feedback control law. Otherwise, the MPC strategy will not be triggered, instead an alternative method such as slowing down the on-ramp vehicle to create space and allow the vehicles on the main road to proceed ahead. Under the proposed method, the recursive feasibility of the MPC optimization problem is achieved at all time steps and the finite time convergence to the small neighborhood of the desired state can be proved under the MPC algorithm. An upper bound on the convergence time step is also derived, which is used to prove the effectiveness of the decision-making mechanism. In addition, the closed-loop constraints satisfaction and asymptotic stability of the on-ramp vehicle are also guaranteed. The effectiveness of the proposed MPC method is demonstrated through simulation examples.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) offers a promising framework for providing vehicles with low-latency and highly reliable services. By leveraging the underutilized computational resources of parked and moving vehicles commonly found in urban areas, a VEC system can enhance the performance of surrounding user devices and alleviate the loads on its edge servers. In this study, a resource orchestration scheme is introduced for a multi-device, multi-vehicle, and multi-edge scenario. Tasks from a device can be offloaded to its associated edge server, a neighboring edge server, a parked vehicle, or a moving vehicle. Our goal is to achieve the total task processing cost (comprising task processing latency and energy consumption) minimization across all devices through making strategies for task offloading and computational and communication resource allocation. We decompose the optimization problem and propose a Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3)-based Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm. Furthermore, to accelerate the convergence speed of the algorithm, we optimize the uplink transmit power allocation sub-problem separately by designing a numerical algorithm. We analyze the complexity of the algorithm and assess its convergence. Through extensive simulations across 5 different scenarios, our proposed scheme outperforms 4 reference schemes, showcasing reductions in total task processing costs ranging from 15.13% to 38.59%.},

The automotive and aviation industries have been pioneers in adopting DTs for enhanced efficiency, predictive maintenance, and real-time decision-making. However, the maritime industry, crucial to global trade and logistics, has lagged in DT implementation. This paper aims to bridge this gap by systematically surveying DT applications in the automotive and aviation industries and exploring how this knowledge can be transferred to the maritime industry. By analyzing existing literature, identifying key trends, and summarizing best practices, a comprehensive roadmap is provided for maritime industry adoption of DT technology. The surveyed papers are selected systematically following the PRISMA statement and categorized based on characteristics such as single vs. multiple systems, modeling methods (model-driven, data-driven, and hybrid), and life-cycle phases. We introduce DT models using a five-dimensional framework and analyze their characteristics in terms of research object, subsystem application, and modeling method. Additionally, DT applications from a product life-cycle perspective, covering design, manufacturing, operation, and maintenance phases are examined. Knowledge transfer from the automotive and aviation industries to the maritime industry is summarized. In the automotive industry, DTs enhance vehicle efficiency and safety, particularly for autonomous and electric vehicles. Aviation DT research focuses on predictive maintenance, pilot training, and real-time monitoring to improve operational efficiency and safety. The maritime industry faces data challenges and operational complexity but has significant potential for DTs to enhance ship performance, safety, and predictive maintenance.},

  abstract     = {Curb detection is a crucial function in intelligent driving, essential for determining drivable areas on the road. However, the complexity of road environments makes curb detection challenging. This paper introduces CurbNet, a novel framework for curb detection utilizing point cloud segmentation. To address the lack of comprehensive curb datasets with 3D annotations, we have developed the 3D-Curb dataset based on SemanticKITTI, currently the largest and most diverse collection of curb point clouds. Recognizing that the primary characteristic of curbs is height variation, our approach leverages spatially rich 3D point clouds for training. To tackle the challenges posed by the uneven distribution of curb features on the xy-plane and their dependence on high-frequency features along the z-axis, we introduce the Multi-Scale and Channel Attention (MSCA) module, a customized solution designed to optimize detection performance. Additionally, we propose an adaptive weighted loss function group specifically formulated to counteract the imbalance in the distribution of curb point clouds relative to other categories. Extensive experiments conducted on 2 major datasets demonstrate that our method surpasses existing benchmarks set by leading curb detection and point cloud segmentation models. Through the post-processing refinement of the detection results, we have significantly reduced noise in curb detection, thereby improving precision by 4.5 points. Similarly, our tolerance experiments also achieve state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, real-world experiments and dataset analyses mutually validate each other, reinforcing CurbNet’s superior detection capability and robust generalizability.

  abstract     = {How to effectively explore semantic feature, especially the traffic semantics, is vital for Low-light image enhancement (LLE) in intelligent transportation systems. Existing methods usually utilize the semantic feature that is only drawn from the output produced by high-level semantic segmentation (SS) network. However, if the output is not accurately estimated, it would affect the high-level semantic feature (HSF) extraction, which accordingly interferes with LLE. To this end, we develop a simple and effective semantic-aware LLE network (SLLEN) composed of a LLE main-network (LLEmN) and a SS auxiliary-network (SSaN). In SLLEN, LLEmN integrates the random intermediate embedding feature (IEF), i.e., the information extracted from the intermediate layer of SSaN, together with the HSF into a unified framework for better LLE. SSaN is designed to act as a SS role to provide HSF and IEF. Moreover, thanks to a shared encoder between LLEmN and SSaN, we further propose an alternating training mechanism to facilitate the collaboration between them. Unlike currently available approaches, the proposed SLLEN is able to fully lever the semantic information, e.g., IEF, HSF, and SS dataset, to assist LLE, thereby leading to a more promising enhancement performance. Additionally, the proposed SLLEN can be applied into intelligent transportation system (ITS). The images enhanced by SLLEN are not only visually clear, but also can be better recognized by subsequent traffic semantics. Comparisons between the proposed SLLEN and other state-of-the-art techniques demonstrate the superiority of SLLEN with respect to LLE quality over all the comparable alternatives.},

Conventional approaches typically struggle with issues such as limited accuracy, slow convergence, and high computational costs. These methods often fail to capture the complex temporal and spatial patterns inherent in multimodal physiological signals, such as EEG and EOG, leading to suboptimal performance in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that leverages Depthwise Separable Convolutional Neural Networks (DSCNNs) for driver fatigue detection. Our method integrates electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrooculogram (EOG) signals through an innovative feature extraction and fusion process, enhancing the system’s ability to detect fatigue with high accuracy and efficiency. The DSCNN model is designed to overcome the limitations of traditional methods by utilizing depthwise separable convolutions, which reduce computational complexity while maintaining robust performance. We validate our approach using the SEED-VIG dataset and the NTHU drowsy driver dataset, which encompasses a range of driving conditions. The DSCNN model outperforms conventional models in both accuracy and computational efficiency. Specifically, DSCNN achieves the highest F1 score and the lowest time per epoch, making it highly suitable for real-time applications in T-CPS. This advancement represents a significant improvement in driver safety by providing more timely and reliable fatigue warnings, thus advancing the capabilities of intelligent transportation systems.},

Manual assessment of car damage usually relies on multi-view car images taken at the scene, which can provide richer information for damage assessment. However, most car damage algorithms are based on single-view datasets, and it is hard to fully leverage the complementary information and alignment information between distant view and close-up images. In this paper, we propose the Multi-View Car Damage Detection model (MVA-CDD), comprising three key modules: Feature Split (FS), Feature Fusion (FF), and Image Alignment (IA). The FS module extracts global and detailed information from distant-view and close-up images separately, which are then combined by the FF module. The IA module effectively aligns car damage information in distant-view and close-up images to correct errors and biases. Meanwhile, we created the new Car Damage Detection Multi-view dataset (CDDM), which has a significant advantage in both image quantity and diversity across categories, addressing the shortcomings of existing multi-view datasets. Our proposed MVA-CDD outperforms the state-of-the-art single-view and multi-view models with the dataset. Results from ablation studies further confirm the efficiency of MVA-CDD. This study contributes to optimizing the car damage detection and claims adjudication process, leading to significant labor and material cost savings.

To achieve this, an analytical solution is derived for the average achievable rate from the lead vehicle to follower vehicles over Rician fading channels. Leveraging this analytical solution, the Gauss-Chebyshev integration is employed to obtain the approximate solution. Then, we formulate a problem of maximizing the sum of secure rates by optimizing the trajectory and spectrum allocation. The formulated problem is constrained by the security requirement and imperfect channel state information. Addressing the NP-hard nature of this problem, an iterative optimization algorithm is developed, incorporating Q-learning and the graph theory to alternately adjust the trajectory and spectrum allocation. Finally, the simulation results show that the approximate solution matches well with the analytical solution, and the gap is less than 6%. Moreover, the proposed scheme has a significant performance improvement in the sum of secure rates compared with the state-of-the-art schemes.},

  abstract     = {In mixed-autonomy traffic environments, accurately predicting the lane change behavior of human-driven vehicles is critical for ensuring the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicle decision-making. However, existing approaches face two major challenges: 1) they tend to represent the relationships between the target vehicle and surrounding vehicles using parameters like relative position and speed. This approach either requires a fixed number of surrounding vehicles or introduces significant noise by relying on virtual vehicles; and 2) they often fail to fully exploit the vast amount of available vehicle trajectory data, leaving the complexities of vehicular interactions underexplored. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel lane change prediction framework using Transformer-based transfer learning. Our design aims to leverage inter-vehicle interactions learned from trajectory data to improve lane-change prediction accuracy. Specifically, pre-trained trajectory prediction models are used to adapt dynamically to the varying number of surrounding vehicles and to capture interaction context from large sets of trajectory data. We then refine the Transformer model to integrate this context and predict the target vehicle’s lane change intentions. The Transformer encoder transforms trajectory interaction context into a lane-change-oriented context using aggregated multi-head attention. The Transformer decoder, in turn, utilizes this context alongside the target vehicle’s states through relation-aware multi-head attention to forecast lane change behavior. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and robustness.},

  abstract     = {Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) instrument connected to dark fibers that widely deployed near roads can collect quasi-static strain signals generated by vehicles over a large range. This approach addresses the high deployment and maintenance costs and limited coverage of traditional roadside sensing technologies, making DAS a highly promising vehicle detection technology for intelligent transportation systems. However, using existing communication cables rather than specially laid sensing cables as the DAS sensing medium, while offering ultra-low deployment and maintenance cost advantages, poses significant challenges for detecting lightweight, low-speed vehicles that are far from the fiber cable. The quasi-static strain generated by such vehicles are low and easily overwhelmed by environmental noise and DAS fading noise. In this paper, we analyze the causes of weak vehicle quasi-static signals and propose a Unet image segmentation network, trained to recognize these weak signals using a large window with a small step size for data input. In a typical campus test scenario containing numerous lightweight low-speed vehicles, we tested various vehicle quasi-static signals using Unet. The results demonstrated that our method has high recognition accuracy and excellent resistance to DAS fading noise.},

  abstract     = {3D object detection is a fundamental yet critical task for autonomous driving. In this paper, we investigate a novel self-distilling paradigm by proposing Self-distilling Introspective Data (SID) to boost the accuracy of 3D object detection in both LiDAR-based and LiDAR-Camera-based scenarios. The proposed SID significantly improves the applicability of the distillation approach since it does not require extra training data or complex teacher network design. Specifically, we first employ an introspective data augmentation method to enrich object-aware information in sparse point clouds through geometric or semantic injection. We then utilize this enhanced data to train a robust teacher model. In contrast to traditional distillation that relies on larger models to enhance the representations of smaller ones, the teacher model in SID shares the same architecture as the student model but exhibits exceptionally high discriminative ability. This enables the effective transfer of rich feature representations to the student model. Rooted on such a scheme, when conducting LiDAR-based detectors, SID significantly enhances the semantic representation capabilities of sparse point clouds. Additionally, in the LiDAR-Camera-based setting, SID also effectively supervises the fusion of the two modalities at the feature level, ensuring more reasonable cross-modal learning. Extensive experiments show the proposed SID improves a variety of detectors. For the LiDAR-based detector, the SID gains 2.31% mAP improvements for the hard objects in KITTI, while 1.76% NDS improvements on nuScenes. For the LiDAR-Camera-based detectors, the SID boosts the detection accuracy significantly, with 1.5% mAP promotion on KITTI and 2.15% NDS improvements on the nuScenes benchmark.},

  abstract     = {The communication security and covertness of legitimate vehicles in the sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication intelligent automatic transportation systems (IATS) face significant challenges, as the communication equipment and wireless signals are complex and susceptible to information leakage. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a novel IATS that integrates simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) with rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA). Concurrently, an eavesdropping vehicle, capable of monitoring and eavesdropping information from legitimate vehicles, is introduced to explore the joint security and covertness performance. A roadside device is also introduced to improve security and covertness performance by transmitting artificial noise. The closed-form expressions for outage probability (OP), detection error probability (DEP), and intercept probability (IP) are derived to characterize the reliability, covertness, and security of the proposed system. The impact of various system parameters on system performance has also been extensively conducted, including transmitted signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), interference power, the power allocation coefficients, and the number of elements in STAR-RIS. The simulation results reveal several key insights: 1) The OPs and IPs of the RSMA-IATS network gradually decrease and increase with the transmitted SNR, respectively; 2) Achieving an optimal balance in power allocation between monitoring and eavesdropping proves essential for effective eavesdropper management; 3) The energy efficiency (EE) of the proposed system exhibits dual peaks at higher STAR-RIS element numbers, contrasting with a single peak at lower element counts, underscoring the strategic deployment of STAR-RIS technology in RSMA-IATS network.},

  abstract     = {In the context of rapidly growing city road networks, understanding complex traffic patterns and implementing effective safety monitoring through advanced Transportation Cyber-Physical Systems (T-CPS) has become increasingly challenging. This involves understanding spatial relationships and non-linear temporal associations. Accurately predicting traffic in such scenarios, particularly for long-term sequences, is challenging due to the complexity of the data. Traditional ways of predicting traffic flow use a single fixed graph structure based on location. This structure does not consider possible correlations and cannot fully capture long-term temporal relationships among traffic flow data, thereby limiting the system ability to ensure safety and reliability. To address this challenge, we propose a novel traffic prediction framework called Attention-based Spatio-temporal Multi-scale Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (ASTMGCNet). This study introduces a novel framework designed to improve prediction accuracy in dynamic urban traffic systems by effectively capturing complex spatio-temporal correlations through multi-scale feature extraction and attention mechanisms. ASTMGCNet records changing features of space and time by combining Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN). Its design incorporates multi-scale feature extraction and dual attention mechanisms, effectively capturing informative patterns at different levels of detail. This strategic design allows ASTMGCNet to effectively capture complex spatio-temporal correlations within traffic sequences, enhancing prediction accuracy. We have tested this method on two different real-world datasets and found that ASTMGCNet predicts significantly better than other methods, demonstrating its potential to advance traffic flow prediction and improve safety and reliability in T-CPS applications.},

  abstract     = {The integration of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) within the smart grid has significantly enhanced the reliability, efficiency, and security of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) services over the past decade, leading to increased research interest in this technology. Charging stations (CSs) utilize electric vehicles (EVs) to manage demand response and provide sustainable energy solutions. However, the transmission of information between EVs and CSs via public channels causes critical security vulnerabilities. Although much effort has been made to overcome the challenge of protecting security and privacy in V2G environments, these efforts have either been proposed based on a centralized architecture or do not ensure essential security requirements, such as self-sovereignty, reliable, and blockchain scalability. Furthermore, in decentralized network, it is difficult to provide reliable energy distribution because a malicious participant can easily try to inflate trading volumes and manipulate energy prices. In this paper, we propose a new blockchain-enabled, reliable, privacy-preserving scheme using decentralized identifiers (DIDs) for preventing energy wash trading in V2G networks called BAPS-DITS. BAPS-DITS guarantees to tackle the above challenges without a trusted third-party intervention. Additionally, we use informal and formal (mathematical) analysis to prove the security of BAPS-DITS and conduct a comparative analysis comparing the security properties, computational cost, and communication cost of BAPS-DITS to previous studies. Furthermore, we implement BAPS-DITS on a practical Ethereum network, demonstrating its efficiency and feasibility, showing that BAPS-DITS provides self-sovereignty, accountability, and blockchain scalability; thus, it is suitable for actual V2G environments.},

  abstract     = {3D scene flow represents the 3D motion of each point in the point cloud, which is a base 3D perception task for autonomous driving, like optical flow for 2D images. As non-learning methods are often inefficient or struggled to learn accurate correspondence in complex 3D real world, recent works turn to supervised learning methods, which require ground truth labels. However, acquiring the ground truth of 3D scene flow is challenging mainly due to the lack of sensors capable of capturing point-level motion and the complexity of accurately tracking each point in real-world environments. Therefore, it is important to resort to self-supervised methods, which do not require ground truth labels. In this paper, a novel unsupervised learning method of scene flow with LiDAR odometry is proposed, which enables the scene flow network can be trained directly on real-world LiDAR data without scene flow labels. In this structure, supervised odometry provides a more accurate shared cost volume for the interframe association of 3D scene flow. In addition, because static and occluded points are more suitable for using the pose transform while dynamic and non-occluded points are more suitable for using the scene flow transform, a static mask and an occlusion mask are designed to classify the states of points and a mask-weighted warp layer is proposed to transform source points in a divide-and-conquer manner. The experiments demonstrate that the divide-and-conquer strategy makes the predicted scene flow more accurate. The experiment results compared to other methods also show the application ability of our proposed method to real-world data. Our source codes are released at: https://github.com/IRMVLab/PSFNet.},

However, few studies have considered time-varying traffic volume and dynamic uncertainties in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes an adaptive robust formation control strategy (ARFC) for CAVs to address these challenges. The ARFC consists of two stages: 1) In the tactical stage, the constraint-oriented platoon formation algorithm classifies approaching CAVs into multiple local virtual platoons (LVP), assigns the collision-free merging sequences and driving modes, thereby enabling the strategy to adapt to time-varying traffic volume. Unified spatial-dependent constraints are formulated to construct this geometry topology, where the spatial dependence ensures collision avoidance in the merging conflict zone. 2) In the operational stage, an adaptive robust control scheme is designed based on the Lyapunov min-max approach, rendering uniform boundedness, uniform ultimate boundedness performance of tracking errors, and string stability of LVP, regardless of time-varying uncertainties. Comprehensive validations demonstrate that the proposed strategy performs effectively under different traffic demands, and improves ride comfort and fuel economy compared to baseline methods.},

  abstract     = {Accurately estimating the position and attitude of vehicles is essential for intelligent transportation systems. The GNSS/INS integrated system offers precise navigation information. However, the system’s positioning errors may accumulate rapidly in challenging GNSS signal conditions. Odometer (ODO) and nonholonomic constraints (NHC) are commonly employed to mitigate the rapid accumulation of INS errors. Compensating for the mounting angles of INS and the scale factor of the odometer is necessary to fully exploit the potential of ODO/NHC. However, many studies employ Kalman filters with small mounting angle assumption, which limits their applicability for large mounting angles in practice. To accurately estimate the mounting angle of INS with any installation attitude, we propose a new algorithm called Fast Estimation of Mounting Angle and Scale Factor (FEMASF). FEMASF employs Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to obtain a closed-form solution for the parameters. It also incorporates an enhanced Sage-Husa scheme, enhancing overall estimation accuracy by reducing the weight of outlier data through a forgetting factor. Extensive simulation experimental results demonstrate that our proposed FEMASF algorithm outperforms filter-based methods in terms of accuracy and convergence speed for large mounting angles. Specifically, for the -90∘ mounting angle, FEMASF achieves 0.45∘ angle error, while the velocity-based Kalman filter (VKF) fails to converge and the position-based Kalman filter (PKF) yields about 4∘ error. Furthermore, neither VKF nor PKF converges for the 120∘ mounting angle, whereas FEMASF exhibits only about 3.2∘ estimation error.},

However, traditional DRL relies on hand-crafted reward functions, which introduce objective alignment challenges and reward loopholes. Moreover, the black-box structure makes it difficult to explain the decision-making process, which has a direct impact on DRL performance in complex driving situations. To address these shortcomings, a preference-based decomposable proximal policy optimization algorithm (PDPPO) is proposed for reliable interactive urban AD. The framework deconstructs the federated reinforcement learning (FRL) algorithm from various perspectives using a rule-based preference model, resulting in high-availability algorithmic performance for AD. PDPPO employs a data-rule fusion-driven hybrid vision transformer to overcome the objective alignment and high-dimensional state-space representation challenges of traditional DRL in complex urban traffic environments. Furthermore, to address the issue of algorithmic trustworthiness, PDPPO models the multi-agent FRL co-optimization process as an interpretable self-organized group collaboration process. This approach enables the algorithm to strike a balance between model robustness and sample efficiency using preference-heuristic parameter aggregation. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PDPPO algorithmic framework can implement interpretable single-agent decision control and multi-agent co-optimization processes.

  abstract     = {Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has shown considerable promise in enhancing the efficiency of adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) systems. However, existing MARL approaches primarily focus on optimizing overall traffic flow, often overlooking the issue of fairness in vehicle waiting times. Considering that there is no need to strive for the ultimate fairness, this paper models the ATSC problem as a Constrained Partially Observable Markov Game (CPOMG), where fairness is modeled as a constraint on the maximum waiting time of vehicles on lanes of intersections instead of a reward term that pursues maximization. CPOMG aims to find a cooperative control policy with optimal traffic efficiency within the constrained solution space by multiple agents. On this basis, this paper proposes a new centralized training and decentralized execution cooperative MARL method, i.e, vehicle-level fairness multi-agent proximity policy optimization (VF-MAPPO) VF-MAPPO leverages a centralized trained global Critic Network to estimate the average vehicle traffic efficiency and vehicle maximum waiting time, and an Actor Network shared by all intersections for decentralized execution, which converts the optimization problem with constraints to an unconstrained optimization objective through the Lagrange multiplier method and adopts proximity policy optimization during training. Additionally, VF-MAPPO incorporates spatial-temporal graph attention in the Critic network to efficiently extract state representations in multi-intersection environments. We qualitatively analyzed the monotonic improvement guarantee of VF-MAPPO. Extensive experimental validation across two real-world and one synthetic scenarios substantiates that VF-MAPPO enhances vehicle-level fairness and maintains average traffic efficiency, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.},

In complex driving conditions, accurate and fast lane recognition is a challenging issue. In this paper, a vision-based geometric model (VBGM) is proposed for accurate and fast lane recognition in complex conditions. The framework of the VBGM includes an image preprocessing stage and a lane recognition stage. In the image preprocessing stage, the region of interest (ROI) is extracted from the original image, and the original image is transformed into an undistorted greyscale image. In the lane recognition stage, the lane contour is first extracted using the Roberts operator. Then, to accurately and quickly recognize the lane marking, a lane recognition coordinate system (LRCS) and a rotational LRCS (R-LRCS) are constructed. The distracting contours in abnormal regions are padded based on the LRCS using a contextual frames correlation (CFC) strategy, and the midpoints of the lane contour are identified based on the R-LRCS. Finally, an adaptive-order polynomial fitting model is built to fit the lane marking according to the midpoints in the LRCS. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, two state-of-the-art methods are selected for comparison. The comparative results indicate that the proposed method possesses a higher recognition rate and speed for lane recognition in complex conditions.},

Accurate prediction of EV charging demand is essential for transportation system operations, such as real-time traffic management, route optimization, and station utilization planning. However, Cyber threats can compromise the accuracy of charging demand predictions, leading to significant disruptions in transportation services, e.g., suboptimal station management, unexpected congestion at charging facilities, and degraded service quality for EV users. This study introduces Generative Multi-task Self-supervised Learning for Prediction (GenS2-P), a cyberattack-resilient framework designed to ensure reliable charging demand predictions under adversarial conditions. GenS2-P incorporates a Denoising/Reconstruction AutoEncoder (DRAE) and a spatio-temporal prediction model to tackle the dual challenges of data poisoning and DoS attacks. By leveraging generative self-supervised learning and multi-task learning, GenS2-P effectively extracts spatio-temporal patterns to denoise and reconstruct data corrupted by cyberattacks. Experimental evaluations using real-world EV charging data demonstrate that GenS2-P significantly reduces prediction errors and mitigates cyberattack-induced disruptions. This improved prediction reliability enables more effective charging infrastructure management and supports robust transportation system operations even under adverse conditions.},

  abstract     = {Drivers’ drowsiness has been considered one of the prime reasons for accidents and road fatalities. Drowsiness may be caused by sleep disorders resulting in unusual mental and health conditions that have detrimental effects on human lives. This article aims to present an attention deep learning (DL) framework for drivers’ drowsiness monitoring for an intelligent transportation system. The proposed imaging system, comprising an Infrared-Cut camera embedded in a microcomputer, has been employed for capturing both day and night mode images for automated detection of drivers’ drowsiness. The frames captured are preprocessed and fed to the proposed attention DL framework based on “you only look once” version 3 (YOLOv3) for eye region detection followed by eye state classification and interpretation. Feature extraction has been carried out via a convolutional neural network module, and multiscale fusion along with the non-maximum suppression method has been applied to detect and classify the eye region of the drivers for monitoring drowsiness. Moreover, the eye region has been interpreted via a classification activation map using the proposed attention module. Experimental evaluations reveal the efficacy of the proposed system on our acquired dataset and two benchmark datasets. The proposed drowsiness detection device and system can possess good potential by increasing safety in an advanced driver assistance system.},

In this paper, we consider a new path finding problem, i.e., length-constrained maximum density path (LDP) problem. Given a graph with length and weight on each edge, the LDP problem aims to find the maximum density path between two nodes under a specified length constraint, where the density of the path is defined as the ratio of the path weight to the path length. To the best of our knowledge, there are no existing works that focus on this problem. We prove the problem is NP-hard. Then we propose an A*-based exact algorithm to acquire the optimal solution. Due to the expensive computational overhead of the A*-based exact algorithm, we further propose two effective approximation algorithms, i.e., the label setting algorithm and the top-k based network expansion (k-NE) algorithm. Extensive experiments on four real and synthetic datasets verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Street Scene Semantic Understanding (denoted as TriSU) is a complex task for autonomous driving (AD). However, inference model trained from data in a particular geographical region faces poor generalization when applied in other regions due to inter-city data domain-shift. Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) offers a potential solution for improving TriSU model generalization by collaborative privacy-preserving training over distributed datasets from different cities. Unfortunately, it suffers from slow convergence because the data from different cities are with disparate statistical properties. Going beyond existing HFL methods, we propose a Gaussian heterogeneous HFL algorithm (FedGau) to address inter-city data heterogeneity so that convergence can be accelerated. In the proposed FedGau algorithm, both single RGB image and RGB dataset are modelled as Gaussian distributions for aggregation weight design. This approach not only differentiates each RGB image by respective statistical distribution, but also exploits the statistics of dataset from each city in addition to the conventionally considered data volume. With the proposed approach, the convergence is accelerated by 35.5%-40.6% compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) HFL methods. On the other hand, to reduce the involved communication resource, we further introduce a novel performance-aware adaptive resource scheduling (AdapRS) policy. Unlike the traditional static resource scheduling policy that exchanges a fixed number of models between two adjacent aggregations, AdapRS adjusts the number of model aggregation at different levels of HFL so that unnecessary communications are minimized. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AdapRS saves 29.65% communication overhead compared to conventional static resource scheduling policy while maintaining almost the same performance.},

  abstract     = {Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed to prevent collisions, identify the condition of drivers while operating vehicles, and provide additional information to enhance drivers’ awareness of potential hazards on the road. Today, ADAS are capable of predicting drivers’ actions several seconds in advance, preparing for potential future hazards to prevent accidents or reduce injuries to occupants. Most previous works have achieved prediction results by analyzing and processing a vast amount of driving data from multiple drivers, based on the macro intention preferences of multiple drivers and external environmental features, collectively referred to as the generalized intention prediction network. This network utilizes extensive driving data to predict the common driving intentions of the overall driving population, without considering individualized driving styles. However, according to our research, different drivers exhibit distinct latent preferences in real-world driving scenarios. The generalized intention prediction network is influenced by these latent preferences, resulting in poor generalization capabilities and inaccurate predictions across different drivers. In this study, we propose a individualized driver intention prediction network. Based on Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), it extracts individualized driving intention feature preferences that influence driving intentions from the driver’s historical behavior to improve generalized prediction results and achieve individualized driving intention prediction. We demonstrate that preferences vary among different drivers in the driving domain, leading to biases in model predictions. Upon experimental validation, the method we have proposed demonstrates remarkable efficacy on both the Brain4Cars and IESDD datasets, thereby showcasing its enhanced applicability in real-world scenarios.},

However, its performance in railway scenes is hindered by various challenges, including severe weather conditions, low-light situations, tunnel settings, and diverse and dynamic unstructured scenes. To address these challenges, this study proposes WaveCRNet, a novel architecture for real-time semantic segmentation in challenging conditions, simulating wavelet-constrained PID controller in feature and wavelet space. This study first designs an effective wavelet information enhancement algorithm using a differentiable wavelet transform to bridge the gap between the wavelet and feature information domains. Then, the wavelet-guided attention pag module (WAPM) is introduced to guide the learning and fusion of detailed features based on wavelet priors. Moreover, the traditional wavelet transforms are spectral aliasing and shift sensitivity. Inspired by dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT), the DTCWT-based channel reconstruction module (DCRM) is designed to assist the channel-based learning of boundary information from coarse to fine. Finally, the proposed architecture is evaluated by the public dataset RailSem19. The experimental results validate the consistent performance gains between accuracy and inference speed, improving by 63.7% mIoU and 87 FPS, surpassing those of the advanced methods for real-time segmentation.},

While single-task visual perception methods have applications in areas like pedestrian detection and traffic sign recognition, the complexity of real-world scenarios necessitates a shift toward multi-task approaches. This paper introduces the Edge-assisted Multi-task Visual Perception (EMVP) system, which is specifically designed to address the computational intensity and dynamic concurrency challenges inherent to multi-task processing in edge environments. EMVP adopts a collaborative architecture that strategically partitions computational tasks between vehicles and Road-Side Units (RSUs). By integrating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), the system achieves a lightweight yet efficient multi-task model for resource-constrained environments. To adapt to the dynamic and concurrent nature of multi-vehicle scenarios, EMVP incorporates a content-aware adaptive inference mechanism based on reinforcement learning, enabling dynamic task scheduling to improve Quality of Service (QoS). Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the single-task baseline model, the multi-task model of EMVP reduces the computational cost by 86.59% on average while achieving a 4.32% improvement in accuracy. Additionally, in dynamic multi-access environments, EMVP’s adaptive scheduling mechanism, which leverages spatiotemporal content awareness, achieves an average QoS improvement of 7.36% over the sub-optimal method.},

Existing methods primarily utilize () measurements for vehicle localization. However, these methods require specialized decoding receivers capable of deciphering communication protocols, leading to increased application costs. rss, a measure of wireless signal strength, can be recorded by any standard communication device, thus allowing ()-based to benefit from cost-effectiveness. Nevertheless, the inherently noisy and sporadic nature of poses significant challenges for accurately reconstructing vehicle trajectories. This paper aims to utilize RSS measurements to reconstruct vehicle trajectories within a road network. We constrain the trajectories to comply with signal propagation rules and vehicle mobility constraints, thereby mitigating the impact of the noisy and sporadic nature of RSS data on the accuracy of trajectory reconstruction. The primary challenge involves exploiting latent spatial-temporal correlations within the noisy and sporadic data while navigating the complex road network. To overcome these challenges, we develop an ()-based embedding (HRE) technique that utilizes alternating optimization to search for the vehicle trajectory based on measurements. This model effectively captures the spatial-temporal relationships among measurements, while a road graph model ensures compliance with network pathways. Additionally, we introduce a maximum speed-constrained rough trajectory estimation (MSR) method to effectively guide the proposed alternating optimization procedure, ensuring that the proposed HRE method rapidly converges to a favorable local solution. The proposed method is validated using real measurements from 5G NR networks in Chengdu and Shenzhen, China. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, even with limited data.},

Subsequently, we delve into the coping strategies and methods of SLAM in these specific scenes. Finally, we compare and summarize the datasets related to SLAM in complex scenes of AD and point out some potential research directions for achieving high-level AD.

Traditional approaches for matching entities from different knowledge bases often struggle with the complexity and diversity of TN data, which varies across systems and sources such as traffic sensors and GPS devices. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel Multi-Objective Genetic Programming assisted Stochastic Deep Reinforcement Learning (MOGP-SDRL) for DKI in TNs. Unlike existing methods, the proposed framework combines SDRL and MOGP to achieve superior efficiency, accuracy and adaptability in handling heterogeneous TN data. First, a novel SDRL framework is designed to automate and optimize the selection of Similarity Features (SFs) for entity matching. This framework incorporates a probabilistic action selection mechanism, which enhances exploration during the SF selection process. Second, a novel MOGP is presented to construct high-quality, diverse SFs by exploring non-dominated feature ensembles, enhancing both accuracy and adaptability in matching results, leading to more accurate and adaptable matching results compared to conventional methods. Lastly, new approximate evaluation metrics are developed to assess alignment quality without relying on predefined entity alignments, guiding the optimization process. Experimental evaluations on OAEI’s knowledge graph (KG) dataset and five pairs of real-world TN dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the MOGP-SDRL framework, which consistently produces high-quality matching results and achieves significant improvements in both accuracy and robustness over existing approaches.},

To address these issues, we propose a model called 2MGTCN, which combines Multi-modal Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) for Cross-city Traffic Flow Prediction (TFP). Our 2MGTCN model utilizes federated transfer learning (FTL) to transfer the model from the source to the target domain, mitigating data scarcity. It also incorporates GCN and TCN to capture both spatial and temporal information, enhancing cross-city adaptability. Additionally, Grey Relation Analysis (GRA) and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) methods are applied to capture road relationships, and a Federated Parameter Aggregation based on Spatial Similarity (FPASS) algorithm is proposed for ensuring effective parameter aggregation by considering spatial similarity. Simulation results show that our 2MGTCN algorithm outperforms traditional TFP models in both centralized and distributed training modes, ensuring higher accuracy and better privacy protection.},

Precise Point Positioning (PPP) is a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) positioning technology which can achieve high-precision positioning without commercial base stations. Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) combines Visual-SLAM and IMU, realizing a more robust local pose estimation than either of the two. In this paper, the invariant optimization approach has been applied to fuse PPP/INS/Visual-SLAM. The proposed positioning system in our paper is called In-P3VINS. All raw data of the In-P3VINS is modeled and optimized under an invariant factor graph framework. In particular, the carrier phase measurement is utilized by adding the phase ambiguity into the estimated states. Finally, In-P3VINS is evaluated in both simulation experiments and real-world experiments. In the simulation experiments, the accuracy and consistency of In-P3VINS are superior to the other compared methods. In the real-world experiments, In-P3VINS has the most accurate results.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the challenges faced by 6G-enabled vehicular networks (V-Nets), including increasing road traffic, ultra-reliable and low latency communication, high data rates, and energy efficiency. The intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is proposed as a solution to configure the propagation channel in a smart radio environment by adjusting phase shifts. However, designing IRS-assisted V-Nets that achieve ultra-reliability in dynamic and noisy communication is challenging due to the passive nature of the IRS and the limitations of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents a computer vision (CV) enabled IRS framework for V-Nets, which combines a convolutional neural network and CV techniques. The framework utilizes real-time visual information to estimate and configure optimal beamforming for IRS-assisted V-Nets. Adapting to real-time network dynamics and intelligently guiding signals, the CV-IRS framework improves prediction accuracy to 95 %, an achievable maximum rate of 11.2 bps/Hz with 100 IRS elements, and resource allocation efficiency of 88 % with 10 vehicles. The simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the CV-IRS framework over benchmark schemes, making it a promising approach for the efficient configuration of IRS-assisted 6G V-Nets.},

  abstract     = {Commercial complex is a compositional scenario that involves pedestrians with different travel purposes such as commuting, shopping and business. Simulation of pedestrian behavior in a commercial complex is difficult due to the heterogeneity of pedestrians and different attractions from various kinds of shops. Inspired from the law of universal gravitation and the pedestrian dynamics theory, we propose an attractive potential based social force framework for pedestrian simulation in commercial complexes. Our framework consists of an attractive potential model and an attractive potential based social force model. The former model evaluates the attractive force of different types of shops towards heterogeneous pedestrians, by associating the attributes of pedestrians with the types of shops. The latter model effectively evaluates the travel direction of pedestrians by incorporating the attractive force with the social force model via a synthesis force criterion. We conduct the simulation experiment based on 600 groups of pedestrian tracking data collected in the China World Mall, Beijing, a typical commercial complex. The simulation results show that the model can effectively simulate not only the trajectory of real pedestrians, but also the behavior of entering shops. Our research significantly improves the authenticity of pedestrian simulation and provides support for travel behavior modeling of heterogeneous pedestrians in the commercial complex.},

However, with the introduction of AAVs, new challenges such as trajectory design and AAV-user association occur. In this paper, we consider a caching AAV-assisted wireless network and formulate a user fairness problem by jointly optimizing AAV-user association, trajectory design, and bandwidth allocation of the AAVs, which is mixed-integer and non-convex. In order to find solutions, we decompose the original problem into three subproblems and propose an iterative algorithm based on block alternating descent and successive convex approximation methods. In addition, computational complexity is analyzed. Finally, simulation results validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, compared to benchmark algorithms.},

  abstract     = {With the acceleration of urbanization, the traffic congestion issue is becoming more and more prominent in large cities. The effective scheduling of urban traffic signals becomes critical. This study proposes three novel prediction and feedback assisted evolutionary algorithms (PFAEAs) to address the urban traffic signal scheduling problem (UTSSP) with minimizing vehicle delays. First, we construct a mathematical model of UTSSP and design an improved evolutionary algorithm (EA) framework that integrates an eight-phase control strategy based on a vehicle movement relationship graph. Then, by combining a back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and meta-heuristics, we improve the prediction accuracy of the vehicle turning rate for generating high-quality initial solutions. Further, 12 problem-specific search operators (PSSOs) are designed to enhance the exploration capability of EA. Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, especially the Q-learning and Sarsa algorithms, are employed to select premium PSSOs dynamically for guiding the search direction of EA. Finally, for 18 cases with different scales, the proposed PFAEAs show significant advantages in reducing vehicle delays compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms. The results validate the competitiveness and practicality of the PFAEAs for UTSSP.},
