  abstract     = {Satellite communications (SatComs) have recently been through a renaissance, both technologically and entrepreneurially. Ambitious plans have already come into fruition with the operation of low-Earth orbit (LEO) constellations including thousands of satellites and supported by state of the art but proprietary technologies, such as active antenna arrays and intersatellite links (ISLs). In this context, this article aims to provide a forward-looking vision of use cases and a deep dive into technological enablers that will be prominent in space communications beyond 2030. In parallel, it motivates how open standards can play a role in delivering affordable communication services in space. Starting from the 5G plans for nonterrestrial networks, we provide a survey and roadmap toward artificial intelligence (AI)-supported satellite systems, space-enabled quantum networks, and joint communications and positioning (JCAP) for space missions and interplanetary exploration.},

  abstract     = {The recent advances in quantum information processing, sensing, and communications are surveyed with the objective of identifying the associated knowledge gaps and formulating a roadmap for their future evolution. Since the operation of quantum systems is prone to the deleterious effects of decoherence, which manifests itself in terms of bit-flips, phase-flips, or both, the pivotal subject of quantum error mitigation is reviewed both in the presence and absence of quantum coding. The state of the art, knowledge gaps, and future evolution of quantum machine learning (QML) are also discussed, followed by a discourse on quantum radar systems and briefly hypothesizing about the feasibility of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) in the quantum domain (QD). Finally, we conclude with a set of promising future research ideas in the field of ultimately secure quantum communications with the objective of harnessing ideas from the classical communications field.},
