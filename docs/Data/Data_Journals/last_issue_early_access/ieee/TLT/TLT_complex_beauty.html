  abstract     = {Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) has demonstrated remarkable potential in both educational practice and research, particularly in areas such as personalized learning, adaptive assessment, innovative teaching methods, and crosscultural communication. However, it faces several significant challenges, including the comprehension of complex domain knowledge, technological accessibility, and the delineation of AI&#39;s role in education. Addressing these challenges necessitates collaborative efforts from educators and researchers. This paper summarizes the state-of-the-art large language models developed by various technology companies, exploring their diverse applications and unique contributions to primary, higher, and vocational education. Furthermore, it reviews recent research from the past three years, focusing on the challenges and solutions associated with GAI in educational practice and research. The aim of the review is to provide novel insights for enhancing human-computer interaction in educational settings through the utilization of GAI. Statistical analysis reveals that the current application of large language models in the education sector is predominantly centered on the ChatGPT series. A key focus for future research lies in effectively integrating a broader range of large language models into educational tasks, with particular emphasis on the interaction between multimodal large language models and educational scenarios},

  abstract     = {The objective of question generation from knowledge graphs (KGQG) is to create coherent and answerable questions from a given subgraph and a specified answer entity. KGQG has garnered significant attention due to its pivotal role in enhancing online education. Encoder-decoder architectures have advanced traditional KGQG approaches. However, these approaches encounter challenges in achieving question diversity and grammatical accuracy. They often suffer from a disconnect between the phrasing of the question and the type of the answer entity, a phenomenon known as semantic drift. To address these challenges, we introduce LEMON, a knowledge-enhanced, type-constrained, and grammar-guided model for KGQG. LEMON enhances the input by integrating entity-related knowledge using heuristic rules, which fosters diversity in question generation. It employs a hierarchical global relation embedding with translation loss to align questions with entity types. Additionally, it utilizes a graph-based module to aggregate type information from neighboring nodes. The LEMON model incorporates a type-constrained decoder to generate diverse expressions, and improves grammatical accuracy through a syntactic and semantic reward function via reinforcement learning. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate LEMON&#39;s strong competitiveness. The study also examines the impact of question generation quality on question-answering systems, providing guidance for future research endeavors in this domain.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, First Responders (FRs) have faced increasing challenges in their operations, highlighting a growing need for specialized and comprehensive training. In particular, the firefighting Incident Commanders (ICs) are playing a pivotal role, providing directions to field operators and making critical decisions in emergency situations. Over time, traditional training tools in this field have evolved, reaching their pinnacle with Augmented Sand Tables (ASTs). ASTs build on Spatial Augmented Reality (SAR), a form of eXtended Reality (XR) that utilizes projections. Although ASTs enable large-scale visualization of the morphological features of the terrain, by relying solely on SAR it is not possible to fully leverage the potential of XR, which is increasingly recognized as a powerful tool for training. This work introduces a novel approach to training ICs by integrating ASTs with XR, incorporating a learning-by-doing methodology alongside an objective measurement of trainees&#39; performance. To this end, an XR Training System (XRTS) has been developed, combining the capabilities of an AST with personal Mixed Reality (MR) devices and integrating a physically accurate, interactive fire simulator. This system was deployed within a forest firefighting IC training course. All the system components were designed based on the theoretical foundations of decision-making to effectively develop the necessary skills. The proposed approach was compared with traditional AST-based training methods for these roles, focusing on the analysis of learning outcomes, user experience, usability, and cognitive load. The study demonstrated several advantages associated with the use of the XRTS, including improvements in training effectiveness and a notable reduction in overall cognitive load.},

  abstract     = {Software engineers are tasked with writing functionally correct code of high quality. Maintainability is a crucial code quality attribute that determines the ease of analyzing, modifying, reusing, and testing a software component. This quality attribute significantly affects the software&#39;s lifetime cost, contributing to developer productivity and other quality attributes. Consequently, academia and industry emphasize the need to train software engineers to build maintainable software code. Unfortunately, code maintainability is an ill-defined domain and is challenging to teach and learn. This problem is aggravated by a rising number of software engineering students and a lack of capable instructors. Existing instructors rely on scalable one-sizefits-all teaching methods that are ineffective. Advances in elearning technologies can alleviate these issues. Our primary contribution is the design of a novel assessment item type, the maintainability challenge. It integrates into the standard intelligent tutoring system (ITS) architecture to develop skills for analyzing and refactoring high-level code maintainability issues. Our secondary contributions include the code maintainability knowledge component model and an implementation of an ITS that supports the maintainability challenge for the C# programming language. We designed, developed, and evaluated the ITS over two years of working with undergraduate students using a mixed-method approach anchored in design science. The empirical evaluations culminated with a field study with 59 undergraduate students. We report on the evaluation results that showcase the utility of our contributions. Our contributions support software engineering instructors in developing the code maintainability skills of their students at scale.},

This research delves into PythonPal&#39;s potential to enhance the online learning experience, especially in contexts with high student-to-teacher ratios where there is a need for personalized feedback. PythonPal&#39;s design, featuring modules for conversation, tutorials, and exercises, was evaluated through student interactions and feedback. Key findings reveal PythonPal&#39;s proficiency in syntax error recognition and user query comprehension, with its intent classification model showing high accuracy. The system&#39;s performance in error feedback, though varied, demonstrates both strengths and areas for enhancement. Student feedback indicated satisfactory query understanding and feedback accuracy but also pointed out the need for faster responses and improved interaction quality. PythonPal&#39;s deployment promises to significantly enhance online programming education by providing immediate, personalized feedback and interactive learning experiences, fostering a deeper understanding of programming concepts among students. These benefits mark a step forward in addressing the challenges of distance learning, making programming education more accessible and effective.},
