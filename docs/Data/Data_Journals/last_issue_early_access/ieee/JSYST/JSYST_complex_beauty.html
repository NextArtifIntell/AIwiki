  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicles trained through multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) have shown impressive results in many driving scenarios. However, the performance of these trained policies can be impacted when faced with diverse driving styles and personalities, particularly in highly interactive situations. This is because conventional MARL algorithms usually operate under the assumption of fully cooperative behavior among all agents and focus on maximizing team rewards during training. To address this issue, we introduce the personality modeling network (PeMN), which includes a cooperation value function and personality parameters to model the varied interactions in high-interactive scenarios. The PeMN also enables the training of a background traffic flow with diverse behaviors, thereby improving the performance and generalization of the ego vehicle. Our extensive experimental studies, which incorporate different personality parameters in high-interactive driving scenarios, demonstrate that the personality parameters effectively model diverse driving styles and that policies trained with PeMN demonstrate better generalization than traditional MARL methods.},

  abstract     = {The growth of distributed renewable energy in microgrids (MGs) raises challenges in energy management and consumption. As an innovative approach, peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading offers a promising solution to address these problems. In this article, we propose a bi-layer decentralized (BLD) optimization algorithm for P2P energy trading in multimicrogrids (MMG). Compared with traditional optimization algorithms that are single-layer decentralized (i.e., decentralizing solely at inter-MG trading and typically centralizing prosumers within the MG), the proposed algorithm achieves bi-layer decentralization (i.e., decentralization extends to both inter-MG and intra-MG trading). In this way, the BLD algorithm can significantly preserve the information privacy and decision independence of prosumers. In addition, the proposed algorithm can efficiently manage power flow in a decentralized manner at both layers, whereas existing decentralized algorithms frequently neglect this critical feature. Furthermore, an accelerated BLD (ABLD) algorithm is proposed to address time-consuming issues in this nested P2P trading for MMG. Numerical simulations on various test systems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The results indicate that the error of the proposed algorithm is below 0.1%. In addition, BLD requires 15602.03 s to converge with 560 prosumers, while ABLD only requires 228.05 s.},

First, we propose a proportional–integral (PI)-based consensus protocol with a linear integrator, under which the system can achieve consensus without any steady-state error. By directly analyzing the closed-loop system matrix, a necessary and sufficient condition for parameter selection is derived. Subsequently, to overcome the phase lag defect of the linear integrator, we propose a new PI-based protocol with a split-path nonlinear integrator. The nonlinear consensus protocol can not only ensure that the system achieves asymptotic consensus, but also enhance the transient performance with respect to overshoot. Finally, some simulation comparisons are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed protocols.},

Specifically, to address the practical limitation that communication links between subsystems of IMMPSs may be unavailable, we first formulate a sparse LQT problem in which the sparse patterns of controllers match the actual communication links. Meanwhile, in order to be applicable to real-time applications while overcoming model uncertainty caused by parameter variability common in IMMPSs models, we subsequently develop a data compression-based model-free PI algorithm for the abovementioned sparse LQT problem. The main advantages of this algorithm over existing algorithms for IMMPSs control are threefold: first, it has the ability to operate without a prior knowledge of system model, second, its embedded data compression significantly reduces the time consumption for controller design, making it suitable for real-time applications, and third, it designs controllers based on actual communication links, making it practical for applications where communication infrastructure may be constrained. Finally the efficacy of the proposed algorithm is verified through the IEEE 39-bus New England Power System.},

It includes a sensing element, advanced electronics, data processing and digitization, and wireless transmission with networking capabilities between sensing nodes. The system is equipped with a power management module with solar-powered charging capabilities, allowing for at least six days of effective operation on a few hours&#39; worth of charge. The electronic circuitry performing amplification and filtering provides cut-off frequencies of 8.2–108 Hz, and the sensor node exhibits a sampling frequency of 600 SPS. Furthermore, the system implements power modes (active/sleep) to reduce power consumption, with a nominal power usage of only 650 mW at its maximum. The WSN comprises a multihop implementation with smart routing to ensure power-efficient and reliable data transmission. In addition, message encryption is implemented for enhanced wireless security. A field test was conducted to validate the proposed geophysical data acquisition system.

Besides, the demand for server computational resources increasingly ascends as the volume of processing tasks grows. However, in reality, many devices have similar computing tasks and require the same computing data. Therefore, servers can effectively reduce server computing latency and bandwidth costs by caching task data. This investigation explores task security offloading and data caching optimization strategies in scenarios with multiple interfering devices. With the goal of minimizing the total energy consumption, the UAV trajectories, transmission power, task offloading scheduling strategies, and caching decisions is jointly optimized. The corresponding optimization problem, which consists of mixed integer nonlinear programming problem, is formulated. To make this problem solved, the original problem is decomposed into three tiers, and an iterative algorithm named CDSFS which is based on the coordinate descent, successive convex approximation, and flow shop scheduling is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate the stability and superiority of the proposed algorithm.},

The method is based on intracluster and intercluster distance evaluations to achieve a good partition. A quasi-convex curve is formed to select the optimal NoC, ensuring an excellent computational time to converge. Tests are carried out using K-means, and simulations are conducted using IEEE unbalanced test feeders. Different input random variables are tested, including correlated and noncorrelated variables, with and without renewable distributed generators. The results prove that the input conditions significantly affect the optimal NoC. Comparisons are made with Monte Carlo simulation to justify the proposed application, showing that the computational time reduction provided by the clustering algorithm reaches up to ∼99% . Since the optimal NoC increases dramatically with the size of the input database, guidelines are proposed to reduce the MPPF dimensionality for more effective probabilistic procedures.},

This article explores optimal UAV positioning to maximize coverage in hybrid aerial–ground communication links. Exploiting a probabilistic line-of-sight (LOS) model, we examine coverage radius behavior in mixed urban and suburban environments to meet specific quality-of-service (QoS) targets. The analysis reveals that the coverage radius expands as the probability of LOS increases, which in turn increases with the UAV height. However, beyond a certain height, path loss becomes dominant, and further increases in altitude negatively impact the coverage radius. By studying the maximum coverage radius for minimum signal strength and spectral efficiency requirements, we numerically determine a configuration space of UAV altitudes and the corresponding maximum radius that satisfies the target QoS. The results illustrate a dual-regime behavior, where coverage increases with altitude up to a certain value, beyond which it declines, indicating the existence of an optimal altitude for reliability. In addition, the analysis of ground surface effects shows that flying over concrete surfaces significantly enhances coverage, offering a radius up to five times larger compared to rough, vegetated surfaces.},

The challenge is to accurately monitor deep parameters in real-time during synchronization, although existing digital twin technologies have made good progress in monitoring shallow parameters. This study proposes a virtual-real synchronization method for digital twins of an aeroengine gas path system (AGPS) based on deep reinforcement learning (RL). First, the parameters are divided into directly measurable parameters (DMP) and nondirectly measurable parameters (NDMP). Then, different algorithms are applied to different types of parameters. An unscented Kalman filtering algorithm is utilized to aid in the synchronization of the DMP. An RL approach is employed to train parameter inference models for the NDMP. By combining the two algorithms, synchronization between these two parameter classes is achieved. This method excels by integrating the NDMP into the virtual-real synchronization of the AGPS digital twin, concurrently reducing the inference time for this specific segment. Comparative experiments are conducted, and the results indicate an effective improvement in the accuracy of parameter inference with the proposed method. Simultaneously, it ensures real-time and robust parameter inference.},
