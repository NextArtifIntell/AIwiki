  abstract     = {Sulfur-derived functional groups represent prevalent motifs in highly sought-after small molecules, such as active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). Thioethers are one such example, being commonly encountered in APIs, prodrugs, and as valuable synthetic “linchpins” to access an array of sulfur-derived functional groups. While nucleophilic aromatic substitution (S N Ar) has traditionally been used to synthesize aryl thioethers, modern approaches leverage transition metals to catalyze thermal or photochemical cross-coupling. While studying photochemical thioetherification reactions, we uncovered a remarkably mild condition that does not require light, transition metals, or exogenous bases. An array of thiols and halogenated heterocycles were coupled to produce &gt;70 diverse products. Reaction progress kinetic analysis (RPKA) and computational studies support a unique mechanism termed proton transfer dual ionization (PTDI) S N Ar. Finally, a predictive statistical model was constructed aided by high-throughput experimentation (HTE) to understand when the PTDI processes are successful, resulting in the completion of ten target-oriented syntheses. This transformation complements modern approaches to thioether synthesis and motivates additional research evaluating PTDI as a general activation mode between reaction partners.},

  abstract     = {Earth-abundant 3 d -orbital late transition metals are the most used and highly desired catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) but are prone to quick oxidative dissolution, leading to poor durability. We first report that FeCoNiCu multielemental alloy nanoparticles (MEA NPs) can be stabilized with only 0.3 at. % Pd, a 4 d -orbital element. Although pure Pd is known for extremely poor OER activity and durability, Pd-FeCoNiCu sustains 1000 h at 10 mA cm –2 . In an accelerating durability test (ADT) at 100 mA cm –2 , it exhibits a mere 8.9 mV increase over 25 h with a degradation rate of 0.356 mV h –1 , which is 1/350th that of FeCoNiCu (125 mV h –1 ) and among the most stable OER catalysts reported so far. Aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) reveal that atomically dispersed Pd atoms, surrounded by Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu atoms, contributed to a more delocalized electronic structure and stronger bonding via strong d-d/sp hybridization and the vibronic coupling induced by atomic displacement. The altered local density of states (LDOS) of Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu mitigates the oxidation of FeCoNiCu in OER by over 50%, quantified by hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES), making the combination of these five dissoluble elements a durable catalyst.},

Mechanistic investigations, including experimental and computational studies, revealed that the high β-selectivity arises from a proton wire mechanism along the capsule’s surface, coupling glycal protonation with nucleophile deprotonation.

However, achieving both cross- and enantioselectivity in RCC reactions has remained a significant challenge. Here, we report a novel metallaphotoredox platform that enables highly enantioselective decarboxylative coupling of carboxylic acid derivatives with aldehydes. Our strategy leverages independent control over radical generation and subsequent enantioselective bond formation through fine-tuning of a common photocatalyst and a simple chiral bis(oxazoline) nickel catalyst. This redox-neutral protocol requires no exogenous oxidants or reductants and demonstrates broad substrate scope and functional group compatibility in the synthesis of enantioenriched α-aryl and α-amino ketones. The α-amino ketone products can be readily transformed into valuable β-amino alcohols, streamlining access to these important motifs. Furthermore, we showcase the potential of this approach for more challenging enantioselective C(sp 3 )–C(sp 3 ) alkyl–alkyl RCC reactions. This unified platform for enantioselective alkyl–acyl radical cross-coupling represents a significant advance in asymmetric catalysis and underscores the potential for metallaphotoredox catalysis to exploit new mechanisms to solve long-standing synthetic problems.},

  abstract     = {The instability issues of oxide-based electrocatalysts during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under acidic conditions, caused by the oxidation and dissolution of the catalysts along with the current-capacitance effect, constrain their application in proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). To address these challenges, we tailored the spinel structure of Co 3 O 4 and exploited the synergism between the tetrahedron and octahedron sites by partially substituting Co with Ni and Ru (denoted as NiRuCoO x ), respectively. Such a catalyst design creates a Ru–O–Ni electronic coupling effect, facilitating a direct dioxygen radical-coupled OER pathway. Density-functional theory (DFT) calculations and in situ Raman spectroscopy results confirm that Ru is the active site in the diatomic oxygen mechanism while Ni stabilizes lattice oxygen and the Ru–O bonding. The designed NiRuCoO x catalyst exhibits an exceptionally low overpotential of 166 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm –2 . Moreover, when serving as the anode in PEMWE, the NiRuCoO x requires 1.72 V to reach a current density of 3A cm –2 , meeting the 2026 target set by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE: 1.8 V@3A cm –2 ). The PEMWE device can operate stably for more than 1500 h with a significantly reduced performance decay rate of 0.025 mV h –1 compared to commercial RuO 2 (2.13 mV h –1 ). This work provides an efficient method for tailoring the octahedron-tetrahedron sites of spinel Co 3 O 4 , which significantly improves the activity and stability of PEMWE.},

  abstract     = {Proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis offers an efficient route to large-scale green hydrogen production, in which the RuO 2 catalyst exhibits superior activity but limited stability. Unveiling the atomic-scale structural evolution during operando reaction conditions is critical but remains a grand challenge for enhancing the durability of the RuO 2 catalyst in the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (a-OER). This study proposes an adaptive machine learning workflow to elucidate the potential-dependent state-to-state global evolution of the RuO 2 (110) surface within a complex composition and configuration space, revealing the correlation between structural patterns and stability. We identify the active state with distorted RuO 5 units that self-evolve at low potential, which exhibits minor Ru dissolution and an activity self-promotion phenomenon. However, this state exhibits a low potential resistance capacity (PRC) and evolves into inert RuO 4 units at elevated potential. To enhance PRC and mitigate the overevolution of the active state, we explore the metal doping engineering and uncover an inverse volcano-type doping rule: the doped metal–oxygen bond strength should significantly differ from the Ru–O bond. This rule provides a theoretical framework for designing stable RuO 2 -based catalysts and clarifies current discrepancies regarding the roles of different metals in stabilizing RuO 2 . Applying this rule, we predict and confirm experimentally that Na can effectively stabilize RuO 2 in its active state. The synthesized Na–RuO 2 operates in a-OER for over 1800 h without any degradation and enables long-term durability in PEM electrolysis. This work enhances our understanding of the operando structural evolution of RuO 2 and aids in designing durable catalysts for a-OER.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the precise quantity and spatial distribution of paired aluminum (Al) sites in zeolite catalysts is crucial, as they significantly impact the catalytic performance via synergistic effects and long-term stability. In this study, a novel strategy by employing divalent cation titration with varying cation sizes, in combination with advanced quantitative 1 H NMR and 1 H– 1 H homonuclear correlation techniques, has been developed to accurately identify and classify three distinct types of Al pairs. These include two types of Al pairs aligned along six-membered rings (6-MRs) and 10-membered rings (10-MRs), the latter of which are essentially composed of Al atoms located in different 6-MR or 5-MR. The third type comprises two Al atoms located in different channels. The second and third types had been challenging to probe in the past, yet they may be critical for catalysis, particularly the second type demonstrating proximity close enough to accommodate Ba 2+ (with a radius of 1.49 Å). Our strategy for quantifying each type of Al pair marks a significant advancement in the understanding of the zeolite framework. Furthermore, controlled hydrothermal treatments using stepwise steaming reveal that a higher concentration of Al pairs accelerates dealumination, primarily for dynamic reasons of water molecules but not intrinsic structural instability induced by Al pairs. To address this, we propose a “bi-Al” vs “mono-Al” hydrolysis model, offering fresh insights into the pivotal role of Al pairs on zeolite stability. This work opens new avenues for optimizing zeolite-based catalysts for enhanced performance and longevity.},

  abstract     = {MXenes, a family of two-dimensional (2D) materials based on transition metal carbides and nitrides, have desirable properties, such as high conductivity, high surface area, and tunable surface groups, for electrocatalysis. Nitride MXenes, in particular, have shown excellent electrocatalytic performance for the nitrogen and oxygen reduction reactions, but a fundamental understanding of how their structures evolve during electrocatalysis remains unknown. Equally important and yet unknown is the effect of the reactivity of the lattice nitrogen on the vibrational behavior of nitride MXenes and the resulting implications in electrocatalysis. Here, we investigate the reactivity of lattice nitrogen and the vibrational properties of titanium nitride MXenes in relevant electrocatalytic solvents using confocal Raman spectroscopy. We found that the vibrational modes of titanium nitride MXenes are attenuated in polar solvents, which is revealed through the alteration of the Raman scattering in solvents. Contrary to polar solvents, the vibrational modes remain unchanged in nonpolar solvents like hydrocarbons due to the inactivity of the lattice nitrogen. We found that this behavior is unique to nitrides because the Raman characteristics of carbides and sulfides are unaffected by the solvent types. However, the inclusion of nitrogen into the carbide structure does exhibit Raman-solvent behavior similar to that of nitrides, suggesting that replacing carbon with nitrogen affects MXene–light interactions. We demonstrated a proof-of-concept utilizing lattice nitrogen reactivity to enhance the electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction for ammonia production. In summary, we elucidate the vibrational properties of nitride MXenes in solvents and demonstrate the tunability of MXene vibrational properties via lattice atom substitution, which in turn can be exploited to advance the applications of MXenes in electrocatalysis.},

  abstract     = {Isothermal techniques for amplifying nucleic acids have found extensive applications in genotyping and diagnostic tests. These methods can be integrated with sequence-specific detection strategies, such as CRISPR-based detection, for optimal diagnostic accuracy. In particular, recombinase-based amplification uses proteins from the Escherichia virus T4 recombination system and operates effectively at moderate temperatures in field and point-of-care settings. Here, we discover that recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) is controlled by liquid–liquid phase separation, where the condensate formation enhances the nucleic acid amplification process. While two protein components of RPA could act as scaffold proteins for condensate formation, we identify T4 UvsX recombinase as the key regulator orchestrating distinct core–shell arrangements of proteins within multiphase condensates, with the intrinsically disordered C-terminus of UvsX being crucial for phase separation. We develop volumetric imaging assays to visualize RPA condensates and the reaction progression in whole volumes, and begin to dissect how macroscopic properties such as size distribution and droplet count could contribute to the overall reaction efficiency. Spatial organization of proteins in condensates may create optimal conditions for amplification, and disruption of such structures may diminish the amplification efficiency, as we demonstrate for the case of reverse transcription-RPA. The insight that RPA functions as a multiphase condensate leads us to identify the UvsX D274A mutant, which has a distinct phase-separation propensity compared to the wild-type enzyme and can enhance RNA detection via RPA-coupled CRISPR-based diagnostics.},

In this study, polyolefins were transformed into syngas through a wet reforming process over a nickel-supported oxygen vacancy-rich titanium dioxide (Ni/TiO 2- x ) catalyst with water as the reactant under light irradiation. The focused light irradiation can readily increase the temperature in the reactor for the dehydrogenation and degradation of polyethylene (PE) to occur, followed by the wet reforming of PE-derived compounds and gaseous hydrocarbons to syngas. Additionally, the transfer of electrons from TiO 2- x to the nickel components under light irradiation facilitates the aforementioned reactions.

  abstract     = {Ruddlesden–Popper oxyfluorides exhibit unique properties, but their synthesis is often hindered by low thermodynamic stability. To overcome this challenge, understanding the formation mechanism of these materials is crucial for optimizing the reaction conditions and accessing new products. This study presents an in-depth investigation of the fluorination reaction of La 2 NiO 4 with poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), targeting the oxyfluorides La 2 NiO 3 F 2 and La 2 NiO 2.5 F 3 , which exhibit distinct structural distortions. In situ X-ray diffraction experiments, performed on a laboratory diffractometer, revealed the presence of four distinct reaction intermediates. The crystal structures of these intermediates were further elucidated through X-ray and neutron powder diffraction experiments, complemented by in situ neutron powder diffraction data obtained using a setup featuring a low-background cell made from single-crystalline sapphire. 19 F MAS NMR spectroscopy was employed to localize the fluoride ions and to track the consumption of PVDF. By systematically optimizing reaction conditions, we successfully obtained both oxyfluorides and quantified the phase evolution of all intermediates through extensive Rietveld refinements, yielding the following reaction steps: La 2 NiO 4 ( I 4/ mmm ) → Inter#1 ( Fmmm ) → Inter#2 ( Fmmm , with increased orthorhombic distortion) → Inter#3 ( C 2/ c ) → La 2 NiO 3 F 2 ( Cccm ). In the presence of 50% excess PVDF, La 2 NiO 3 F 2 is not obtained from Inter#3 and the reaction instead progresses via Inter#4 ( P 4 2 / nnm ) to La 2 NiO 2.5 F 3 ( P 4 2 / nnm , with a larger unit cell). This study demonstrates the power of laboratory in situ XRD experiments in elucidating complex fluorination reaction mechanisms, enabling the synthesis of new oxyfluorides with interesting physical properties. The in situ approach represents a significant advancement over traditional trial-and-error methods, which are still prevalent in solid-state synthesis.},

  abstract     = {In protein engineering, researchers have extensively explored the incorporation of nonprotein entities into proteins to extend their functionalities to various applications; however, achieving precise modifications of proteins is still challenging. This study demonstrates epitope- and moiety-selective conjugation of nonengineered proteins by integrating “slow-reactive and hydrolysis-resistant” deoxyoxanosine (dOxa) into a “target- and epitope-selective” aptamer. The amine-reactive dOxa-containing aptamers are dominantly single-lysine-selective at recognition sites, achieving significantly high conjugation yields with remarkably low off-target reactions in complex environments under near-physiological conditions through a catalyst-free, one-pot reaction. When stoichiometrically controlled protein–DNA conjugates are efficiently produced for various proteins, high conjugation selectivity enables semipermanent regulation of enzymatic functions, targeted labeling in a protein mixture, and even heterofunctionalization of a single protein. As our dOxa-containing aptamers selectively react with the recognition sites of target proteins among nontargets, we demonstrate bioorthogonal labeling of live-cell surface nucleolin and PTK7 in amine-rich cell media, displaying their distinct distributions. Aptamer-guided dOxa positioning offers a promising strategy for site-specific modification of native proteins in complex environments, opening new avenues for the synergistic collaboration between nucleic acids and proteins.},

Among this family, host materials with low symmetry such as 1T′ phase TMDCs are particularly interesting because of their potentials in inducing unconventional phenomena. However, such systems typically have low quality and poor stability, hindering further study of the structure–property relationship and applications. In this work, we intercalated Cu into 1T′ MoS 2 with high crystallinity and high thermal stability up to ∼300 °C. We identified the distribution and arrangement of Cu intercalators for the first time, and the results show that Cu intercalators occupy partially the tetrahedral interstices aligned with Mo sites. The obtained Cu-1T′ MoS 2 exhibits an insulating hopping transport behavior with a large temperature coefficient of resistance reaching −4∼−2%·K –1 . This work broadens the artificial intercalated structure library and promotes the structure design and property modulation of layered materials.},

Combining theoretical descriptors, specifically the highest occupied molecular orbital energy levels and dual local softness values, along with systematic experimental validation, we demonstrated the reaction activity of glycerol and its upgraded products on BiVO 4 photoelectrodes. Glyceric acid was identified as the optimal biofuel candidate through monohydroxyl oxidation of glycerol. Coupling the preferential upgrading of glycerol to glyceric acid by night and its reuse as biofuel by day, a hybrid biophotoelectrochemical system delivered an open-circuit voltage of 0.89 ± 0.02 V and a maximum power density of 0.41 ± 0.03 mW cm –2 with stable diurnal operation for over 10 days.

Here, we report single-atom ruthenium oxide-doped ZnO as a highly selective photocatalyst for the aerobic oxidation of CH 4 to CH 3 OOH. Under optimal conditions, the CH 3 OOH formation rate over Ru 1 O x /ZnO reaches 321 μmol g cat –1 h –1 with a high selectivity of 90.9% under simulated solar irradiation. Mechanistic studies reveal that the selective generation of •OOH radicals via oxygen reduction and the ability to prevent secondary side reactions of CH 3 OOH are the main advantages of Ru 1 O x /ZnO, accounting for the remarkable selectivity of CH 3 OOH from CH 4 . The single-atom Ru oxide/ZnO catalyst also exhibits remarkable chemoselectivity to alkyl hydroperoxide in the photocatalytic oxidation of low paraffins, which provides a solution to prepare value-added peroxide from a single-step oxidation of hydrocarbon substrates.},

  abstract     = {Fe-exchanged zeolites are heterogeneous catalysts that can potentially ensure simultaneous conversion of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and nitric oxide (NO) using ammonia (NH 3 ) as a selective reducing agent through their selective catalytic reduction reaction (N 2 O-NO-SCR). In this study, we rationalize the origin of the beneficial effect of N 2 O on the NO conversion by combining catalytic experiments with ex situ characterization and in situ/operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and infrared spectroscopy in diffuse reflectance mode (DRIFTS) on a series of Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts where we attempted to control Fe speciation at constant Fe content. The catalytic activity data revealed that N 2 O can promote NO conversion at different temperatures and to different extents. This behavior was found to be related to the activity of the catalysts in the NO-mediated N 2 O decomposition reaction, which ensures the oxidative transformation of NO and thus sustains the N 2 O-NO-SCR chemistry. The oxidation activity is in turn determined by processes of N 2 O activation and NO adsorption, which are a function of the Fe speciation and are likely catalyzed by a minority of isolated Fe 2+ sites coordinated in different cationic environments. In agreement, the concentrations of the Fe species able to activate N 2 O ( C α ) and of the Fe species able to coordinate NO ( C Fe-NO ) decrease with an increasing degree of Fe agglomeration and govern especially the promotion of the NO conversion induced by N 2 O in this dual-site mechanism. Maximization of the concentration of both species is therefore essential to design Fe-exchanged zeolites with the highest activity toward the N 2 O-NO-SCR reaction.},

Trimetallic clusterfullerenes (TMCFs) encapsulating quinary M 3 C 2 carbide or M 3 NC carbonitride clusters offer an ideal model system for elucidating conformation-electronic property correlation due to its unusual conformational versatility. Herein, we synthesize and isolate two novel lanthanide-transition metal heteronuclear TMCFs, namely, CeTi 2 C 2 @ I h (7)-C 80 and CeTi 2 NC@ I h (7)-C 80 . Crystallographic studies reveal singly bonded C 2 /NC ligands coordinating vertically to the CeTi 2 trimetallic plane within the cluster, drastically different from the bat-ray conformations reported for all homonuclear TMCFs. Such bonding characters give rise to variable electronic structures of [Ce 4+ (Ti 2 ) 8+ (C 2 ) 6– ] 6+ @C 80 6– and [Ce 3+ (Ti 2 ) 8+ (NC) 5– ] 6+ @C 80 6– , featuring a fixed tetravalent oxidation state of Ti and tunable oxidation states of Ce (Ce 4+ /Ce 3+ ), as confirmed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy and magnetic measurements in combination with theoretical studies. Furthermore, scrutinizing all reported TMCFs bearing M 3 C 2 /M 3 NC clusters, we find that the conformations of trimetallic carbide/carbonitride clusters are precisely dictated by the bonding nature of the diatomic C 2 /NC ligand so as to suffice strong coordination interactions with the encapsulated metals. Following such a general rule governing conformational variation, a very strong ligand field is achieved on Ce 3+ in the presence of a singly bonded NC ligand in CeTi 2 NC@C 80 , giving rise to the first Ce-based single-molecule magnet that shows an open magnetic hysteresis at 2 K.},

Electricity-mediated difunctionalizations significantly expand the scope of both aliphatic and aromatic alkynes, demonstrating excellent functional group compatibility. The key to success lies in the rational design of anodically generated nickel-bound tertiary radical intermediates, which stereoselectively capture alkynes to form vinyl radicals and participate in subsequently diverse group transfer processes to enable the intermolecular and anti -stereoselective difunctionalization of alkynes.

However, one mystery of the photothermally driven micro/nanomotor is the wide range of reported light intensities applied, ranging from 1 W cm –2 to over 10 5 W cm –2 . To address this mystery, we systematically investigated the propulsion of a carbon microbottle-based micromotor under three illumination conditions: continuous laser, pulsed laser, and scanning laser, where a new cavitation-driven mechanism is identified. Using a high-speed camera, we find that the instantaneous deposition of laser energy on the micromotors can lead to transient and localized evaporation of the solvent, creating cavitation bubbles to drive micromotors with ultrafast speed, where instantaneous velocity over 1 m s –1 is observed. Through precise modulation of the scanning orientation and intensity of the laser, directional propulsion and targeted explosions of the microbottles are achieved, where the instant force is strong enough to penetrate live cell membranes. Finally, the cavitation-driven micromotors are exploited as gene transfection tools, where targeted cytoplasmic transfection is demonstrated.},

The synergetic Co–Fe dual sites were demonstrated to enable the optimal free energies of eNO 3 – RR-to-NH 3 species and balance water dissociation and protonation of adsorbed NO 2 – . Notably, the Co 4 Fe 6 electrocatalysts can attain a high current density of 100 mA cm –2 with a high NH 3 FE surpassing 96% and long-term stability for over 500 h eNO 3 – RR-to-NH 3 in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer. This work provides insight into tailoring the self-reinforced local-alkalinity on the Fe-based alloy electrocatalysts for eNO 3 – RR-to-NH 3 and thus avoids alkaline electrolytes and noble metals for practical sustainable nitrate upcycling technology.},

  abstract     = {Herein, we quantify rates of O 2 -photoactivated corrosion and recovery processes within triple cation CsFAMAPb(IBr) 3 perovskite active layers using dynamic near-ambient pressure X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (NAP-XPS). Activated corrosion is described as iodide oxidation and lead reduction, which occurs only in the presence of both O 2 and light through photoinduced electron transfer. We observe electron density reorganization from the Pb–I bonds consistent with ligand exchange, evident from the nonstoichiometric redox change (i.e., &lt;1 e – ). Approximately half of the Pb centers are reduced to weakly coordinated Pb–higher oxidation number than metallic Pb–with a rate coefficient of ∼3 (±0.3) × 10 –4 atomic percent/s. Hole capture by I – yields I 3 – and is accompanied by increased concentrations of near-surface bromides, hypothesized to be due to anion vacancies and/or oxidation of mobile iodide resulting from ion demixing. Activated corrosion is found to be quasi-reversible; initial perovskite stoichiometry slowly recovers when the O 2 /light catalyst is removed, postulated to be due to mobile halide species present within the film below XPS sampling depth. Small deviations in near-surface composition (&lt;2%) of the perovskite are used to connect reaction rates to quantified, near-band edge donor and acceptor defect concentrations, demonstrating two energetically distinct sites are responsible for the redox process. Collectively, environmental flux and rate quantification are deemed critical for the future elucidation of chemical degradation processes in perovskites, where rate-dependent reaction pathways are expected to be very system dependent (environment and material).},

  abstract     = {Crystallization is a powerful method to isolate enantiopure molecules from racemates if enantiomers self-sort into separate enantiopure crystals. Unfortunately, this behavior is unpredictable and rare (5–10%), as both enantiomers predominantly crystallize together to form racemic crystals, hindering any such chiral sorting. These unfavorable statistics might be overcome using nonequilibrium conditions. Therefore, we systematically characterize energy differences (Δ G Φ ) between racemic and enantiopure crystal phases for libraries of target molecules (phenylglycine, praziquantel) with different chemical modifications. Surprisingly, these libraries reveal wide but similar continuous distributions of Δ G Φ , wherein similar chemical modifications group together. This grouping allows a directed evolution strategy to discover racemic crystals with low Δ G Φ for isolating desired enantiomers by crystallization under nonequilibrium conditions. Comparison with over a hundred previously reported compounds suggests that as many as half of all chiral molecules may kinetically form enantiopure crystals (∼50%). These insights open new previously unconsidered possibilities for isolating enantiopure molecules.},

We characterized the chemical features of the SAMHD1 transition state for 2′-deoxyadenosine 5′-triphosphate (dATP) hydrolysis by analysis of 18 O and 33 P primary kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) at the α-phosphoryl of the leaving triphosphate group. The intrinsic KIE values for [5′- 18 O]dATP of 1.028 ± 0.003 and for [α- 33 P]dATP of 1.015 ± 0.004 provide insights into the mechanistic details of the SAMHD1 transition state. Solvent 2 H 2 O isotope effects for the hydrolysis of dATP indicate that a single proton is being transferred at the transition state to give a solvent KIE of 3.2 ± 0.1. Quantum chemical matching of the isotope effects supports a concerted, loose, highly asymmetric D N A N transition state with a Pauling bond order of 0.17 to the attacking hydroxide oxygen nucleophile and 0.53 to the departing deoxyadenosine. The reaction coordinate distance is 4.7 Å from attacking the hydroxyl oxygen to departing 5′-deoxyadenosine oxygen. The solvent KIE is consistent with a near-midpoint proton transfer from the His215 catalytic site proton donor to the deoxyadenosine 5′-oxygen in the transition state. This is the first triphosphohydrolase transition state to be characterized and the first use of a 33 P primary isotope effect to characterize a phosphotransferase transition state.},

  abstract     = {Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) with nonaqueous liquid electrolytes are prone to gas generation at elevated voltages and temperatures, degrading battery performance and posing serious safety risks. Organosilicon (OS) additives are an emerging candidate solution for gassing problems in LIBs, but a detailed understanding of their functional mechanisms remains elusive. In this work, we present a combined computational and experimental study to elucidate the gas-reducing effects of OS additives. Cell volume measurements and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry reveal that OS additives can substantially reduce gas evolution in LIBs, particularly CO 2 regardless of source. Through density functional theory calculations, we identify multiple plausible pathways for CO 2 evolution, including (1) nucleophile-induced ring-opening of ethylene carbonate (EC) and the subsequent electro-oxidation and (2) direct electro-oxidation of lithium carbonate (Li 2 CO 3 ). Correspondingly, we find that OS additives function via two primary mechanisms: (1) scavenging of nucleophiles such as superoxide (O 2 •– ), peroxide (O 2 2– ), and carbonate ion (CO 3 2– ); (2) oligomerization with ethylene carbonate oxide ion and ethylene dicarbonate ion. Moreover, we discover that OS additives possess strong lithium coordination affinity, which helps further reduce the nucleophilic reaction energies and hence increases their nucleophile-scavenging efficiency. Finally, we provide a mechanistic interpretation for the enhanced gas-reduction effects observed with fluorinated OS compounds, corroborated by surface analysis results from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Our study offers the first molecular-level insights into how OS additives contribute to reduced gas formation in LIBs, paving the way for improved safety and performance of LIBs.},

Taking advantage of the open metal sites of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), quasi-MOFs represent viable catalysts, but the poor designability and unpredictable structures hinder their development. In this work, a Ni-based quasi-MOF was rationally designed and synthesized by controlled ligand engineering. Compared to the fully occupied metal clusters in the pristine MOFs, the accessible Ni sites in quasi-MOFs can efficiently convert HMF to FDCA with remarkable Faradaic efficiency (99.2%) and FDCA selectivity (98.3%). In situ characterizations and mechanistic analysis revealed that the open Ni sites created by partial ligand disconnection in quasi-MOFs are critical to the formation of high-valent active species and HMF oxidation. Moreover, serving as the anode in an integrated electrolysis system, such a quasi-MOF can not only reduce the cell voltage for hydrogen generation but also produce high-purity FDCA with good yield, offering a new opportunity for the simultaneous production of high value-added chemicals and sustainable hydrogen.},

  abstract     = {Hybrid lead halide materials have been highly studied for optoelectronics, but their use with chiral organics in chiro-optoelectronics remains limited. Understanding the ability to impart chirality into bulk materials by incorporating a chiral precursor is of great interest due to unique optical properties directly arising from chirality such as circular dichroism, optical rotatory dispersion, and circularly polarized luminescence. Herein, we used protonated l -nicotine (L-n) (nicotinium cations) as a spacer and templated a variety of structures including a series of (L-n) 3 M 4 X 14 (M = Sn, Pb; X = Cl, Br, I) that take space group P 6 3 in which the lead halide regions template two distinct moieties, both a 1D chain motif and a 0D cluster motif. Hydrogen bonding of the L-n and lone pair expression of the metal play a significant role in structural templating. The materials exhibit large band gaps of 2.70, 3.41, and 3.71 eV for X = I, Br, and Cl, respectively. They also exhibit broadband emission with a large Stokes shift, where the emission can come from both the cluster and chain depending on the composition and excitation. Single crystals exhibit linearly polarized light emission with iodide composition, giving a high degree of polarization of 0.61, among the highest reported for 1D hybrid lead halide materials at room temperature. Solution-processed thin films show strong CD responses corresponding to the choice of organic cation, indicating potential for device investigations.},

Among the various investigated ILs, the p -toluene sulfonate of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium, [C 2 mim][Tos], which has a large dipole moment in the tosylate anion (∼10.99 D), shows large hysteresis in P – E curves with a high saturation polarization ( P s ∼ 92 μC cm –2 ) and a remanent polarization ( P r ∼ 68 μC cm –2 ) at a relatively low electric field E (1.75 kV cm –1 ). The mechanism of polarization and its switching in ILs are corroborated by the switching current peaks observed in current density ( j ) versus E ( j–E ) profiles and the change in fluorescence intensity of a cyanine dye doped in ILs. The reversible cyanine fluorescence intensity changes in response to the applied AC electric field reflect the dynamic orientational changes of the IL, synchronized with the polarization reversal. The dependence of P s and P r values on applied AC electric fields ( E ) is fitted by two straight lines with different slopes, below and above a threshold electric field E th (∼1.25 kV cm –1 ). Long-range order is not obtained below the threshold potential of E th . Under AC electric fields above E th , more significant polarization and cyanine fluorescence responses to the electric field are observed. The present study indicates the presence of long-range ordering of molecular dipole moments over a distance of more than 1 μm from the interfacial adsorption layers through the transition zone to the bulk zone.},

Here, we designed novel dual-asymmetric acceptors A-SSe-TCF and A-SSe-LSF by simultaneously asymmetrically regulating the backbone and terminal groups and investigated their synergistic effects on photovoltaic performance in comparison with the monoasymmetric acceptor A-SSe-4F. The dual-asymmetric acceptors exhibit broader spectral absorption and larger half-molecule dipole moment differences, which favored the enhancement of J SC and the reduction of energy loss ( E loss ). Among the binary blends, PM6:A-SSe-TCF exhibits superior phase separation, vertical phase distribution morphology, and more ordered π–π stacking compared to PM6:A-SSe-LSF and PM6:A-SSe-4F. As a result, OSCs based on PM6:A-SSe-TCF achieved a higher PCE of 18.53% with both higher V OC and J SC due to the suppressed nonradiative recombination and enhanced charge extraction capabilities. Furthermore, by incorporating A-SSe-TCF as the third component, the PM6:L8-BO:A-SSe-TCF-based device achieves a champion PCE of 19.73% without V OC loss on account of the decrement of E loss . The novel dual-asymmetric strategy provides new insights into the molecular design and the improvement of PCE for OSCs.},

  abstract     = {Continuous directionally biased 360° rotation about a covalent single bond was recently realized in the form of a chemically fueled 1-phenylpyrrole 2,2′-dicarboxylic acid rotary molecular motor. However, the original fueling system and reaction conditions resulted in a motor directionality of only ∼3:1 (i.e., on average a backward rotation for every three forward rotations), along with a catalytic efficiency for the motor operation of 97% and a fuel efficiency of 14%. Here, we report on the efficacy of a series of chiral carbodiimide fuels and chiral hydrolysis promoters (pyridine and pyridine N -oxide derivatives) in driving improved directional rotation of this motor-molecule. We outline the complete reaction network for motor operation, composed of directional, futile, and slip cycles. Using derivatives of the motor where the final conformational step in the 360° rotation is either very slow or completely blocked, the phenylpyrrole diacid becomes enantiomerically enriched, allowing the kinetic gating of the individual steps in the catalytic cycle to be measured. The chiral carbodiimide fuel that produces the highest directionality gives 13% enantiomeric excess ( e.e. ) for the anhydride-forming kinetically gated step, while the most effective chiral hydrolysis promoter generates 90% e.e . for the kinetically gated hydrolysis step. Combining the best-performing fuel and hydrolysis promoter into a single fueling system results in a 92% e.e. . Under a dilute chemostated fueling regime (to avoid N -acyl urea formation at high carbodiimide concentrations with pyridine N -oxide hydrolysis promoters), the motor continuously rotates with a directionality of ∼24:1 (i.e., a backward rotation for every 24 forward rotations) with a catalytic efficiency of &gt;99% and a fuel efficiency of 51%.},

However, it remains unclear how to achieve long spin relaxation time at room temperature in 2D c-MOFs via a bottom-up design strategy. Herein, we design a hexahydroxytrithiatruxene ligand (HHTH) to minimize the influence of nuclear spin on electron spin relaxation while weakening d –π conjugation to construct a “spin docking” for preserving spin centers, which enables the resulting 2D c-MOFs, Ni 3 HHTH 2 , to exhibit quantum coherence and Rabi oscillations at room temperature. Spin dynamics studies not only reveal an unusual temperature-dependent Rabi frequency in Ni 3 HHTH 2 but also indicate that the coordination mode determines the spin–lattice relaxation behavior via spin–phonon coupling. These investigations provide a general guideline for the development of high-performance quantum qubits based on 2D spin arrays.},

  abstract     = {Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) enable the precise and controlled synthesis of single-atom catalysts with uniformly distributed active metal centers, offering opportunities to elucidate the impact of subtle coordination environment changes on the catalytic performance. Inspired by N-confused porphyrins, we designed 20 metalloporphyrin-based COFs with either M–N 3 C 1 or M–N 4 centers, where M refers to 3 d transition metals from Sc to Zn, for the electrocatalysis of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Density functional theory calculations predicted Co-based COFs to be the best ORR catalysts among the screened catalysts. Hence, Co–N 3 C 1 –COF and Co–N 4 –COF with a high crystallinity were synthesized. The Co–N 3 C 1 –COF exhibited improved ORR performance over the parent Co–N 4 –COF, as it had a reduced overpotential and increased four-electron selectivity, corroborating theoretical predictions. The enhanced performance was ascribed to the increase in electron density on Co as the coordination environment transits from Co–N 4 to Co–N 3 C 1 . This not only facilitated the adsorption of O 2 and critical intermediates but also changed the potential-determining step, which in turn made the ORR free energy profile of Co–N 3 C 1 –COF approach equilibrium for all elementary steps, thus leading to a reduced overpotential. This combined theoretical and experimental work exemplified carbon coordination in porphyrin-based COFs as an effective strategy to facilitate the catalytic capability for ORR. A descriptor was also provided to guide the design of coordination-varied Por-COFs catalysts.},

As a result, luminescence lifetimes of up to 100 ns are achieved, the upconversion from red to blue light becomes 68 times more efficient and the yield of benchmark photoredox reactions is significantly improved.

  abstract     = {Chiral molecular cages are demonstrated to have unique applications in enantioselective chemistry owing to their 3D cage-like geometry and intrinsic cavity. Yet, the role of the chirality of molecular cages in their physical properties of condensed materials, for example, the manipulation of electronic spin behaviors, remains elusive. Here, we report that chiral organic molecular cages can become an appealing chiral system to realize highly efficient spin filtering through the chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect. A pair of triphenylphosphine-containing organic cages (Pcages) with opposite handedness can manifest a very high spin polarization of nearly 90% and a high conductivity that exceeds those of other chiral molecules and structures by 2 orders of magnitude. By fabricating such molecular cages into thin-film spin filter devices, they have outstanding magnetoresistance ratios up to 12% among most of the devices based on the CISS effect. More interestingly, the Pcages can self-assemble with triphenylborane molecules through B–P frustrated Lewis acid–base complexation to form homochiral helical supramolecular nanofibrils. The spin-selective transport capacity and magnetic resistance obtained unexpected enhancement within these cage-based assemblies. This study demonstrates the potential of organic cages as a new chiral platform for controlling spin selectivity and will inspire the creation of new spintronic devices using chiral organic cage materials.},

However, their cross-linked structure poses significant challenges for sustainable manufacturing and end-of-life reprocessing. Herein, we present a novel approach to regenerate high-performance polydicyclopentadiene (p DCPD ) thermoset materials through a one-pot deconstruction-reactivation strategy enabled by an “activatable repeat unit”, norbornene-furan ( NBF ). The pendant furyl ring of NBF remains intact during the initial curing reaction via frontal ring-opening metathesis polymerization (FROMP) and retains its reactivity for subsequent Diels–Alder cycloaddition with the in situ generated benzyne. Deconstruction-reactivation proceeds in one pot to effectively recover the activated oligomers for further FROMP curing, thereby completing the circular workflow. The regenerated materials demonstrate retention of key properties, including glass transition temperature ( T g ), stiffness, and yield strength, while maintaining their deconstruction capability. This strategy provides a sustainable framework for thermoset material design and regeneration, addressing critical challenges in material circularity and environmental impact.},

  abstract     = {Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) is a highly promising hydrogen production technology for enabling a sustainable energy supply. Herein, we synthesize a single-atom Co-doped core–shell heterostructured Ru@RuO 2 (Co-Ru@RuO 2 ) catalyst via a combination of ultrafast pulse-heating and calcination methods as an iridium (Ir)-free and durable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst in acidic conditions. Co-Ru@RuO 2 exhibits a low overpotential of 203 mV and excellent stability over a 400 h durability test at 10 mA cm –2 . When implemented in industrial PEMWE devices, a current density of 1 A cm –2 is achieved with only 1.58 V under an extremely low catalyst loading of 0.34 mg Ru cm –2 , which is decreased by 4 to 6 times as compared to other reported Ru-based catalysts. Even at 500 mA cm –2 , the PEMWE device could work stably for more than 200 h. Structural characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the single-atom Co doping and the core–shell heterostructure of Ru@RuO 2 modulate the electronic structure of pristine RuO 2 , which reduce the energy barriers of OER and improve the stability of surface Ru. This work provides a unique avenue to guide future developments on low-cost PEMWE devices for hydrogen production.},

Soc. 2009, 131, 8603], is a robust precursor for in crystallo single-crystal to single-crystal (SC-SC) C–H activation of methane and ethane at 80 °C. This contrasts with the reported solution (CD 2 Cl 2 ) behavior, where 1[BAr F 4 ] decomposes by methane loss. Crystalline 1[BAr F 4 ] is accessed as a single polymorph on a gram scale. A single-crystal neutron diffraction study locates the hydride. 13 C{ 1 H} SSNMR experiments on 1[BAr F 4 ] , and its isotopologue [Ir( t Bu-PONOP)(CD 3 )D][BAr F 4 ], d 4 -1[BAr F 4 ] , suggest a rapid and reversible endergonic reductive bond formation is occurring in crystallo to access an Ir(I) σ-methane complex. Heating 1[BAr F 4 ] to 80 °C under high vacuum results in loss of methane and intramolecular C–H activation to form cyclometalated [Ir(cyclo- t Bu-PONOP′)H][BAr F 4 ], 2[BAr F 4 ] , in a SC-SC reaction. This is reversible, and the addition of CH 4 or CD 4 to 2[BAr F 4 ] at 80 °C results in an equilibrium with 1[BAr F 4 ] or d 4 -1[BAr F 4 ] , respectively. Complex 2[BAr F 4 ] is thus an operationally unsaturated source of 14-electron [Ir( t Bu-PONOP)][BAr F 4 ], III , that undergoes C–H activation with methane. Periodic DFT studies, alongside isotope labeling experiments, link 1[BAr F 4 ] and 2[BAr F 4 ] /CH 4 via a reductive elimination/oxidative addition pathway. Heating 2[BAr F 4 ] to 80 °C under N 2 forms [Ir( t Bu-PONOP)(κ 1 -N 2 )][BAr F 4 ], in a SC-SC transformation. Reaction with CO forms [Ir( t Bu-PONOP)(CO)][BAr F 4 ] at room temperature. Calculations suggest reaction with N 2 occurs via an associative process or competitively through III , while with CO only an associative process operates. Heating 2[BAr F 4 ] to 80 °C under an ethane atmosphere results in alkane dehydrogenation, via a SC–SC reaction, forming a ∼1:1 mixture of [Ir( t Bu-PONOP)(η 2 -H 2 C═CH 2 )][BAr F 4 ], and [Ir( t Bu-PONOP)H 2 ][BAr F 4 ].},

Currently, the exploration of adaptive and reprocessing aerogels has become increasingly urgent, as the demand for intelligent and sustainable materials intensifies. Here, we present a molecular weaving strategy to construct molecularly woven polymer aerogels (WPAs) via catalyst-free aldimine condensation between prewoven aldehyde-functionalized Cu(I) bisphenanthroline (Cu(PBD) 2 ) and flexible 4,4′-diaminodibenzyl (DB). The key feature of this system consists entirely of dense woven nodes that can be readily activated by external stimuli, where Cu(I) ions can also be reversibly removed as needed, while preserving porous structures. Consequently, we achieve adjustable mechanical properties of WPAs, with a 10-fold enhancement in elasticity after removing Cu(I) ions. Moreover, the destroyed WPAs demonstrate a straightforward reprocessing capacity rather than tedious monomer recovery due to the dissociation of Cu(I)-coordination bonds, the activation of sequential polymer thread motions, and the accelerated imine bond exchange enabled by adjacent Cu(I) ions. This work offers a new perspective on designing customizable and sustainable aerogels and verifies the feasibility of the emergent molecularly woven technique in a more complex functional material system.},

  abstract     = {Polystyrene (PS) is a widely used thermoplastic polymer, but its very low recycling rate has motivated consideration of chemical conversion strategies to convert waste PS into value-added products. Oxidation methods have been widely studied, but they typically generate benzoic acid, a product with a relatively low market demand. Phenol is a higher volume chemical that would be an appealing target, but no methods currently exist for the conversion of PS into phenol. The repeat unit in PS closely resembles cumene, the primary feedstock used to produce phenol through the Hock process. Here, we investigate prospects for adapting the Hock process to PS, generating hydroperoxides through the autoxidation of benzylic C–H bonds followed by the acid-promoted rearrangement of the hydroperoxides to afford phenol and a partially oxygenated polymer. Experimental and computational studies of dimeric and trimeric PS model compounds show that neighboring phenyl rings impose conformational constraints that raise the barrier to hydrogen-atom transfer from the tertiary benzylic C–H bond. These effects are also evident with PS and contribute to lower yields of phenol when PS is subjected to Hock process conditions. These results provide valuable insights that have important implications for other efforts that seek to adapt small-molecule reactivity to polymeric feedstocks.},

Beyond typical chemical passivation, ammonium salts control the electronic structure of perovskite surfaces, yet the molecular structure–property relationship requires further understanding, especially the dipole effect. Here, we employed carbazole and its halogenated counterpart as the functional group of ammonium salts. 2-Chloro-carbazol-9-ethylammonium iodide (CzCl-EAI) with a rigid, conjugated molecular structure further provides chemical passivation and enhances the ambient stability of perovskites. In addition, we found that halogenation enhances the intramolecular charge transfer for a larger molecular dipole moment, leading to the depletion region of perovskite films threefold wider than that of the PDAI 2 condition. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of inverted PSCs based on mixed passivation reached 25.16% and certified 24.35% under the quasi-steady-state (QSS) measurement. Unencapsulated devices retained over 91% of initial PCE under ISOS-D-2 conditions over 1100 h and maintained 80% of their initial performance after 500 h of continuous light illumination in ambient air with a 50–60% relative humidity (RH).},

However, such two effects rarely occur successively within a single material. Here, we present a unique case of temperature-induced sequential charge transfer and magnetic ordering in antiferromagnetic CrSbS 3 with quasi-one-dimensional structure. Intriguingly, the contrasting effects of charge transfer between Cr and [Sb 2 S 6 ] units and antiferromagnetic transition on lattice expansion result in diverse thermal expansion behaviors of lattice parameters, which ultimately leads to an anti-Invar effect on the lattice volume. Neutron powder diffraction further unravels a C-type antiferromagnetic order. Moreover, pressure regulation can also induce similar volume collapse, implying potential valence and spin-state transitions. The multiple electronic transitions observed in CrSbS 3 offer a valuable platform for deciphering the interweaving among charge, spin, and lattice degrees of freedom, and shed a new light for exploring novel quantum phenomena in more low-dimensional van der Waals materials.},

  abstract     = {Peptide materials offer a broad platform to design biomimetic soft matter, and filamentous networks that emulate those in extracellular matrices and the cytoskeleton are among the important targets. Given the vast sequence space, a combination of computational approaches and readily accessible experimental techniques is required to design peptide materials efficiently. We report here on a strategy that utilizes this combination to predict supramolecular cohesion within filaments of peptide amphiphiles, a property recently linked to supramolecular dynamics and consequently bioactivity. Using established coarse-grained simulations on 10,000 randomly generated peptide sequences, we identified 3500 likely to self-assemble in water into nanoscale filaments. Atomistic simulations of small clusters were used to further analyze this subset of sequences and identify mathematical descriptors that are predictive of intermolecular cohesion, which was the main purpose of this work. We arbitrarily selected a small cohort of these sequences for chemical synthesis and verified their fiber morphology. With further characterization, we were able to link the latent heat associated with fiber to micelle transitions, an indicator of cohesion and potential supramolecular dynamicity within the filaments, to calculated hydrogen bond densities in the simulation clusters. Based on validation from in situ synchrotron X-ray scattering and differential scanning calorimetry, we conclude that the phase transitions can be easily observed by very simple polarized light microscopy experiments. We are encouraged by the methodology explored here as a relatively low-cost and fast way to design potential functions of peptide materials.},

  abstract     = {The vast majority of cells are protected and functionalized by a dense surface layer of glycans, proteoglycans, and glycolipids. This surface represents an underexplored space in structural biology that is exceedingly challenging to recreate in vitro. Here, we investigate β-barrel protein dynamics within an asymmetric outer membrane environment, with the trimeric autotransporter Yersinia adhesin A (YadA) as an example. Magic-angle spinning NMR relaxation data and a model-free approach reveal increased mobility in the second half of strand β2 after the conserved G72, which is responsible for membrane insertion and autotransport, and in the subsequent loop toward β3. In contrast, the protomer–protomer interaction sites (β1 i –β4 i –1 ) are rigid. Intriguingly, the mobility in the β-strand section following G72 is substantially elevated in the outer membrane and less so in the detergent environment of microcrystals. A possible source is revealed by molecular dynamics simulations that show the formation of a salt bridge involving E79 and R76 in competition with a dynamic interplay of calcium binding by E79 and the phosphate groups of the lipids. An estimation of overall barrel motion in the outer membrane and detergent-containing crystals yields values of around 41 ns for both. The global motion of YadA in the outer membrane has a stronger rotational component orthogonal to the symmetry axis of the trimeric porin than in the detergent-containing crystal. In summary, our investigation shows that the mobility in the second half of β2 and the loop to β3 required for membrane insertion and autotransport is maintained in the final folded form of YadA.},

  abstract     = {Regiodivergent C–C bond-forming reactions are a powerful tool for constructing diverse molecular architectures from common precursors. While transition metal catalysis has dominated regioselective transformations, achieving similar precision with transition-metal-free methods remains an unmet challenge, particularly when using identical starting materials. In this work, we report a transition-metal-free, regiodivergent direct alkylation of electronically unbiased pyridines using 1,1-diborylalkanes as the sole alkylating agent. The key to controlling regioselectivity lies in the choice of alkyllithium activator of 1,1-diborylalkanes: methyllithium directs alkylation predominantly to the C4 position, while sec -butyllithium promotes C2-alkylation. Mechanistic studies reveal that the structural dynamics of alkyllithium clusters dictate the regioselectivity, with tetrameric clusters favoring C4-alkylation and dimeric clusters preferring C2-alkylation. This method demonstrates broad substrate scope, enables late-stage functionalization of complex molecules, and allows for the sequential installation of two distinct alkyl groups onto a pyridine scaffold. Our approach provides a versatile tool for site-selective pyridine functionalization, offering new possibilities for synthesizing diverse alkylated pyridines in pharmaceutical and materials research.},

Sustainable NO 3 – production via the nitrogen electrooxidation reaction powered by renewable electricity is highly desirable, but the Faradaic efficiency (FE) at high production rates is unsatisfactory due to competition from the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this study, we propose reengineering the catalyst’s microstructure-to-macroenvironment interface by particularly utilizing the previously considered unfavored oxygen from the OER. We demonstrate that the re-engineered interface facilitates a record-breaking FE of 35.52% under 8 atm air, with an impressive increase in FE (41.56%) observed during a continuous electrochemical process lasting for 60 h due to the in situ formation of the O 2 -rich macro-interface environment. The revelation is anticipated to furnish groundbreaking perspectives for the reaction systems design in electrochemical nitrate production and other electrocatalytic fields.},

  abstract     = {During infection, the human opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa forms protective biofilms, whose matrix consists of proteins, nucleic acids, and polysaccharides such as alginate, Psl, and Pel. Psl, a polymeric pentasaccharide composed of mannose, rhamnose, and glucose, is produced during the early stages of biofilm formation, serving as a protective barrier against antibiotics and the immune system. The Psl biosynthesis gene cluster, besides encoding various glycosyltransferases, also includes an endoglycosidase, PslG. Here, we show, by activity-based protein profiling, structural studies on enzyme–inhibitor complexes, and defined substrate processing, that PslG is not, as previously suggested, an endo-β-mannosidase but instead a retaining endo-β-glucosidase. This insight allows the design of both competitive and covalent PslG inhibitors, as we show for repeating pentasaccharide mimetics featuring either a reducing end deoxynojirimycin or cyclophellitol moiety. This work provides valuable tools to deepen the understanding of Psl biosynthesis, its function in biofilm formation, and its contribution to antibiotic resistance. We demonstrate the enzyme’s actual endo−β–glucosidase activity, a means to monitor PslG activity in P. aeruginosa biofilms, and a blueprint for inhibitor design.},

  abstract     = {Iron photosensitizers represent a holy grail in photochemistry, but their widespread implementation is limited by their short excited-state lifetimes and poor cage escape yields. Here, the introduction of an anthracene moiety appended to an iron(III) complex allowed to solve both limitations and generate a novel dyad exhibiting an extraordinary excited-state lifetime of 11.5 μs. The key to achieving this remarkably long lifetime is the depopulation of the short-lived iron-centered emissive excited state to populate a dark triplet state located on the anthracene-like moiety with a spin-forbidden deactivation. Population of the triplet anthracene only occurs with ∼10% efficiency in acetonitrile but still allows expansion of the scope of reactivity accessible with iron-based photosensitizers, which now encompasses energy transfer to 3 O 2 . In addition, in a proof-of-principle investigation with methyl viologen as electron acceptor, the population of a triplet excited state allows a drastic ten-fold increase of the cage escape yield from 4.5% for the unsubstituted complex to 42% for the molecular dyad. Hence, this new iron-based dyad provides a complementary approach for complexes based on first-row transition metals as alternatives to well-established analogues based on precious metals. We believe that further spectroscopic investigations and synthetic modifications of the energy acceptor and linkage to the photosensitizer will be key to use these innovative dyads for applications in the near future.},

  abstract     = {Lead halide perovskite quantum dots (LHP QDs) CsPbX 3 generate immense interest as narrow-band emitters for displays, lasers, and quantum light sources. All QD applications rely on suited engineering of surface capping ligands. The first generation of LHP QDs employed oleic acid/oleyl amine capping and have found only a limited use in photoredox catalysis. These catalysts have been reported to be unstable and decompose over the course of the reaction, thus reducing turnover numbers (TONs) and limiting their synthetic ability. Herein, the impact of eight distinct surface ligands on monodisperse CsPbBr 3 QDs is reported, affording a thorough comprehension of their performance in photocatalytic C–H brominations. These efforts yielded QDs operating at extremely low catalyst loadings (&lt;100 ppb) with TONs over 9,000,000 per LHP QD. We emphasize that the optimal catalytic performance requires increased QD surface accessibility without compromising the QD structural and colloidal integrity. Control experiments indicated that well-known photoredox catalysts such as Ir(ppy) 3 , Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 , or 4CzlPN are ineffective in the same reaction. Mechanistic studies reveal that the C–Br bond reduction in CH 2 Br 2 is the rate-limiting step and is likely facilitated through interaction with the CsPbBr 3 QD surface. This work outlines a holistic approach toward the design of practically useful photocatalysts out of QDs comprising structurally soft QD cores and dynamically bound capping ligands.},

  abstract     = {Careful control over the defect chemistry of crystalline compounds is typically critical to transport phenomena (ion, electron, phonon). In one-dimensional (1D) ion conductors, even small concentrations of defects in the diffusion pathway can be pernicious. Wadsley–Roth block phases are 1D ion conductors with high redox capacity and among the highest diffusivity of any battery electrode materials. The origin of their high-rate transport has been attributed to parallel tunnels that could impart defect tolerance, but direct evidence is limited. Herein, a new lithium-ion battery negative electrode material, NaNb 7 O 18 , is described that exhibits extreme defect tolerance. Multimodal characterization combining neutron diffraction, 23 Na solid-state NMR spectroscopy, and DFT calculations reveals that more than half of the Na + in NaNb 7 O 18 is in diffusion tunnel-blocking cuboctahedral environments (similar to the perovskite A-site). Despite the high point-defect concentration, NaNb 7 O 18 can reversibly lithiate to Li 7 NaNb 7 O 18 and cycle 200 mAh·g –1 in 10 h and 100 mAh·g –1 in 3 min in large 4–23 μm (D 10 –D 90 ) particles. Operando synchrotron diffraction shows an anisotropic and asymmetric lithiation/delithiation process with two first-order phase transitions including one with nearly zero volume change. Li x NaNb 7 O 18 also exhibits evidence for reversible Nb–Nb bond formation. From the same operando diffraction measurements, Nb–Nb distances between edge-sharing octahedra at the block peripheries vary from ca . 3.4 to 2.8 and back to 3.4 Å over one lithium insertion/extraction cycle, in quantitative agreement with the Nb–Nb bond formation charge storage mechanism recently proposed from the computational lithiation of several different Wadsley–Roth compounds.},

The first pathway involves the reduction of NO 2 – to N 2 , where the NO generated in the initial step is transformed to N 2 O by PPh 3 and further reduced to N 2 by the [N(afa Cy ) 3 Fe]OTf 2 complex. An alternative pathway showcases the reduction of the bound NO complex, [N(afa Cy ) 3 Fe(NO)] 2+ , to NH 3 using chemical reductants, albeit with a modest yield of 29%. Confirmation of the nitrogen source as NO is established through 15 N labeling studies. Hydroxylamine (NH 2 OH) is proposed as a plausible intermediate in the reduction of bound NO, supported by independent NH 2 OH reduction experiments and computational studies. Nature employs a well-orchestrated, stepwise process involving several enzymes to reduce N-containing oxyanions, and this approach provides valuable insights into the stepwise reduction mechanisms of nitrate and nitrite, yielding NH 3 or N 2 as the product.},

  abstract     = {Natural polysaccharides possess various biological functions and have become increasingly important as drug candidates for biomedical development. However, the accessibility to multiple-branched and large-sized acidic polysaccharides with well-defined structures and the identification of related active glycan domains remain challenging. Here, we report the precision synthesis of a highly branched acidic pectin polysaccharide up to a 63-mer containing 10 different glycosidic linkages from Lycium barbarum . The synthetic strategy relies on highly stereoselective modular assembly of an orthogonally protected decasaccharide backbone, efficient synthesis of three side chain glycans by the integration of stereocontrolled one-pot chemoselective glycosylations and a hydrogen-bond-mediated aglycone delivery approach, and convergent assembly of the target polysaccharide in a branched site-specific glycosylation manner via flexible orthogonal protecting group manipulations. Structure–activity relationship studies of synthetic polysaccharide 63-mer and its short fragments (9-mer, 10-mer, 11-mer, and 33-mer) suggest that the decasaccharide as an active glycan domain exhibits better antiliver fibrosis activity.},

To this end, a series of ultramicroporous mixed aluminum and iron formate framework materials, Fe-ALFs, were synthesized. Furthermore, their moisture stability has been significantly enhanced by passivation with polyvinylidene fluoride (Fe-ALF-PVDF). Gas sorption and breakthrough measurements demonstrate that Fe-ALF-PVDF exhibits outstanding CO 2 adsorption capacities (4.6 mmol/g at 298 K) and remarkable CO 2 /N 2 selectivity (387). In addition, it can be economically produced from readily available chemicals and is easy to regenerate.

High entropy oxide (HEO) sub-1 nm nanowires (SNWs) with the nearly 100% active site exposure and intrinsic stability are doubtless one of the best candidates. Herein, under a mild solvothermal condition, by incorporating phosphomolybdic acid (PMA) into multimetal oxide reaction system, a series of HEO-PMA SNWs are successfully prepared, where the variety of metal oxides is adjustable from mono component to six components. When these SNWs as the cathode catalysts are applied to LOBs, the capacity and cycling stability of the LOBs are steadily improved with the metal oxide species increasing stepwise, indicating that the entropy modulation effect plays an important role in enhancing battery performance. Additionally, considering the difference in the intrinsic catalytic activity of various metal oxides, the battery performance is further optimized by keeping the number of elements constant in HEO-PMA SNWs and just adjusting one kind of metal oxide. Particularly, BiCuFeCeWPtO x -PMA SNWs based battery delivers a high capacity (11206 mA h g –1 ) and excellent stability for 213 cycles, making it a promising electrocatalyst candidate for LOBs.},

Benefiting from the photonic Rashba–Dresselhaus spin–orbit coupling, we observe the separation of left- and right-circularly polarized emission in momentum space and real space, a signature of the OSHE. Above the lasing threshold, the OSHE pattern changes due to transverse quantization in the microbelt.

We recently identified a family of serine hydrolases termed fluorophosphonate binding hydrolases (Fphs) that play important roles in lipid metabolism and colonization of a host. Because many of these enzymes are only expressed in Staphylococcus bacteria, they are valuable targets for diagnostics and therapeutics. Here, we developed and screened highly diverse cyclic peptide libraries using mRNA display with a genetically encoded oxadiazolone (Ox) electrophile that was previously shown to potently and covalently inhibit multiple Fph enzymes. By performing multiple rounds of counter selections with WT and catalytic dead FphB, we were able to tune the selectivity of the resulting selected cyclic peptides containing the Ox residue toward the active site serine. From our mRNA display hits, we developed potent and selective fluorescent probes that label the active site of FphB at single digit nanomolar concentrations in live S. aureus bacteria. Taken together, this work demonstrates the potential of using direct genetically encoded electrophiles for mRNA display of covalent binding ligands and identifies potent new probes for FphB that have the potential to be used for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.},

  abstract     = {Supramolecular self-assembly offers an intriguing approach to construct microarchitectures, which combine properties of their molecular constituents with dynamic supramolecular features. Control over intermolecular interactions and their resulting properties can sometimes be achieved by targeted design. However, it is often unfeasible to transfer the insights gained from a specific supramolecular synthon to another chromophore without tedious synthetic work guided by trial and error. Herein we demonstrate how a flexible molecular design approach enables access to a diverse library of photophysical properties, which can be further diversified by social self-sorting strategies using a second supramolecular building block as a modulator. By intercalation into the supramolecular polymer the modulator can disrupt interchromophore interactions and modulate the ensembles emissive properties across the visible color space by simply adjusting the ratio between the two building blocks. Furthermore, by combining a chromophore appended synthon with a different morphology than the modulator the mesoscopic size distribution of the coassemblies can be modified to resemble either of its constituents. Crucially, this moldability is not only achievable for systems under thermodynamic control, but can be also employed to tune photophysical properties and thermal stability profiles of kinetically controlled states. Finally, the thermodynamic stability of the modulated polymers can be adjusted by varying the amount of solubilizing alkyl chains in the ensemble. This peripheral stabilization approach does not affect the engineered photophysical or supramolecular properties. Our results demonstrate how flexible molecular design enriched by a supramolecular modulator can offer access to a wide variety of photophysical properties and enable unique fine-tuning of various supramolecular properties.},

The intense electric field generated around the BaTiO 3 nanoparticles, as supported by density functional theory calculations, provides the suitable conditions necessary to trigger the cycloaddition of the alkyne-functionalized nanoparticles and the azide present in the solution. To quantitatively assess the occurrence of the click cycloaddition reaction at the nanoparticle surface interface, we tacked the azide with either an electroactive ferrocene moiety or with gold nanoparticles, which act as surface Raman enhancers.

  abstract     = {Amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides exhibit distinct biological activities across multiple physical length scales, including monomers, oligomers, and fibrils. The transition from Aβ monomers to pathological aggregates correlates with the emergence of chemical toxicity, which plays a critical role in the progression of neurodegenerative disorders. However, the relationship between the physical state of Aβ assemblies and their chemical toxicity remains poorly understood. Here, we show that Aβ assemblies can spontaneously generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) through transition-state-specific inherent nonenzymatic redox activity. During the transition from initial monomers to intermediate oligomers or condensates to final fibrils, interfacial electrochemical environments emerge and vary at the liquid–liquid and liquid–solid interfaces. Determined by the vibrational Stark effect using electronic pre-resonance stimulated Raman scattering microscopy, the interfacial field of such assemblies is on the order of 10 MV/cm. Interfacial activity, which depends on the Aβ transition state, can modulate the spontaneous oxidation of hydroxide anions, which leads to the formation of hydroxyl radicals. Interestingly, this redox activity modifies the chemical composition of Aβ and establishes a self-regulated positive feedback loop that accelerates aggregation and promotes fibril formation, which represents a new functioning mechanism of Aβ aggregation beyond physical cross-linking. Leveraging this mechanistic insight, we identified small molecules capable of disrupting the feedback loop by scavenging hydroxyl radicals or perturbing the interface, thereby inhibiting fibril formation. Our findings provide a nonenzymatic model of neurotoxicity and reveal the critical role of physical interfaces in modulating the chemical dynamics of biomolecular assemblies. These results offer a novel framework for therapeutic intervention in Alzheimer’s disease and related neurodegenerative disorders.},

Among the six types of putative A-site ordered perovskites with and without oxygen vacancy, only two types of oxygen-deficient perovskites CaBaFe 2 O 6−δ and Ca(Ba 0.9 Ca 0.1 ) 2 Fe 3 O 9−δ (δ ∼ 1) were successfully obtained by high-pressure synthesis, consistent with the DFT-based convex-hull calculations. Considering the evaluated stability of the putative perovskites at selected pressures, we adopted low-temperature topotactic oxidation using ozone at ambient pressure and obtained the oxidized perovskites CaBaFe 2 O 6−δ (δ ∼ 0.4) and Ca(Ba 0.9 Ca 0.1 ) 2 Fe 3 O 9−δ (δ ∼ 0.6), potentially showing novel helimagnetic phases. This study demonstrates that computational visualization of multistep synthetic pathways involving high pressure can accelerate the search for new metastable perovskites with rich magnetic phases.},

  abstract     = {Room-temperature sodium–sulfur (Na–S) batteries are emerging as a promising next-generation energy storage technology, offering high energy densities at low cost and utilizing abundant elements. However, their practical application is hindered by the shuttle effect of sodium-polysulfides and the sluggish kinetics of sulfur redox reactions. In this study, we demonstrate a heteronuclear diatomic catalyst featuring Fe and Co bimetallic sites embedded in nitrogen-doped hollow carbon nanospheres (Fe–Co/NC) as an effective sulfur host at the cathode of Na–S batteries. Aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy demonstrates the presence of isolated Fe–Co atomic pairs, while synchrotron radiation X-ray absorption fine structure analysis confirms the (Fe–Co–N 6 ) coordination structure. Density functional theory calculations show that the introduction of Fe atoms induces electron delocalization in Co(II), shifting the electronic configuration from a low-spin to a higher-spin state. This shift enhances the hybridization of the Co dz 2 orbitals with the antibonding π orbitals of sulfur atoms within the sodium sulfide species that accelerates their catalytic conversion. As a result, Fe–Co/NC-based cathodes exhibit excellent cycling stability (378 mAh g –1 after 2000 cycles) and impressive rate performance (341.1 mAh g –1 under 5 A g –1 ).},

  abstract     = {Metallophthalocyanine (MPc)-linked conductive two-dimensional (2D) metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) hold tremendous promise as modular 2D materials in sensing, catalysis, and energy-related applications due to their combinatory bimetallic system from the MPc core and bridging metal nodes, endowing them with high electrical conductivity and multifunctionality. Despite significant advances, there is a gap in fundamental understanding regarding the periodic effects of metal nodes on the structural properties of MPc-linked 2D MOFs. Herein, we report a series of highly crystalline MOFs wherein copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) is linked with Ni, Cu, and Zn nodes (CuPc-O-M, M: Ni, Cu, Zn). The prepared CuPc-O-M MOFs exhibit p -type semiconducting properties with an exceptionally high range of electrical conductivity. Notably, the differences in the 3 d orbital configurations of the Ni, Cu, and Zn nodes in CuPc-O-M MOFs lead to perturbations of the interlayer stacking patterns of the 2D framework materials, which ultimately affect material properties, such as semiconducting band gaps and charge transport within the framework. The Cu 2+ (3 d 9 ) metal node within the eclipsed interlayer stacking of CuPc-O-Cu MOF demonstrates excellent charge transport, which results in the smallest band gap of 1.14 eV and the highest electrical conductivity of 9.3 S m –1 , while the Zn 2+ (3 d 10 ) metal node within CuPc-O-Zn results in a slightly inclined interlayer stacking, leading to the largest band gap of 1.27 eV and the lowest electrical conductivity of 2.9 S m –1 . These findings form an important foundation in the strategic molecular design of this class of materials for multifaceted functionality that builds upon the electronic properties of these materials.},

Here, we report plasma-assisted epitaxy (PAE) engineering of a metal–organic 3DHS with extreme light-matter interaction for rapid single-molecule-level sensing. Plasmonic-active 3DHS composed of structure-tuned gold–silver core–shell nanoparticles (AuAgCSNPs) was precisely engineered using stable and scalable microplasma-enabled nanofabrication under ambient conditions. The engineered AuAgCSNP-based 3DHS possessed exceptional Raman enhancement under suitable laser excitation, leading to single-molecule detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins in simulated human saliva via surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). The developed plasma fabrication method allows the production of centimeter-scale SERS-active metal–organic 3DHS on disposable, flexible, lightweight, and cost-effective substrates, thereby opening a new avenue for next-generation biosensing, nanoelectronics, nanocatalysis, and biomedical applications.},

  abstract     = {Rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs) using near-neutral aqueous electrolytes are gaining significant attention due to their high energy density, low cost, high safety, and the excellent reversibility of the zinc (Zn) anode in mild electrolytes. However, the sluggish O 2 /ZnO 2 conversion in the carbon-based cathodes of these batteries leads to a large voltage hysteresis (&gt;600 mV) between charge and discharge. Metal- or metal oxide-based electrocatalysts are rarely used to reduce the overpotentials of this conversion because their presence may trigger undesirable H 2 O-participated oxygen reduction/evolution reactions, disrupting the pH balance of the electrolyte. Here, we propose a dual-layer catalytic cathode comprising an outer photocatalyst layer (exposed to air) of gold (Au) nanoparticles (NPs) decorated tungsten oxide (Au@WO 3 ) loaded on carbon paper, and an inner electrocatalyst layer (exposed to the electrolyte) based on carbon nanotube (CNT). The hydrophobic inner CNT layer not only provides numerous active sites and ample accommodation for O 2 /ZnO 2 conversion but also prevents the electrolyte from contacting the outer photocatalyst layer. Under light, the outer photocatalyst layer effectively separates photogenerated electron–hole pairs, which are then transferred to the inner CNT layer, reducing the overpotential of the O 2 /ZnO 2 electrochemical conversion. As a result, the near-neutral ZAB demonstrates high stability at 0.1 mA cm –2 ; with a very small voltage hysteresis (&lt;150 mV), significantly improving energy efficiency.},

However, the clinical success of this technique is constrained by the limited ability of current imaging techniques to differentiate effectively between cancerous and healthy tissues with high spatial resolution. To overcome this challenge, we present a nanoscale Covalent Organic Framework, nTG-DFP-COF, specifically designed to enhance fluorescence-guided cryo-imaging. This framework exhibits a unique temperature-dependent luminescence, that results in enhanced fluorescence emission under cryogenic conditions, enabling precise tissue differentiation during surgical procedures. Engineered for biocompatibility and water dispersibility, nTG-DFP-COF demonstrates minimal cytotoxicity and exceptional specificity toward cancer cells. Comprehensive in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo evaluations confirm its structural stability and functional efficacy under cryogenic conditions. This innovation not only enhances the precision and safety of cryosurgical procedures but also advances the integration of diagnostic and therapeutic functionalities into a unified platform. By substantially improving tumor targeting accuracy, the use of nTG-DFP-COF will reduce the need for repeat surgeries, facilitate faster recovery, and minimize healthcare costs, thus setting a new standard in oncologic imaging and intervention.},

Inspired by advances in the synthesis of organoboron-based multiresonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters, we herein report the convenient access and detailed characterization of a 1,4-azaborine-embedded cycloarene that features the smallest cavity among known (hetero)cycloarenes. The contracted cavity induces a bowl-shaped molecular geometry, as confirmed by crystallographic analysis, while also triggering through-space conjugation with delocalized π-electrons at the cavity site. Comparative studies between this compound and its helical analogue reveal a substantial topological impact on photophysical properties, including a bathochromic-shifted and broadened emission band, prolonged radiative decay process, and more efficient triplet-to-singlet spin-flip. Capitalizing on its efficient TADF with a remarkably high quantum yield, we successfully fabricated the first (hetero)cycloarene-based organic light-emitting diodes, achieving over 30% external quantum efficiency and minimal efficiency roll-off.

The first complex is neutral and contains two triarylamide ligands coordinating to a Dy III ion that is additionally ligated to a chloride anion, in the form of (NHAr*) 2 DyCl ( 1 ). Treatment of 1 with Tl[BArF 24 ] prompted the removal of the chloride as TlCl from the first coordination sphere to afford the mononuclear Dy III complex, [(NHAr*) 2 Dy][BArF 24 ] ( 2 ), with a cationic [(NHAr*) 2 Dy] + core. 1 and 2 were investigated through single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, UV–vis spectroscopy, and SQUID magnetometry. Both compounds are single-molecule magnets with magnetic hysteresis. The determined effective spin-reversal barriers and preattempt times for 1 and 2 are U eff = 601(2) cm –1 and 598(2) cm –1 , and τ 0 = 4.2(1) × 10 –10 s and 3.1(2) × 10 –10 s, respectively. Ab initio calculations were conducted on both molecules which uncovered the energy of the crystal field states of Dy III and affirmed the effective energy barrier height. Notably, the extrusion of the halide ion has huge ramifications on the magnetic relaxation: While 1 features butterfly hysteresis loops up to 8 K that are closed at zero field at all temperatures probed, 2 exhibits a much higher magnetic blocking temperature of T B = 19.0 K and substantial coercivity of H C = 1.03 T. Remarkably, both the T B and H C observed for 2 constitute a record for mononuclear single-molecule magnets where the metal is either sandwiched by two arene ligands or stabilized by amide functionalities, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Charge separation is at the heart of solar energy applications, and efficient materials require fast photoinduced electron transfer (ET) and slow charge recombination (CR). Using time-dependent self-consistent charge density functional tight-binding theory combined with nonadiabatic (NA) molecular dynamics, we report a detailed analysis of ET and CR in hybrids composed of photoactive covalent organic polyhedra (COP) and encapsulated fullerenes. The ET occurs on a subpicosecond time scale and accelerates with increasing fullerene diameter, C 60 to C 70 to C 84 . As the fullerene size increases, the π-electron system available for interaction with the COP grows, the fullerene-COP separation decreases, and the number of fullerene states available to accept the photoexcited electron increases, accelerating the ET. In comparison, the CR occurs on a nanosecond time scale and correlates with the length of the fullerene shortest axis because the relevant fullerene state is polarized in that direction. The largest and least symmetrical C 84 exhibits the fastest ET and the slowest CR, making COP@C 84 the most promising hybrid. Both high-frequency bond stretching and bending vibrations and low-frequency breathing modes are involved in the ET and CR processes, with more modes present in the C 84 system due its lower symmetry. The 10–20 fs vibrationally induced coherence loss in the electronic subsystem contributes to long lifetimes of the charge-separated states. The comprehensive investigation of the structure–property relationship of the charge carrier dynamics in the COP@fullerene hybrids provides a detailed atomistic understanding of interfacial ET processes and generates guidelines for rational design of high-performance materials for solar energy and related applications.},

Single-carbon-atom doping (SCAD) offers a powerful approach to enhancing molecular complexity in one process without atom loss. However, synthetically viable SCAD reactions capable of generating stereocenters have not been realized. Here, we report an SCAD reaction that creates stereocenters by unlocking the reactivity of ( N -isocyanoimino)phosphorane as an atomic carbon equivalent. This reagent facilitates the single-step conversion of various acyl chlorides into homologated α-chloro cyclic ketones, proceeding via the formation of four different bonds: one C–Cl, one C–H, and two C–C bonds at the incorporated carbon atom.},

  abstract     = {Lignocellulosic biomass-derived pyrolysis hard carbon (LCB-HC) shows promising commercial potential as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). LCB compromises multiple biopolymer carbon sources, including cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, which influence the formation and microstructure of pyrolysis HC. However, the poor plateau kinetics of LCB-HC is one of the main obstacles that severely limits its energy density with high power density, which could be attributed to the narrow interlayer distance and the lack of abundant closed pores for the intercalation/filling of Na + . Herein, we proposed a bottom-up approach to tailoring the microstructure of LCB-HC by regulating the components of the LCB precursor at the molecular level using bioenzymes secreted by lignocellulolytic bacteria. This mild and efficient enzymatic hydrolysis pathway partially depolymerized the biopolymers of basswood specifically, thereby enabling the construction of a small curved-graphite domain architecture with increased closed pores and an enlarged interlayer distance of LCB-HC, benefiting the low-voltage plateau Na + storage with accelerated kinetics. As a result, the basswood-derived HC delivers a reversible capacity of 366.4 mAh g –1 and performed remarkable plateau capacity retainability with a high proportion of 74.3% even with increased current density to 1000 mA g –1 . Such a microbial-chemistry-assisted approach provided insights into tailoring the microstructure of LCB-HC to construct high-performance SIB anode materials.},

The combined results of in/ex situ spectroscopies and molecular dynamics simulations reveal the origin of high selectivity. TFSI – shields the transportation of free H 2 O to provide moderate ·OH formation for the synthesis of chlorohydrin. DMC reconstructs hydrogen bonds with free H 2 O to minimize the interaction between them and the anode, matching the requirements of vicinal dichloride production. Thus, these hybrid electrolytes not only achieve high selectivities of 80% and 76% for chlorohydrin and vicinal dichloride, respectively, but also enable the selective chlorination of other olefins with high isolated yields of up to 74%.

  abstract     = {Self-assembled monolayer molecules have been widely employed as interfacial transport materials in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs), demonstrating high efficiency and improved device stability. However, self-assembling monolayer (SAM) molecules often suffer from aggregation and weak interactions with the perovskite layer, resulting in inefficient charge transfer and significant energy losses, ultimately limiting the power conversion efficiency and long-term stability of perovskite solar cells. In this work, we developed a series of novel skeleton-matching carbazole isomer SAMs based on the following key design principles: (1) introducing a benzene ring structure to distort the molecular skeleton of the SAM, thereby preventing aggregation and achieving a uniform distribution on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates; (2) strategically incorporating methoxy groups onto the benzene ring at different positions (ortho, meta, and para). These functional groups not only increase anchoring points with the perovskite layer but also fine-tune the molecular dipole moment. Among the SAMs, m-PhPACz exhibits the most favorable properties, with a maximum dipole moment of 2.4 D and an O–O distance that aligns excellently with the diagonal lead ions in the adjacent perovskite lattice, thereby enhancing SAM–perovskite interactions, facilitating efficient charge extraction, and improving interfacial stability. As a result, the new SAM-based PSCs achieved an impressive power conversion efficiency of 26.2%, with 12.9% improvement. Moreover, the devices demonstrated outstanding photothermal stability, retaining 96% of their initial PCE after 1000 h at 85 °C and maintaining 90% of their initial PCE after 300 h of UV-light exposure.},

In this work, charge-polarized Ir–O–Co units are constructed in alkali metal cobalt oxides (LiCoO 2 , and Na 0.74 CoO 2 ) to modify the lower Hubbard band. Benefiting from the accelerated delithiation reconstruction induced by the altered band structure, typical Ir-LiCoO 2 produces high-valent Ir sites with unsaturated coordination through the charge compensation during OER. Oxygen atoms shared by trimetallic sites exhibit strong Bro̷nsted acidity, promoting proton migration for unsaturated Ir sites and dynamically enhancing deprotonation. Furthermore, the stable coordination environment, along with electron donation from Co sites, significantly improves the stability of Ir sites. The unique electrochemical activation results in a low overpotential of 190 mV at 10 mA cm –2 during acidic OER and delivers exceptional stability at 1 A cm –2 for 150 h with a slight voltage degradation in a proton exchange membrane electrolyzer.

  abstract     = {A solid state [2 + 2] photodimerization reaction of ─C═C─ bonds in solids has been designed by controlling the molecular arrangement using supramolecular chemistry. Stilbene derivative ( C14SDA ) with alkyl amide chains (─CONHC 14 H 29 ) forms intermolecular amide hydrogen-bonding chains and exhibits reversible successive phase transitions (S1 → S2 → S3 → L) corresponding to the dynamics of the alkyl chains. In the high-temperature solid phase S3, the alkyl chains partially melt, resulting in a one-dimensional (1D) dynamic intermolecular amide hydrogen bond and ferroelectric behavior with hysteresis in the electric field–polarization curve due to polarization reversal of the dipole moment by an external electric field. The S1 phase of C14SDA did not exhibit a photodimerization reaction, while the dynamic S2 and S3 phases exhibited a [2 + 2] photodimerization reaction to form reaction products with cyclobutane rings. In the dynamic ferroelectric S3 phase, trans – cis isomerization of stilbene was observed simultaneously with the formation of the photodimerization product. When the photodimerization reaction was attempted with an electric field applied to the S3 phase, thermal molecular fluctuations were suppressed by the electric field, increasing the distance between ─C═C─ double bonds and reducing the photoreaction yield.},

  abstract     = {Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) are excellent luminescent materials, but their short exciton lifetime, typically in the nanosecond range, restricts their applications in photochemical reactions. By designing QD-molecule conjugates, the exciton energy can be cycled between the QD exciton state and the molecular triplet state through triplet energy transfer, thereby prolonging the exciton lifetime to hundreds of microseconds, which is similar to the mechanism of thermally activated delayed fluorescence in molecules. Currently, QD-molecule-based thermally activated delayed photoluminescence (TADPL) systems have covered the blue to near-infrared spectral range. Here, we extend the reach of TADPL to the violet band, including slight penetration into the ultraviolet, by using Cd, Pb-free ZnSe/ZnS core/shell QDs functionalized with biphenyl ligands, which exhibit the highest TADPL energy (up to 3.0 eV) reported to date for QD-molecule conjugates. The high exciton energy, long lifetime (80 μs), and high TADPL quantum yield (23.7%) of the ZnSe/ZnS-biphenyl system enable very high efficiency in a variety of QD-sensitized photochemical reactions.},

This study investigates the pressure-dependent energy transfer dynamics in Mn 2+ -doped CdS/ZnS core/shell QDs, focusing on how external hydrostatic pressure modulates these dynamics and optical properties. By synthesizing Mn 2+ -doped QDs with varying Mn 2+ doping concentrations, we explore the effects of the pressure on photoluminescence (PL) spectra and energy transfer efficiency. Our study reveals that increasing pressure induces a blueshift in the QD host bandgap PL and a redshift in the Mn 2+ dopant PL. The pressure-induced shifts highlight a unique modulation mechanism where the energy transfer efficiency decreases with pressure due to reduced wave function overlap between host excitons and Mn 2+ dopants. Detailed analysis of the PL quantum yields and energy transfer rate constants provides insights into these dynamics, suggesting that the pressure can effectively and reversibly regulate the energy transfer efficiencies and rates. These results have implications for developing pressure-sensitive configurable devices and exploring pressure-induced phenomena in doped nanomaterials.},

Building on foundational advances in single- and dual-selective transformations, we report a multimodal strategy for the selective carbonylation of 1,3-enynes, a versatile class of multisite substrates. Through meticulous fine-tuning of the catalytic conditions, our approach enables five distinct regio- and stereoselective carbonylative transformations, including direct functionalization (1,2- and 2,1-hydroaminocarbonylation) and tandem cyclization pathways (2,4-, 1,3-, and 2,3-carbonylation). Furthermore, mechanistic studies suggested that multidimensional precise regulation enables the seamless relay of up to three tandem reactions (hydroaminocarbonylation-hydroamination–transamination) with exceptional accuracy. This unified platform not only establishes a robust framework for tackling the enduring challenges of selectivity control in multisite substrates but also broadens the chemical space accessible through 1,3-enyne transformations, exemplifying atom- and step-economic principles and paving the way for transformative advancements in drug discovery, materials science, and beyond.},

However, there are great difficulties in their scalable and sustainable production because the strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds and other interactions of aramid macromolecules lead to lengthy processes with highly corrosive solvents. Taking advantage of uniquely efficient delamination of polymer nanocrystallites, here we show that the preparation time of para-aramid nanofibers can be reduced by 2520 times (from 1 week to four min), while their concentration can be increased by 10 times. Through this molecule intercalation-induced method, novel ribbon-like aramid nanofibers are prepared. The multiscale modeling indicated that delamination of nanofibers occurs via intercalation of alcohols at nanoscale interfaces. 1000 kg nanofiber dispersions were successfully prepared within half an hour in a pilot-scale test. These findings demonstrate the realism of effective aramid recycling into a wide range of multifunctional nanofiber composites.},

  abstract     = {Hydrophobic ionic liquid (HIL) engineering on the catalyst surface represents a simple yet potent direction for optimizing the CO 2 electroreduction performance. However, the pivotal role of HIL engineering at an industrial current density is still ambiguous due to limited and conflicting research findings. Herein, HIL-engineered oxide-derived Cu porous nanoparticles with electron-delocalized groups and a specific ultramicropore structure are first constructed to facilitate CO 2 -to-C 2+ electroreduction at ampere-level current densities. The uniformly decorated HIL is innovatively demonstrated by positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy, which offers unparalleled advantages in ultramicropore characterization. Bader charge-dependent performance analyses and theoretical calculations disclose that the N atoms in the HIL lower the adsorption energy of CO on the atop site from −0.38 to −1.42 eV through electron donation, which inverts the most stable adsorption site and favors the energy-efficient dimerization of atop-bound CO. Operando Raman spectra and in situ attenuated total reflection-surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy indicate that the adhered HIL increases *CO coverage and alters the *CO adsorption configuration to an atop-bound state with an abundant high-frequency band. Furthermore, staircase potential electrochemical impedance spectroscopy unravels the specific arrangement structure of HIL enlarges the electrochemical surface charge by about 1.5 times, thereby accelerating CO 2 electroreduction. As a result, the HIL-engineered oxide-derived Cu porous nanoparticles achieve a prominent C 2+ productivity with a Faradaic efficiency of 85.1% and a formation rate up to 2512 μmol h –1 cm –2 , outperforming most reported Cu-based electrocatalysts.},

In this work, we have successfully synthesized and characterized 35 cyclometalated Au(III) complexes containing dithiocarbamate ligands, with 25 of these complexes being previously unreported. Their ability to induce phagocytosis in vitro against immunologically “cold” malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) cells was strongly dependent on the cyclometalated scaffold and the overall lipophilicity of the complexes. We elucidated the role of cell death mechanisms in the observed ICD effects and identified correlations between the ability of the complexes to induce necrotic cell death and ICD, both in vitro and in vivo . Complex 2G , with its high phagocytosis rates and low necrosis rates, was recognized as a bona fide ICD inducer, demonstrating a remarkably long-lasting immune response in vaccinated mice. In contrast, complex 1C , characterized by high phagocytosis rates and high necrosis rates, failed to elicit a sustained immune response upon following vaccination; however, it triggered selective activation of calreticulin in tumors upon direct in vivo administration. Overall, this study offers a framework for predicting ICD effects in vivo for structurally similar Au(III) complexes, with the potential for extension to other series of metal complexes.},

To address these issues, we introduce dual-targeted unimolecular theranostic probes (e.g., radioactive 177 Lu-P-A and its cold counterpart nat Lu-P-A) for disease-activatable PROTACs in combination with targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT) against prostate cancer with high specificity and effectiveness. The probes achieve a cathepsin B (CTSB)-activatable pro-PROTAC moiety for precise degradation of bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) and a prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted 177 Lu-based TRT. Owing to the favorable pharmacokinetics and PSMA-mediated excellent targeting efficiency, the probe possesses high tumor imaging specificity and accumulation capacity of therapeutic units for highly effective PROTACs and TRT. In contrast, the free PROTACs unit (e.g., ARV-771) shows no observable therapeutic effect due to its poor targeting ability. Importantly, the BRD4 proteolysis by PROTAC activation can downregulate radiosensitivity-associated RAD51AP1 expression, synergistically enhancing the TRT effect and promoting apoptosis after combined therapy compared to individual treatment regimes. Additionally, the probe demonstrates high renal clearance, underscoring its biosafety for potential clinical translation. This study presents a potential approach for precise PROTACs combined with TRT for effective tumor therapy.},

  abstract     = {Engineering sublattice imbalance is an intuitive way to induce high-spin ground states in bipartite polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbons (PCHs). Such molecules can be employed as building blocks of quantum spin chains, which are outstanding platforms to study fundamental models in quantum magnetism. This is exemplified by recent reports on the bottom-up synthesis of antiferromagnetic spin chains that provided insights into paradigmatic quantum phenomena such as fractionalization. In contrast to antiferromagnetism, demonstration of ferromagnetic coupling between PCHs has been scarce. Previous attempts in this direction were limited by the formation of nonbenzenoid rings leading to spin quenching or the use of spacer motifs that weaken the magnitude of ferromagnetic exchange. Here, we demonstrate the on-surface synthesis of short ferromagnetic spin chains based on dibenzotriangulene, a triplet PCH. Our synthetic strategy centers on the concept of achieving a direct (without spacer motifs) majority–minority sublattice coupling between adjacent molecules. This leads to a global sublattice imbalance in spin chains scaling with the chain length and therefore a ferromagnetic ground state with a strong intermolecular ferromagnetic exchange. Through scanning probe measurements and quantum chemical calculations, we analyze the electronic and magnetic properties of ferromagnetic dimers and trimers of dibenzotriangulene and confirm their quintet and septet ground states, respectively, with an intermolecular ferromagnetic exchange of 7 meV. Furthermore, we elucidate the role of sublattice coupling on magnetism through complementary experiments on antiferromagnetic dibenzotriangulene dimers with majority–majority and minority–minority sublattice couplings. We expect our study to provide impetus for the design of organic ferromagnetic materials.},

Here, we report the design of proteins designed to bind powerful photooxidants and the evaluation of the use of these proteins to generate diffusible small-molecule reactive species. Because excited-state dynamics are influenced by the dynamics and hydration of a photooxidant’s environment, it was important to not only design a binding site but also to evaluate its dynamic properties. Thus, we used computational design in conjunction with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to design a protein, designated NBP ( N DI B inding P rotein), that held a naphthalenediimide (NDI), a powerful photooxidant, in a programmable molecular environment. Solution NMR confirmed the structure of the complex. We evaluated two NDI cofactors in this de novo protein using ultrafast pump–probe spectroscopy to evaluate light-triggered intra- and intermolecular electron transfer function. Moreover, we demonstrated the utility of this platform to activate multiple molecular probes for protein labeling.},

Materials that contain a combination of metal cations with an s 2 electron lone pair and a d 0 electronic configuration, such as BiVO 4 , possess favorable band gaps. BiVO 4 has also been reported to possess noncentrosymmetric polar properties, such as flexoelectricity, piezo-photocatalysis, and an anomalous photovoltaic effect, despite its centrosymmetric crystal structure. Here, it is shown how centrosymmetric materials possessing s 2 and d 0 cations can display “hidden” local-scale features, often ignored by conventional crystallography, that influence their physical properties. Anomalous peak shapes are observed in the high-resolution synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction of BiVO 4 , and temperature-dependent local-scale distortions are revealed using neutron total scattering methods. Together, these suggest the polar properties of BiVO 4 are related to local-scale distortions induced by the Bi 3+ 6 s 2 electron lone pairs. This demonstrates the possibility of engineering specific interatomic distances between lone pair-bearing cations and the anion sublattice, creating new opportunities for photocatalytic and polar materials from compounds with long-range centrosymmetric structures.},

  abstract     = {Strong metal–support interactions (SMSI) are at the cutting edge of catalysis research, yet their size-dependent nature remains both widespread and subject to ongoing debate. Here, we report the discovery of bell-shaped size-dependent SMSI, and we establish its structure–SMSI–performance relationship in oxidative C–H/O–H coupling reactions. Using Au/ZnO as a prototypical catalyst, we develop a thermodynamic equilibrium model that quantitatively captures the size-dependent surface energy and tension disparities, identifying the particle size ratio as the descriptor for bell-shaped encapsulation dynamics. Larger Au particles with a higher surface energy are prone to wetting by smaller ZnO particles, triggering lattice oxygen spillover to form Au–O species that accelerate the rate-limiting hemiacetal β-H elimination. Simultaneously, residual oxygen vacancies serve as frustrated Lewis pairs, synergizing with Au–O to replenish hemiacetals and complete the catalytic cycle. This dual promotional mechanism overcomes the oxygen activation bottleneck in traditional Au catalysts, achieving state-of-the-art performance of 94.6% aldehyde conversion and 97.0% ester selectivity. The obtained structure–SMSI relationships are applicable to Ir/ZnO and Rh/ZnO catalysts, with similar SMSI–performance relationships extending to various aldehyde substrates, including saturated, unsaturated, and aromatic. These generalizable relationships lay a strong foundation for the strategic design and manipulation of SMSI states.},

  abstract     = {Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) represent powerful tools to modulate the activity of classically “undruggable” proteins, but their application has been limited to known ligands and a few select protein classes. Herein, we present our chemoproteomic strategy for simultaneous de novo discovery of novel degraders and ligands for challenging and previously “undruggable” targets. Using comparative PROTAC versus ligand global proteomics analyses, we rapidly identify proteins selectively downregulated by several “untargeted” PROTACs containing a VHL E3 ligase recruiter and various covalent and noncovalent ligands. We showcase our approach by identifying a first-in-class PROTAC for metallothionein 2A (MT2A), a small, cysteine-rich, metal-binding protein implicated in heavy metal detoxification, zinc homeostasis, and cellular invasion. Notably, isoform-specific MT overexpression has been shown to augment cellular migration and invasion across several cancer cell lines, although the precise mechanisms are unknown due to insufficient tools to study MTs. We show that optimized PROTAC AA-BR-157 covalently binds conserved C44, degrades overexpressed MT2A with nanomolar potency, and reduces the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells. We further demonstrate a time-dependent increase in intracellular zinc levels following MT2A degradation as well as downregulation of protein diaphanous homolog 3 (DIAPH3), a positive regulator of actin and cell motility. Super-resolution imaging of MDA-MB-231 cells shows that the downregulation of MT2A and DIAPH3 inhibits cell polarization and thereby migration, suggesting that MT2A may regulate motility via DIAPH3-dependent cytoskeletal remodeling. In summary, our strategy enables the de novo discovery of PROTACs and ligands for novel disease-related targets and lays the groundwork for expansion of the druggable proteome.},

  abstract     = {Developing effective structural design strategies for regulating charge transport is a central focus in molecular electronics. The interplay between molecular symmetry and orbital distribution, facilitated by heteroatom substitution, presents opportunities for direct modulation in both resonant and off-resonance tunneling processes. In this study, scanning tunneling microscopy-break junction techniques and the first-principles calculations are employed to investigate the electronic properties of boron-embedded acenes. Compared to the parent acene, boron incorporation shifts the transport-dominating molecular orbital from a centrally localized distribution to a delocalized configuration across the orthogonal molecular backbone. This shift results in a 10-fold increase in conductance in the off-resonance region near zero bias and a 50-fold enhancement in conductance through near-resonant tunneling at high bias voltages. Notably, expanding the central acene fragment increases orbital asymmetry within molecular junctions, thereby compromising transport efficiency. However, applying a bias voltage gradually mitigates the symmetry-breaking effect, leading to through-backbone orbital distribution and a recovery in the near-resonant tunneling conductance. This orthogonal control of electronic transport channels provides a distinct strategy for the effective regulation of molecular conductance.},

Within this workflow, we identified 494 unique reconstructed surface structures that surpass conventional chemical intuition-driven, bulk-truncated models. After constructing the surface Pourbaix diagram under Bi- and V-rich electrolyte conditions using density functional theory and hybrid functional calculations, we proposed structural models for the experimentally observed Bi-rich BiVO 4 surfaces. By performing hybrid functional molecular dynamics simulations with the explicit treatment of water molecules on selected reconstructed BiVO 4 (010) surfaces, we observed water dissociation from molecular water. Our findings demonstrate significant water dissociation on reconstructed Bi-rich surfaces, highlighting the critical role of bare and undercoordinated Bi sites (only observable in reconstructed surfaces) in driving hydration processes. Our work establishes a foundation for understanding the role of complex, reconstructed Bi surfaces in surface hydration and reactivity. Additionally, our theoretical framework for exploring surface structures and predicting reactivity in multicomponent oxides offers a precise approach to describing complex surface and interface processes in PEC systems.},

  abstract     = {Because mixed-halide wide-bandgap (1.6–2.0 eV) perovskite solar cells suffer from operating instability related to light-induced halide segregation, it is of interest to study alternative means of bandgap widening. Perovskitoids combine wide bandgaps and structural stability resulting from face- or edge-sharing octahedral connections in their crystal structures. Unfortunately, there existed no prior reports of three-dimensional (3D) perovskitoids having direct bandgaps with optical absorption edges less than 2.2 eV. As the most significant predictor of perovskitoid bandgaps is the fraction of corner-sharing in their crystal structures, we hypothesized that increasing the amount of corner-sharing would access lower bandgaps than previously reported. We accomplished this by mixing a spacer cation within the size range for 3D perovskitoid formation with a smaller perovskite-forming cation. We explored three spacer cations of different sizes: ethylammonium (EA), cyclopropylammonium (c-C3A), and cyclobutylammonium (c-C4A), combining these with methylammonium (MA), and found that the middle cation, c-C3A, pairs with MA to form a 3D perovskitoid with the formula (c-C3A) 3 (MA) 3 Pb 5 I 16 and a direct bandgap with an optical absorption edge at 2.0 eV. Solution-processed films of this perovskitoid showed improved light stability over mixed-halide perovskites, and solar cells based on these films exhibit increased maximum power point operating stability compared to reference mixed-halide devices.},

  abstract     = {Despite their biological significance, the study of hydropersulfides (RSSH) is often limited due to their inherent instability. Here, we introduce arylsulfonothioates as thiol-activated RSSH donors and provide insight into cellular reactive sulfur species homeostasis. These precursors persulfidate physiologically relevant thiols (RSH) to form the corresponding RSSH. Real-time monitoring of hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) generation via membrane inlet mass spectrometry (MIMS) was employed to follow RSSH production, revealing that electron-donating aryl substituents marginally slow RSSH release rates, whereas electron-withdrawing substituents slightly accelerate release. Furthermore, arylsulfonothioates with strong electron-withdrawing substituents offer superior protection against doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiotoxicity. Experiments using H9c2 cardiomyocytes affirmed the cell-permeability of arylsulfonothioates and their ability to increase intracellular RSSH levels and protein persulfidation levels. Notably, we observe the excretion of RSSH into the extracellular medium. Further investigations revealed the involvement of the cystine/glutamate antiporter SLC7A11, as cotreatment with its inhibitor, sulfasalazine, significantly reduce extracellular RSSH release. H9c2 cells exhibit tolerance to arylsulfonothioate 1g with an electron-withdrawing 4-cyano group at 1 mM; however, inhibition of the cystine antiporter results in a minor decrease in cell viability. Under oxidative stress conditions induced by DOX or hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), cotreatment with 1g diminishes the excretion of RSSH and confers cytoprotection against DOX or H 2 O 2 -mediated toxicity. Our findings show adaptive cellular responses to RSSH levels, demonstrating excretion under elevated conditions to maintain redox homeostasis and intracellular retention as a protective response during oxidative stress.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic organic crystals are becoming recognized as some of the fastest materials for converting light or heat to mechanical work. The degree of deformation and the response time of any actuating material are often exclusive of each other; however, both factors influence the material’s overall performance limits. Unlike polymers, whose disordered structures are not conducive to rapid energy transfer, cooperative phase transitions in dynamic molecular crystals that are amenable to rapid and concerted martensitic-like structure switching could help circumvent that limitation. Here, we report that single crystals of a dibenzothiophene sulfone derivative exhibit extraordinarily large, rapid, and reversible elongation when they undergo a thermally induced phase transition. The value for the linear stroke of ∼15% along the long crystal axis with retention of macroscopic integrity of this material is remarkable and capitalizes on an anisotropic lattice switching with relative changes of 14.8% and −9.5% along its crystallographic a and c axes, respectively, resulting in a visible macroscopic elongation of the crystal. The transitioning crystals deliver forces ranging from 0.19 to 15 μN and a work density of ∼7 × 10 –3 J m –3 . The phase transformation is accompanied by a change in symmetry between centrosymmetric and noncentrosymmetric space groups and a significant change in both the fluorescence and the second-order nonlinear optical (NLO) response. The combination of these properties makes this material a favorable choice for low-power, precise, and small-scale NLO actuation applications.},

Combined experimental and theoretical studies unveil that the strong antiferromagnetic coupling between the benzene dianion and 4f 7 Eu 2+ ions is pivotal to the stabilization of the triplet state of the benzene dianion with Baird aromaticity. In addition, a comparison with analogous ytterbium benzene and europium para -xylene complexes further reveals that the spin state of the benzene dianion depends on the spin–spin interaction and local symmetry. These results accomplish the isolation of the long-sought triplet benzene dianion and illustrate the effectiveness of spin modulation using lanthanide ions.},

  abstract     = {Designing a rational electrocatalyst/electrolyte interface with superb active hydrogen supply is of significant importance for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs). Here, we propose a strategy to tune the interfacial active hydrogen supply via inducing dissoluble cation into electrocatalysts to boost HER in alkali, with electrochemical lithiated sub-2 nm RuSn 0.8 nanowires (NWs) as a proof of concept. It is found that a part of Li + could dissolve in situ from lithiated RuSn 0.8 NWs during HER, which tends to affect the interfacial structure and facilitate the proton transport. Among all the Li–Ru–Sn and Ru–Sn NWs, the best-performing Li 3.0 RuSn 0.8 NWs exhibit the lowest initial overpotential of 66 mV at 100 mA cm –2 in 1.0 M KOH, which could be further reduced to 38 mV after the 30 000 cycles accelerated stability test (AST). In situ Raman spectroscopy and operando X-ray adsorption spectroscopy indicate that the pristine Li 3.0 RuSn 0.8 NWs are highly active toward water dissociation and the dissolved Li + during AST could further enhance the flexibility of the hydrogen bond network for proton transportation. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations disclose that the incorporation of Li into the Ru–Sn lattice is beneficial to lower the water dissociation barrier, while dissolved Li + at the interface significantly increases the population of interfacial water molecules, thereby providing sufficient active hydrogens for H 2 production. The AEMWE equipped with the Li 3.0 RuSn 0.8 NWs cathode delivers an extremely low cell voltage (1.689 V) at an industrial-scale current density (1 A cm –2 ) and outstanding stability (56 μV h –1 loss at 1 A cm –2 after 1000 h galvanostatic test), representing one of the best alkaline HER electrocatalysts ever reported.},

  abstract     = {Photoelectrochemical water splitting offers a promising pathway for green hydrogen production, but its efficiency is limited by electron−hole recombination. Overcoming this challenge requires detailed analysis of the relationship between charge separation and charge transfer kinetics under operando conditions. Here, we applied intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) combined with distribution of relaxation times (DRT) analysis to the photoanodic process under varying light intensities. This approach revealed three distinct applied potential regions: a high-potential region with constant admittance independent of light intensity; a midpotential region strongly influenced by light intensity; and a low-potential region with back electron−hole recombination (BER). Crucially, our analysis demonstrated that what has traditionally been viewed as a single bulk recombination process can be resolved into distinct mechanisms based on light intensity dependence. Additionally, we identified satellite peaks in the slow kinetic regions for the first time. These peaks, influenced by light intensity and reaction conditions, revealed novel insights into surface-trapped hole dynamics. Based on these insights, we propose tailored band bending models for each kinetic scenario and discuss the implications of satellite peaks for reaction bottlenecks. These results offer new perspectives on understanding and optimizing photoelectrochemical systems.},

The presence of coordinatively unsaturated metal sites within their structures provides additional binding locations for substrates in catalytic processes. Consequently, MOCNs fabricated on solid surfaces are emerging as promising candidates for use in solution-based heterogeneous applications. The bottom-up synthesis of such surface-supported MOCNs requires a rigorous design by utilizing two-dimensional (2D) crystal engineering. However, a comprehensive description of the factors governing their synthesis at the liquid–solid interface is still missing, resulting in only a few reported examples. In this work, we use scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) at the liquid–solid interface to reveal the effect of the choice of solvent, concentration, and temperature on the structure of a surface-supported MOCN constituted by a tritopic ligand containing pyridyl moieties and trans -protected Pd(II) cations. A quantitative analysis of the network’s crystallinity is presented. Furthermore, the impact of the synthetic pathway is investigated and a qualitative description of the growth mechanism is provided. Finally, the porosity of the extended honeycomb network is examined by studying the adsorption of guest molecules in its pores.},

Here, we report an approach for scalable and robust solar H 2 evolution by enhancing photogenerated charge transport in a H 2 -evolving molecular photoelectrode. The photoelectrode is based on p-type conjugated polymers that are homogeneously distributed in a polycarbazole network. With a self-assembled NiS 2 catalyst, the photoelectrode under solar irradiation (100 mW cm –2 , AM 1.5 G) is capable of evolving H 2 from seawater at an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 34.4% under an applied bias of −0.06 V vs RHE. When scaling up from 1 cm 2 to 25 cm 2 , the photoelectrode generates photocurrents stabilized at 0.4 A and maintains the high EQE at an efficiency loss of less than 1%. Investigation of the photogenerated charge-transport dynamics reveals that the kinetic basis for scaling up lies in the desirable hole diffusion length that far exceeds the spacing between adjacent conjugated-polymer chains due to interchain π–π interactions.},

  abstract     = {The development of porous materials exhibiting steep and stepwise adsorption of water vapor at desired humidity is crucial for implementing diverse applications such as humidity control, heat allocation, and atmospheric water harvesting. The precise molecular-level elucidation of structural characteristics and chemical components that dictate the water sorption behaviors in confined nanospaces, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) in particular, is fundamentally important, but this has yet to be largely explored. In this work, by leveraging the isoreticular principle, we crafted two pairs of isostructural Zr-MOFs with linker backbones of benzene and pyrazine acting as hydrogen-bonding donor and acceptor, respectively. The outstanding water sorption cyclic durability of the four Zr-MOFs permits persuasive investigation of the correlation of the water sorption inflection point and steepness (the two central figures-of-merit for water sorption) with the linker functionality. The two pyrazine-carrying Zr-MOFs both show steep water uptake at lower relative pressure and slightly decreased steepness, which are quantitatively described by the Dubinin-Astakhov relation. We deciphered the privileged water clusters through single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies in which the pyrazine moiety formed stronger hydrogen-bonding interactions with guest water molecules and favored the formation of water pentamers instead of hexamers that are observed in the benzene analog. The hydrogen-bonding donor/acceptor manipulation approach presented in this work may facilitate future research endeavors focusing on molecular attribute engineering in predeterminedly ultrawater-resistant MOF platforms for efficient regulation of water sorption behaviors toward customized applications.},

Despite not being trained on any literature precedents, the routes designed by the algorithm mimic the strategies used by human experts.

This structure consists of dimers of face-sharing octahedra arranged on the vertices of a triangular network. The transition metal ions occupy sites in these octahedra, leading to Fe 2 Cl 9 4– and FeMnCl 9 4– bioctahedra, respectively. The bioctahedral clusters are sandwiched by layers of corner-sharing octahedra occupied by Na + cations. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy reveals optical transitions that arise from metal-to-metal charge transfer (Cs 3 NaMnFeCl 9 ) and intervalence charge transfer (Cs 3 NaFe 2 Cl 9 ) excitations. In Cs 3 NaFe 2 Cl 9 , magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal local ferromagnetic coupling (θ CW = 16.7 K), mediated by the rapid exchange of an electron between the iron sites within each dimer. In contrast, the magnetic coupling between Fe 3+ and Mn 2+ in Cs 3 NaMnFeCl 9 is antiferromagnetic (θ CW = −41.4 K). At 100 K, the Mössbauer spectrum is dominated by a single type of iron that corresponds to Fe 2.5+ , signaling electron exchange between iron sites that is faster than the Mössbauer time scale (∼100 ns). Upon further cooling, the Fe 2.5+ signal gives way to a 1:1 ratio of Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ , as the thermally activated hopping slows down.},

  abstract     = {The rapid expansion in lithium battery production and disposal presents considerable sustainability challenges, emphasizing the critical need for recycling. However, current methods predominantly focus on metals from cathodes, while electrolytes have rarely been recycled. Here, we propose an innovative closed-loop design for solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs), enabled by reversible catalysis of lithium bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonimide (LiTFSI) in both polymerization and depolymerization. The formation of a hydrogen-bonded adduct between TFSI – and alcohol initiates the in situ ring-opening polymerization of Li + -activated trimethylene carbonate (TMC), generating well-defined SPEs. With delicate structural optimization, the SPE achieves an outstanding ionic conductivity of 1.62 × 10 –3 S cm –1 at room temperature with robust high-voltage stability up to 4.7 V. The assembled Li||NCM811 demonstrates promising cycling stability with 88% capacity retention over 100 cycles. Upon end-of-life, LiTFSI facilitates selective depolymerization of the polycarbonate-based SPE at 180 °C without introducing external catalysts, recovering both TMC monomer (&gt;90%) and LiTFSI (&gt;98%) for reuse. This work highlights a significant advance in closed-loop recyclable SPEs and a vital step toward sustainable lithium battery technology.},

These copolypeptides incorporate two distinct thiol reactive components where each segment can respond differently to a single thiol stimulus. Incubation of M O 35 A DH 30 vesicles with glutathione under intracellular mimetic conditions resulted in vesicle disruption and release of cargo. Further, incubation of M O 35 A DH 30 vesicles with thiolglycolic acid resulted in a reversal of amphipilicity and successful in situ inversion of the vesicle assemblies.

  abstract     = {Effective delivery of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and their organ- or cell-type targeting are paramount for therapeutic success. Achieving this requires a comprehensive understanding of protein corona dynamics and the identification of cell receptors involved in the recognition and uptake of LNPs. We introduce a simple, fast, and in situ strategy by a biosensor-based “Fishing” method to uncover protein corona formation on LNPs and identify key receptors of human blood cells that are responsible for the recognition and binding of human plasma corona on the surface of LNPs. Unexpectedly, we observed a significant presence of immunoglobulins with high abundance, especially anti-PEG antibodies, within the LNP corona. These antibodies, along with complement opsonization, drive colony-stimulating factor 2 receptor β (CSF2RB)-mediated phagocytosis by human myeloid cells. These compositions of the human plasma corona and their interactions with neighboring proteins are critical for the recognition and binding of LNPs by cell receptors and cellular uptake. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of anti-PEG antibodies in the circulation and phagocytosis of LNPs in vivo . This approach offers profound insights into nanomaterial behavior in vivo , paving the way for the enhanced design and efficacy of LNP-based therapies.},

  abstract     = {The rhodamine motif has been modified in myriad ways to produce probes with specific fluorescent and chemical properties optimal for a variety of fluorescence microscopy experiments. Recently, far-red (&gt;640 nm) emitting silicon rhodamines have become popular in single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM), since these dyes are membrane-permeable and can be used alongside red (570–640 nm) emitting fluorophores for two-color imaging. While this has expanded multicolor SMLM imaging capabilities, we demonstrate that silicon rhodamines can create previously unreported photoproducts with significantly blueshifted emissions, which appear as bright single-molecule crosstalk in the red emission channel. We show that this fluorescence is caused by the replacement of the central silicon group with oxygen after 640 nm illumination, turning far-red silicon rhodamines (JFX650, JF669, etc.) into their red oxygen rhodamine counterparts (JFX554, JF571, etc.). While this blueshifted population can cause artifacts in two-color SMLM data, we demonstrate up to 16-fold reduction in crosstalk using oxygen scavenging systems. We also leverage this far-red photoconversion to demonstrate UV-free photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) without the need for additives, and with 5-fold higher efficiency than the Cy5 to Cy3 conversion. Finally, we demonstrate multiplexed pseudo two-color PALM in a single emission channel by separating localizations by their photoactivation wavelengths instead of their emission wavelengths.},

In this study, we present novel real-time fluorogenic probes to monitor both subcellular dynamics of ADC trafficking and payload release. We optimized a tandem molecular design of sequential pH- and enzyme-activatable naphthalimide fluorophores to (1) track their subcellular localization along the endolysosomal pathway and (2) monitor linker cleavage with OFF-to-ON fluorescence switches. Live-cell imaging microscopy revealed that fluorogenic ADCs can traffic to the lysosomes and yet require residence time in these subcellular compartments for efficient linker cleavage. Notably, the compact size of fluorogenic naphthalimides did not impair the recognition of target cell surface reporters or the kinetics of payload release. This modular platform is applicable to many ADCs and holds promise to inform their rational design for optimal release profiles and therapeutic efficacy.},

  abstract     = {Imidazolium-based ionic liquids have led to enhanced CO 2 electroreduction activity due to cation effects at the cathode surface, stabilizing the reaction intermediates and decreasing the activation energy. In aqueous media, alkali cations are also known to improve CO 2 reduction activity on metals such as Ag, with the enhancement attributed to electrical double layer effects and trending with the size of the alkali cation. However, the effect of a mixed catholyte solution of alkali cations in the presence of an imidazolium-based ionic liquid has not been well-explored. Herein, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate, [EMIM][BF 4 ], in water was investigated with alkali salts to unravel the interaction effects for CO 2 electroreduction on Ag. Although both [EMIM] + and alkali cations have individually improved CO 2 to CO conversion on Ag in water, electrochemical results showed that alkali cations hindered imidazolium-mediated CO 2 electroreduction in most conditions. Li + , in particular, was sharply inhibitory compared to other alkali cations and strongly redirected the selectivity to hydrogen evolution. The nature of the alkali cation inhibition was investigated with spectroscopic techniques, including in situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and dynamic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (DEIS). Along with computational insights from density functional theory (DFT), the electrochemical and spectroscopic data suggest that alkali cations inhibit [EMIM]-mediated CO 2 reduction by competing for surface adsorption sites, preventing the potential-dependent structural reorientation of imidazolium, and promoting hydrogen evolution by bringing solvated water to the cathode surface.},

The Ni/ZnO with the optimum Lewis acidity could balance water dissociation and hydroxyl desorption, thereby greatly boosting the HER. On the basis of this finding, we further in situ grew the Ni/ZnO heterostructure on a three-dimensional conductive support. The resulting catalyst requires overpotentials of merely 34 and 194 mV to deliver the current densities of 10 and 200 mA cm –2 , respectively, and can stably operate at these current densities for 2000 h in 1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 7), representing the most active and durable HER catalyst in neutral electrolyte reported thus far.

However, despite FDA approval for use in neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), the effective in vivo delivery of therapeutic aptamers is hindered by ocular barriers and rapid degradation in biofluids. Here, we demonstrated a microinvasive delivery of VEGFA-targeted aptamers to the ocular fundus using tetrahedral framework nucleic acids (tFNAs). Upon incorporating anti-VEGFA aptamers to the tFNAs (apt-tFNA), we interrogated their penetration across the outer blood–retinal barrier (oBRB) to the innermost retinal in the eyeball, while maintaining their structural integrity. In addition, the apt-tFNA showed superior efficacy in inhibiting vascular proliferation and migration by neutralizing VEGFA. Furthermore, in a laser-induced CNV mouse model, subconjunctival injection of apt-tFNA exhibited comparable antiangiogenic efficacy to intravitreal ranibizumab, a monoclonal antibody fragment. These findings suggest that FNAs can effectively deliver therapeutic aptamers to the ocular fundus without compromising their antiangiogenic properties, highlighting their potential for microinvasive and feasible periocular administration in treating neovascular ophthalmic diseases.},

The modification of ΔAla is a powerful method for the semisynthetic engineering of NPs and for post-translational protein mutagenesis. Numerous enabling ΔAla modification techniques have been developed over the years, but most state-of-the-art approaches furnish product mixtures detrimental in many applications. Here, we report a Pd(II)-mediated coupling reaction between aryl N -methylimidodiacetic acid boronates and ΔAla-containing peptides and proteins which yields Δ z Phe coupling products with high selectivity. The coupling proceeds in water under ambient conditions (37 °C, &lt;24 h) and without the exclusion of oxygen using fully unprotected substrates. The speed and high selectivity of the reaction is enabled by the use of N , N ′-ethylene-bis- L threonine as a Pd(II) ligand. We utilize this chemistry to selectively functionalize a variety of oligopeptides, NP-like compounds, and intact proteins. Finally, we show that the coupling reaction can be readily adapted to modify in vitro translated peptides by devising a platform for the chemoribosomal synthesis of Δ z Phe-containing structures. Altogether, our chemistry provides a powerful tool for the selective late-stage functionalization of ΔAla in peptides and proteins.},

Combining coordination and colloidal methods, we developed a simple approach for synthesizing an atomically precise CdTe nanocluster with high purity and stability. Specifically, a precise cadmium–thiolate compound, [Cd 4 (SR) 9 ] n , was reacted with a facile phosphine telluride (TePR 3 ) precursor to produce a CdTe magic-sized cluster with a distinct absorption peak at 377 nm and a narrow linewidth of 20 nm. X-ray crystallography reveals the cluster is Cd 32 Te 14 (SR) 36 (PR 3 ) 4 , a homologue of Cd 32 S 14 and Cd 32 Se 14 reported about three decades ago, thus filling the missing link in this family. The cluster features a zincblende core in a truncated tetrahedron shape. While the core is achiral, chirality emerges from the rotational stacking of surface ligands. The left and right enantiomers self-assemble into a highly ordered, atomically coherent cubic superlattice, leading to a rare racemic crystal coined as “kryptoracemate.” This method provides an accessible platform for further atomic engineering of CdTe and related nanoclusters toward their target applications.},

In particular, we focus on the ligand field excited states that dominate the photophysics of first-row transition metal complexes. We investigate if they can be significantly delocalized off the metal center, possibly yielding photochemical reactivity more similar to charge transfer excited states than metal-centered ligand field excited states. Here, [Ni(mpo) 2 ] (mpo = 2-mercaptopyridine- N -oxide) provides a representative example for the larger chemical class and is an active electro- and photocatalyst for proton reduction. A detailed characterization of the excited state electronic structure, dynamics, and photochemistry of [Ni(mpo) 2 ] is presented based on ultrafast transient X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Ni and S 1s core absorption K-edges. By comparing the ultrafast Ni K-edge absorption to ab initio calculations, we identify an excited state relaxation mechanism where an initial ligand-to-metal charge transfer excitation results in both excited state electron transfer (generating a catalytically relevant reduced photoproduct [Ni(mpo) 2 ] − ) and relaxation to a pseudotetrahedral triplet ligand field excited state. From the ultrafast S K-edge absorption, the ligand field excited state is found to be highly delocalized onto the thiolate ligands, and a tetrahedral structural distortion is shown to substantially influence the degree of delocalization. The results identify a significant structural coordinate to target when aiming to control the excited state covalency in square planar complexes.},

  abstract     = {meta -Nitration of azines (pyridines and quinolines) serves as a powerful method for the prompt construction and derivatization of several pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials. However, due to the inherent electronic properties of pyridines, achieving direct selective meta –C–H nitration under mild conditions has been a long-standing challenge in synthetic chemistry. Currently, there is no adequate strategy for late-stage meta –C–H nitration of pyridine-containing drugs and drug precursors. To address this void, we introduce a practical protocol for the highly regioselective meta -nitration of pyridines using a dearomatization-rearomatization strategy. The introduced method provides a diversification platform for selective nitration at the meta -position of azines via a radical pathway. This mild, open-air, one-pot, scalable, and catalyst-free process is employed for the late-stage meta -nitration of pyridine containing drugs, drug precursors, and ligands using pyridines as the limiting reagents. Consecutive C3 and C5 difunctionalization of pyridines is also achieved with complete regiocontrol relying on sequential addition, which further highlights the potential of the presented work. Additionally, the obtained products could be transformed into meta -amino azine products and other valuable building blocks.

  abstract     = {The development of machine learning models to predict the regioselectivity of C(sp 3 )–H functionalization reactions is reported. A data set for dioxirane oxidations was curated from the literature and used to generate a model to predict the regioselectivity of C–H oxidation. To assess whether smaller, intentionally designed data sets could provide accuracy on complex targets, a series of acquisition functions were developed to select the most informative molecules for the specific target. Active learning-based acquisition functions that leverage predicted reactivity and model uncertainty were found to outperform those based on molecular and site similarity alone. The use of acquisition functions for data set elaboration significantly reduced the number of data points needed to perform accurate prediction, and it was found that smaller, machine-designed data sets can give accurate predictions when larger, randomly selected data sets fail. Finally, the workflow was experimentally validated on five complex substrates and shown to be applicable to predicting the regioselectivity of arene C–H radical borylation. These studies provide a quantitative alternative to the intuitive extrapolation from “model substrates” that is frequently used to estimate reactivity on complex molecules.},

  abstract     = {Peptide macrocycles are promising therapeutics for a variety of disease indications due to their overall metabolic stability and potential to make highly selective binding interactions with targets. Recent advances in covalent macrocycle peptide discovery, driven by phage and mRNA display methods, have enabled the rapid identification of highly potent and selective molecules from large libraires of diverse macrocycles. However, there are currently limited examples of macrocycles that can be used to disrupt protein–protein interactions and even fewer examples that function by formation of a covalent bond to a target protein. In this work, we describe a directed counter-selection method that enables identification of covalent macrocyclic ligands targeting a protein–protein interaction using a phage display screening platform. This method utilizes binary and ternary screenings of a chemically modified phage display library, employing the stable and weakly reactive aryl fluorosulfate electrophile. We demonstrate the utility of this approach using the SARS-CoV-2 spike-ACE2 protein–protein interaction and identify multiple covalent macrocyclic inhibitors that disrupt this interaction. The resulting compounds displayed antiviral activity against live virus that was irreversible after washout due to the covalent binding mechanism. These results highlight the potential of this screening platform for developing covalent macrocyclic drugs that disrupt protein–protein interactions with long lasting effects.},

  abstract     = {The enantioselective protonation of prochiral enolates is an ideal and straightforward platform to synthesize stereodefined α-tertiary esters, which are recurring motifs in a myriad of biorelevant molecules and important intermediates thereof. However, this approach remains onerous, particularly when dealing with α-unactivated esters and related acids, as enantioinduction on the nascent nucleophile necessitates peremptory reaction conditions, thus far only achieved via preformed enolates. A complementary and contra-thermodynamic catalytic strategy is herein described, where a transient photoenol, in the form of a ketene hemiacetal, is enantioselectively protonated with a chiral phosphoric acid (CPA). The prochiral photoketene hemiacetals are procured from excited α,β -unsaturated esters, specifically from the Z -geometric isomer through [1,5]-hydride shift as a chemically productive nonradiative relaxation pathway. Tautomerization via formal 1,3-proton transfer in the photoketene hemiacetal with CPA as a proton shuttle delivers α-branched β,γ -alkenyl esters in good to excellent yields and enantioselectivity under mild conditions. Furthermore, the current protocol was coupled to functional group interconversion experiments, as well as in a formal total synthesis of a known marine γ-butyrolactone-type metabolite. Performing the reaction in a continuous photoflow setup also enabled a gram-scale synthesis of a β,γ -alkenyl ester with up to 92% ee .},

However, the alignment of isolated macromolecules has not yet been demonstrated also because quantitative modeling is very expensive. We computationally demonstrated that the alignment of nanorods and proteins is possible with a standard laser technology. We performed a comprehensive analysis on the dependence of the degree of alignment on molecular properties and experimental details, e.g., particle temperature and laser-pulse energy. Considering the polarizability anisotropy of about 150,000 proteins, our analysis revealed that most of these proteins can be aligned using realistic experimental parameters.},

Although the STING pathway emerges as a promising target to remedy defects, uncertain drug delivery might lead to off-target inflammatory reactions. Here, we manifest a novel phototheranostic agent with an aggregation-induced emission property that guided the pharmacological activation of a STING agonist for photothermal immunotherapy to create an immunologically “hot” tumor. A pyridinium rotor strategy is proposed to develop a positively charged TBTP-Bz, which is stably coincorporated with a STING agonist MSA-2 into thermal-responsive exosome-liposome hybrid nanoparticles for tumor-targeting delivery. TBTP-Bz exhibits aggregation-enhanced NIR-II emission and a photoacoustic signal, accomplishing real-time tumor tracking. Its photothermal stimulation induces immunogenic cancer cell death and promotes the precise release of MSA-2, thus boosting STING activation and STING-mediated type I interferon production. Significantly, single-dose photoimmunotherapy effectively suppresses abscopal tumor growth and provokes an immune memory effect to inhibit postsurgical recurrent and rechallenged tumors. This demonstrates promising clinical potential for poorly immunogenic breast cancer.},

  abstract     = {The development of smart drug delivery vehicles capable of controlled release upon application of an external stimulus is of paramount interest for the next generation of personalized medicine. Herein, we report a series of six multivariate (MTV) MOFs capable of visible light-activated drug delivery. The drug loading capacity and release rates were systematically tuned through variation of the linker ratio between 4,4′-azobenzene dicarboxylic acid (H 2 ABDA) and 4,4′-(diazene-1,2-diyl)bis(3,5-difluorobenzoic acid) (H 2 ABDA(3,5-F)). The drug loading capacity, dictated by host–guest interactions, was thoroughly explored via a combined experimental and computational approach using two model drug or drug-like molecules, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and Nile Red. Notably, the loading capacity for 5-FU follows a “Goldilocks” profile with a maximum loading at 33% H 2 ABDA(3,5-F) content. Computational results confirm the existence of a cooperative ligand environment that promotes strong, preferential binding at the tetrahedral/octahedral pore window formed between two H 2 ABDA and one H 2 ABDA(3,5-F). Thus, the MTV approach enhanced capacity over the native 100% H 2 ABDA(3,5-F) and 0% H 2 ABDA(3,5-F) MOFs. In addition to increased loading, the rate of cargo release upon green light excitation also increased as the percentage of H 2 ABDA(3,5-F) in the MOF was raised, reaching a maximum release rate of 0.9 ± 0.1% of total cargo per minute for the MOF containing 100% H 2 ABDA(3,5-F) MOF. The results highlight the promise of MTV MOF design for optimizing drug delivery vehicles with relevant payloads and patient-dictated dosing.},

  abstract     = {Heterogeneous materials containing molecular catalytic sites show promise for electrocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to energy-enriched carbon products. Interactions between the catalyst and the heterogeneous support increasingly are recognized as important in governing product selectivity and rate. Recent work on Mn(R-bpy)(CO) 3 Br type catalysts immobilized on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) demonstrated control of electrocatalytic behavior with steric modification of the molecular catalyst. Phenyl groups installed in the 4,4′ positions of the bipyridine ligand (ph-bpy) maximized performance through π–π interactions with the MWCNT support. Herein we report the outcome of extending the ligand π system with Mn(nap-bpy)(CO) 3 Br (nap-bpy = 4,4′-di(naphthalen-1-yl)-2,2′-bipyridine) and Mn(pyr-bpy)(CO) 3 Br (pyr-bpy = 4,4′-di(pyren-1-yl)-2,2′-bipyridine) immobilized on MWCNT. We demonstrate exceptional electrocatalysis with Mn(nap-bpy)(CO) 3 Br/MWCNT (FE CO &gt; 92%; J CO = 16.5 mA/cm 2 ) and find that this catalyst electrochemically reduces bicarbonate in the absence of deliberately added CO 2 at a remarkable overall selectivity of &gt;80% for carbon products (FE HCOO – = 52% and FE CO = 29%). We show diminishing returns to simply adding aromatic character to the bipyridyl ligand with Mn(pyr-bpy)(CO) 3 Br/MWCNT and observe a unique cambering of the Mn(nap-bpy)(CO) 3 Br bipyridyl ligand that we believe enables selective catalysis. Mechanistic studies were carried out on Mn(nap-bpy)(CO) 3 Br/MWCNT using a novel thin-film infrared spectroelectrochemical (IR-SEC) technique. These experiments observe the immobilized Mn(nap-bpy)(CO) 3 Br undergo single electron reduction to a Mn-centered radical that binds CO 2 in a reduction-coupled process.},

  abstract     = {While Li-ion batteries (LIBs) are a leading energy storage technology, their energy densities are limited by the low capacity of conventional intercalation cathodes, driving interest in high energy-density Li–S batteries that make use of conversion chemistry. Achieving high capacity, reversibility, and cycle stability, and controlling volume changes in conversion batteries during the charge–discharge process, however, remains challenging. Here, we present a porous, amorphous, sulfide-based Mn x Mo 3 S 13 chalcogel, which concurrently offers high capacity and cycle stability. The solution-processable room temperature synthesized Mn x Mo 3 S 13 ( x = 0.25) chalcogel exhibits a local structure that resembles the Mo 3 S 13 cluster with Mn 2+ distributed across the Mo 3 S 13 matrix, as determined by synchrotron X-ray pair distribution function (PDF) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations reveal that Mn 2+ incorporation shortens the polysulfide chain in the gel matrix compared to the Mo 3 S 13 chalcogel, while forming a coordination environment with disulfide groups, analogous to the experimental findings. A Li/Mn 0.25 Mo 3 S 13 half-cell delivers 897 mAh g –1 capacity during the first discharge and retains 571 mAh g –1 capacity after 100 cycles at a C/3 rate. Distribution of relaxation time (DRT) unveils a stable solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation upon cycling that enables charge–discharge reversibility. Here, the enhanced capacity retention and cycle stability compared to those of the Li/Mo 3 S 13 cell are attributed to the reduced dissolution of active mass into the electrolyte, facilitated by the formation of shorter polysulfide chains within the Mn 0.25 Mo 3 S 13 structure and the strong affinity of Lewis-acidic Mn 2+ for polysulfide anions generated during the charge–discharge process of the Li/Mn 0.25 Mo 3 S 13 cell. Thus, this work illustrates a design principle of material for high-capacity and cycle-stable Li-metal sulfide batteries.},

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate tricoordinated Al (Al III ) sites and Zn–OH functional, respectively, as Lewis and Brønsted acid sites over Zn–O–Al, synergistically enhancing the adsorption and decomposition of CF 4 . X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), pyridine infrared spectroscopy (Py-IR), and ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH 3 -TPD) verified the presence of both Al III and Zn–OH on the atomically dispersed Zn–O–Al sites. CF 4 -TPD and in situ infrared spectroscopy confirmed that the Zn–O–Al sites facilitate CF 4 adsorption and C–F bond activation. As a result, the Zn–O–Al sites with synergistic Lewis and Brønsted acid pairs achieved 100% CF 4 decomposition at a low temperature of 560 °C and demonstrated outstanding stability for more than 250 h.},

The alkane dissociation barriers are ∼13.2 kcal mol –1 or about 0.5 kcal mol –1 larger than that of the previously described methane complex [(C 5 Me 5 )Os(dfmpm)(CH 4 )] + . The alkane ligands bind to osmium through one methyl group, which exchanges slowly with the unbound terminal methyl group(s). Within the bound methyl group, one bridging hydrogen atom interacts directly with osmium; it exchanges rapidly with the other two methyl C–H bonds at a rate consistent with a slightly hindered C–C bond rotation. The large difference in 1 J CH between the bridging (75 Hz) and terminal (142 Hz) C–H sites is consistent with the view that the 16-electron [(C 5 Me 5 )Os(dfmpm)] + fragment has partially abstracted a hydride group (H – ) from the alkane, which confers carbocation (sp 2 ) character to the CH 2 R portion of the Os–H–CH 2 R unit. The extent of this distortion and the overall strength of the metal-alkane interaction are correlated with the alkane C–H orbital energies in a manner consistent with covalent metal–ligand bonding. Whereas most ligands can bind to metals with little structural reorganization, an alkane must undergo a significant structural change─weakening of a C–H bond─to become a sufficiently good donor and acceptor to bind to a metal. Collectively, these results show that the binding energies of alkane ligands are small not because the constituent metal–ligand interactions are weak but rather because the reorganization energy needed to form them is large.},

  abstract     = {Hypoxia, a hallmark of many solid tumors, is linked to increased cancer aggressiveness, metastasis, and resistance to conventional therapies, leading to poor patient outcomes. This challenges the efficiency of photodynamic therapy (PDT), which relies on the generation of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) through the irradiation of a photosensitizer (PS), a process partially dependent on oxygen levels. In this work, we introduce a novel family of potent PSs based on ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complexes with 2,2′-bipyridyl ligands derived from COUPY coumarins, termed COUBPYs. Ru-COUBPY complexes exhibit outstanding in vitro cytotoxicity against CT-26 cancer cells when irradiated with light within the phototherapeutic window, achieving nanomolar potency in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions while remaining nontoxic in the dark, leading to impressive phototoxic indices (&gt;30,000). Their ability to generate both Type I and Type II ROS underpins their exceptional PDT efficiency. The lead compound of this study, SCV49 , shows a favorable in vivo pharmacokinetic profile, excellent toxicological tolerability, and potent tumor growth inhibition in mice bearing subcutaneous CT-26 tumors at doses as low as 3 mg/kg upon irradiation with deep-red light (660 nm). These results allow us to propose SCV49 as a strong candidate for further preclinical development, particularly for treating large hypoxic solid tumors.},

Cyclodextrins are promising candidates for forging multiple-stranded helicates with well-defined helicity, but a lack of available tools has precluded the construction of artificial helical nanochannels with a controllable geometry and helicity from these widely available chiral building blocks. Herein, we disclose a family of Ag 6 L 2 helical nanochannels that can be readily assembled from α-cyclodextrin-derived ligands through coordination between pyridinyl groups and Ag + cations. We discovered that the nanochannels exhibit either an M or a P helicity when the Ag + cations adopt a tetrahedral coordination geometry while losing most of their helicity when the Ag + cations are linearly coordinated. Both the geometry and helicity of the nanochannels can be precisely controlled by simply changing the number of methyl groups at the ortho positions of the pyridinyl ligands. The tetracoordinated Ag + cations interconnect the helical nanochannels into an infinite two-dimensional coordinative network characterized by hexagonal tessellation. Theoretical calculations, which reveal lower energies of the helical conformations observed in crystals compared with those of their inverted counterparts, support the experimental results.},

  abstract     = {The study of high-valent organometallic nickel compounds has gained considerable interest recently, primarily driven by the development of nickel-catalyzed alkyl–alkyl cross-coupling reactions that are proposed to employ such high-valent intermediates. In that regard, we have recently reported a formal Ni(III)-dimethyl intermediate supported by the ligand N , N ′, N ″-triisopropyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononane ( i Pr 3 tacn) that can undergo rapid C–C reductive elimination and catalyze alkyl–alkyl Kumada cross-coupling reactions. The bulky nature of this tridentate ligand was suggested to lead to two geometrically and electronically inequivalent alkyl groups bound to the five-coordinate Ni center. Herein, we have employed pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance techniques such as electron nuclear double resonance, hyperfine sublevel correlation, and electron spin echo envelope modulation to provide strong experimental evidence for the geometrically and electronically inequivalent nature of the two methyl groups in which one methyl ligand can be better described as a methyl radical. These experimental results were supported by density functional theory computational methods used to probe the covalent nature of the Ni–C bonds and the formal Ni oxidation state assignment for this catalytically relevant, high-valent Ni intermediate. Moreover, computational investigation of a series of related methyl/alkyl analogs reveals that the radical character of an alkyl group increases for a tertiary vs a secondary vs a primary alkyl group, with direct relevance for alkyl–alkyl cross-coupling catalysis. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the nature of organometallic Ni-dialkyl species that undergo efficient reductive elimination, likely through an S H 2-type mechanism.},

While biological ONOO – is conventionally analyzed using 3-nitrotyrosine antibodies and fluorescent sensors, such probes lack specificity and sensitivity, making high-throughput and comprehensive profiling of ONOO – -associated proteins challenging. In this study, we used a conditional proteomics approach to investigate ONOO – homeostasis by identifying its protein neighbors in cells. We developed Peroxynitrite-responsive protein Labeling reagents ( Porp-L ) and, for the first time, discovered 2,6-dichlorophenol as an ideal moiety that can be selectively and rapidly activated by ONOO – for labeling of proximal proteins. The reaction of Porp-L with ONOO – generated several short-lived reactive intermediates that can modify Tyr, His, and Lys residues on the protein surface. We have demonstrated the Porp-L -based conditional proteomics in immune-stimulated macrophages, which indeed identified proteins known to be involved in the generation and modification of ONOO – and revealed the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as a ONOO – hot spot. Moreover, we discovered a previously unknown role for Ero1a, an ER-resident protein, in the formation of ONOO – .

  abstract     = {High-field dynamic nuclear polarization nuclear magnetic resonance (DNP NMR) spectroscopy transfers polarization from unpaired electrons in polarizing agents to nuclei of interest to boost NMR sensitivity. Verdazyl biradicals are a promising choice as polarizing agents because they have been found to generate narrower electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signals compared to nitroxide biradicals; an advantageous characteristic for high-field DNP when operating above 400 MHz/263 GHz. The use of verdazyl radicals as DNP polarizing agents has been very limited to date, yet, recent numerical simulations have predicted that verdazyl-nitroxide hybrid biradicals could be more effective polarizing agents than nitroxide-nitroxide biradicals. Herein, the syntheses of a series of verdazyl mono- and biradicals, as well as verdazyl-nitroxide biradicals are described. These radicals were examined in high-field DNP NMR experiments (600 MHz/395 GHz), by measuring 1 H signal enhancements directly and through 13 C{ 1 H} cross-polarization experiments. X-band EPR, 1 H DNP field profiles, and experiments to determine the nuclear build-up times were performed for verdazyl-nitroxide biradicals VerTEMPol and VerTEKol . These hybrid biradicals provide enhancements of up to 100-fold increased signal intensities (i.e., representing &gt;10 4 -fold time savings), approximately four times higher than that of the nitroxide biradical TEKPol , a commonly used polarizing agent in the field.},

However, current methods predominantly rely on stabilized carbene-bearing α –π-conjugated groups, restricting access to less stabilized carbenes, such as α -silyl and α -boryl carbenes. Herein, we present an unprecedented Cr(II)-based metalloradical system for the asymmetric cyclopropanation of α , β -unsaturated amides with α -boryl and α -silyl dibromomethanes in the presence of Mn as the reducing agent. Employing a chiral chromium complex, the reaction proceeds under mild conditions, yielding cyclopropanes with three contiguous stereocenters in high diastereo- and enantioselectivities. This method features a Cr-catalyzed radical-based stepwise cyclopropanation mechanism. The broad substrate scope, encompassing various α , β -unsaturated amides, demonstrates the protocol’s versatility and robustness. Mechanistic insights, supported by experimental and computational studies, suggest the formation of α -Cr(III)-alkyl radical intermediates, delineating a pathway distinct from that of classical concerted cyclopropanations. This approach provides a powerful tool for synthesizing highly functionalized cyclopropanes, offering high potential for applications in drug discovery and development.},

  abstract     = {Stereochemistry, usually associated with the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms in molecules, is crucial in processes like life functions, drug action, or molecular reactions. This three-dimensionality typically originates from sp 3 hybridization in organic molecules, but it is also present in out-of-plane sp 2 -based molecules as a consequence of helical structures, twisting processes, and/or the presence of nonbenzenoid rings, the latter significantly influencing their global stereochemistry and leading to the emergence of new exotic properties. In this sense, on-surface synthesis methodologies provide the perfect framework for the precise synthesis and characterization of organic systems at the atomic scale, allowing for the accurate assessment of the associated stereochemical effects. In this work, we demonstrate the importance of the initial diastereomeric configuration in the surface-induced skeletal rearrangement of a substituted cyclooctatetraene (COT) moiety–a historical landmark in the understanding of aromaticity–into a cyclopenta[ c , d ]azulene (CPA) one in a chevron-like graphene nanoribbon (GNR). These findings are evidenced by combining bond-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy with theoretical ab initio calculations. Interestingly, the major well-defined product, a CPA chevron-like GNR, exhibits the lowest bandgap reported to date for an all-carbon chevron-like GNR, as evidenced by scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements. This work paves the way for the rational application of stereochemistry in the on-surface synthesis of novel graphene-based nanostructures.},

In this work, we establish Gordonibacter urolithinfaciens as a versatile bacterial host to express active catechol dehydroxylases. Using this system, we rapidly deorphanize eight previously uncharacterized gut bacterial catechol dehydroxylases that selectively dehydroxylate intermediates in the gut bacterial metabolism of plant-derived catechins and lignans. Unexpectedly, we discover multiple instances of distinct catechol dehydroxylases that have evolved to selectively metabolize individual substrate enantiomers, setting the stage for future efforts to elucidate their mechanisms and evolution. Altogether, these findings greatly increase our knowledge of these metalloenzymes, illustrating the power of bacterial genetics to accelerate enzyme discovery and providing a more complete understanding of transformations relevant to the health benefits of phytochemicals.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic protein post-translational methylation is essential for cellular function, highlighted by the essential role of methylation in transcriptional regulation and its aberrant dysregulation in diseases, including cancer. This underscores the importance of cataloging the cellular methylproteome. However, comprehensive analysis of the methylproteome remains elusive due to limitations in current enrichment and analysis pipelines. Here, we employ an l -methionine analogue, ProSeMet, that is chemoenzymatically converted to the SAM analogue ProSeAM in cells and in vivo to tag proteins with a biorthogonal alkyne that can be directly detected via liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), or functionalized for subsequent selective enrichment and LC-MS/MS identification. Without enrichment, we identify known and novel lysine mono-, di-, and tripargylation, histidine propargylation, and arginine propargylation with site-specific resolution on proteins including heat shock protein HSPA8, the translational elongation factor eEF1A1, and the metabolic enzyme phosphoglycerate mutase 1, or PGAM1, for which methylation has been implicated in human disease. With enrichment, we identify 486 proteins known to be methylated and 221 proteins with novel propargylation sites encompassing diverse cellular functions. Systemic ProSeMet delivery in mice propargylates proteins across organ systems with blood–brain barrier penetrance and identifies site-specific propargylation in vivo with LC-MS/MS. Leveraging these pipelines to define the cellular methylproteome may have broad applications for understanding the methylproteome in the context of disease.},

The complex was synthesized through the reduction of a thorium precursor, {N[CH 2 CH 2 N–P i Pr 2 ] 3 ThCl} 2 ( 1 ) and chromium dichloride (CrCl 2 ) using potassium graphite (KC 8 ) under an N 2 atmosphere. Isotopic labeling with 15 N 2 confirms that the nitride in complex 2 originates from N 2 . Under ambient conditions, complex 2 exhibits remarkable catalytic activity, converting N 2 to silylamine with yields of up to 9.9 equiv per thorium molecular catalyst.

This mechanism enhances light-harvesting efficiency for solar energy conversion and enables the use of lower-energy photons in bioimaging and photoredox catalysis applications. The magnetic modulation of such high-energy excitons presents an exciting opportunity to develop molecular quantum information technologies. While the spin dynamics of triplet exciton pairs are sensitive to external magnetic fields, the magnetic field effects (MFEs) associated with these pairs are generally limited by spin statistics to at most 10% at low fields (&lt;1 T), making them challenging to apply in technological advancements. In contrast, MFEs on spin-correlated radical pairs (SCRPs) can be significantly greater, surpassing those on triplet pairs. By using SCRPs-based molecular qubits as triplet sensitizers in the sensitized TTA scheme, we can magnetically modulate TTA and consequently, the delayed fluorescence of annihilators. In our current system, we have achieved more than 70% magnetic modulation of delayed fluorescence, effectively harnessing and even amplifying magnetic modulation within SCRPs to influence high-energy excitons.

Reductive elimination of the common phosphinephenolate Ni(II) motif occurs with the acyl intermediates formed upon incorporation of carbon monoxide into the growing chain, as observed by low temperature NMR spectroscopy and single crystal X-ray crystallography of the isolated product. Further, we show that such decomposition pathways are generally relevant during ethylene–carbon monoxide copolymerizations under pressure reactor conditions.

  abstract     = {Pulmonary macrophages undergo dynamic changes in population, proportion, and polarization during respiratory diseases. Monitoring these changes is critical for understanding their roles in pathology, improving the diagnosis, and guiding drug development. However, current analytic methods based on tissue biopsy are invasive and static, limiting their ability to provide such dynamic information. Herein, we report a dual-locked macrophage-specific renal-clearable probe (DMRP NOCas ) for the dynamic monitoring of pulmonary macrophages during influenza A virus (IAV) infection. DMRP NOCas activates fluorescence in the presence of two biomarkers (caspase-1 and NO) only coexpressed by M1 macrophages. To optimize the NO reactivity, the scaffold of DMRP NOCas is screened from the hemicyanine derivatives with an o -phenylenediamine group positioned differently on the indole ring. Notably, the para-substituted o-phenylenediamine demonstrates a higher NO-activated fluorescence compared to its meta-substituted counterpart. This enhancement, as revealed by quantum chemical calculations, is attributed to differential inhibition of twisted intramolecular charge transfer induced by the NO reaction. DMRP NOCas specifically distinguishes M1 macrophages from other leukocytes including T cells, neutrophils, and M2 macrophages, a capability unmatched by single-locked control probes and other reported probes. Consequently, DMRP NOCas enables in vivo dynamic monitoring of pulmonary macrophages, uncovering extensive recruitment and M1 polarization of monocyte-derived macrophages within 48 h of IAV infection. This process is accompanied by a significant reduction in alveolar macrophages. These findings provide new insights into macrophage-mediated pulmonary inflammation and underscore the potential of dual-locked probes for precise diagnosis and monitoring of pathological processes.},

However, integrating millimolar-sensitivity 19 F MRI and micromolar-sensitivity FLI into a single molecule remains challenging. Here, we report the use of mechanically interlocked [5]rotaxanes to efficiently incorporate 144 symmetrical fluorines ( 19 F) for sensitive 19 F MRI and to control the motion of tetraphenylethylene (TPE) for responsive FLI at the molecular level, yielding a dual imaging agent with micromolar sensitivity. The sensitivity gap between 19 F MRI and FLI is bridged by generating an intense singlet 19 F peak from 144 symmetrical 19 F and modulating their motion through mechanical interlocking. Spectroscopic and imaging studies, in conjunction with molecular dynamics simulations, highlight the critical role of [5]rotaxane formation, wheel “stationing-shuttling”, and the introduction of fluorous bulky perfluoro- tert -butoxymethyl (PFBM) groups as effective strategies to improve 19 F MRI sensitivity and enable responsive FLI. This work not only advances the development of high-performance dual imaging agents but also provides valuable insights into the structure, dynamics, and potential applications of [5]rotaxanes in materials science.},

  abstract     = {Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are anthropogenically produced greenhouse gases with longer atmospheric lifetimes and higher global warming potentials than those of carbon dioxide. General strategies to abate their emissions from industrial point sources, such as via adsorptive capture, remain scarce. Herein, we uncover the key structure–property relationships that lead to strong binding of HFCs such as fluoroform (CHF 3 ) and difluoromethane (CH 2 F 2 ) in metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) under the low pressures relevant to flue gas scrubbing. Extensive gas sorption and computational studies support that the Zr-based microporous framework MOF-801-Br or HHU-2-Br (HHU = Heinrich-Heine-University Düsseldorf) strongly binds HFCs due to its synergistic combination of Zr-OH sites on the nodes and bromine sites on the linkers. As such, MOF-801-Br demonstrates a record-setting performance for separating CHF 3 from N 2 under dilute conditions. Our work highlights that the combination of multiple hydrogen-bonding sites in microporous MOFs represents a generalizable strategy for HFC capture, enabling their selective removal from industrial waste streams.},

  abstract     = {Precise imaging of atherosclerotic plaques using biomarkers could prompt the diagnosis and clinical management of atherosclerosis (AS)-driven cardiovascular diseases. MicroRNA-155 (miR-155) plays a critical role in AS development, with its expression notably upregulated in foam cells within plaques. However, miRNA imaging methods for atherosclerotic plaques face significant challenges, including low specificity, inefficient delivery, and poor cell selectivity. Herein, we develop an endogenous hypochlorous acid (HClO)-gated cascade signal amplification strategy for precise miR-155 imaging in living foam cells, enabling accurate in vivo and ex vivo detection of atherosclerotic plaques. This strategy utilizes a phosphorothioate (PT)-modified hairpin probe that is specifically deprotected by HClO and uncaged by miR-155, triggering a catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) to amplify fluorescence signals. The PT-CHA probes are encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNs), followed by conjugating with phosphatidylserine (PS)-binding peptide (PBP) for selectively targeting foam cells, enabling in vivo miR-155 imaging in atherosclerotic plaques. The fluorescence intensity of PT-CHA@LN-PBP in the aorta region shows clear differentiation among AS-bearing mice, miR-155 –/– mice, and healthy mice. Moreover, the fluorescence intensity strongly correlates with plaque area and AS progression and can discriminate plaque vulnerability risk with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.94. Imaging of human aortic tissues further validates the probe’s capacity to distinguish atherosclerotic plaques from normal endarterium. These findings establish PT-CHA@LN-PBP as a noninvasive, reliable diagnostic tool for precise assessment of AS.},

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations driven by machine-learning force fields (MLFFs), which can study the interface dynamics under near ab initio accuracy, provide a powerful technique to reveal the formation mechanism of SWCNTs. Here, we develop a cobalt–carbon MLFF and perform growth simulations on a cobalt catalyst to investigate the chirality preference of the growth of SWCNTs under the vapor–liquid–solid (VLS) regime. Through microkinetic modeling, we reproduce the observed growth and defect kinetics, demonstrating their dependence on the chirality. It is observed that while the initial chirality assignment is likely related to the configurational degeneracy of the nanotube caps, pentagon defects immediately form and resolve after nucleation. Such processes, which we name diameter control mechanisms, not only control the diameter toward an optimum but also shift the chirality distribution drastically. Our simulation shows a preference toward the (6,5) chirality, which is also widely observed experimentally. Our work offers a microkinetic modeling workflow for the chirality-dependent kinetics of the SWCNTs, highlighting the important contribution of the defect kinetics to the chirality origination.},

However, complexes containing more than one heavier tetrylidyne ligand RE (E = Si, Ge, Sn, Pb) are rare due to the high oligomerization tendency of RE ligands. In this study, we describe the complex [Fe(SnAr’) 2 ] ( 1 ; Ar’ = 2,6-Dipp 2 -C 6 H 3 , Dipp = 2,6- i Pr 2 –C 6 H 3 ), which features adjacent Fe–Sn single and double bonds. Complex 1 exhibits versatile reactivity with transition metal and main group compounds. Treatment of complex 1 with Ni(COD) 2 (COD = 1,5-cyclooctadiene) yields the tetranuclear complex [Fe(μ-SnAr’) 2 Ni] ( 2 ), characterized by an unusual “push–pull” interaction between nickel(0) and the two coordinating Sn atoms, as revealed by quantum chemical studies. The reaction of complex 1 with AlBr 3 results in Al–Br bond cleavage and Ar’ migration to aluminum. CH 3 I adds oxidatively to the Sn atom that is singly bonded to Fe, while PMe 3 coordinates to Fe, inducing reversible cleavage of the Fe═Sn double bond. In addition, complex 1 activates inorganic molecules. CO 2 undergoes disproportionation to produce a carbonate-bridged Ar’Sn(μ–OCO 2 )SnAr’ ligand, whereas CS 2 is reductively coupled to form an ethylene tetrathiolate ligand ([C 2 S 4 ] 4– ). The reaction with white phosphorus (P 4 ) generates an unusual Ar’P 4 Sn 2 Ar’ ligand. This multifaceted reactivity illustrates the behavior of the Fe and Sn sites in complex 1 , suggesting that complexes of this type are promising reagents for small molecule activation.},

To enable the rational design of more efficient catalysts, models grounded in a deeper understanding of catalytic mechanisms are essential. Existing models, such as d -band center theory, fall short in explaining the role of dopants, particularly when these dopants do not directly interact with reactants. In this study, we synthesize various heteroatom-doped catalysts to explore the correlation between the electronic effects of the dopants and catalyst activity. Using Co-MoS 2 as a model catalyst and the Li–S redox reaction within the cathode of Li–S batteries as a test system, we show the interaction between cobalt sites and adjacent lattice sulfur atoms disrupts the intrinsic structural and electronic symmetry of MoS 2 . This disruption enhances the transfer of spin-polarized electrons from metal centers to lattice sulfur and promotes the adsorption of reactant intermediates. Furthermore, by analyzing 20 different dopant elements, we establish a linear relationship between the electron density in the lattice sulfur and catalyst activity toward the reduction of sulfur species, a relationship that extends to other catalytic systems, such as the hydrogen evolution reaction.},

As proof of concept, our building of full ANIBs using iron-based PBAs and NaTi 2 (PO 4 ) 3 anode with an appropriate amount of Na 2 C 4 O 4 enable a reversible capacity of ∼144 mA h g –1 at 0.2 C and an excellent cycling stability of 15,000 cycles with 85% retention at 10 C.

  abstract     = {Thin-film β tungsten (β-W), a metastable phase of tungsten, holds significant potential in the fabrication of superconducting and spin-memory devices. However, due to the rapid surface passivation of tungsten in oxygen and moisture, the synthesis of nanosized metastable β-W with the intrinsic atomic surface is still difficult, and their magnetic properties remain rather unexplored. Inspired by the strong host–guest interaction-induced stabilization, we reported the synthesis of atomically thin (1.0–1.3 nm) metastable β-W nanowires within single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) through an oxygen-assisted transformation of starting W 2 C, with 85% of β-W nanowires along the anisotropic ⟨010⟩ direction. Atomically resolved electron microscopy directly unveils the dynamic evolutions of W 2 C-to-β-W and further β-to-α - W within SWCNTs, depending on the H 2 -annealing time. Detailed mechanistic studies by theoretical calculations and experiments reveal that oxygen diffused within the W 2 C lattice governs the formation and stabilization of ultrathin β-W nanowires within the SWCNTs. Additionally, the nanoconfinement of SWCNTs, restricting the thickness of W nanowires down to 2 nm, also benefits the thermodynamically favorable nucleation of β-W than α-W. With the protection of a single graphene layer against water erosion, β-W@SWCNTs exhibit a ferromagnetic response at ∼130 K, with higher chemical stability than fully exposed thin-film β-W. This work may provide a feasible way to design the ferromagnetic nanowire metamaterials based on aligned SWCNT arrays that have the potential to fabricate microwave and spin devices.},

  abstract     = {Triplet excitons, driven by spin-flip processes, play a crucial role in enabling efficient room-temperature phosphorescence across various applications. However, attaining a significant accumulation of long-lived excitons is impeded by the simultaneous influence of nonradiative and radiative decay pathways alongside intersystem crossing efficiencies. Here, we introduce a solvent intercalation approach that leverages the triplet exciton processes in a family of zero-dimensional organic–inorganic halides, A 2 ZnBr 4 (A = organic phosphonium cations). By intercalating phosphorescence inactive molecules into these halides, their spin-flip processes can be reconfigured. This leads to significantly amplified intersystem crossing but attenuated radiative and nonradiative transitions, which give rise to 16- and 6-fold increases in lifetime and quantum yield, respectively. Our single crystal X-ray diffraction, transient absorption, and theoretical calculation results reveal that such dramatic improvement is attributed to the unique spatial effect on both electrons and holes induced by the intercalated molecules. The consequently reduced orbital degeneracy increases the number of spin-allowed channels, promoting intersystem crossing, while the synergistically enhanced electron localization diminishes the triplet exciton decay, leading to high efficiency and enduring phosphorescence. Our findings offer a new pathway for manipulating the spin-flip process to boost the emission of triplet excitons, with potential applications in designing a wide spectrum of phosphorescent materials.},

We chemically prepared homogeneous glycoproteins with high-mannose glycans or a single N -acetylglucosamine at the confirmed glycosylation sites in K18 and 2N4R tau. Our findings reveal that N -glycosylation significantly alters biophysical properties and potentially cellular functions of tau. Small glycans promote tau aggregation and liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS), while larger glycans reduce these effects. High mannose glycans at N410 enhance phosphorylation by GSK3β, suggesting a pathological role in AD. Functional assays demonstrate that N -glycosylation does not impact microtubule polymerization dynamics but modulates aggregation kinetics and morphology. This research underscores the importance of glycosylation in tau pathology and opens new avenues for therapeutic interventions targeting glycan processing.},

  abstract     = {The self-assembly of nanoparticles allows the fabrication of complex, nature-inspired architectures. Among these, Voronoi tessellations─intricate patterns found in many natural systems such as insect wings and plant tissues─have broad implications across materials science, biology, and geography. However, replicating these irregular yet organized features at the nanoscale through nanoparticle self-assembly remains challenging. Here, we introduce a confinement transformation method to generate two-dimensional (2D) Voronoi patterns by converting metal–organic frameworks, specifically zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8), into layered hydroxides. The process begins with the self-assembly of ZIF-8 particles into densely packed monolayers at the liquid–air interface, driven by the Marangoni effect. Subsequent Ni 2+ -induced etching converts the floating ZIF-8 monolayer into a freestanding membrane composed of interconnected polygonal cells, closely resembling the geometric characteristics of Voronoi tessellations. We systematically investigate the parameters affecting the transformation of ZIF-8 particles, shedding light on the mechanism governing Voronoi pattern formation. Mechanical testing and simulations demonstrate that the resulting cellular membranes exhibit enhanced stress distribution and crack resistance, attributed to their Voronoi-patterned architecture. These robust, monolithic membranes composed of Ni-based hydroxides, when serving as catalyst support materials, can synergistically enhance the intrinsic activity of Pt catalysts for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction by facilitating water dissociation. This work presents a promising approach for creating nature-inspired materials with optimal stress management, superior mechanical properties, and potential catalytic applications.},

GSLs are widely distributed in cells and tissues, where they play crucial roles in various biological functions and disease processes. However, the heterogeneity and complexity of GSLs make it difficult to explore their precise biofunctions due to obstacles in obtaining well-defined structures. Herein, we report a host–guest-chemistry-mediated biomimetic chemoenzymatic approach for the efficient synthesis of diverse complex GSLs. A key feature of this approach is that the use of methyl-β-cyclodextrin enables amphipathic glycolipids forming water-soluble inclusion complexes to improve their solubility in aqueous media, thereby facilitating enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The power and applicability of our approach are demonstrated by the streamlined synthesis of biologically important globo-, ganglio-, neolacto-, and lacto-series GSLs library containing 20 neutral and acidic glycolipids with different fucosylation and sialylation patterns. The developed method will open new avenues to easily access a wide range of complex GSLs for biomedical applications.},

  abstract     = {Polymer-grafted metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) can be used to form free-standing self-assembled MOF monolayers (SAMMs). Polymer chains can be introduced onto MOF surfaces through either the ligands or metal nodes using both grafting-to and grafting-from approaches. However, controlling the grafting density of polymer-grafted MOFs has not yet been achieved, because a means to control the density of grafting sites on the MOF surface has not been developed. In this study, the grafting density of polymer-grafted UiO-66 (UiO = University of Oslo) was controlled by functionalizing a portion of the Zr(IV) secondary building units (SBUs) on a UiO-66 surface with a so-called blocking agent. The remaining sites on the UiO-66 SBUs were functionalized with polymerization initiation groups, and polymers were grown from these sites to obtain particles with variable grafting densities and chain lengths that form SAMMs at an air–water interface. Even under conditions of low grafting density, these materials retain the ability to form SAMMs and their free-standing ability. Changes in particle arrangement within the monolayers were investigated using SEM imaging, and the toughness of the monolayers was evaluated using a film-on-water (FOW) method. Furthermore, coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to elucidate the morphology and mechanical properties of the monolayers. Findings from both experiments and simulations indicate that the toughness of SAMMs is more heavily influenced by the chain length of the grafted polymers than by the overall polymer content in the composite.},

  abstract     = {The mechanisms underlying the reaction between carbon monoxide (CO) and activated dioxygen on metal oxide substrates to produce CO 2 remain poorly understood, particularly regarding the role of oxygen vacancies and the nature of the activated O 2 adsorbate. In this study, we present experimental findings from infrared reflection–absorption spectroscopy on a model system of bulk monocrystalline CeO 2 (111). Contrary to expectations, exposing the reduced surface to dioxygen (O 2 ) at 80 K does not yield activated oxygen species, such as superoxo or peroxo. Notably, in the presence of adsorbed CO, an unexpected low-temperature oxidation reaction occurs, consuming CO while oxidizing the CeO 2 substrate. Since a direct reaction between impinging O 2 and adsorbed CO is unlikely at these low temperatures, a novel mechanism is proposed. Extensive spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that oxygen vacancies play a critical role in this low-temperature CO oxidation. Initially located in the subsurface region (Vss), these vacancies migrate to the surface (Vs) via a concerted interaction with coadsorbed CO and O 2 , leading to O 2 activation and the formation of superoxo or peroxo species. Detailed analysis identifies key reaction intermediates and quantifies their adsorption energies and activation barriers. Our findings suggest that the peroxo-mediated pathway, with its lower activation barrier, is more favorable for CO oxidation at low temperatures compared to the carbonate pathway. This study provides valuable insights into the dynamic role of subsurface oxygen vacancies in the activation of gaseous O 2 and CO oxidation mechanisms on CeO 2 .},

  abstract     = {Covalent organic frameworks, as a class of fascinating crystalline porous materials, are attracting increasing attention in various fields. Synthesizing these materials to attain crystallinity and porosity is essential; however, it is time-consuming, not cost-effective, and energy-demanding as it involves extensive screenings of reaction conditions and employs undesired aromatic solvents. Despite recent progress in the synthesis, finding an efficient, convenient, low-toxicity, and widely applicable method remains a challenging goal. Here, we report an in situ -protected strategy for synthesizing imine-linked frameworks by exploring triflic acid as the catalyst to replace traditional acetic acid and deploying alcohols as a single-component reaction medium instead of aromatic solvents. We found that the function of triflic acid is threefold: it rapidly protonates amino groups of amine monomers into ammonium cations, protects formyl units of aldehyde monomers by converting them into acetals, and improves the solubilities of both monomers. The in situ -protection scheme greatly changes their concentrations and reactivities, making reactions highly controllable and reversible. This strategy is general for various monomer combinations to develop imine-linked frameworks with different topologies, including tetragonal, rhombic, pentagonal, hexagonal, kagome, dual trigonal, dual rhombic, and dual hexagonal shapes, and various pore sizes from micropores to mesopores, presenting a facile and simple way to synthesize 28 different yet high-quality frameworks in n -butanol/water. Remarkably, nine new imine-linked frameworks are synthesized for the first time, which cannot be prepared by traditional systems. The porphyrin frameworks exhibited exceptional photocatalytic activities in the activation of molecular oxygen to produce highly reactive oxygen species of singlet oxygen.},

Intriguingly, its formation stems from a diboron(I)-mediated C–O–C deoxygenation of the xanthene spacer via a bis(borylene)xanthene as a reactive intermediate. Consistent with the proposed pathway, bis(borylene)xanthene 6 with three-coordinate B(I) atoms could be isolated when the sterically less demanding NHC ligand IMe [IMe = C{N(Me)CMe} 2 ] was employed. Due to its ring strain, the B–B bond of the B 2 O ring in 4 undergoes versatile ring-expansion reactions with small molecules to engender new boron-containing heterocycles.

However, fine-tuning the structure of Fe-N 4 active sites to enhance their performance remains a grand challenge. Herein, we report an innovative design strategy to promote the ORR activity and kinetics of Fe-N 4 sites by engineering their Lewis acidity, which is achieved by tuning the spatial Fe coordination geometry. Theoretical calculations indicated that Fe 1 -N 4 SO 2 sites (with an axial –SO 2 group bonded to Fe) offered favorable Lewis acidity for the ORR, leading to optimized adsorption energies for the key ORR intermediates. To implement this strategy, we developed a molecular-cage-encapsulated coordination strategy to synthesize a Fe single-atom site catalyst (SAC) with Fe 1 -N 4 SO 2 sites. In agreement with theory, the Fe 1 -N 4 SO 2 /NC catalyst demonstrated outstanding ORR performance in both alkaline ( E 1/2 = 0.910 V in 0.1 M KOH) and acidic media ( E 1/2 = 0.772 V in 0.1 M HClO 4 ), surpassing commercial Pt/C and traditional Fe SACs with Fe 1 -N 4 sites or planar S-coordinated Fe 1 -N 4 -S sites.

  abstract     = {The interest in aqueous energy storage devices is surging due to their exceptional safety profile. However, in aqueous energy storage systems, interfacial side reactions, predominantly attributed to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), result in significant self-discharge, which is concomitant with the deterioration of both voltage and capacity. Herein, we propose the construction of a ferrocyanide “skin” on transition metal compounds (TMCs) to mitigate this issue. This engineered “skin” creates Fe–C≡N terminations, initiating a new reaction pathway featured by the bonding process of N–O and N–H bonds. This reaction pathway presents a significant energy barrier, effectively shielding the active sites for the OER from H 2 O molecules and hydroxyl ions. Taking NiO as an example, the ferrocyanide “skin” effectively suppresses the undesired phase transition from NiOOH to Ni(OH) 2 during the idling process of a fully charged electrode, enabling the as-modified electrode to achieve a remarkable voltage retention of 80.0% after 1 week of idling within a device. Furthermore, this concept demonstrates extensive applicability, extending to a range of TMC materials, including but not limited to manganese oxide, vanadium oxide, and nickel cobalt oxide. These findings highlight the efficacy of the ferrocyanide “skin” design strategy as a broadly applicable paradigm for suppressing H 2 O-induced undesirable phase transitions in aqueous energy storage devices.},

  abstract     = {The exploration of novel and high-performance organo-electrocatalysts with well-defined active sites is vital for understanding catalytic mechanisms and replacing metal-based catalysts, but remains a formidable challenge. Here, we report metal-free trifluoroacetate as a new organo-electrocatalyst, where the strong electron-withdrawing trifluoromethyl (−CF 3 ) group intrinsically transforms the neighboring carboxylate anions (−COO – ) into highly efficient active sites for electrocatalytic acetylene semihydrogenation. The electrophilic acetylene molecule bonds to the negatively charged O – sites of the carboxylate anion via the σ-configuration. Benefiting from precise molecular engineering of electron-withdrawing groups, the ethylene partial current density presents a volcano relationship with the total natural charge of the −COO – anions. In 1 M KOH aqueous solution, trifluoroacetate delivers an ethylene partial current density of 260 mA/cm 2 with an ethylene Faradaic efficiency of 96.8% at −0.9 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under a pure acetylene atmosphere, outperforming metal-based electrocatalysts. This work presents a new type of high-activity organo-electrocatalysts with −COO – anions as active center and promises its application in electrocatalysis.},

  abstract     = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are physiologically harmful radical species generated as byproducts of aerobic respiration. To detoxify ROS, most cells employ superoxide scavenging enzymes that disproportionate superoxide (O 2 ·– ) to oxygen (O 2 ) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ). In contrast, the membrane-bound superoxide oxidase (SOO) is a minimal 4-helical bundle protein that catalyzes the direct oxidation of O 2 ·– to O 2 and drives quinone reduction by mechanistic principles that remain unknown. Here, we combine multiscale hybrid quantum/classical (QM/MM) free energy calculations and microsecond molecular dynamics simulations with functional assays and site-directed mutagenesis experiments to probe the mechanistic principles underlying the charge transfer reactions of the superoxide-driven quinone reduction. We characterize a cluster of charged residues at the periplasmic side of the membrane that functions as a O 2 ·– collecting antenna, initiating electron transfer via two b hemes to the active site for quinone reduction at the cytoplasmic side. Based on multidimensional QM/MM string simulations, we find that a proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reaction from the active site heme b and nearby histidine residues (H87, H158) results in quinol (QH 2 ) formation, followed by proton uptake from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. The functional relevance of the identified residues is supported by site-directed mutagenesis and activity assays, with mutations leading to inhibition of the O 2 ·– -driven quinone reduction activity. We suggest that the charge transfer reactions could build up a proton motive force that supports the bacterial energy transduction machinery, while the PCET machinery provides unique design principles of a minimal oxidoreductase.},

Herein, we propose a novel method of electrostatics-mediated intramolecular cross-linking of Janus polymer bottlebrushes to synthesize large-scale asymmetric Janus nanorods at an unprecedentedly high concentration of 300 mg/mL. Compositions of both the nanorod body and ends are broadly tunable in an orthogonal mode to endow the nanorod functional groups for self-assembly, which could be visualized under a STED microscope upon dyeing. The sample amino acid analogous Janus nanorods are achieved by the orthogonal hydrolysis and click reaction at the opposite ends, serving as building blocks to self-organize into superstructures from linear wires, branches, and networks that are highly dependent on the valence states.},

  abstract     = {We present the design and implementation of a novel neural network potential (NNP) and its combination with an electrostatic embedding scheme, commonly used within the context of hybrid quantum-mechanical/molecular-mechanical (QM/MM) simulations. Substitution of a computationally expensive QM Hamiltonian by an NNP with the same accuracy largely reduces the computational cost and enables efficient sampling in prospective MD simulations, the main limitation faced by traditional QM/MM setups. The model relies on the recently introduced anisotropic message passing (AMP) formalism to compute atomic interactions and encode symmetries found in QM systems. AMP is shown to be highly efficient in terms of both data and computational costs and can be readily scaled to sample systems involving more than 350 solute and 40,000 solvent atoms for hundreds of nanoseconds using umbrella sampling. Most deviations of AMP predictions from the underlying DFT ground truth lie within chemical accuracy (4.184 kJ mol –1 ). The performance and broad applicability of our approach are showcased by calculating the free-energy surface of alanine dipeptide, the preferred ligation states of nickel phosphine complexes, and dissociation free energies of charged pyridine and quinoline dimers. Results with this ML/MM approach show excellent agreement with experimental data and reach chemical accuracy in most cases. In contrast, free energies calculated with static DFT calculations paired with implicit solvent models or QM/MM MD simulations using cheaper semiempirical methods show up to ten times higher deviation from the experimental ground truth and sometimes even fail to reproduce qualitative trends.},

The metal-centered chirality is typically mediated by enantiopure ligands, which occupy a relatively narrow chemical space compared to their achiral counterparts. We demonstrate that achiral ligands can be used to access chiral-at-ruthenium half-sandwich complexes with exceptionally high configurational stability. Key to success is the introduction of a rigid bidentate ligand with a minimized dihedral angle between the pyridyl and phenolic moieties, which proved effective for preventing racemization. Computational studies revealed the energetic factors contributing to the exceptional configurational stability enabled by the rigid and planar structure of the successful ligand design. These optically active chiral-at-ruthenium complexes incorporating aldehyde moieties were obtained by NHC-catalyzed kinetic resolution with excellent selectivities ( s -factor up to &gt;200, ee up to 99%). We further demonstrate that they are highly effective chiral aldehyde catalysts for the asymmetric 1,6-conjugate addition of glycine ester and para -quinone methide.},

Understanding the molecular composition, structural organization, and mobility of polysaccharides constituting this cell envelope is crucial to correlate cell wall organization with its role in pathogenicity and to identify potential antifungal targets. For the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans , the characterization of the cell envelope has been complexified by the presence of an additional external polysaccharide capsular shell. Here, we investigate how magic-angle spinning (MAS) solid-state NMR techniques increase the analytical capabilities to characterize the structure and dynamics of this encapsulated pathogen. The versatility of proton detection experiments, dynamic-based filters, and relaxation measurements facilitate the discrimination of the highly mobile external capsular structure from the internal rigid cell wall of C. neoformans . In addition, we report the in situ detection of triglyceride molecules from lipid droplets based on NMR dynamic filters. Together, we demonstrate a nondestructive technique to study the cell wall architecture of encapsulated microbes using C. neoformans as a model, an airborne opportunistic fungal pathogen that infects mainly immunocompromised but also competent hosts.},

Here, we emphasize the significance of lanthanide-based metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) combined with an effective energy transfer strategy for developing high-performance color converters in OWC systems. In this approach, we successfully reduced the photoluminescence (PL) lifetime from 1.3 ms of the MOF to 4.6 ns of the MOF–chromophore composite, achieved through an efficient energy transfer process in the cavity and surface of the MOFs. This significant reduction in PL lifetime led to a dramatic increase in the −3-dB bandwidth, rising from less than 0.1 to 65.7 MHz. Most importantly, a net data rate of 1.076 GB/s was achieved, marking the first successful demonstration of lanthanide-based MOFs as color converters that facilitate data transmission rates exceeding 1 GB/s. Notably, both the −3-dB bandwidth and net data rate surpass those of most reported organic and inorganic materials, underscoring the exceptional potential of lanthanide-based MOFs when combined with an efficient energy transfer strategy.

  abstract     = {The ability to control materials at the nanoscale has advanced optoelectronic devices, such as LEDs, displays, and quantum light sources. A new frontier is controlling exciton properties beyond quantum size confinement, achieved through single monolayer heterostructures. In the prototypical example of transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures and moiré superlattices, excitons with long lifetimes, strong binding energies, and tunable dipole moments have been demonstrated and are ideal for optoelectronics and quantum applications. Expanding this material platform is crucial for further progress. This study introduces colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) of monomethylhydrazinium lead bromide (MMHPbBr 3 ), a novel lead halide perovskite (LHP) with a unique “2.5-dimensional” electronic structure. While the spatial dimensionality of the NC extends in all three dimensions, these NCs exhibit excitonic properties intermediate between 2D and 3D LHPs. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that MMHPbBr 3 features spatially separated electron and hole wave functions, with electrons delocalized in 3D and holes confined in 2D monolayers. Synthesized via a rapid colloidal method, these NCs were characterized by using techniques such as 4D-STEM and nuclear magnetic resonance, confirming their monoclinic structure. Optical analysis revealed size-dependent properties and 3D quantum confinement effects, with three distinct photoluminescence (PL) bands at cryogenic temperatures corresponding to excitons with varying interlayer coupling. PL spectroscopy of single MMHPbBr 3 NCs reveals their photon emission statistics, expanding their potential for unconventional quantum material designs.},

However, amines suffer from chemical instability under scrubbing conditions, corrosiveness, and toxicity, hindering their long-term implementation at multiton scales. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that tertiary amine N-oxides, an oxidative degradation product of amines, can remove CO 2 from dilute streams, including flue gas from a natural gas-fired power plant. Our extensive spectroscopic and computational studies support that the nontoxic, noncorrosive, and inexpensive 4-methylmorpholine N -oxide (MMNO) captures CO 2 under humid conditions via the formation of a hydrogen-bond-stabilized bicarbonate (HCO 3 – ) species, despite being significantly less basic than an amine. Accelerated aging studies show that MMNO exhibits superior oxidative and thermal stability compared to structurally similar amines, highlighting the potential of eco-friendly N -oxides in industrial carbon capture applications.},

They did not induce antimicrobial resistance during 24 successive passages in vitro. The cytotoxicity of CCOs is reduced by exploiting glutathione-triggered degradation.

However, it remains challenging to assemble polymers into vertically oriented nanostructures. Here, we use a seed-induced confinement self-assembly strategy to construct vertically aligned semiconducting nanobrushes from polyfluorene-based polymers on conductive substrates. Mechanism studies elucidate that the immobilized seeds on the substrate initiate the vertical growth of nanobrushes, and supercritical drying as well as the rigid charged coronas collectively contribute to retaining the vertical architecture. This process enables nanobrushes with ∼40× higher charge mobilities than their bulk film counterparts. Thus, inverted organic solar cells using the nanobrushes as the electron transporting layer (ETL) exhibit a record power conversion efficiency of 18.51% as a result of increased ETL texturing and the ETL-active layer interface favoring electron extraction. Moreover, our approach also enables the uniform growth of nanobrushes on a nanoporous photoanode (bismuth vanadate) for photoelectrochemical water splitting, improving catalyst distribution and electron transfer. Our work presents a feasible approach to fabricating challenging vertical polymer nanostructures, thereby unlocking the tremendous potential of conjugated polymers in optoelectronic applications.},

Here we report the two-dimensional (2D) chalcogenide, BaSbTe 2 S which acts as a new platform hosting these phenomena. The crystal structure of BaSbTe 2 S is composed of alternating atomically thin Te square-net layers and double rock-salt type [(SbTeS) 2 ] 2– slabs separated with Ba 2+ atoms. Due to the electronic instability of the Te square net, an incommensurately modulated structure is triggered and confirmed by both single-crystal X-ray diffraction, electron diffraction, and the presence of an energy bandgap in this compound. Our first-principles electronic structure analysis and investigation of structural dynamical instability suggest that the Te network plays a dominant role in its origin. The incommensurate structure is refined with a modulation vector of q = 0.351(1) b * using an orthorhombic cell of a = 4.4696(5) Å, b = 4.4680(5) Å, and c = 15.999(2) Å under superspace group Pmm 2(0β0)000 at 293 K. The modulation vector q varies as a function of both occupancy of Te in the square net and temperature, indicating the CDW order can be modulated by local distortions. The CDW can be suppressed by pressure, leading to the emergence of superconductivity with a T c up to 7.5 K at 13.6 GPa, suggesting a competition between the CDW order and superconductivity. Furthermore, electrical transport under the magnetic field reveals the existence of compensated high mobility electron- and hole-bands near the Fermi surface (μ ∼600–3500 cm 2 V –1 s –1 ), suggesting Dirac-like band dispersion.},

The lamellar formation involves controlling the weight fraction of hydrophilic segments containing water to 40–70 wt % by the RA content, hydrophobic side chains, and the amount of absorbed water. The domain spacing can be controlled in the range of 2–6 nm. More interestingly, the lamellar materials reversibly afford expansion and contraction of the domain spacing in the sub-1 nm level via the absorption and release of water, in response to relative humidity. The multilayered lamellar formation process via the intercalation of water was analyzed in situ by neutron reflectometry and atomic force microscopy measurements under humid conditions.

  abstract     = {Second-harmonic generation (SHG) is the wave–wave nonlinear interaction in doubling wave frequencies, spanning from optics, radio, magnetohydrodynamics, and even the middle atmosphere, and enhancing SHG efficiency has attracted broad interest in both fundamental mechanisms and industrial applications. Laser SHG is characterized by a second-order nonlinear susceptibility tensor in nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals, and its intensity is largely related to the lattice distortion. Halide perovskites demonstrate unique photovoltaic and optoelectronic properties due to their high tunability in crystalline and electronic structures, which provides a great platform to investigate their NLO properties. Here, we report a pressure-driven SHG enhancement in all-inorganic lead-free compound CsGeCl 3 , which exhibits a considerable SHG intensity with 9.1 times (@ 1030 nm) that of KH 2 PO 4 at ambient pressure. Upon compression to 1.07 GPa, the SHG intensity further gains ∼3 times, setting a record-high SHG intensity under high pressure (HP). Concerning the limitations of traditional SHG powder measurements, we developed a new single-crystal angle-resolved polarization strategy to retrieve the intrinsic NLO tensors under HP, confirming pressure-induced SHG enhancement. In situ HP synchrotron X-ray diffraction and Raman scattering reveal a strong correlation between SHG intensity and pressure-induced [GeCl 6 ] octahedral distortion. Optical absorption measurements show significant band gap closing under compression, further favoring SHG enhancement. First-principles calculations corroborate these findings. Our results offer a tunable and clean strategy to enhance the SHG intensity in halide perovskites and establish a reliable approach for probing pressure-dependent NLO mechanism in general.},

  abstract     = {Highly fluorogenic probe based bioorthogonal chemistry has become a promising tool in biomedical applications. However, the majority of fluorogenic probes are designed by introducing a bioorthogonal partner as a fluorescence quencher into classical fluorophores, and these probes exhibit a deteriorating fluorogenicity as the emission wavelength shifts toward the near-infrared (NIR) region, greatly limiting their applications in vivo. Herein, we report a novel fluorogenic bioorthogonal reaction involving β- chloroacroleins ( β- CAs ) and meta- aminothiophenol ( m- AT 1 ), whose fluorescence increases more than 500-fold upon in situ generating fluorophores. β- CAs are stable under physiological conditions and react rapidly ( β- CA 9 , k 2 = 2.2 × 10 2 M –1 s –1 , in H 2 O) and chemoselectively with m- AT 1 in the presence of biological nucleophiles, and delightfully, the reaction proceeds swiftly even under solvent-free conditions. Furthermore, manipulating the conjugate length of β- CAs enables the emission wavelength of the probes to be fine-tuned from 627 to 778 nm. These probes allow the simultaneous labeling of multiple cellular organelles without washing steps, and two-color tumor visualization is achieved in living mice. We believe this study not only provides new insights for the development of NIR fluorogenic probes with superior turn-on behaviors but also presents a promising fluorogenic bioorthogonal reaction CA-AT with widespread potential applications in biomedical research.},

The combined results of molecular dynamics simulations and in situ spectroscopies provide solid evidence for the widened EDL that originates from the repulsion of water molecules from the interface by ClO 4 – . The addition of ClO 4 – has a negligible effect on chlorination kinetics because of the electrostatic interaction between the anode and Cl – but obviously suppresses the interaction between water and the anode, leading to high FEs of anodic electrosynthesis by increasing the energy barrier of the undesirable OER. In addition, this method is suitable for other chlorination reactions with enhanced FEs at 100 mA cm –2 .},

The in vivo imaging of miRNA at the tumor sites is essential for understanding its role in colorectal cancer pathology and therapeutic target identification. However, achieving accurate imaging of miRNA at the tumor sites is hindered by the low abundance of miRNAs in tumor cells and nonspecific signal leakage in normal tissues. Here, we report a multivariate-gated catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) nanosensor for the specific amplified imaging of microRNA-21 (miR-21) in human colorectal cancer tissues to reveal the underlying miR-21-associated molecular mechanism. The endogenous glutathione and exogenous near-infrared multivariate-gated design in combination with CHA probes improves the signal strength of target miR-21 and reduces the background interference. The nanosensor enables specific amplified imaging of miR-21 in vivo, and the signal-to-background ratios are 1.6-fold compared with traditional CHA methods. With the assistance of the designed nanosensor, we achieve the preliminary identification of tumor tissues and normal tissues from human clinical surgical resection samples. The overexpressed miR-21 is found to suppress the core mismatch repair recognition protein human mutS homologue 2 involved in DNA damage recognition and repair to inhibit the therapeutic efficacy of colorectal cancer. The strategy of probe design, which combines multivariate-gated activation methods with a signal amplification system, is applicable for accurate miRNA imaging and disease-relevant molecular mechanism research.},

Most strategies to date have aimed to suppress the phase transitions by stabilizing their layered structures through limiting the content of extractable Na + . Here, we conversely increase atomic disorder in the Na-birnessite, a layered sodium manganese oxide, and thereby modulate its phase transition behavior toward improved electrochemical reversibility. Our study reveals that Mn vacancies and Mn migrated into the interlayer affect interlayer local environment of Na + and water molecules consequently enhancing Na + mobility. We observe better capacity retention for disordered “D-Na-birnessite”, which undergoes a reversible phase transition from the birnessite-type structure to an O′3-type α-Na x MnO 2 -like structure through another intermediate metastable birnessite-type phase. This research highlights the positive effects of atomic disorder to regulate phase transition routes for achieving superior electrochemical reversibility, finally paving the way to overcoming the limits of layered oxide cathodes.},

Conventional SERS analysis relies on matching experimental and cataloged spectra, limiting identification to known molecules in databases. With a vast chemical space of &gt;10 60 molecules, it is impractical to obtain the spectra of every molecule and rely solely on in silico techniques for spectral predictions. Here, we showcase an ML-based SERS chemical space that leverages key spectra–structure correlations to achieve two-way spectra-to-structure and structure-to-spectra predictions for untrained molecules with a &gt;90% average accuracy. Using a SERS chemical space comprising 38 linear molecules from four classes (alcohols, aldehydes, amines, and carboxylic acids), our experimental and in silico studies reveal underlying spectral features that enable the prediction of untrained molecules represented by two molecular descriptors (functional group and carbon chain length). For forward spectra-to-structure predictions, we devise a two-step “classification and regression” ML framework to sequentially predict the functional group and carbon chain length of untrained molecules with 100% accuracy and ≤1 carbon difference, respectively. In addition, using an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) regressor trained on the two molecular descriptors, we attain inverse structure-to-spectra prediction with a high average cosine similarity of 90.4% between the predicted and experimental spectra. Our ML-based SERS chemical space represents a shift in molecular identification from traditional spectral matching to predictive modeling of spectra–structure relationships. These insights could motivate the expansion of SERS chemical spaces and realize demands for present and future SERS technologiesfor accurate unknown identification across diverse fields.},

Inspired by the principles of enzyme-cofactor cooperation to enhance stereochemical induction in enantioselective radical transformations, we developed an enantioselective asymmetric radical azidation via cooperative organo- and transition metal catalysis. This approach enables the efficient synthesis of heavily functionalized tertiary azides from readily available aldehydes. The key to this enantioselective process is the use of both chiral organocatalysts to transiently convert aldehydes to the corresponding chiral radical cationic species upon oxidation along with a detailed screening of chiral metal-azide catalysts to cooperatively enhance stereoinduction in carbon-azide bond formation. DFT studies suggest a favorable stereocontrol model and validate the crucial roles of chirality pairing of both catalytic schemes. We envision that this copper/amine cooperative catalysis could offer a useful strategy of constructing tetrasubstituted stereogenic carbon in asymmetric radical transformation development.},

While most research on Egyptian mummified bodies has so far been conducted in European collections, our study focuses on the collection of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. The goal was to evaluate whether contemporary smells reflect the mummification materials and, if so, what information can be of value to collection interpretation and conservation. We combined panel-based sensory analyses with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-olfactometry (GC-MS-O), microbiological analysis, and historical and conservation research. Apart from differences in odor intensity, the sensory analyses highlighted common olfactory descriptors for all samples: “woody”, “spicy”, and “sweet”. GC-MS-O identified four categories of volatiles based on their origin: (i) original mummification materials; (ii) plant oils used for conservation; (iii) synthetic pesticides; and (iv) microbiological deterioration products. However, the use of insect repellents similar in composition to the original mummification materials makes it challenging to attribute the origin of some compounds. Clusters based on the chemical and olfactory profiles of the smells emerged, suggesting similarities based on the archeological period, conservation treatments, and materiality.},

  abstract     = {The bursatellin-oxazinin family is a series of tyrosine-derived, nitrile-containing marine natural products from gastropod and bivalve molluscs. Although the first analogs were identified and associated with toxicity 40 years ago, their biosynthetic origins were unknown. During an investigation of published mollusc genomes and transcriptomes, we serendipitously identified a putative bursatellin biosynthetic gene cluster (referred hereafter as the bur-ox pathway). Through biochemical characterization of some bur-ox genes, we provide evidence suggesting that bursatellin-type metabolites are produced by molluscs themselves rather than by their microbial symbionts. We show that the reductive domain from a monomodular nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) protein FmtATR performs a four-electron reduction to produce tyrosinols from tyrosine derivatives. Moreover, an aminocarboxypropyltransferase enzyme, ACT, uses S -adenosylmethionine (SAM) to transform tyrosinols into their phenolic homoserine ethers, which in bursatellin is further modified to the nitrile. Widespread occurrence of bur-ox in molluscs suggests a common biosynthetic origin for bursatellins and oxazinins as well as an important but currently unidentified physiological role for this metabolite family in molluscs inhabiting diverse ecological niches. The presence of bur-ox pathway homologues in culinary bivalves, such as mussels and geoducks, calls into question the potential of oxazinins as toxins. As one of the few NRPS pathways of animal origin to be characterized, bur-ox sheds light on underappreciated chemical and biochemical diversity in animals.},

  abstract     = {Immune disorders induced by cell-free DNA (cfDNA) account for the incidence and deterioration of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Scavenging of cfDNA using cationic polymers represents a promising modality for SLE management. However, they bind cfDNA mainly via electrostatic interaction, which would result in an undesired discharge of the captured cfDNA upon competitive replacement by the negatively charged serum/intracellular components. Inspired by the natural recognition mechanism of biomacromolecules via spatial matching, we herein developed a library of dendrimer-templated, spherical, α-helical, and guanidine-rich polypeptides as molecular clips for cfDNA scavenging. Upon optimization of the polypeptide length and density on the dendrimer surface, the top-performing G3-8 was identified, which could tightly confine cfDNA within the cavity between the adjacent, rod-like α-helices. As thus, the helical G3-8 but not the random-coiled analogue D,L -G3-8 enabled robust cfDNA scavenging under serum-rich conditions to inhibit TLR9 activation and inflammation. In SLE mice, i.v. injected G3-8 efficiently prevented organ failure and inhibited inflammation by scavenging cfDNA. This study provides an enlightened strategy to stably bind and scavenge cfDNA and may shift the current paradigm of SLE management.},

Here, we realized a rare atroposelective remote meta -C–H functionalization with a chiral monoprotected amino acid (MPAA) ligand and a racemic transient norbornene mediator. The reaction starts with enantioselective ortho -C–H activation via kinetic resolution to give a chiral biaryl-palladium intermediate, which subsequently undergoes a Catellani relay to afford chiral meta -functionalized biaryl products ( S -factors up to 458). The obtained diverse enantioenriched quinoline-based atropisomers are ubiquitous in natural products, pharmaceuticals, chiral ligands, and functional materials.

  abstract     = {The recombination of water ions has diverse scientific and practical implications, ranging from acid–base chemistry and biological systems to planetary environments and applications in fuel cell and carbon conversion technologies. While spatial confinement affects the physicochemical properties of water dynamics, its impact on the recombination process has rarely been studied. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of water, the water ion distribution, and the ion recombination process in water droplets as a function of droplet size through molecular dynamics simulations and adaptive quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical calculations. We compare the dynamics of recombination in water droplet sizes ranging from 100 to 18 000 waters, both in their interiors and on their surfaces. We found that the self-diffusion of water dramatically decreases in droplets with a diameter below 2.2 nm. Using a classical RexPoN force-field, we found that the ions in 1000 H 2 O’s spend almost 50% of the time on the surface and 0.5 nm beneath it with a slight preference for OH – ion to reside longer on the surface. We estimate that, on average, recombination in these drops occurs at 400 ps in 1000 H 2 O’s and 1 ns in 3000 H 2 O’s. We also found that recombination is not limited by the local structure of the surface or the size of the droplet but can be influenced by the geometry of the water wire connecting the ions as they approach each other, which can often prevent recombination. Our results provide insights to the reaction microenvironments presented by nanoscopic water droplets.},

Here, by preparation of a N -doped carbon-supported bifunctional cobalt catalyst (Co-DAPhen/C), it was applied to develop a reductive tandem reaction for general synthesis of AHBA derivatives from cheap and abundant nitroarenes, formaldehyde, and acrylates. This catalytic three-component reaction features broad substrate and functionality tolerance, an easily accessible and reusable catalyst, and high step and atom economy. The active Co sites of the catalyst are involved in the mild reduction processes with formic acid, whereas the N-doped carbon support enriches the HCHO and acrylates by physical adsorption, thus favoring the capture of hydroxylamine and nitrone intermediates via condensation and 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition, respectively. Such a metal–support synergy interrupts the conventional reduction of nitroarenes into anilines and results in a novel tandem reaction route. In this work, the concept merging mild reduction and effective intermediate transformations is anticipated to develop more useful tandem reactions by rational catalyst design.},

For photodetection, resonant nanostructures have enabled emerging technologies, such as light detection and ranging, spectrometers, and polarimeters, within an ultracompact footprint. However, resonant nanophotonics usually relies on nanofabrication technology, which suffers from the trade-offs between precision and scalability. Here, we first realize the self-assembly of subwavelength resonant nanostructures of metal-halide perovskites for spatial object localization and tracking. By steering crystallization along capillary corner bridges localized at edges, we achieve single crystallinity, subwavelength size, and resonant coupling between perovskite nanowires, thus leading to an angle-resolved photodetector with an angular resolution of 0.523°. Furthermore, we integrate multiple pairs of coupled resonant nanowires along two orthogonal orientations to form angle-resolved photodetector arrays for spatial light localization of both static and moving objects with an error of less than 0.6 cm. These findings create a platform for self-assembled resonant nanostructures, thus paving the way for multifunctional nanophotonic and optoelectronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Developing catalysts that achieve a higher turnover frequency (TOF) with a lower effective overpotential (η eff ) in electrocatalytic reactions is an emerging focus of research. A promising approach to this end is modifying the secondary coordination sphere (SCS) that can facilitate hydrogen bonding interactions or electrostatic effects, thereby lowering the activation energy barrier in the rate-determining step (rds). Herein, we designed and synthesized a series of Co III complexes ( 1 – 8 ) featuring a bis-pyridine-dioxime framework, each with a distinct SCS (−C 6 H 5 ( 1 ), o -NHMe 2 + –C 6 H 4 – ( 2 ), o -OMe–C 6 H 4 – ( 3 ), o -OH–C 6 H 4 – ( 4 ), p -NHMe 2 + –C 6 H 4 – ( 5 ), p -OMe–C 6 H 4 – ( 6 ), pyridine ( 7 ), and pyrimidine ( 8 )). We investigated their electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in acetonitrile, both with CF 3 COOH and in a 1:1 CF 3 COOH/CF 3 COO – buffer solution. All complexes demonstrated selective 4e – /4H + reduction of O 2 . A linear free energy relationship (LFER) analysis revealed a trend of increasing the TOF with η eff , aligning with molecular scaling expectations. However, 2 and 3 with the o -NHMe 2 + –C 6 H 4 – and o -OMe–C 6 H 4 – substituents diverged from this trend, exhibiting TOF values over 1000 and 250 times higher than predicted based on their positions in the log(TOF)/η eff correlation within the buffer solution. Kinetic investigations indicate that protonation of the Co III (O 2 • ) adduct is the rds for all catalysts, suggesting that the functional groups in the SCS of 2 and 3 facilitate proton transfer, acting as proton relay sites. We propose that this effect reduces the activation energy barrier in the rds, accounting for the observed deviation from the LFER. This study underscores the critical role of designing an appropriate SCS to enhance catalyst efficiency beyond LFER expectations.},

In this research, we designed a dual-functional antitumor peptide (N-Pep) that serves as both a therapeutic agent and metal ions (Mn 2+ ) immunomodulator carrier. The rational designed antitumor peptide self-assembles into a hydrogel through coordination with Mn 2+ ions (referred to as N-Pep-Mn gel). The multiporous hydrogel network allows for efficient loading of antiprogrammed death-1 antibody (αPD-1). The hydrogel served as a depot for the sustained release of Mn 2+ ions and encapsulated αPD-1, effectively activating dendritic cells, polarizing tumor-associated macrophages and enhancing effector T cell infiltration, thereby leading to the effective inhibition of tumor growth through intratumoral and systemic immune responses. Additionally, the hydrogel induces robust immune memory, providing substantial protection against tumor recurrence.

First-row transition metal electrocatalysts for ammonia oxidation are an enabling technology for sustainable energy production. We describe electrocatalytic ammonia oxidation using robust molecular complexes based on Earth-abundant iron. Electrochemical studies of ferrocenes with covalently attached pyridine arms reveal facile ammonia oxidation in DMSO (2.4 M NH 3 ) with modest overpotentials (η = 770–820 mV) and turnover frequencies (125–560 h –1 ). Experimental and computational studies indicate that the pendant pyridyl base serves as an H-bond acceptor with an N–H bond of ammonia that transfers a proton to the pyridine following oxidation by the attached ferrocenium moiety in a proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) step. This generates an amidyl ( • NH 2 ) radical stabilized via H-bonding to a pendant pyridinium moiety that rapidly dimerizes to hydrazine (H 2 N–NH 2 ), which is easily oxidized to nitrogen (N 2 ) at the glassy carbon working electrode. This report identifies a general strategy to oxidize ammonia via H-bonding to a base (B:), thereby activating [B···H-NH 2 ] toward PCET by a proximal oxidant to form [BH···NH 2 ] +/• radical cations, which are susceptible to dimerization to form easily oxidized hydrazine.},

  abstract     = {Despite tremendous efforts to engineer translational machinery, replacing the encoded peptide backbone with new-to-nature structures remains a significant challenge. C, H, O, and N are the elements of life, yet ribosomes are capable of forming only C–N bonds as amides, C–O bonds as esters, and C–S bonds as thioesters. There is no current strategy to site-selectively form C–C bonds as ketones embedded in the backbones of ribosomal products. As an alternative to direct ribosomal C–C bond formation, here we report that peptides containing a dehydrolactic acid motif rapidly isomerize to generate backbone-embedded α,γ-diketoamides via a spontaneous formal O to C acyl shift rearrangement. The dehydrolactic acid motif can be introduced into peptides ribosomally or via solid-phase synthesis using α-hydroxyphenylselenocysteine followed by oxidation. Subsequent incubation at physiological pH produces an α,γ-diketoamide that can be diversified using a variety of nucleophiles, including hydrazines and hydroxylamines, to form pyrazoles and oximes, respectively. All of these groups remain embedded directly within the polypeptide backbone. This general strategy for peptide backbone editing, predicated on an intricate cascade of acyl rearrangements, provides the first nonenzymatic example of a C–C bond forming reaction to take place within a peptide backbone. The products so-produced are easily diversified into protein-like materials with backbone-embedded heterocycles. Application of this peptide editing strategy should accelerate the discovery of genetically encoded molecules whose properties more closely resemble those of bioactive natural products.},

Here, ring-opening copolymerization (ROCOP) of unpurified, commercially available epoxides and succinic anhydride is employed to synthesize well-defined, low molecular weight polyesters with controlled functionalization.

  abstract     = {Gallia-alumina (Ga x Al 2– x O 3 ), promoted with a trace amount of Pt, exhibits excellent activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) due to a bifunctional mechanism. Tetrahedrally coordinated Ga (Ga IV ) catalyzes C–H dissociation, while Pt facilitates H recombination into H 2 . To maximize the utilization of precious Pt and Ga, it is crucial to understand the optimal balance between the two catalytic functions or determine the ‘ideal regime.’ Here, we developed techniques to quantify the catalytic functions of Pt and Ga IV sites. H 2 –D 2 exchange rates ( r HD ) and propylene chemisorption ( Q (Ga IV,surf )) were used as effective measures of the catalytic functions of Pt and Ga IV , respectively. When Pt is sufficient relative to Ga IV ( r HD / Q (Ga IV,surf ) ratio &gt;0.3 mol HD mol GaIV,surf –1 s –1 ), the catalysts exhibit ideal catalytic properties. During repeated reaction and regeneration cycles, the catalysts deactivated mainly due to Pt sintering, which leads to an imbalance between the two catalytic functions. Notably, catalysts with higher Pt contents lost catalytic activity faster than those with lower Pt contents, eventually exhibiting reversed activities. This is because increased Pt loading facilitates sintering. Doping a small amount of Ce 3+ onto Ga x Al 2– x O 3 effectively suppresses Pt sintering via strong metal–support interaction. Thus, optimal loadings of Ga and Pt, combined with Ce 3+ doping to stabilize Pt, enabled the minimized use of precious elements while maintaining excellent catalytic properties. Even with 100 ppm Pt and 1 wt % Ga, the catalyst exhibited superior activity, selectivity, and stability compared to the benchmark catalyst, PtSn/γ-Al 2 O 3 , with 7000 ppm (0.7 wt %) Pt.},

  abstract     = {The surface of an organism is a dynamic interface that continually adapts to its environment. In nematodes, the cuticle forms a complex boundary that protects against the physicochemical pressures. However, the precise molecular composition and function of this surface remain largely unexplored. By utilizing 3D-OrbiSIMS, an advanced surface-sensitive mass spectrometry method, we directly characterized the molecular composition of the outermost regions (∼50 nm) of Caenorhabditis elegans and Pristionchus pacificus to improve the understanding of species-specific surface lipid composition and its potential roles in nematode biology. We found that nematode surfaces consist of a lipid-dominated landscape (&gt;81% C. elegans and &gt;69% P. pacificus of all surveyed chemistries) with distinct compositions, which enrich in granularity and complexity through development. The surface lipids are also species-specific, potentially highlighting distinct molecular compositions that are derived from diverging evolutionary paths. By exploring the effect of mutations on lipid production, we found the peroxisomal fatty acid β-oxidation component daf-22 is essential for defining the surface molecular fingerprint. This pathway is conserved across species in producing distinct chemical profiles, indicating its fundamental role in lipid metabolism and maintaining the surface integrity and function. Furthermore, we discovered that variations in surface lipids of C. elegans daf-22 larvae contribute to significantly increased susceptibility to predation by P. pacificus . Therefore, our findings reveal that nematode surface lipids are developmentally dependent, species-specific, and fundamental in interspecies interactions. These insights pave the way for further exploration into the physiological and behavioral significance of surface lipids.},

  abstract     = {The integration of water-based electrolytes into zinc-ion batteries encounters challenges due to the limited voltage window of water, interfacial side reactions of mobile counterions, and the growth of zinc metal (Zn 0 ) dendrites during charge. In this study, we introduce a nonfluorinated, cation-conducting polyelectrolyte membrane (PEM) designed to alleviate these challenges by suppressing the reactivities of both water and counterions. This PEM forms hydrogen bonds with water molecules through its proton-accepting side chains, thus shifting the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy of water from −0.37 to −0.14 eV and inducing a negative shift in the onset potential for hydrogen evolution by 110 mV. Additionally, it immobilizes the counteranions onto the polymer backbones via covalent bonding, hence making the Zn 2+ transference number nearly unity (0.96). Meanwhile, the high modulus PEM establishes a solid-state diffusion barrier to homogenize the interfacial Zn 2+ flux, leading to 3D in-plane interfacial Zn 2+ diffusion and compact Zn 0 plating within the (002) plane. Atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) reveals corrosion-free Zn 0 deposition without electrolyte degradation, while operando transition X-ray microscopy (TXM) further illustrates the real-time dendrite-free Zn 0 plating process at 5 mA/cm 2 . Consequently, the unique properties of this water-binding and anion-tethering PEM enable enhanced electrochemical performance without employing highly fluorinated and expensive anions. This PEM demonstrates a durability of 3800 h in Zn 0 –Zn 0 symmetric cells and a lifetime of 6000 cycles in Zn 0 –LiV 3 O 8 full cells.},

Herein, we present a halogen bonding approach to achieve TSDP emission in bromo-substituted Cu(I) cyclic trinuclear complexes (CTCs). Photophysical analysis and theoretical calculations reveal the crucial role of halogen bonding in suppressing the excited-state distortions and reducing energy differences between the first and second triplet excited states (T 1 and T 2 ). This enables efficient spin-allowed reverse internal conversion, leading to the TSDP behavior. Additionally, the low internal reorganization energy and rigid halogen-bonded network in bromo-substituted Cu(I) CTCs result in significantly suppressed nonradiative decay and high QYs, with one approaching near-unity. This work provides an innovative approach to extend the TSDP behavior from Au(I)/Au(III) to Cu(I) complexes with high QYs.},

However, traditional 13 C– 15 N cross-polarization (CP), effective at lower MAS frequencies, suffers diminished efficiency under ultrafast MAS conditions. To overcome this limitation, we developed a robust method for selective polarization between insensitive nuclei (SPINE). This approach significantly enhances the heteronuclear 13 C– 15 N correlation efficiency over CP, with gain factors of 1.75 for 13 CA– 15 N and 1.9 and 13 CO– 15 N transfers. SPINE’s efficacy was validated on four diverse proteins: the microcrystalline β1 immunoglobulin binding domain of protein G (GB1), the large-conductance mechanosensitive ion channel from Methanosarcina acetivorans (MaMscL), fibrillar septum-forming protein (SepF), and the vertex protein of the β-carboxysome shell (CcmL). This enhancement can reduce the duration of current multidimensional experiments to about one-third of that using a single 13 C– 15 N CP and to about one-tenth with dual 13 C– 15 N transfers. Our findings underscore the practical utility and versatility of SPINE in ssNMR spectroscopy, making it a valuable approach for advancing structural biology studies of sub-milligram protein.},

The same catalyst had been identified previously to promote enantioselective opening of oxetanes via both Lewis and Brønsted acid mechanisms. This remarkable generality is interpreted to arise from catalyst recognition of the conserved electrostatic features of the dipolar enantioselectivity-determining transition states in the ring-opening S N 2 mechanisms with simultaneous tolerance of variation of the specific functional group and steric features of the reactions. Specific experimental and computational evidence is provided for a network of electrostatic interactions that forms a shared basis for enantioinduction across these transformations.

  abstract     = {Vancomycin continues to be a widely used antibiotic of last resort in treating drug-resistant pathogens despite the emergence of vancomycin-resistant strains such as vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE). This communication reports that conjugation of vancomycin to a second antibiotic that targets a different region of lipid II enhances and rescues its antibiotic activity. Conjugation of vancomycin to a minimal teixobactin pharmacophore in which residues 1–6 are replaced with an aromatic amide results in substantial enhancement in activity over the individual components or mixtures thereof. Three conjugates with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 0.5 μg/mL against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and 0.063–0.125 μg/mL against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) were identified. Each of these conjugates is also active against VRE, even though the individual components are inactive, with the most active conjugate (Cbp-Lys 10 -teixo 7–11 -vanco) having an MIC of 2–4 μg/mL. These findings demonstrate that conjugation of vancomycin to a minimal teixobactin pharmacophore is an effective strategy for enhancing the activity of vancomycin against important Gram-positive pathogens.},

Herein, we report a one-step mechanochemical reaction that converts AGF into alkali metal fluorides under basic conditions, bypassing HF. The method consists of reacting AGF with alkali metal (hydr)oxides and titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) under mechanical energy for MF formation and in situ sequestration of calcium (hydr)oxide byproducts as calcium titanate (CaTiO 3 ). Ca 2+ sequestration prevents reversible CaF 2 formation upon aqueous extraction, thus enabling the isolation of alkali metal fluorides. We also demonstrate that alkali metal titanates (M 2 TiO 3 ) are suitable reagents for both CaF 2 activation and Ca 2+ sequestration, with K 2 TiO 3 being optimal for KF synthesis.},

The four-step anaerobic conversion of tryptophan to skatole is well-established; though, to date, no aerobic counterpart has been reported. Herein, we report the discovery of the oxygen-dependent skatole synthase SktA that single-handedly converts 5-bromo- l -tryptophan to 5-bromoskatole, obviating the need for a multienzyme process. SktA is part of a three-gene biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) in the cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme NIES-2108 and functions as a nonheme diiron enzyme belonging to the heme oxygenase-like domain-containing oxidase (HDO) superfamily. Our detailed biochemical analyses revealed cyanide and bicarbonate as biosynthetic coproducts, while stopped-flow experiments showed the hallmark formation of a substrate-triggered peroxo Fe 2 (III) intermediate. Overall, this work unravels an alternative pathway for converting tryptophan to skatole while also expanding the functional repertoire of HDO enzymes.},

However, to fully utilize the microdroplets for accelerating chemical reactions requires a fundamental understanding of how microdroplet chemistry differs from that of a homogeneous phase. Here we provide our perspective on recent progress to this end, both experimentally and theoretically. We begin by reviewing the many ways in which microdroplets can be prepared, creating water/hydrophobic interfaces that have been frequently implicated in microdroplet reactivity due to preferential surface adsorption of solutes, persistent electric fields, and their acidity or basicity. These features of the interface interplay with specific mechanisms proposed for microdroplet reactivity, including partial solvation, possible gas phase channels, and the presence of highly reactive intermediates. We especially highlight the role of droplet charge and associated electric fields, which appears to be key to understanding how certain reactions, like the formation of hydrogen peroxide and reduced transition metal complexes, are thermodynamically possible in microdroplets. Lastly, we emphasize opportunities for theoretical advances and suggest experiments that would greatly enhance our understanding of this fascinating subject.},

We demonstrate that the fidelity of this enzyme-free primer extension benefits from reactions performed with a mixture of activated PNAs where every 4-mer has its self-complementary 4-mer. The reactions can be performed using the whole repertoire of 4-mers (256 permutations) in a parallelized manner. Using a primer in combination with its −1, −2, and −3 deletion allows for sequencing by MALDI analysis, using the increment in mass for each nucleobase assignment. Given the enzyme-free nature of this sequencing and the achiral nature of PNA, we further demonstrate that the technology can be used to sequence d - or l -DNA as well as LNA and PNA (XNA).},

Compared with luminescent lanthanide complexes with hard nitrogen or oxygen donor ligands, the development of luminescent lanthanide complexes based on sulfur-donor ligands currently lags behind. In this work, two types of poly(mercaptoimidazolyl)borate ligands, one is tridentate and the other is tetradentate, were used for the design and synthesis of two series of novel S-coordinating cerium(III) (Ce(III)) complexes, which were found to be not only luminescent but also with moderate to surprisingly good stability in air. By tuning the ligand type and substituents, blue- and yellow-green-emitting Ce(III) complexes with different emission mechanisms of d–f transition, delayed d–f transition, and ligand-centered fluorescence/phosphorescence were obtained, among which the highest photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) was 97%, and the most stable one can still maintain 74% of the initial PLQY even after exposure to air for 1 month. Furthermore, we investigated the degradation mechanism of these complexes in air, revealing the oxidation of low-valence sulfur(II) to high-valence sulfur-containing S═O bonds. This work shows the potential of S-coordinating ligands in luminescent Ce(III) complexes and provides new perspectives for designing Ce(III) complexes with soft donors.},

While the electronic interactions of chalcogen bonds in the ground state have been intensively analyzed, there is barely any knowledge about the electron structure in the excited state. This is despite the fact that in some cases photoswitches containing chalcogen bonds exhibit exceptional switching behavior. Here, we investigate the effect of light absorption on chalcogen bonds containing divalent chalcogen centers. Quantum chemical calculations reveal that in the excited S 1 state the noncovalent chalcogen bond converts to a covalent three-electron σ bond. The bond between the chalcogen center and the Lewis base center is thus significantly reinforced by light excitation. This change in bond type explains the previously experimentally observed nonswitchability of some tellurium-containing azo compounds. Furthermore, we were able to demonstrate that the switchability of certain selenium-containing compounds is temperature-dependent, whereby the ratio of the less stable cis compound is higher for higher temperatures. These results highlight the potential for designing responsive materials and dynamic molecular systems based on light-induced chalcogen bond modulation.},

Based thereupon, we successfully constructed a highly durable photocatalytic system, of which the turnover number of formate (TON HCOO– ) exceeded 1700 when fac -[Mn I (bpy)(CO) 3 ((OC(O)OC 2 H 5 N(C 2 H 5 OH) 2 ) ( Mn-CO 2 -TEOA ) as the catalyst, [Os II (4,4′-dimethyl-bpy)(5,5′-dimethyl-bpy) 2 ] 2+ ( Os ) as the photosensitizer, and 1,3-dimethyl-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[d]imidazole ( BIH ) as the reductant were used in conjunction with irradiation at λ ex ≥ 620 nm. In contrast, for the same photocatalytic system, irradiation at λ ex ≥ 480 nm lowered the TON HCOO– to less than 60. The significant difference in the durability of the photocatalytic system arises from the dependence of the Mn(0)–Mn(0) dimer [Mn 0 2 (bpy) 2 (CO) 6 ] ( Dim-Mn ), an intermediate produced during the photocatalytic reaction, on the wavelength of the irradiated light for its photoreactivity. That is, the irradiation of Dim-Mn at λ ex ≥ 620 nm selectively induces splitting of the Mn–Mn bond to produce [Mn 0 (bpy)(CO) 3 ] ( Mn • ) and, contrary to this, splitting of the Mn(0)–CO bonds and further decomposition processes are induced by irradiation at λ ex ≥ 480 nm.},

  abstract     = {C–H···O hydrogen bonds are formed in systems ranging from biomolecular complexes to small-molecule structures. Previous work has focused on the blueshifts in the C–H stretching frequency ( ν ¯ CH ) induced by these hydrogen bonds and their chemical and biological roles. Here, we show that, in contrast, terminal alkyne C–H hydrogen bonds exhibit large redshifts (50–100 cm –1 ) upon hydrogen bonding with oxygen-containing solvents. Using spectroscopic and computational approaches, we elucidate and compare the roles of the vibrational Stark effect, bond polarization, and charge transfer in driving the C–H redshift. We show that the redshifts of alkyne’s terminal C–H upon the formation of hydrogen bonds correlate with the Lewis basicity of the solvent and are significantly larger than those arising solely from solvent electric fields (vibrational Stark effect), differing from the well-studied redshift of carbonyl vibrations induced by hydrogen bonds. Through a decomposition of vibrational frequency shifts based on DFT calculations using absolutely localized molecular orbitals, we demonstrate that including the effects of bond polarization and charge transfer, in addition to the vibrational Stark effect, results in quantitative agreement between experimentally observed C–H frequency shifts and the theoretically predicted values in various oxygen-containing solvents. Our results highlight the significance of effects beyond pure electrostatics in accounting for the large redshifts in C–H···O hydrogen bonds and exemplify our approach to quantifying the contributions from different physical effects.},

By modulating and monitoring electron behavior at the single-molecule level, we can better understand the fundamental mechanisms and ways to control them for technological use. Here, we unravel a mechanism of single-electron catalysis under positively charged nanoconfinement. We demonstrate that both (2 + 2) and (4 + 4) cycloadditions can be catalyzed reversibly by a single electron. Key reaction pathways are discovered by monitoring sequential electrical signals in the cycloadditions through advanced single-molecule detection platforms. Experimental and theoretical results consistently demonstrate that combining single ET processes with nanoconfinement involving cucurbit[8]uril can lower the reaction energy barrier and promote reversible cycloaddition. Moreover, we show that the bias voltage can fine-tune ET processes and chemical equilibria in bond formation and cleavage.

Here, we immobilize a single-metal atom model catalyst into a single-molecule electrical detection platform for in situ monitoring of the catalytic hydrogen generation process at the single-event level. In combination with theoretical and experimental studies, the catalytic mechanisms of the hydrogen generation reaction, especially the selection of the catalytic center through charge, spin, and orbital quantum control, are elucidated. In addition, a hydrogen generation process via quantum spin-induced catalysis is observed, in which the turnover frequency increases by about 65 times at a magnetic field of 50 mT. This study provides valuable insights into the intrinsic mechanism of single-metal atom catalysis and opens up unique avenues for their precise control, thus offering a useful strategy for efficiently developing clean energy.},

In principle, redox-active organic materials can tackle this challenge because of their high theoretical energy densities. However, electrode-level energy densities of organic electrodes are compromised due to their poor electron/ion transport and severe dissolution. Here, we report the use of a low-bandgap, conductive, and highly insoluble layered metal-free cathode material for SIBs. It exhibits a high theoretical capacity of 355 mAh g –1 per formula unit, enabled by a four-electron redox process, and achieves an electrode-level energy density of 606 Wh kg –1 electrode (90 wt % active material) along with excellent cycling stability. It allows for facile two-dimensional Na + diffusion, which enables a high intrinsic rate capability. Growth of the active cathode material in the presence of as little as 2 wt % carboxyl-functionalized carbon nanotubes improves charge transport and charge transfer kinetics and further enhances the power performance. Altogether, these allow the construction of SIB cells built from an affordable, sustainable organic small molecule, which provide a cathode energy density of 472 Wh kg –1 electrode when charging/discharging in 90 s and a top specific power of 31.6 kW kg –1 electrode .},

  abstract     = {The initial stages of photosynthesis in light-harvesting antennae, driven by excitonic energy transport, have inspired the design of artificial light-harvesting complexes. Double-walled nanotubes (DWNTs) formed from the cyanine dye C8S3 provide a robust, self-assembled system that mimics natural chlorosomes in both structure and optical properties. Two competing molecular packing models─bricklayer (BL) and herringbone (HB)─have been proposed to explain the structural and optical characteristics of these DWNTs. This study resolves the debate by combining theoretical analysis with advanced polarization-resolved wide-field photoluminescence microscopy. Quantum-classical simulations reveal reduced linear dichroism (LDr) as a decisive parameter for distinguishing between the models. Experimental measurements of single DWNTs yielded LDr values as high as 0.93, strongly favoring the BL model. The BL model’s unique excitonic patterns, dominated by negative couplings among individual chromophores, generate superradiant exciton states with transition dipoles preferentially aligned along the nanotube axis. In contrast, the HB model’s mixed positive and negative couplings produce destructive interference, leading to a weaker alignment of transition dipoles. Our approach deepens the understanding of the structure–property relationships in self-assembled systems and demonstrates the potential of slip-stacking engineering to fine-tune excitonic properties for artificial light-harvesting applications.},

  abstract     = {Despite the diversity of reactions catalyzed by mononuclear iron and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent enzymes, the factors that lead to diverse reaction outcomes beyond canonical hydroxylation remain elusive. Cyclopropanation reactions are of particular interest not only due to the prevalence of cyclopropane moieties in pharmaceuticals but also due to the chemistry that allows cyclopropanation to outcompete oxygen rebound. HrmJ is one such cyclopropanase from the biosynthetic pathway of hormaomycin; however, a homologue is herein discovered that instead catalyzes C -hydroxylation of the same nitro enolate substrate. These enzymes were reconstituted with Mn(II) and V(IV)═O as mimics of the resting (Fe(II)) and reactive (Fe(IV)═O) intermediate states, respectively. Corresponding crystal structures of the cyclopropanase bound with a substrate imply H atom transfer via an offline π-pathway. In contrast, analogous structural analysis of the hydroxylase implies H atom abstraction likely proceeds through a σ-pathway. Preparation of isotopically labeled substrates and stopped-flow kinetic analyses indicate that while the pro-S hydrogen of C4 is abstracted in both enzymes, the Fe(IV)═O intermediate reacts ca. 17-fold faster in the active site of the hydroxylase, consistent with the mechanistic assignments. These results also support a correlation between the mechanism of H atom transfer and the subsequent fate of the substrate radical once generated. A subtle difference in substrate positioning not only affects the H atom abstraction pathway but also allows the nitro enolate moiety to intercept the resulting substrate radical in the active site of the cyclopropase, thereby facilitating intramolecular C–C bond formation in a stereoselective manner.},

However, this transformation often suffers from regio- and stereoselectivity issues when working with unsymmetrical internal alkynes. Herein, we report for the first time the regio- and syn -stereoselective hydroalkynylation of a variety of heteroatom-functionalized unsymmetrical internal alkynes including homopropargyl ethers, thioethers, and tertiary amines with terminal alkynes by half-sandwich rare-earth catalysts. This protocol provides an atom-efficient and straightforward route for the synthesis of a new family of heteroatom (O, S, or N)-functionalized 1,3-enynes, featuring 100% atom-efficiency, broad substrate scope, and high regio- and syn -stereoselectivity (&gt;19:1 r.r. and &gt;19:1 syn / anti ). The mechanistic details have been elucidated by deuterium-labeling experiments, control experiments, and isolation and transformations of key reaction intermediates, revealing that the reaction proceeded through the C(sp)–H deprotonation of a terminal alkyne by a half-sandwich scandium alkyl species to form a catalytically active dimeric half-sandwich scandium tetraalkynyl species followed by heteroatom-assisted insertion of internal alkyne into the Sc–alkynyl bond and the subsequent protonolysis of the resulting Sc–alkenyl bond with another terminal alkyne molecule. The coordination of the heteroatom (O, S, or N) of internal alkynes to the catalyst metal center plays a critically important role in achieving a high level of reactivity and regio- and stereoselectivity. Remarkably, the catalytically active dimeric half-sandwich scandium tetraalkynyl species can be recovered and reused, constituting the first example of a recyclable catalyst system for the hydroalkynylation of internal alkynes.},

Bond length analysis of VIII Cm(III)–OH 2 (where VIII refers to the coordination number) was compared to VIII Ln(III)–OH 2 (Ln 3+ = Nd 3+ and Sm 3+ ), indicating similar VIII M(III)–OH 2 bond lengths because of their similar eight-coordinate ionic radii of these VIII M(III) cations. Owing to the reduced coordination number, the VIII Cm(III)–OH 2 bond lengths were shorter than previously reported IX Cm(III)–OH 2 bonds in [Cm(H 2 O) 9 ](CF 3 SO 3 ) 3 . The octa-aquo complexes were also characterized by solid-state UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy in addition to variable-temperature and variable-pressure photoluminescence. Variable-pressure absorption spectra of Cm1 were compared with Ln1 and show that the Cm(III) f → f transitions have a stronger dependence on pressure than that observed in Ln1 (Ln 3+ = Nd 3+ and Sm 3+ ). The experimental and computational analyses reveal that the monotonic decrease in the computed energy difference between the ground state and the first excited state corresponds to the observed red shift of the photoluminescence peak. This is accompanied by a gradual reduction in the average Cm(III)–OH 2 bond length and a delocalization of spin densities, alongside an intensified interaction involving the 5f orbitals under increasing pressure. These changes accommodate the new geometry and collectively modify the energy landscape, resulting in peak broadening and quenching.},

  abstract     = {Diffusion is a ubiquitous process that is strongly correlated with concentration. Based on developed three-dimensional free energy and a continuous-time random-walk coarse-graining method, we found the optimal diffusion pathway under confinement, determined all diffusional energy barriers, and identified the major units of zeolite where molecular diffusion is limited. Interestingly, a novel diffusion mechanism was determined in the nanopore of a zeolite catalyst by molecular dynamics simulation, pulsed field gradient, and 2D exchange spectroscopy (EXSY) NMR experiments. We describe a “molecular self-gating effect” that effectively predominates the diffusion process in cage-type (e.g., RHO and MER) zeolites through a “traffic jam” and a “smooth traffic” process. Initially, transport is hindered by molecules forming a gate (traffic jam); then, as the number of molecules reaches a certain threshold, diffusion increases rapidly due to the synergistic collisions of aggregated molecules upon the gate (smooth traffic). This unique diffusion behavior is observed here for the first time and illustrates a microscopic mechanism dictated by the molecular self-gating effect in a confined space. The exploitable diffusion disclosed herein should shed new light on the fundamental understanding of transport, as well as enrich diffusion behavior under confinement.},

Achieving such control is generally based on a trial-and-error approach. Data-driven synthesis holds promise to advance both discovery and mechanistic knowledge. Herein, we contribute to advancing the current state of the art in the chemical synthesis of colloidal NCs by proposing a machine-learning toolbox that operates in a low-data regime, yet comprehensive of the most typical parameters relevant for colloidal NC synthesis. The developed toolbox predicts the NC shape given the reaction conditions and proposes reaction conditions given a target NC shape using Cu NCs as the model system. By classifying NC shapes on a continuous energy scale, we synthesize an unreported shape, which is the Cu rhombic dodecahedron. This holistic approach integrates data-driven and computational tools with materials chemistry. Such development is promising to greatly accelerate materials discovery and mechanistic understanding, thus advancing the field of tailored materials with atomic-scale precision tunability.},

  abstract     = {Multi-proton-coupled electron transfer, multitudinous intermediates, and unavoidable competing hydrogen evolution reaction during CO 2 electroreduction make it tricky to control high selectivity for specific products. Here, we present spatial confinement of Fe single atoms (FeN 2 S 2 ) by adjacent FeS clusters (Fe 4 S 4 ) to orientate the transition of CO 2 adsorption configuration from C,O-side to O-end, which triggers a shift of activated CO 2 from first-step protonation to C–C coupling, thus switching the target product from HCOOH in high Faraday efficiency (FE: 90.6%) on FeN 2 S 2 to CH 3 COOH (FE: 82.3%) on Fe 4 S 4 /FeN 2 S 2 . The adsorption strength of *OCHO upon the solitary FeN 2 S 2 site is linearly related to the coordination number of Fe–S, with HCOOH predominantly produced over single-atom FeN 2 S 2 (ortho-substituted S atoms). Fe 4 S 4 cluster functions as a switch for a specific reduction product, which can not only optimize the spatial and electronic structure of the neighboring FeN 2 S 2 but also impel complete reduction of CO 2 to the hydrocarbon intermediate *CH 3 , followed by coupling of CO 2 * and *CH 3 via the single-atom cluster synergistic catalysis of Fe 4 S 4 /FeN 2 S 2 . This spatial confinement strategy provides a new avenue to modulate the reactant adsorption model for desirable reaction pathways, with potential applications in diverse multistep electrochemical processes of controlled selectivity.},

According to the classical Sabatier principle, optimal 3 d metal catalysts, such as Fe/Co–N–C, achieve superior catalytic performance due to the moderate binding strength. However, the substantial ORR activity demonstrated by weakly binding M–N–C catalysts such as Ni/Cu–N–C challenges current understandings, emphasizing the need to explore new underlying mechanisms. In this work, we integrated a pH-field coupled microkinetic model with detailed experimental electron state analyses to verify a novel key step in the ORR reaction pathway of weak-binding SACs─the oxygen adsorption at the metal–nitrogen bridge site. This step significantly altered the adsorption scaling relations, electric field responses, and solvation effects, further impacting the key kinetic reaction barrier from HOO * to O * and pH-dependent performance. Synchrotron spectra analysis further provides evidence for the new weak-binding M–N–C model, showing an increase in electron density on the antibonding π orbitals of N atoms in weak-binding M–N–C catalysts and confirming the presence of N–O bonds. These findings redefine the understanding of weak-binding M–N–C catalyst behavior, opening up new perspectives for their application in clean energy.},

  abstract     = {The electrochemical coupling of CO 2 and NO 3 – on copper-based catalysts presents a sustainable strategy for urea production while simultaneously addressing wastewater denitrification. However, the inefficient random adsorption of CO 2 and NO 3 – on the copper surface limits the interaction of the key carbon and nitrogen intermediates, thereby impeding efficient C–N coupling. In this study, we demonstrate that the residual lattice oxygen in oxide-derived copper nanosheets (O L -Cu) can effectively tune the electron distribution, thus activating neighboring copper atoms and generating electron-deficient copper (Cu δ+ ) sites. These Cu δ+ sites enhance CO 2 adsorption and stabilize *CO intermediates, which enables the directional NO 3 – adsorption at adjacent Cu δ+ sites. This mechanism shortens the C–N coupling pathway and achieves a urea yield of up to 298.67 mmol h –1 g –1 at −0.7 V versus RHE, with an average Faradaic efficiency of 31.71% at a high current density of ∼95 mA cm –2 . In situ spectroscopic measurements confirmed the formation of Cu δ+ sites and tracked the evolution of the key intermediates (i.e., *CO, *NO, *OCNO, and *NOCONO) during urea synthesis. Density functional theory calculations revealed that Cu δ+ sites promote adjacent coadsorption of *CO and *NO 3 , as well as *OCNO and *NO 3 , significantly improving C–N coupling kinetics. This study underscores the critical role of lattice oxygen in facilitating adjacent coadsorption and improving C–N coupling selectivity.},

  abstract     = {Despite the progress made in the field of synthetic organic photocatalysis over the past decade, the use of higher wavelengths, especially those in the deep-red portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, remains comparatively rare. We have previously disclosed that a well-defined N,C,N -pincer bismuthinidene ( 1a ) can undergo formal oxidative addition into a wide range of aryl electrophiles upon absorption of low-energy red light. In this study, we map out the photophysical dynamics of 1a and glean insights into the nature of the excited state responsible for the activation of aryl electrophiles. Transient absorption and emission techniques reveal that, upon irradiation with red light, the complex undergoes a direct S 0 → S 1 metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transition, followed by rapid intersystem crossing (ISC) to a highly reducing emissive triplet state (−2.61 V vs Fc +/0 in MeCN). The low dissipative losses incurred during ISC (∼6% of the incident light energy) help rationalize the ability of the bismuthinidene to convert low-energy light into useful chemical energy. Spectroelectrochemical and computational data support a charge-separated excited-state structure with radical-anion character on the ligand and radical-cation character on bismuth. Kinetic studies and competition experiments afford insights into the mechanism of oxidative addition into aryl iodides; concerted and inner-sphere processes from the triplet excited state are ruled out, with the data strongly supporting a pathway that proceeds via outer-sphere dissociative electron transfer.},

In this study, we benchmark our fast-charging electrolyte (FCE) against the commercial LP57 electrolyte to identify the EEI characteristics that enhance fast-charging performance. By utilizing the latest advances in time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) and focused-ion beam (FIB) techniques, we reveal the complex chemical architecture of the cathode–electrolyte interphase (CEI). Our findings indicate that stable battery operation under fast-charging conditions requires reduced surface reactivity rather than stabilizing the bulk integrity of the cathode. While inorganic species are often cited as beneficial for EEI composition, their distribution within the EEI is equally critical. Additionally, dynamic interactions between the cathode material and conductive carbon significantly affect CEI formation and alter the passivation layer chemistry. A chemically homogeneous distribution of CEI components passivating preferentially the active material particles is desired for enhanced performance. Notably, the amount of electrolyte decomposition species in the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) far outweighs their distribution within the SEI in determining better electrochemical performance. An inorganic-rich SEI effectively protects graphite particles, suppresses the accumulation of metallic lithium, and prevents the formation of lithium dendrites. Overall, an enhanced fast-charging performance can be achieved by tuning the interphase chemistry and architecture on both the cathode and anode sides.},

These mechanically labile crosslinkers have typically relied on release of ring strain or weak covalent bonds for selective covalent bond scission. Here, we report a novel chemical design for accelerated mechanochemical bond scission based on replacing a single carbon atom in a crosslinker with a silicon atom. This single-atom replacement affords up to a two-fold increase in the tearing energy. We suggest a mechanism, validated by computational modeling, for accelerated mechanochemical Si–C bond scission based on minimizing the energy required to distort the starting material toward the transition-state geometry. We demonstrated the seamless incorporation of these scissile carbosilanes to toughen 3D-printed networks, which demonstrates their suitability for additive manufacturing processes.},

  abstract     = {Developing efficient methods to improve catalytic selectivity, particularly without sacrificing catalytic activity, is of paramount significance for chemical synthesis. In this work, we report a small ligand-involved Pickering droplet interface as a brand-new strategy to effectively regulate reaction selectivity of metal catalysts. It was found that small ligands such as polar arenes could engineer the surface structure of Pt catalysts that were assembled at Pickering droplet interfaces. Due to the strong hydrogen-bonding interactions with water, the polar arenes preferentially adsorbed with the water adlayer that covered Pt surfaces, forming water-mediated metal–organic interfaces on the Pickering emulsion droplets. Such an interface system displayed a significantly enhanced p -vinylaniline selectivity from 8.7 to 94.2% with an unreduced conversion in p -nitrostyrene hydrogenation. The selectivity was found to follow a negatively linear correlation with the bond length of the interfacial hydrogen bonds. Theoretical calculations revealed that the small arene ligands could closely array at the interface, which modulated the adsorption patterns of reactant/product molecules to prevent the C═C group from approaching Pt surfaces without suppressing their accessibility toward reactant molecules. Such a remarkable interfacial steric effect contributed to the efficient control of the hydrogenation selectivity. Our work provides an innovative strategy to modulate the surface structure of metal catalysts, opening a new venue to tune catalytic selectivity.},

  abstract     = {Proton sandwiches are unusual nonclassical carbocations characterized by a five-center, four-electron bonding array which rapidly isomerize to lower energy isomers with three-center, two-electron bonding arrays via hydrogen migration transition states. These reactions are suspected to involve significant contributions from tunneling, even at relatively high temperatures, where tunneling effects are usually minimal. Machine-learning-accelerated ring-polymer, quasiclassical, and classical ab initio molecular dynamics simulations were used to investigate the effects of a flavor of dynamic matching that involves coupling of vibrational modes of the reactant to the transition structure mode with an imaginary frequency, and how quantum mechanical tunneling affects this coupling. These nonstatistical dynamic effects were quantified by analysis of momentum in the molecular dynamics simulations. We show the importance of momentum for reactivity with and without tunneling, how tunneling amplifies these benefits, and that vibrational modes can be leveraged to generate beneficial momentum.},

  abstract     = {Weakly solvating electrolytes (WSE) can favor reversible Na batteries at −40 °C for some extreme applications because of the low desolvation energy. However, it is challenging to enable reversible Na batteries at lower temperatures. Herein, we uncover that the low ionic conductivity of WSE reduces reaction kinetics at −60 °C. Accordingly, a highly conductive weakly solvating electrolyte (HCWSE) is designed by introducing additives of strongly solvating solvents and the dilution of NaPF 6 . The additive can dominate the solvation sheath, increase the dissociation of NaPF 6 and the fluidity of the electrolyte, and thus greatly improve the ionic conductivity. Furthermore, the binding energy between Na + and solvents is proposed as a descriptor to determine the solvating power of solvents, based on which a series of ultralow-temperature HCWSEs have been topologically designed by facilely introducing strong-solvation ether additives into the weak-solvation solvents. As a demonstration, the HCWSE showcases the long cycling of Na||Na cell at −60 °C with an overpotential of 42 mV under 1 mA cm –2 for 1200 h. The Na||NNFM (Na 0.75 Ni 0.25 Fe 0.25 Mn 0.5 O 2 ) cell exhibits a reversible capacity of 79.2 mAh g –1 after 160 cycles. The cells also achieve impressive performances at −70 °C.},

The “water-in-salt” design is a valid strategy to broaden the electrochemical stability window in aqueous electrolytes, but drawbacks such as high manufacturing cost, high electrolyte viscosity, etc., also hinder its development. Here, inspired by biological ion channels in cell membranes, we propose an effective approach to engineer the electrode surface, inducing the desolvation of hydrated ions at the electrochemical interface and inhibiting water decomposition in nonconcentrated electrolytes. The biological engineering strategy enables the induction of controlled desolvation and accelerates the transportation of hydrated ions, e.g., potassium. The subnanometer design (0.8 nm) forces the hydrated potassium ions to shed their solvation shell with a hydration number of only 0.3, while the electrostatic interactions between the pore groups and the potassium ions facilitate their transport. The Zn||Zn cells demonstrate a stable cycling lifespan of over 1000 h at 1 mA cm –2 /10 mAh cm –2 .

Here, we present the first total synthesis of this class of DMOA-derived meroterpenoids, specifically (+)-berkeleyacetal D and (+)-peniciacetal I. Our approach features a chemoselective deprotonation followed by an intramolecular single-electron transfer (SET) from an enolate to an alkyl bromide, enabling the construction of the 2,3-dihydrofuran ring in berkeleyacetal D. Additional selective transformations include an endo -selective intramolecular Diels–Alder reaction, chemoselective methylations and semihydrogenation of [3]dendralene, and a solvent-controlled diastereoselective epoxidation.

Herein, we employ 1 H NMR peak analysis of the aromatic and proton end group regions to characterize 2D-PA growth from monomeric precursors, alongside purification using two-stage filtration and washing steps. The ratio of aromatic to end group protons yields the molecular weight and discoidal size, while the skewness of the NMR peaks in the aromatic region provides a relative weighting between dendritic, small, and larger polycyclic domains. These two metrics delineate a distinct two-dimensional 1 H NMR trajectory that we show to be valuable for analyzing the results of differing synthetic and processing conditions. Theoretical bounds corresponding to dendrimer and polycyclic limits as a function of repeat unit size are derived as an aid in trajectory analysis. These results establish an analytical framework for evaluating 2D-PA and its variants, facilitating the exploration of the synthetic landscape.},

Here, we study epitaxial films on silicon of the Weyl altermagnet GdAlSi ranging from more than a hundred unit cells to a single unit cell. The films do not show any discernible net magnetic moments. Electron transport studies reveal a remarkable transformation. Thick films exhibit the chiral anomaly, whereas symmetry restrictions prevent observation of the anomalous Hall effect in our electron transport measurements. In ultrathin films, a spontaneous anomalous Hall effect manifests itself, indicating a nonrelativistic spin splitting. The transformation is associated with crystal symmetry breaking accompanying the 3D-to-2D crossover.

In this study, we investigate the ion-specific effects under electric fields on HIN efficiency using mica surfaces containing various cations. Our findings reveal that an upward electric field significantly boosts HIN of water droplets atop Na-mica surfaces, raising the nucleation temperature by approximately 6 °C. In contrast, mica surfaces with other cations or those exposed to a downward electric field show no change in nucleation temperature or HIN efficiency. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that Na + ions detach more easily from the mica surface under an electric field, exposing more of the flat mica lattice and thus possibly promoting ice nucleation. This study offers new insights into the ion-specific effects of electric fields on HIN, providing a deeper understanding of the role of cations and electric fields in ice nucleation processes.},

Expanding the use of exsolved nanoparticles in heterogeneous catalysis requires the development of low-temperature ( T &lt; 400 °C) exsolution processes. In this study, we report the synthesis of phase-pure ZnFe 2– x Rh x O 4 metal oxide precursors with a spinel-type crystal structure. The isomorphic substitution of Fe 3+ in the host lattice by Rh 3+ was confirmed by X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy combined with DFT calculations. The hydrothermal synthesis method of the oxide precursors was specifically chosen so that very small oxide particles of 10–20 nm were obtained, which enabled the exsolution of Rh nanoparticles with a particle size of about 1 to 2 nm at temperatures below 200 °C in a hydrogen-containing atmosphere. Compared to a Rh catalyst prepared by conventional wet impregnation of ZnFe 2 O 4 , the catalysts obtained by low-temperature exsolution show superior properties in terms of selectivity toward aldehydes in the hydroformylation of 1-hexene in the liquid phase. In addition, there is no Rh loss due to leaching, which is the main challenge for heterogeneous Rh catalysts used in liquid phase reactions. The exceptionally strong metal–support interaction imparts unique nanostructures and electronic properties to the exsolved metal nanoparticles, as revealed by electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy. The specific adsorption sites on the exsolved Rh particles lead to stronger metal–hydride and weaker metal–carbonyl bonds on the surface, steering the reaction pathway toward hydroformylation rather than olefin isomerization.},

However, the rectification ratio of π-conjugated single-molecule diodes has been long-term limited by the challenge of asymmetric electronic coupling to induce the rectification effect. Here, we present a supramolecular diode constructed through an intramolecular π–π interaction-driven assembly strategy. The asymmetric transmission in this system is tunable via subangström mechanical control, resulting in a rectification ratio of up to 16. Electron transport studies reveal that this through-space D-π–π–A system constructed by the π–π stacking between pyrene ( Py ) and naphthalenediimide ( NDI ) is crucial for achieving asymmetric currents under different bias polarization. Theoretical calculations suggest that the intermolecular destructive quantum interference not only enables a sharp variation in electron transmission but also facilitates asymmetric electronic energy shifts through mechanical stretching, significantly improving the rectification ratio. Our work provides a general approach to fabricating and modulating asymmetric molecular architectures through noncovalent supramolecular interactions, showcasing the potential of high-performance single-molecule rectifiers.},

Achieving the full set of stereoisomers of carbohydrate derivatives would significantly enhance the efficiency of building compound libraries for biological studies and drug discovery. However, the selective functionalization of seemingly identical hydroxyl groups in carbohydrates remains a long-standing challenge in organic chemistry. In carbohydrate synthesis, achieving precise control of both relative configurations in catalyst-controlled reactions that create a new stereocenter presents a significant synthetic challenge.

Nevertheless, LOR-induced local structure distortion and irreversible phase transitions cause serious electrochemical performance degradation, hindering practical applications. Herein, we propose that the generation of the OP4 phase can be replaced with the Z phase by introducing the Sb element with a higher ionic potential and strong covalent bonds within the TMO 6 octahedron. Z phase transition is realized by constraining interlayer slipping between adjacent transition metal (TM) layers compared to OP4, which reduces the strain in the layered structure, lowers the Na + diffusion energy barrier, and creates more efficient Na + diffusion channels.

Owing to its unique photophysical properties, it effectively catalyzed the etherification and amination of aryl bromides under 620–630 nm light irradiation, functioning as both a photocatalyst and an active metal catalyst. Mechanistic studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations further confirmed the exceptional absorption properties of Ni(0)(DQ)dtbbpy in the red-light region, as well as the electron transfer process triggered by red-light irradiation.},

Here, we report the first visible-light-driven gold-catalyzed cross-couplings of challenging aryl bromides. In the presence of a (P, N)-gold(I) catalyst and an acridinium photocatalyst under blue LED irradiation, C–O coupling of aryl bromides with carboxylic acids was achieved, and soon it was found that this photoinduced gold-catalyzed cross-coupling of aryl bromides was appliable for other C–C, C–N, and C–S bond formation. Experimental and computational studies suggest that this visible-light-driven gold-catalyzed cross-couplings of aryl bromides involves two discrete photoinduced energy transfer (EnT) events: first, energy transfer (EnT) from a photosensitizer produces an excited-state gold(I) complex that allows the bottleneck oxidative addition of aryl bromides to form an aryl Au(III) complex and second, the reductive elimination of aryl-Au(III) complex to regenerate Au(I). Collectively, the new synergistic catalytic method developed here highlights the tremendous potential of photochemical gold catalysis via excited-state organogold complexes, as well as its potential to facilitate drug discovery due to the biocompatibility and mildness of the reaction conditions.},

While the impact of oxidative stress on protein integrity is well-established, the protective role of sialylation against such damage remains poorly understood. This study employs a microscale low-temperature plasma device to generate a controlled, deep radical oxidation environment mimicking cellular oxidative stress. By subjecting free sialic acids (Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc) to time-resolved deep radical exposure, high-resolution mass spectrometry, and high-fidelity density functional theory calculations, we establish an unprecedented oxidation pathway, revealing unique stepwise side chain oxidation prior to ring opening. Comprehensive radical oxidation maps comprising over 100 oxidative intermediates provide a molecular basis for the higher propensity of Neu5Gc over Neu5Ac in resisting radical oxidation. Further, using human transferrin as a model glycoprotein, we demonstrate the protective role of sialylation against oxidative unfolding. Through a combination of site mapping, enzymatic treatments, and all-ion unfolding ion mobility-mass spectrometry, we identify specific protein sialylation patterns and structural motifs that are crucial for maintaining structural stability under oxidative stress. Our findings provide unprecedented insights into the intricate interplay between sialylation and oxidative stress, highlighting the importance of sialylation in stabilizing protein conformations under various oxidative stresses.},

Under real reaction conditions, CoPc undergoes reversible angle distortion while maintaining a constant metal–ligand bond length, causing changes in the energy levels of split d orbitals and electron density of molecular orbitals. The angle distortion further influences intrinsic interactions among the ligands, intermediates, and metal centers. The reversible change in the bond angle with the CO Faraday efficiency was also determined, demonstrating the robustness. The demonstrated findings serve as an important contribution to determine the structure–performance relationship of CoPc which enlightens the further rational design of atomically dispersed site catalysts with high activity and to emphasize the capabilities of the high energy resolution X-ray spectroscopy toward analyzing metal–implanted N-doped carbon catalysts.},

  abstract     = {The formation of 1,2- trans -glycosides taking advantage of neighboring group participation by stereodirecting esters at the 2-position of glycosyl donors is widely held to be a robust and reliable protocol. Examples abound, however, of cases in which less-than-perfect selectivity is obtained, causing practitioners to survey different esters or resort to alternative strategies in the quest for optimal selectivities and yields. Consideration of the mechanism of neighboring group participation and in particular of the competing process of S N 2-like glycosylation with activated covalent donors leads to the hypothesis that in cases of imperfect selectivity, more careful attention to reaction concentration and stoichiometry may be beneficial. Three case studies are presented to demonstrate the concentration dependence of neighboring group-directed glycosylation reactions targeting the formation of both 1,2- trans -equatorial and 1,2- trans -axial glycosides. Higher concentrations, whether achieved through increased acceptor:donor stoichiometry or through increased concentration at a fixed stoichiometry, mostly lead to erosion of 1,2- trans -selectivity as the competing S N 2-like reaction with the covalent donors becomes increasingly important. These observations underline the importance of a rational, mechanism-based approach to glycosylation in general and more importantly suggest a simple approach to enhancing 1,2- trans -selectivity in neighboring group-directed glycosylation reactions displaying less-than-perfect 1,2- trans -selectivity, namely, moving to a different concentration regime.},

The key M-H/M-D species for alkene reduction were generated from the electrolysis of H 2 O/D 2 O on modified electrodes, which avoided the usage of H 2 and D 2 . Mono-, di-, tri-, and tetra-substituted alkenes were successfully reduced in this electrocatalytic system using H 2 O and D 2 O as hydrogen and deuterium sources. Electron-donating/-withdrawing alkenes, alkenes with other easily reducible functional groups, and complicated natural products and drugs were all reductive hydrogenated and deuterated with excellent yields (85 examples, yields up to 99%).

  abstract     = {In nature, oxidizing metalloenzymes usually bind O 2 in the form of peroxo intermediates that frequently requires for activation a further protonation, for which the formation of hydroperoxo species is proposed. In dinuclear metalloenzymes, which typically feature Fe, Mn, and Cu, structures and electrophilic reactivity of peroxo, superoxo, and hydroperoxo intermediates are generally difficult to study due to their reactive and transient nature, which is why more stable peroxo Co III Co III complexes might be helpful models. Here, we present the molecular structures of a series of μ-1,2-peroxo, μ-1,2-superoxo, and μ-1,1-hydroperoxo Co III Co III complexes and the variation of their electrophilic hydrogen-atom-transfer (HAT) and oxygen-atom-transfer (OAT) reactivity. The μ-1,2-peroxo complex exhibits no electrophilic reactivity, whereas oxidation to the μ-1,2-superoxo complex activates electrophilic HAT reactivity, while protonation to the μ-1,1-hydroperoxo complex activates electrophilic OAT reactivity. The latter occurs by an associated mechanism with the μ-1,1-hydroperoxo ligand being the electrophilic OAT agent. Protonation to the μ-1,1-hydroperoxo elongates the O–O bond, while oxidation to the μ-1,2-superoxo shortens it relative to the μ-1,2-peroxo. The protonation of the μ-1,2-peroxo complex could be made accessible by the introduction of remote electron-donating substituents into a recently reported μ-1,2-peroxo Co III Co III complex that increases the μ-1,2-peroxo basicity by more than five p K a units. Hence, the initially counterintuitive increase of electron donation by the ligand environment increases the μ-1,2-peroxo basicity allowing its protonation to a more electrophilic μ-1,1-hydroperoxo ligand. More generally, HAT and OAT reactivity is correlated with accessibility of the following intermediate.},

  abstract     = {The unique properties of fluorinated organic compounds have received intense interest and have conquered a myriad of applications in the chemical and pharmaceutical sciences. Today, an impressive range of alkyl fluorides are commercially available, and there are many practical methods to make them exist. However, the unmatched stability and inertness of the C–F bond have largely limited its synthetic value, which is very different from the widely accepted utility of alkyl chlorides, bromides, and iodides that serve everyday as “workhorse” building blocks in countless carbon–carbon bond forming reactions. This study demonstrates practical and high-yielding functionalization of the C–F bond under mild conditions, i.e., at temperatures as low as −78 °C, in short reaction times and with unconventional chemoselectivity. Cryogenic Csp 3 –F bond cleavage using fluorophilic organoaluminum compounds together with fast nucleophile transfer of intermediate ate complexes forge carbon–carbon bonds with unactivated primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl fluorides alike. This method, which exploits the stability of the Al–F bond as the thermodynamic driving force, is highly selective toward Csp 3 –F bond functionalization, whereas many other functional groups including alkyl chloride, bromide, iodide, aryl halide, alkenyl, alkynyl, difluoroalkyl, trifluoromethyl, ether, ester, hydroxyl, acetal, heteroaryl, nitrile, nitro, and amide groups are tolerated, which is an unexpected reversal of long-standing main group organometallic and alkyl halide cross-coupling reactivity and compatibility patterns. As a result, the strongest single bond in organic chemistry can now be selectively targeted in high-yielding arylation, alkylation, alkenylation, and alkynylation reactions and used in late-stage functionalization applications that are complementary to currently available methods.},

Our DNA-based dimerization network consists of DNA oligonucleotide monomers modified with reactive moieties that can covalently bond with each other to form dimer outputs in an all-to-all or many-to-many fashion. By designing DNA-based input strands that can specifically sequester DNA monomers, we can control the size of the reaction network and thus fine-tune the yield of each DNA dimer output in a predictable manner. Thanks to the programmability and specificity of DNA–DNA interactions, we show that this approach can be used to control the yield of different dimer outputs using different inputs. The approach is also versatile and we demonstrate dimerization networks based on two distinct covalent reactions: thiol–disulfide and strain-promoted azide–alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) reactions. Finally, we show here that the DNA-based dimerization network can be used to control the yield of a functional dimer output, ultimately controlling the assembly and disassembly of DNA nanostructures. The covalent dynamic DNA networks shown here provide a way to convert multiple inputs into programmable outputs that can control a broader range of functions, including ones that mimic those of living cells.},

While the edges of elemental TMDC nanoparticles, such as MoS 2 , can show significant catalytic activity, the basal plane of the pristine materials is notoriously inert, which limits their normalized activity. Here, we show that high densities of catalytically active sites can be formed on the TMDC basal plane by alloying elements that prefer the 2H (1T) phase into a 1T (2H) structure. The global stability of the alloy, in particular, whether it crystallizes in the 2H or 1T phase, can be controlled by ensuring a majority of elements prefer the target phase. We further show that the mixing entropy plays a decisive role in stabilizing the alloy, implying that high-entropy alloying becomes essential. Our calculations point to a number of interesting nonprecious hydrogen evolution catalysts, including (CrTaVHfZr)S 2 and (CrNbVTiZr)S 2 in the 1T-phase and (MoNbTaVTi)S 2 in the 2H-phase. Our work opens new directions for designing catalytic sites via high-entropy alloy stabilization of locally unstable structures.},

  abstract     = {Chiral 1,4-dihydroquinolines are frequently found in natural products and pharmaceuticals, yet a generally useful route for their synthesis remains elusive. Here, we present an asymmetric partial hydrogenation strategy to access enantioenriched 1,4-dihydroquinolines from quinolines. Our strategy involves incorporating an ester group at position 3 of the quinoline ring, thereby enhancing the electronic deficiency and polarity of the C3–C4 double bond. Employing a chiral Ir-SpiroPAP catalyst facilitated the hydrogenation of a wide variety of 4-substituted 3-ethoxycarbonylquinolines, yielding chiral 1,4-dihydroquinolines in high yields (up to 95%) with exceptional enantioselectivity and efficiency (up to 99% ee and 1840 TONs). Noteworthy for its scalability and practicality, the method provides a robust avenue for the synthesis of valuable compounds such as 9-aryl aza-podophyllotoxins and melatonin MT 2 receptor modulators. Density functional theory calculations were performed to gain insights into the reaction mechanism and the origins of the enantioselectivity.},

  abstract     = {Intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDRs) are structurally dynamic yet functional, often interacting with other proteins through short linear motifs (SLiMs). Proline residues in IDRs introduce conformational heterogeneity on a uniquely slow time scale arising from cis / trans isomerization of the Xaa-Pro peptide bond. Here, we explore the role of proline isomerization in the interaction between the prolactin receptor (PRLR) and 14–3–3. Using NMR spectroscopy, thermodynamic profiling, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we uncover a unique proline isomer-dependent binding, with a cis conformation affinity 3 orders of magnitude higher than the trans . MD simulations identify structural constraints in the narrow 14–3–3 binding groove that provide an explanation for the observed isomer selectivity. The cis preference of WT PRLR introduces a slow kinetic component relevant to signal propagation and a steric component that impacts chain direction. Proline isomerization constitutes a previously unrecognized selective component relevant to the ubiquitous 14–3–3 interactome. Given the prevalence of prolines in IDRs and SLiMs, our study highlights the importance of considering the distinct properties of proline isomers in experimental design and data interpretation to fully comprehend IDR functionality.},

Here, we demonstrate that high-flux argon ion (Ar + ) irradiation above recrystallization temperatures generated well-defined coordinatively unsaturated Zn (CUZ) sites on ZnO(101̅0) surfaces that exhibited enhanced stability and activity for CO hydrogenation. Combining low-temperature scanning probe microscopy, ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and surface–ligand infrared spectroscopy with density functional theory calculations, we identified &lt;12̅10&gt; step edges exposing CUZ sites as the dominant active sites. These sites facilitate hydrogen-assisted CO dissociation through a mechanism distinct from formate-mediated pathways on stoichiometric ZnO. The ion-irradiation approach effectively addressed instability of Zn species, a major problem in ZnO catalysis, enabling stable performance in syngas conversion when combined with zeolites. Our atomic scale investigation provided spectroscopic fingerprints for active sites on the ZnO catalyst and insights into the structure–activity relationships of ZnO for CO hydrogenation. Our approach for engineering thermally stable defect sites in oxide catalysts provided opportunities for rational catalyst design beyond traditional preparation methods.},

Synchrotron X-ray single-crystal diffraction unambiguously determined that the newfound β-NaYbO 2 belongs to the three-dimensional pyrochlore structure characterized by the R 3̅ m space group, corroborated by synchrotron X-ray and neutron powder diffraction and pair distribution function. Magnetic measurements revealed no long-range magnetic order or spin glass behavior down to 0.4 K with a low boundary spin frustration factor of 17.5, suggesting a potential QSL ground state. Under high magnetic fields, the potential QSL state was broken and spins order. Our findings reveal that NaYbO 2 is a fertile playground for studying novel quantum states.},

This study focuses on α,β-unsaturated carbonyls, particularly acrolein-derived protein modifications, unveiling a one-pot, four-step, selective chemistry that results in the formation of a heterocyclic α,β-unsaturated carbonyl, termed 3-formyl-3,4-dehydropiperidino (FDP), exclusively on lysine residues. Remarkably, this chemistry transforms lysine, a nucleophile, into an electrophilic warhead. We demonstrate its versatility in late-stage peptide diversification, precision protein engineering, and homogeneous protein labeling with diverse payloads. Additionally, FDP-lysine smoothly transforms into another heterocycle, 3-methylpyridinium (3-MP) lysine via deoxygenation and aromatization in reagentless conditions. This transformation facilitates late-stage peptide functionalization and homogeneous engineering of proteins, with MP-lysine acting as a mass booster. Leveraging this chemistry, we discovered hyperreactive sites responsible for acrolein-induced modification through chemoproteomic profiling of FDP- and MP-modified proteins. Our findings revealed changes in protein–protein interactions mediated by FDP-modified proteins and uncovered ∼1548 novel cross-linking partners of an FDP-modified protein.},

  abstract     = {Crystal and conformational polymorphisms play crucial roles in the physical and chemical properties of materials, impacting their stability, solubility, and bioavailability, which are essential for various applications in pharmaceuticals, materials science, and chemistry. Despite their significance, the structural analysis of these polymorphisms, particularly conformational polymorphisms, remains challenging due to the limited methodology that provides sufficient resolution for microcrystalline variants of polymorphs. Three-dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED) is an emerging technique with significant potential for elucidating the microcrystal structures of functional organic molecules, pharmaceuticals, and biomolecules. Despite this potential, there are limited instances of 3D ED structures for small molecules exhibiting the lowest crystallographic symmetry with a preferred orientation and possibly conformational variations of constituent molecules. A novel organic semiconductor, Ph-anti-benzothieno[5,6- b ]benzothieno[3,2- b ]thiophene-C10 (antiC10), is one of such examples. We successfully determined the 3D ED structure of this challenging molecule. The antiC10 crystal exhibited the lowest symmetry (space group P 1), and the preferred orientations against the grid resulted in a missing cone. These challenges were surmounted by employing a sequential molecular replacement approach with an ab initio -generated search model. The resulting octameric antiC10 structure reveals a two-monolayer architecture and an antiparallel alkyl-interdigitated herringbone configuration in contrast to the all-parallel associations observed in its previously reported isomer. Concurrently, the alkyl chains are intricately interdigitated with each other and positioned between the adjacent π-core strata. Detailed analysis has elucidated the conformational polymorphism in herringbone packing between the two monolayers as well as in intramolecular conformations among monomers. The structure with conformational polymorphism is presumably in a metastable intermediate state, stabilized by twinning. These findings may provide critical insights into the crystallization mechanisms and rational design of organic semiconductors. This research demonstrates that advancements in 3D ED technology and sequential phasing methodologies have enabled the study of previously unreachable structures.},

  abstract     = {The quantum spin-liquid state was first theorized by Anderson 50 years ago and the challenge remains to realize a quantum spin-liquid material. A handful of two-dimensional molecular candidates have attracted huge attention over the past 30 years owing to their triangular lattice possessing S = 1/2 spin systems. We present a new quantum spin-liquid candidate in 2D Mott insulator κ-(BEDT-TTF) 2 [B R / S (salicylate)] 2 . The structure has a double-width anion layer giving it a strong 2D character. The spiroborate anion is chiral and the salt is an inversion twin, having no inversion symmetry center and crystallizing in space group P 2 1 . This offers the possibility of novel behavior owing to the low symmetry not previously seen in molecular spin-liquid candidates. The peak height of the 6K anomaly of κ-(BEDT-TTF) 2 [B R / S (salicylate) 2 ] is 2 or 3 times larger than that of κ-(BEDT-TTF) 2 Cu 2 (CN) 3 and EtMe 3 Sb[Pd(dmit) 2 ] 2 . The structure presents many opportunities for crystal engineering through atom-by-atom changes to the ligands on the spiroborate anion to produce a family of materials which lie in and around the QSL region of the phase diagram for these salts. This gives the prospect of an experimental playground to deepen understanding of the QSL state. Electrical resistivity, SQUID magnetometry, band calculations, heat capacity, Infrared and Raman spectroscopy are reported for κ-(BEDT-TTF) 2 [B R / S (salicylate) 2 ].},

During α-polymerization, heat from the exothermic reaction and pressure induced by the growing polymer chains on the catalyst particle lead to fragmentation, revealing active sites for further polymerization. To study these phenomena precisely and in-depth, we utilized a Nd-doped LaOCl-supported metallocene model system. This model catalyst can accurately display fluctuations in temperature with luminescence thermometry. During mild gas phase prepolymerization conditions, we observed a temperature difference of +43 °C and link this to the exothermicity of the ethylene polymerization reaction. In addition, the fragmentation behavior of the model catalyst was accurately monitored. The shell feature of the catalyst ruptured layer-by-layer, while the inner core fragmented via a bisectional fragmentation mechanism. We demonstrated that it is possible to probe the individual temperatures of multiple catalyst support particles within the field-of-view of the probe. This was correlated to structural changes and kinetics in an α-olefin polymerization catalyst. This powerful toolbox could be applied to different heterogeneous catalytic systems to correlate the temperature profile with morphological evolution.},

For pathogenic fungi, the cell wall is also the initial point of contact with the host. Specific cell wall features such as hypha tails and smaller glycan components modulate a wide range of fungal interactions with the immune defenses. Here, a bio-orthogonal labeling method utilizing N -acetyl-glucosamine (NAG) probes is developed to fluorescently label native, pathogenic yeast via the chitin scavenging pathway. A panel of NAG probes was assembled, synthesized, and characterized for the ability to label the chitin in pathogenic yeast. Enzymatic data show that the native scavenging biosynthetic enzyme, Hxk1, is promiscuous, permitting the labeling of the native chitin biopolymer. This chitin labeling method was validated via the development of mass spectrometry protocols. When compared to the current available labeling systems for chitin, the probes do not affect the integrity of the cell wall and do not interrupt cell growth. Furthermore, the NAG probes enabled multiple “click” platforms across pathogenic Candida species including Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis . Budding and filamentous hyphal states were observed. The results indicate the probes’ utility for in vivo study of the morphological, pathogenic switch, and visualization of growth patterns. Thus, the use of these probes in pathogenic Candida strains is ideal for a variety of future applications including strain specific antifungals, diagnostic tools, and immunomodulators.},

They can be used to prepare robust self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) for a variety of applications, including as small-molecule inhibitors (SMIs) for metal surfaces in the fabrication of next-generation integrated circuits with angstrom precision. However, little work has been performed to assess the effect of structural and electronic modifications to the basic NHC structure. Herein, we report the design and deposition of a series of 1,2,3-triazolylidene (Tz)-type carbenes on gold (Au) and Au/SiO 2 patterned substrates. Triazolylidenes are an important class of stable carbenes that can be prepared with ease by using click chemistry. In this work, we studied the selective deposition of 1,2,3-triazolium hydrogen carbonate salts. The thermal properties of these precursors were measured and shown to be appropriate for either solution or vapor phase deposition. Tz-SAM stability was studied by time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) of Tz SAMs before and after exposure to various conditions, leading to the conclusion that Tz SAMs have thermal stabilities greater than that of NHC SAMs reported to date. Tz SAMs were analyzed by using X-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, UPS) and contact angle measurements. High selectivity for deposition on metal regions over dielectric regions on patterned Au/SiO 2 substrates enabled the use of Tzs as an entirely new class of SMIs on preventing ZnO deposition, providing considerable potential utility in microelectronics fabrication methods. Structure–property relationships were studied and provided key insight into the effectiveness of the SAM as a blocking agent.},

All methods confirmed a singlet ground state for the WR metallocarbene, which is stabilized by π interactions with the carboxyl substituent, thus complementing computational and transient spectroscopy studies for classic organic WR reactions.},

  abstract     = {The stereocontrolled C(sp 3 )–C(sp 3 ) cross-coupling represents a considerable challenge of great contemporary interest. While this has been achieved through the reactions of boronate complexes with π-allyl iridium complexes, such reactions suffered from a limited substrate scope. We now report that following transmetalation from boronate complexes to organozinc reagents enables previously unreactive substrates to engage in stereocontrolled C(sp 3 )–C(sp 3 ) cross-coupling. The broader substrate scope has enabled their application to the synthesis of biologically active molecules. The organozinc reagents react through a stereoinvertive coupling pathway with π-allyl iridium complexes, in contrast to reactions with other electrophiles that occur with retention of stereochemistry. The reaction uniquely combines the enantiospecific reactivity of an enantioenriched organometallic nucleophile with the enantioselective engagement of a racemic electrophile, enabling access to all stereoisomers.},

To deepen our understanding of the roles of various sulfated glycoforms and their relevant binding proteins, we must expand our enzymatic toolkit for their synthesis. Here, we bypass the need for both sulfotransferases and glycosyltransferases by engineering a series of mutants of a 6-SulfoGlcNAcase, from Streptococcus pneumoniae , to directly and efficiently synthesize not only the ubiquitous 6S-GlcNAc-β-1,3-Gal linkage prevalent within host glycans, but also the 6S-GlcNAc-β-1,6-GalNAc commonly observed within core-6 O-glycans, and the more exotic 6S-GlcNAc-β-1,4-GalNAc linkage. We further elaborate these into complex sulfated N-glycan and O-glycan structures of biological relevance. By utilizing the cost-effective activated donor pNP-6S-GlcNAc in conjunction with mutant GH185 6-SulfoGlcNAcases we demonstrate a simple yet powerful in vitro method for generating well-defined sulfated oligosaccharides and glycoforms for use in a variety of applications including glycan arrays, glycan remodeling, and specificity studies with carbohydrate binding proteins such as lectins.},

  abstract     = {Strategic design of solid-state proton-conducting electrolytes for application in anhydrous proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) has gained burgeoning interest due to a spectrum of advantageous features, including higher CO tolerance and ease in the water management systems. Toward this direction, crystalline materials like metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs), hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs), and polyoxometalates (POMs) are emerging PEM materials, offering strategic structural engineering through crystallography, thus enabling ultrahigh anhydrous proton conductivity up to 10 –2 –10 –1 S/cm. This Perspective highlights significant progress achieved thus far with such crystalline platforms in the domain of anhydrous proton conduction across a wide temperature window (sub-zero to above 100 °C). Based on their structural backgrounds, these platforms are categorized into four classes (viz. MOFs, COFs, HOFs, and POMs) with a detailed evolutionary timeline since their emergence early in 2009. Insightful discussions with a key focus on the strategies undertaken to attain anhydrous proton conductivity along with implementation in fuel cell technology through membrane electrode assembly are presented. A section on “Critical Analysis and Future Prospects” provides decisive key viewpoints on those overlooked issues with future endorsement (e.g., performance assessment with CO tolerance analysis and fuel cell test stand) for further development while comparing them with other anhydrous platforms from both academic and industrial perspectives.},

We discover distinct kinetic fingerprints between the iron triad (Fe, Ni, Co), coinage (Au, Cu, Ag), and platinum group metals (Ir, Pt, Pd, Rh). Importantly, the applied bias changes not only the activation energy ( E A ) but also the pre-exponential factor ( A ). We interpret these changes as entropic changes in the interfacial solvent that differ between acid and base and entropic changes on the surface due to a changing hydrogen coverage. Finally, we observe that anions can induce Butler–Volmer behavior for the coinage metals in acid. Our results provide a new foundation to understand HER kinetics and, more broadly, highlight the pressing need to update common understanding of basic concepts in the field of electrocatalysis.},

In recent years, the discovery of a charge density wave (CDW) in the AV 3 Sb 5 superconductors and structurally-derived bond density waves (BDW) in FeGe and ScV 6 Sn 6 have stoked the search for new kagome platforms broadly exhibiting density wave (DW) transitions. In this work, we evaluate the known AM 6 X 6 chemistries and construct a stability diagram that summarizes the structural relationships among the &gt;125 member family. Subsequently, we introduce our discovery of the broader Ln Nb 6 Sn 6 ( Ln :Ce–Nd,Sm,Gd–Tm,Lu,Y) family of kagome metals and an analogous DW transition in LuNb 6 Sn 6 . Our X-ray scattering measurements clearly indicate a (1/3, 1/3, 1/3) ordering wave vector ( √ 3 × √ 3 × 3 3×3×3 superlattice) and diffuse scattering on half-integer L -planes. Our analysis of the structural data supports the “rattling mode” DW model proposed for ScV 6 Sn 6 and paints a detailed picture of the steric interactions between the rare-earth filler element and the host Nb–Sn kagome scaffolding. We also provide a broad survey of the magnetic properties within the HfFe 6 Ge 6 -type Ln Nb 6 Sn 6 members, revealing a number of complex antiferromagnetic and metamagnetic transitions throughout the family. This work integrates our new Ln Nb 6 Sn 6 series of compounds into the broader AM 6 X 6 family, providing new material platforms and forging a new route forward at the frontier of kagome metal research.},

Addressing this challenge, our study utilized quantum chemical calculations and structure–property relationship analysis to establish an iterative design approach and enable precision engineering for compact, single-benzene-based NIR fluorophores. These newly developed fluorophores exhibit emissions up to 759 nm and maintain molecular weights as low as 192 g/mol, approximately 50% of that of Cy7. Additionally, they display unique environmental sensitivity─nonemissive in aqueous solutions but highly emissive in lipid environments. This property significantly enhances their utility in wash-free imaging of live cells. Our findings mark a substantial breakthrough in fluorophore engineering, paving the way for more efficient and adaptable imaging methodologies.},

  abstract     = {Continuous pressure to shorten synthetic sequences along with the concomitant expansion of scope makes the use of alkyl bromides, chlorides, and oxygen based leaving groups- which are abundant and readily available feedstocks, highly attractive for C–C bond synthesis. However, selective activation of these bonds to generate radical intermediates remains challenging and is generally unfeasible using traditional activation strategies. Herein, we report a dual catalytic activation strategy to access primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl radicals from respective alkyl chlorides and bromides, as well as primary tosylates and trifluoroacetates. While the method relies on visible light and a photocatalyst to facilitate electron transfer, based on reduction potentials, the substrates are not expected to be reduceable, and yet they are reduced in the presence of lutidine. Ultimately, our investigation revealed that lutidine was a precatalyst and ultimately led to the use of lutidinium iodide salt which served as a critical cocatalyst that resulted in improved reaction profiles. Our studies revealed two critical roles that lutidinium iodide salts play which made it possible to engage otherwise unreactive substrates: nucleophilic exchange and halogen atom transfer by the lutidinium radical. In short, this work converts unactivated alkyl chlorides, bromides, tosylates, and trifluoroacetates to radicals that can be used for C–C bond formation without the need for preactivation─effectively expediting synthesis},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) platelet structures with uniform dimensions and spatially defined diverse cores are highly sought but are still challenging to access. Living crystallization-driven self-assembly (CDSA)-seeded growth enables the creation of uniform 2D core–shell nanomaterials with diverse core compositions via sequential epitaxial crystallization of block copolymers. Nevertheless, general limitation of the growth process to strict requirements of heteroepitaxial crystallization is a major obstacle to the formation of segmented nanoparticles with extended diverse core chemistries. Herein, we introduce a strategy of using double-crystalline triblock copolymers, such as poly(ε-caprolactone)- block -poly( p -dioxanone)- block -poly( N,N -dimethyl acrylamide) (PCL- b -PPDO- b -PDMA), as bridges to create segmented platelets with compositionally distinct cores. The epitaxial crystallization of the PCL block excludes the PPDO block, forming out-of-plane PPDO crystals that seed subsequent epitaxial crystallization of the added PPDO unimer, producing flat-on quasi-square PPDO crystals. Meanwhile, the less-defined orientation of PPDO crystals has confirmed the presence of flat-on epitaxy between PCL and PPDO. For comparison, PCL- b -PHL (PHL = poly(ζ-heptalactone)) forms in-plane crystals with a strictly defined orientation via edge-on epitaxy due to the cocrystallization of PCL and PHL. Therefore, this approach provides a novel route to construct precisely controlled segmented 2D platelet structures with chemically distinct cores and tunable functionalities, an extension to expand the precise design of complex nanoparticles.},

To counter that lack of specificity, we expanded tumor targeting capabilities with universal CAR and spatially defined CAR T cell engagement with targets through a combination of synthetic biology and biomaterial approaches. We developed a novel framework, called “ In situ Mobilization: Polymer Activated Cell Therapies” (IMPACT) for polymer-mediated, anatomical control of IF-THEN gated CAR T cells. With IMPACT, a regulated payload such as a BiTE or tumor-targeting CAR will only be expressed after engineered cells engage a tumor-localizing polymer (“IF” condition). In this first demonstration of IMPACT, we engineered CAR T cells to respond to fluorescein that is displayed by an injectable polymer that binds to and is retained in fibrin deposits in tumor microenvironments. This interaction then drives selective and conditional expression of a protein within tumors (“THEN” condition). Here, we develop the polymer and CAR T cell infrastructure of IMPACT and demonstrate tumor-localized CAR T cell activation in a murine tumor model after the intravenous administration of polymer and engineered T cells.},

  abstract     = {Organic cathode materials for aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) have garnered significant attention due to their environmental friendliness and structurally customizable nature. However, the low voltage, sluggish redox kinetics, and high solubility of most n-type cathode materials hinder their wide deployment. To overcome these challenges, through molecular evolution, we rationally select a cheap industrial material, organodisulfide 2,2′-dithiobis (benzothiazole) (MBTS), as an n-type cathode material for AZIBs. Due to the presence of N-containing benzothiazole rings, the dissociation energy of the sulfur−sulfur (S–S) bond is reduced, substantially enhancing the discharge voltage and improving the reaction kinetics. They regulate the π-conjugated plane to achieve a low solubility and fast charge transfer. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidate the synergistic effect between adjacent active sites and Zn 2+ storage reactions, revealing that the formation of weak coordination bonds between N and Zn atoms (N–Zn–S bond) reduces the solubility of the discharge product. Molecular evolution has led to the fast reaction kinetics of zinc ion storage, thus achieving a high performance under high mass loading. At a current density of 0.05 A g –1 , MBTS exhibits an average discharge voltage of 1.02 V, with a mere overpotential of 100 mV, and delivers a high specific capacity of 153.6 mAh g –1 . The assembled pouch cell demonstrates an excellent rate capability of 124.4 mAh g –1 at 1 A g –1 and displays a stable cycle life after 200 cycles with 96.8% capacity retention. Remarkably, MBTS maintains high specific capacity and favorable cycle stability under various ultrahigh loadings, up to 18.2 mg cm –2 . The findings provide substantial guidance for practical applications of organic electrode materials in AZIBs.},

  abstract     = {Current synthetic transformations occur readily with starting materials that possess both innate reactivity and steric accessibility or functional-group-oriented reactivity. However, achieving reactions with inactive feedstock substrates remains significantly challenging and normally requires cumbersome prior functional group manipulations. Herein, we report an unprecedented example of catalytic asymmetric 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of azomethine ylides with nonactivated alkenes enabled by copper/ruthenium relay catalysis. Key to the success is the temporary activation strategy initiated by oxidative dehydrogenation of inert allylic alcohols into electron-demanding reversed highly reactive enones, which triggers the ensuing Cu-catalyzed asymmetric 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition followed by reductive hydrogenation to deliver highly functionalized chiral pyrrolidines with the construction of two C–C bonds and four well-defined stereogenic centers in an atom-/step-economical and redox-neutral manner. This method features mild reaction conditions, operational simplicity, and broad substrate scope and is also characterized by formal dynamic kinetic resolution. Mechanistic studies and control experiments supported a typical borrowing-hydrogen cascade orthogonally merged with 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition and revealed that the superiority and reliability of relay catalysis are enabled by the controlled release of highly reactive but unstable enones to impede the undesired polymerization. It should be noted that up to four stereoisomers of the challenging and otherwise inaccessible pyrrolidines and cyclobutanes could be readily prepared through concise late-stage elaborations.},

Molecular metal hydrides have the distinct advantage of allowing tunability of their hydricities by rational ligand modifications, with more electron-rich metal hydrides being in general more hydridic. We report here a new approach to generate highly hydridic metal hydrides of the type [Ru(tpy)(LL)(H)] n + by introducing electron-withdrawing substituents into the backbone of the bidentate LL ligand. This strategy enables the generation of the metal hydride [Ru(tpy)(LL)(H)] + at mild negative potentials and further one-electron reduction to the more hydridic [Ru(tpy)(LL)(H)] 0 at a potential window that is redox silent for the more electron-rich metal hydride analogue [Ru(tpy)(bpy)(H)] + . In addition, formate release takes place from the hydride transfer adducts [Ru---HCOO)(tpy)(LL)] 0 rather than from the corresponding formato complexes [Ru(tpy)(LL)(OCHO)] 0 , which would require further reduction to [Ru(tpy)(LL)(OCHO)] − as demonstrated by IR spectroelectrochemistry. The parent [Ru(tpy)(LL)(CH 3 CN)] n + solvento complexes were then tested as catalysts for the reduction of CO 2 to formate in a four-component homogeneous photochemical approach driven by a Ru(II) sensitizer. The results showed selective (&gt;88%) formate production with a record turnover number of ∼50,000 and record turnover frequency of 4.4 s –1 when compared to other molecular catalysts.},

  abstract     = {Proteins are subject to aging in the form of spontaneous, nonenzymatic post-translational modifications (PTMs). One such PTM is the formation of the β-linked isomer l -isoaspartic acid (isoAsp) from aspartic acid (Asp) or asparagine residues, which tends to occur in long-lived proteins. Histones can exhibit half-lives on the order of 100 days, and unsurprisingly, isoAsp formation has been observed in nearly every histone family. Delineating the molecular consequences of isoAsp formation in histones is challenging due to the multitude of processes that occur on such time scales. To isolate the effects of a specific isoAsp modification thus necessitates precise in vitro characterization with well-defined substrates. Here, we adapt a protein semisynthesis approach to generate full-length variants of histone H4 in which the canonical Asp at position 24 is replaced by its isoAsp isomer (H4isoD24). This variant was incorporated into chromatin templates, and the resulting constructs were used to interrogate key parameters of chromatin integrity and maintenance in vitro : compaction, nucleosome remodeling, and methylation of H4 lysine 20 (H4K20). Remarkably, despite its disruptive changes to the backbone’s spacing and direction, isoD24 did not dramatically disrupt Mg 2+ -mediated chromatin self-association or nucleosome repositioning by the remodeler Chd1. In contrast, H4isoD24 significantly inhibited both Set8- and Suv4-20h1-catalyzed methylation at H4K20. These results suggest that H4isoD24 gives rise to a complex reorganization of the chromatin functional landscape, in which macroscopic processes show robustness and local mechanisms exhibit vulnerability to the presence of this mark.},

  abstract     = {Single-atom Fe–N–C catalysts have attracted significant attention in the NO x reduction reaction (NO x RR). However, the origin of their selectivity in the NO x RR remains unclear, impeding further advancements in application. Herein, we investigate the potential-driven competitive mechanism for NH 3 and NH 2 OH production in the NO x RR over single-atom pyridinic-FeN 4 and pyrrolic-FeN 4 sites using constant-potential density functional theory calculations. The origin of selectivity in the NO x RR is linked to the switching of Fe 3 d orbitals as they interact with intermediates. The selectivity between NH 3 and NH 2 OH is determined by the applied potentials. The pyridinic-FeN 4 predominantly generates NH 3 at higher reduction potentials (−0.6 to −1.2 V, vs SHE), while NH 2 OH is favored at lower reduction potentials (0.6 to −0.6 V). The pyrrolic-FeN 4 shows a similar potential-dependent product distribution, with a crossover potential of −1.0 V. The selectivity-determining intermediates (SDIs) in the NO x RR are *NH 2 OH and *NH 2 + *OH. The potential-dependent selectivity is governed by the switching of Fe 3 d orbitals interacting with SDIs, from dumbbell-shaped Fe 3 dz 2 to four-leaf clover-like Fe 3 dxz , 3 dyz , and 3 dx 2 -y 2 , which plays a crucial role in controlling product distribution based on applied potentials. These findings offer new insights into the product selectivity of single-atom catalysts for the NO x RR.},

  abstract     = {The giant muscle protein titin is largely responsible for the passive elasticity of the muscles. The I-band part of titin is elastic, and its constitutive immunoglobulin (Ig) domains undergo force-induced unfolding and refolding when the muscle is stretched toward or beyond the end of the physiological range of sarcomere length. Correct folding of the titin Ig domains is essential to the structure and functions of titin. Although our knowledge of titin elasticity at the molecular level has been largely obtained from single molecule experiments, titin does not exist as an isolated molecule. Instead, six titins are parallelly organized in the muscle sarcomeres. It remains unknown what impact such a parallel organization brings on the folding of titin Ig domains and titin elasticity. Using the two-molecule force spectroscopy technique, here, we report the direct observation of the intermolecular misfolding of titin Ig domains that are arranged in parallel. Our results reveal that when parallelly arranged, two I94 domains can misfold into an intermolecular domain-swapped state that is thermally and mechanically stable. Such intermolecular misfolding may play important structural and functional roles in titin organization and elasticity.},

  abstract     = {O3-type layered transition metal (TM) oxides are widely used as cathode materials for Na-ion batteries due to their high energy density potential, enabled by the state of charge (SoC)-dependent transition from octahedral (O-type) to prismatic (P-type) structures during Na-ion (de)sodiation. However, the O–P transition is often criticized for compromising the Na-ion mobility and limiting the cycle life. Herein, we reveal the intrinsic correlation between O–P transitions, oxygen behaviors, and Na-ion kinetics. We demonstrate that a compositionally versatile, entropy-tailored approach can promote preferred transitions (characterized by large lattice parameter deviations in the O-type region and rapid O–P biphasic reactions), enhancing Na-ion migration, as revealed by in situ high-energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction (HEXRD). Additionally, irreversible oxygen loss at high SoC is effectively mitigated, while TM migration and surface reconstruction are greatly suppressed, further accelerating Na-ion transport and stabilizing the structure, as confirmed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and theoretical analyses. The result is an exceptionally high rate capability of 88.7 mAh g –1 at 20 C (2.4 A g –1 ) with a superior normalized retention of 72.6%, accompanied by a prolonged lifetime with 74.3% retention after 1000 cycles. This work advances the understanding of the chemistry–property relationships in O3-type layered cathodes and broadens the prospects for fabricating high-power-density electrodes.},

  abstract     = {This study presents the first integration of wavelet denoising with resonator-enhanced microwave spectroscopy to explore the formation and characteristics of gas-phase heterogeneous vinylene carbonate-(CO 2 ) 1–5 clusters. Through this innovative approach, faint spectral lines were detected with efficiency, enhancing our understanding of complex interaction patterns that govern the growth and stability of these molecular clusters. It was found that CO 2 aggregates preferentially around the vinylene carbonate molecule through C···O tetrel bonds at the carbonyl and ether groups, altering the typical self-aggregation topology of free CO 2 clusters. This leads to more symmetrical growth around the vinylene carbonate monomer. Our findings provide insights into the solvation mechanisms of compounds in supercritical CO 2 thereby advancing the understanding of subnanoscale CO 2 aggregation patterns.},
