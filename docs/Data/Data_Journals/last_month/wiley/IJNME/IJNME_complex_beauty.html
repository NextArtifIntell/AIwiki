  abstract     = {In this manuscript, we extend the quasi-static multi-phase-field method for composite materials to the dynamic case. In the dynamic multi-phase-field method, each phase of the composites has its individual phase field, and the degradation of each phase is governed by its respective phase field. The macroscopic response is then obtained by averaging and homogenization approaches through the reduced-order-homogenization (ROH) framework. Through the ROH and the Francfort-Marigo variational principle, we can obtain the equations that govern the motion of the composites and the evolution of each phase field. This method is capable of capturing the characteristics of dynamic fracture, such as crack branching, without the need for any additional bifurcation criterion. Moreover, it can capture dynamic fracture patterns in composite materials, including matrix cracking, fiber breakage, and delamination. The corresponding numerical algorithm that includes spatial and temporal discretization is developed. An implicit, staggered Newton-Raphson iterative scheme is implemented to solve the nonlinear coupled equations. Finally, this method is tested with several sets of dynamic fracture benchmarks, which demonstrates good agreement with the experiments and other numerical methods.},

A shell element is treated as a three-dimensional continuum whose midsurface, the generalized “boundary” of the continuum, is characterized with a quadrilateral spectral element. It is along the thickness direction ξ that the midsurface is scaled to represent the three-dimensional geometry and that the analytical displacement solution is sought. Neumann expansion is used to approximate the inverse of the Jacobian as a quadratic matrix polynomial of ξ while the assumed natural strain method is applied to alleviate the shear and membrane locking. The virtual work principle considering body forces is utilized to derive the scaled boundary finite element equation, which is directly solved via the differential quadrature method. Numerical examples show that the shell elements with five displacement sampling points along ξ can efficiently analyze thin to very thick general shells.},

  abstract     = {Advances in 3D-printing technology have enabled the fabrication of periodic microstructures that exhibit characteristic mechanical performances. In response, multiscale topology optimization, which finds the optimal design of microstructure for the macrostructure geometry and performance requirements, has become a hot topic in the field of structural optimization. While the basic optimization framework based on the homogenization theory spanning macro and microscales is available, it is computationally expensive and not easily applicable in practical scenarios such as high-resolution design for precision modeling and reliable design considering non-linearities. To address this issue, we focus on a homogenization analysis using a fast Fourier transform as an alternative approach to conventional finite element analysis and develop an optimization method with fast computing speed and low memory requirements. In this paper, we define a simple stiffness maximization problem with linear elastic materials and conduct two and three-dimensional optimization analyses to evaluate the validity and performance of the proposed method. We discuss the advantages of computational cost, the influence of the filtering process, and the appropriate setting of material contrast.},

  abstract     = {Reduced order modeling (ROM) is applied to the finite element thermo-mechanical simulation of metal additive manufacturing at part scale. This is a significant challenge because of the continuously evolving computational domain, on which a local reduced basis is required to apply the projection-based ROM. In this paper, ROM is applied to the mechanical resolution, which is much more time-consuming than the thermal one. Considering the modeling of DED processes (directed energy deposition), it is proposed to organize the training set of simulation snapshots according to an energy deposition length that represents the progress of the process. The full-order model consists of a transient thermomechanical model modified by use of the previously developed Inherent Strain Rate method. When applying the projection-based ROM to this full-order model, the constructed data sequence enables the design a local ROM depending on the energy deposition length and process parameters. The approach, in its present state, is limited to constructions with a constant transverse geometry and a constant set of process parameters. The simulation of the DED construction of a turbine blade mock-up, made of thirty layers with interlayer dwell times, revealed a computational speedup of about 100.},

The Bernstein interpolations are utilized in both radial and circumferential directions in the scaled boundary coordinates. Firstly, the C 1 $$ {C}^1 $$ continuity conditions inside an S-domain and normal derivatives constraining conditions are imposed by a simple linear system on the S-net coefficients. Secondly, to satisfy the C 1 $$ {C}^1 $$ connection between different polygonal elements, we construct the Hermite interpolation by equivalently transforming part of the S-net coefficients to proper boundary degrees of freedom, namely, three degrees of freedom at each vertex and a normal derivative at the midpoint of each edge. Moreover, we discuss the convergence analysis of the proposed element over convex meshes by finding the necessary and sufficient geometric conditions, where the corresponding unisolvency theorem is proved by studying the dimension of the spline space . This proposed spline element base have explicit expressions, and the computation of the stiffness matrix can be greatly simplified by using the S-net coefficients. Some numerical tests verify the cubic polynomial completeness, the optimal 4th-order convergence rate, and the continuity of the derivatives. It also shows other good properties like superconvergence in the square mesh and insensitivity to the mesh distortion.},

Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions for multiobjective linear optimization problems are applied to construct this neural network model. Compared with the available models in the literature, the proposed approach employs the KKT optimality conditions of the main MLOP, not a scalarized problem related to the MLOP. The stability of the suggested NN model in the sense of Lyapunov, is proved. Also, it is shown that the proposed NN is globally convergent to an efficient solution of the main MLOP. Moreover, we present two algorithms to attain some nondominated points with equidistant distribution throughout the Pareto front of bi-objective and three-objective optimization problems. In the suggested algorithms we apply some filters to attain a uniform approximation of the Pareto front. Illustrative results are provided to clarify the validity and performance of the introduced model for different categories of MLOPs. Numerical results satisfy the presented theoretical aspects. In order to have a comparison with other methods, three indicators, including Hypervolume (HV), Spacing, and Even distribution (EV), are utilized.

  abstract     = {Finding the critical time step for conditionally stable time integration methods has been a decades-long problem. The apparently obvious option of directly computing it from a generalized eigenvalue analysis, identifying the largest eigenfrequency of the discrete system, is usually impractical because of its numerical expense and because a stiffness matrix is often unavailable in the context of explicit analysis. There exist two popular approaches to efficiently estimate the critical time step: A characteristic element length can be estimated based on heuristic formulas. The resulting estimate, however, cannot be guaranteed to be conservative. Another approach is to reformulate and simplify the underlying eigenvalue problem on the element level and to use certain inequalities to derive an upper bound for the largest eigenvalue. This is conservative but may show poor performance by significantly under-predicting the actual critical time step. Moreover, the necessary simplifications are usually specific to the investigated element formulation. Many works that develop time step estimators demonstrate their performance only for particular element configurations, making it difficult to compare the estimators. In this paper, data-driven approaches for time step estimation for 2d-elements that address several of the aforementioned problems are proposed. First, the set of all possible quadrilateral element geometries and its discrete representation are described. A detailed comparison of nine existing time step estimators based on more than ten million element configurations is presented. Additionally, the concept of an optimal safety factor function is introduced. This concept allows us to generate the optimal and conservative version of an existing estimator and thus solves two problems at the same time: It can be used to make non-conservative estimators conservative and to improve the performance of estimators that are conservative by construction. Finally, we formulate time step estimation as a function approximation problem. It allows us to derive customizable time step estimators solely based on data. Through two examples, we demonstrate that this data-driven approach yields time step estimators that outperform state-of-the-art estimators in terms of accuracy while also being efficient to evaluate.},

  abstract     = {This study presents an improved version of the Extended Lumped Damage Mechanics (XLDM) formulation within a position-based approach of the Finite Element Method (FEM). In the XLDM, the strain field has been assessed from the elongations of numerical extensometers, which connect the finite element nodes. In addition, localisation bands positioned along the elements&#39; boundaries depict the mechanical effects of material degradation. The position-based approach of FEM enables the accurate modelling of geometrically non-linear effects and its computational implementation is straightforward. In this approach, the equilibrium configuration has been evaluated in relation to the nodal positions instead of its displacements. Thus, one improvement proposed herein involves the coupling of the XLDM failure predictions within an exact geometrically non-linear framework. Besides, in this study, the XLDM has been further improved by incorporating the damage growth caused by compressive stresses. The non-linear formulation proposed herein enables the presence of reinforcements, which have been added by an embedded scheme and lead to another improvement in the XLDM context. Three applications demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed non-linear scheme, in which the numerical responses obtained by the proposed improved formulation have been compared to experimental results available in the literature.},

This enhances simulation fidelity by accurately considering the deformability of the contact surface and preventing fictitious gaps between bodies in contact. Additionally, the method utilises the Extended B-Splines (EBSs) domain approximation, providing two key advantages. First, EBSs robustly mitigate grid cell-crossing errors by offering continuous gradients of the basis functions on the interface between adjacent grid cells. Second, numerical integration errors are minimised, even with small physical domains in occupied grid cells. The proposed method&#39;s robustness and accuracy are evaluated through benchmarks, including comparisons with analytical solutions, other state-of-the-art MPM-based contact algorithms, and experimental observations from the literature.

The localized radial basis function (LRBF) collocation method is modified and utilized to solve the resulting boundary value problems. A new radial basis function is developed and combined with an optimization strategy for the distribution of source points to enhance the performance of the LRBF scheme. This method synergizes the KDC technique, which supports large time step sizes, with the LRBF collocation method, characterized by its truly meshless nature, to address dynamic problems over long durations. Additionally, the coefficient matrix produced by the LRBF method is sparse and depends solely on the spatial distances between collocation points and source points, which is advantageous for long-term simulations. Numerical simulations spanning thousands of time steps demonstrate the accuracy, stability, and convergence of the hybrid approach. The developed numerical framework shows significant improvements over existing methods, particularly in handling dynamic problems with substantial temperature variations.},

The NURBS fitting method is used to fit the physical response function, generating a NURBS surface for describing the physical response function, that is, the explicitly described physical response function surface. An iso-surface cut the NURBS physical response surfaces to obtain the explicitly described structure topology. In addition, the standard IGS files of the NURBS physical response surface and iso-surface can be transferred to Computer-Aided-Design (CAD) software without post-processing. The multiscale structure can be easily assembled in CAD software using the proposed method.

We demonstrate that the main condition for the stability of the numerical solution is that the distribution of the pressure nodes has to be coarser than that of the velocity both globally and locally in the domain, and there is no need for any more complex assumptions similar to the Ladyzhenskaya-Babuška-Brezzi condition in the finite element method. Optimal stability is achieved when the relative local density of the velocity to pressure nodes is about 4:1. The convergence rates of the method correspond to the convergence rates of numerical differentiation for both low and higher order discretizations. The method works well on both mesh-based and irregular nodes, such as those generated by random or quasi-random numbers and on nodes with varying density. There is no need for special staggered arrangements, which suggests that node generation algorithms may produce just one node set and obtain the other by either refinement or coarsening. Numerical results for the benchmark Driven Cavity Problem confirm the robustness and high accuracy of the method, in particular resolving a cascade of multiple Moffatt Eddies at the tip of the wedge by using nodes obtained from the quasi-random Halton sequence.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present a stable generalized finite element method (SGFEM) to address the approximation of the discontinuous solutions of interface problems with nonhomogeneous interface conditions. We propose a set of enrichment functions based on the Heaviside and Distance functions on the patches that intersect the interface. The enrichment based on the Heaviside function is used to strongly enforce the given nonhomogeneous interface condition, that is, the jump in the solution, and only the enrichment based on the product of the Heaviside and Distance functions contributes to the degrees of freedom. Consequently, the number of degrees of freedom in this approach is the same as that is required for an interface problem with homogeneous interface conditions. The chief merit is that the proposed method totally confors and does not use conventional techniques for the nonhomogeneous interface condition in the literature, such as the penalty method or the Lagrange multiplier. Our experiments show that this method yields optimal order of convergence, its conditioning is not worse than that of the standard finite element method, and it is robust.},

  abstract     = {Sensitivity analysis plays a vital role in understanding the impact of control parameter variations on system output, particularly in cases where an objective functional evaluates the output&#39;s merit. The adjoint method has gained popularity due to its efficient computation, especially when dealing with a large number of control parameters and a few functionals. While the discrete form of the adjoint method is prevalent, exploring its continuous counterpart can offer valuable insights into the underlying mathematical problem, particularly in characterizing the boundary conditions. This paper presents an investigation into the continuous form of the adjoint method applied to time-dependent viscous flows, where the time dependence is either imposed by boundary conditions or arises from the system dynamics itself. The proposed approach enables the computation of sensitivities with respect to both geometric and operational control parameters using the same adjoint solution. For time-periodic flows, a special formulation is developed to mitigate the computational costs associated with time integration. Results demonstrate that the methodology proposed in a previous work can be successfully extended to time-dependent flows with fixed time spans. In such applications, time-accurate simulations of physics and adjoint fields are sufficient. However, periodic flows necessitate the application of the Leibniz Rule because the period might depend on the control parameters, which introduces additional terms to the adjoint-based sensitivity gradient. In that case, time integration can be limited to a minimum common multiple of all appearing periods in the flow. Although the accurate estimation of such multiple poses a challenge, the approach promises significant benefits for sensitivity analysis of fully established periodic flows. It leads to substantial cuts in computational costs and avoids transient data contamination.},

  abstract     = {Thermal analysis of fractured porous media is of interest in environmental and reservoir engineering. The dual-porosity method is a common and cost-efficient approach for modeling fractured domain. In the case of thermal analysis, this method encounters two challenges; the high dependence on the matrix to fracture transfer parameter, “shape factor,” and numerical oscillations produced in the conventional Galerkin finite element formulation for convection dominant problems. To overcome these issues a Petrov-Galerkin dual porosity (PGDP) algorithm is presented for the analysis of 2D transient heat flow in fractured porous media. In the computational algorithm, an appropriate unit cell is selected from the primary domain and the corresponding thermal shape factor is evaluated with a time-varying function. Unlike conventional constant shape factor models, this shape factor accounts for not only the geometry of the blocks, but also the thermal properties of the domain and existing boundary conditions. Several case studies are simulated to investigate the validity and sensitivity of the time-dependent thermal shape factor to different parameters for square and non-square blocks. Moreover, the Petrov-Galerkin formulation is applied to effectively achieve the accurate spatial results for highly convective heat flows. Numerical simulations are performed to study the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed PGDP algorithm for different range of convection and conduction regimes. This study illustrates that the PGDP algorithm efficiently enhances the accuracy of the simulation in modeling of fractured domains, particularly in transient stages. Moreover, the capability of the proposed computational algorithm is demonstrated in modeling square and non-square matrix formations.},

  abstract     = {This article is dedicated to the development of a model to simulate fast transient compressible flows on solid structures using immersed boundary method (IBM) and a lattice Boltzmann solver. Ultimately, the proposed model aims at providing an efficient algorithm to simulate strongly-coupled fluid-structure interactions (FSI). Within this goal, it is necessary to propose a precise and robust numerical framework and validate it on stationary solid cases first, which is the scope of the present study. Classical FSI methods, such as body-fitted approaches, are facing challenges with moving or complex geometries in realistic conditions, requiring computationally expensive re-meshing operations. IBM offers an alternative by treating the solid structure geometry independently from the fluid mesh. This study focuses on the extension of the IBM to compressible flows, and a particular attention is given to the enforcement of various thermal boundary conditions. A hybrid approach, combining diffuse forcing for Dirichlet-type boundary conditions and ghost-nodes forcing for Neumann-type boundary conditions is introduced. Finally, a simplified model, relying only on diffuse IBM forcing, is investigated to treat specific cases where the fluid solid interface is considered as adiabatic. The accuracy of the method is validated through various test cases of increasing complexity.},

The formulation proposed is intended for model order reduction of electrostatically actuated resonating Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS). The continuous problem is first rewritten in a manner that can be directly handled by the parametrisation method, which relies upon automated asymptotic expansions. A new mixed fully Lagrangian formulation is thus proposed, which contains only explicit polynomial nonlinearities, which is then discretised in the framework of finite element procedures. Validation is performed on the classical parallel plate configuration, where different formulations using either the general framework or an approximation of the electrostatic field due to the geometric configuration selected are compared. Reduced-order models along these formulations are also compared to full-order simulations operated with a time integration approach. Numerical results show a remarkable performance both in terms of accuracy and the wealth of nonlinear effects that can be accounted for. In particular, the transition from hardening to softening behaviour of the primary resonance while increasing the constant voltage component of the electric actuation is recovered. Secondary resonances leading to superharmonic and parametric resonances are also investigated with the reduced-order model.},

Addressing this challenge, the present study contributes not only a comprehensive analytical framework for formulating implicit integration algorithms but also leverages the auxiliary variable and the composite sub-step technique to propose two distinct types of implicit integration algorithms. Each type is characterized by self-initiation, unconditional stability, identical second-order accuracy, controllable numerical dissipation, and zero-order overshoots. Recognizing that single-step implicit methods can be conceptualized as composite single-sub-step ones, both algorithm types achieve identical effective stiffness matrices, thereby reducing the computational effort for solving linear problems. The utilization of auxiliary variables endows the proposed single-step method with numerical attributes akin to established counterparts, while achieving identical second-order accuracy. Conversely, the adoption of the composite sub-step technique in the proposed two-sub-step methods surpasses the published algorithms by significantly reducing the error constants. This superiority persists when enforcing the same sub-step sizes and sub-step dissipation levels. Numerical simulations affirm that the proposed methods consistently outperform existing alternatives without incurring additional computational expenses.},

Secondly, the interpolation error in the maximum norm is estimated in any dimension. Consequently, we get a theoretical convergence rate which has been sought since the year 2010. When restricted to one-dimensional problems, we construct a special test function to prove the superconvergence: (1) S-FEM flux is exact in the meaning of element-wise integral; (2) numerical flux is exact at some point in each element; (3) physical flux can be quadratically approximated at the center of each element. At last, we present two numerical experiments: (1) conventional S-FEM fails in high-contrast composite materials while our new scheme performs well; (2) our flux converges quadratically.},

First, we show that an abstract fixed-point method with non-expansive fixed-point operator and non-trivial damping converges linearly, provided the associated residual mapping satisfies a monotonicity condition on a closed subspace. Then, we transfer this result to the framework of polarization schemes and conclude the linear convergence of the damped Eyre–Milton scheme for porous materials. We present general arguments which apply to a class of nonlinear composites and mixed stress-strain loadings, as well. We show that the best contraction estimate is reached for a damping factor of 1 / 2 $$ 1/2 $$ , that is, for the polarization scheme of Michel–Moulinec–Suquet, and derive the corresponding optimal reference material. Our results generalize the recent work of Sab and co-workers who showed that an adaptively damped Eyre–Milton scheme leads to linear convergence for a class of linear composites with pores.

Subsequently, an automatic mesh simplification algorithm is established to enhance the computational efficiency without compromising accuracy. In validating the smooth polyhedral model, the simulation results of a hexahedron colliding with a plane are found to agree favorably with the experimental results. Then, the elastic collisions between the convex and concave particles are analyzed, and the total kinetic energy before and after the particle collision remains unchanged.

  abstract     = {The traditional approach to structural lightweight optimization design, which is based on the elastic limit rule, often results in a structure that exhibits either weight redundancy or strength redundancy to some extent. This study introduces a novel integration of shakedown analysis with structural topology optimization, departing from the conventional elastic limit rule. Shakedown analysis identifies a non-failure external load region beyond the elastic limit but below the plastic limit, independent of loading history. The proposed method, for the first time, accounts for the influence of self-equilibrium residual stress at the element level, redefining effective and ineffective elements in topology optimization. Shakedown total stress replaces elastic equivalent stress, offering a comprehensive measure. Utilizing Melan&#39;s lower bound theorem, a gradient-based topology optimization framework for shakedown analysis is developed, ensuring structures stay within the elastic–plastic range, preventing excessive plastic deformation. The approach, employing the moving asymptotes method after adjoint sensitivity analysis of shakedown total stress, is applied to a three-dimensional L-shaped bracket. Even with a remarkable 50% reduction in weight, the maximum total shakedown stress of the bracket reveals that it only increases by a modest 17.20% from its initial value. Moreover, compared to traditional topology optimization methods based on either elastic stress or stiffness, the proposed method based on total shakedown stress leads to a higher shakedown limit. Specifically, the configuration designed using the total shakedown stress exhibited increases of 2.01% and 9.82% in the shakedown limit compared to those obtained using stiffness and equivalent elastic stress, respectively. This suggests that the proposed method can effectively balance the trade-off between shakedown strength and structural stiffness, achieving a 2.01% rise in shakedown strength with only a 2.24% compromise in structural stiffness. These findings highlight the method&#39;s effectiveness and potential, emphasizing the benefit of redefining effective and ineffective elements using shakedown stress in topology optimization.},

To be scalable, these methods are equipped with an augmentation projector built from the local preconditioners nullspaces. The determination of these nullspaces is a complex task in the case of ill conditioned system, the use of block low rank compression makes this task even more complex as MUMPS&#39; automatic detection no longer works properly. Two alternatives based on incomplete factorization with a well-chosen Schur complement are proposed. Also, the first massively parallel implementation of the adaptive multipreconditioned BDD solver (AMPBDD) is introduced. The performance of the methods is assessed with two weak scalability studies on problems up to 24,576 cores and about 790 millions of unknowns, on the Sator and Topaze supercomputers. BLR preconditioning proves to be an interesting strategy both in terms of memory usage and time to solution for reasonably conditioned problems.},

The DC framework differs from traditional Bayesian approaches due to the incorporation of the push-forward of an initial density, which performs selective regularization in parameter directions not informed by the data in the resulting updated density. This extends a previous study that included the linear Gaussian theory within the DC framework and introduced the maximal updated density (MUD) estimate as an alternative to both least squares and maximum a posterior (MAP) estimates. In this work, we introduce algorithms for operational settings of MUD estimation in real- or near-real time where spatio-temporal datasets arrive in packets to provide updated estimates of parameters and identify potential parameter drift. Computational diagnostics within the DC framework prove critical for evaluating (1) the quality of the DC update and MUD estimate and (2) the detection of parameter value drift. The algorithms are applied to estimate (1) wind drag parameters in a high-fidelity storm surge model, (2) thermal diffusivity field for a heat conductivity problem, and (3) changing infection and incubation rates of an epidemiological model.},

  abstract     = {A computationally efficient spectral Kirchhoff plate element is presented for time-domain analysis of wave propagation at high frequencies in thin isotropic plates. It employs a C 1 $$ {C}^1 $$ -continuous spectral interpolation based on the modified bi-Hermite polynomials using the Gauss–Lobatto–Legendre (GLL) points as a basis with selective collocation of rotational and twisting degrees of freedom (DOFs) at element edge and corner nodes. The lowest order version of the proposed element reduces to the classical Bogner–Fox–Schmit (BFS) element for Kirchhoff plates. The GLL basis allows diagonalisation of the mass matrix using the nodal quadrature technique, which enhances the computational efficiency. The numerical properties of the proposed element are comprehensively evaluated, including the conditioning of the system matrices. Moreover, the effect of employing different numerical integration schemes and nodal sets is examined in both static and free vibration analyses. The effectiveness of the proposed element in wave propagation problems is evaluated by comparing its performance to the converged solutions achieved using the BFS element with a very fine mesh. Results demonstrate that the current element, without and even with mass matrix diagonalisation delivers exceptional accuracy while also exhibiting faster convergence and enhanced computational efficiency than the existing Kirchhoff plate elements.},
