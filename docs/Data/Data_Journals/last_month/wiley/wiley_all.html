  abstract     = {Company earnings calls are pivotal events that offer crucial insights into a company&#39;s financial well-being and future outlook. Large language models (LLMs) present a promising avenue for automatically generating the initial draft of earnings call scripts, leveraging financial data and past examples. We evaluate two distinct methods: (1) few-shot learning prompt engineering with a large language model (LLM) and (2) fine-tuning a large language model on earnings call transcript data. Our findings indicate that both methods can produce coherent scripts encompassing key metrics, updates, and guidance. However, there are inherent trade-offs in comprehensiveness, potential hallucinations, writing style, ease of use, and cost. We discuss the pros and cons of each method to guide practitioners on effectively harnessing LLMs for earnings call script generation. Notably, we employ a human and two different LLMs to act as judges to compare the outcomes generated by the two approaches.},

  abstract     = {Modern large language models (LLMs) represent a paradigm shift in what can plausibly be expected of machine learning models. The fact that LLMs can effectively generate sensible answers to a diverse range of queries suggests that they would be useful in customer support applications. While powerful, LLMs have been observed to be prone to hallucination which unfortunately makes their near-term use in customer support applications challenging. To address this issue, we present a system that allows us to use an LLM to augment our customer support advocates by re-framing the language modeling task as a discriminative classification task. In this framing, we seek to present the Top-K best template responses for a customer support advocate to use when responding to a customer. We present the result of both offline and online experiments where we observed offline gains and statistically significant online lifts for our experimental system. Along the way, we present observed scaling curves for validation loss and Top-K accuracy, resulted from model parameter ablation studies. We close by discussing the space of trade-offs with respect to model size, latency, and accuracy as well as and suggesting future applications to explore.},

  abstract     = {Biological function often depends on complex mechanisms of a dynamic, time-variant nature. An example is certain bat species (horseshoe bats—Rhinolophidae) that use intricate pinna musculatures to execute a variety of pinna deformations. While prior work has indicated the potential significance of these motions for sensory information encoding, it remains unclear how the complex time-variant pinna geometries could be controlled to enhance sensory performance. To address this issue, this work has investigated deep neural network models as digital twins for biomimetic pinnae. The networks were trained to predict the acoustic impacts of the deformed pinna geometries. A total of three network architectures have been evaluated for this purpose using physical numerical simulations (boundary element method) as ground truth. The networks predicted the acoustic beampattern function from pinna shape or even directly from the states of actuators that were used to deform the pinna shapes in simulation. Inserting prior knowledge in the form of beam-shaped basis functions did not improve network performance. The ability of the networks to produce beampattern predictions with low computational effort (in about three milliseconds each) should lend itself readily to supporting learning methods such as deep reinforcement learning that require many such functional evaluations.},

Consequently, urban decision-makers prioritize the mitigation of congestion. This study delves into the efficacy of harnessing extensive data on urban traffic dynamics, coupled with comprehensive knowledge of road networks, to enable Artificial Intelligence (AI) in forecasting traffic flux well in advance. Such forecasts hold promise for informing emission reduction measures, particularly those aligned with Low Emission Zone policies. The investigation centers on Valencia, leveraging its robust traffic sensor infrastructure, one of the most densely deployed worldwide, encompassing approximately 3500 sensors strategically positioned across the city. Employing historical data spanning 2016 and 2017, we undertake the task of training and characterizing a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network for the prediction of temporal traffic patterns. Our findings demonstrate the LSTM&#39;s efficacy in real-time forecasting of traffic flow evolution, facilitated by its ability to discern salient patterns within the dataset.},

To address this challenge, this paper proposes a new approach to indoor positioning that utilises channel state information (CSI) and machine learning (ML) techniques to improve accuracy. The proposed method extracts the amplitude and phase differences of the subcarriers from the CSI data to create fingerprints. ML algorithms and network architecture are utilised to train the CSI data from two antennas, in the form of phase and amplitude. Experiments conducted in a standard indoor environment demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The ANN model with two hidden layers was trained with experimental data collected from subjects (canines and felines) in our previous work. Inverse mapping of the trained ANNs was conducted using BO to predict the acceptable MV settings for specific subject outcomes. Our results suggest that the model can support veterinarians in estimating the proper MV parameters for optimal subject outcome.},

Fuzzy Deep Belief Network (DBN) has proved its efficiency in dealing with sentiment analysis and suitability for classifying unlabeled or semi-labeled data. Previous structures of deep belief networks are mostly made of traditional activation functions such as sigmoid. In this paper, a new activation function, which is referred to as hyperbolic secant function, is proposed. The new activation function not only solves gradient zeroing problem but also increases the accuracy and efficiency. Besides, extreme learning machine (ELM) is proposed as the decision layer to increase the accuracy and improve the generalizability through solving gradient-based learning problem. The efficiency of the proposed method has been experimented on “IMDB” movie critic dataset, 20-newspaper dataset and Sentiment Analysis dataset. The results of the proposed method are more accurate and precise as compared with the previous approaches.},

  abstract     = {The absence of the enhancement of fluorescence in carbon dots (CDs) through doping with transition metal atoms (TMAs) hinders the advancement of multi-modal bio-imaging CDs with high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Herein, Mn-atomically-doped R-CDs (R-Mn-CDs) with a high PLQY of 41.3% in water is presented, enabling efficient in vivo dual-mode fluorescence/magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. The comprehensive characterizations reveal that the incorporation of Mn atoms leads to a Mn-N 2 O 2 coordinating structure, resulting in five significant effects: an increase in sp 2 conjugation domains, a reduction in band gap, a decreased oxidation level, an increase in photo-excited electron numbers, and the suppression of non-radiative electron relaxation pathways. Collectively, these factors contribute to the remarkable PLQY of R-Mn-CDs. Additionally, the doping of Mn atoms also endows R-Mn-CDs with superior MR imaging capabilities due to, which highlights their promising prospect as a dual-modal bio-imaging platform for fluorescence/MR imaging. Furthermore, the findings indicate that the introduction of various TMAs, such as Mn, Zn, Ni, and Cu, can universally improve the PLQY of water-soluble CDs through the construction of TMAs─O bonds. This research provides valuable theoretical insights into the mechanisms underlying the fluorescence enhancement induced by TMAs doping and offers guidance for the future design of high PLQY CDs.},

  abstract     = {Mitochondrial dysfunction is a key factor in exacerbating pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy and is linked to increased morbidity and mortality. ECSIT, a crucial adaptor for inflammation and mitochondrial function, has been reported to express multiple transcripts in various species and tissues, leading to distinct protein isoforms with diverse subcellular localizations and functions. However, whether an unknown ECSIT isoform exists in cardiac cells and its potential role in regulating mitochondrial function and pathological cardiac hypertrophy has remained unclear. This study identified a 42-kDa ECSIT isoform encoded by the transcript variant Ecsit-X4, which is highly expressed in the mitochondria of adult cardiomyocytes but down-regulated in hypertrophic human heart samples and TAC-treated mouse hearts. AAV9-mediated Ecsit-X4 gene therapy, administered either before or after TAC surgery, significantly attenuated cardiac hypertrophy. Cardiomyocyte-specific Ecsit deficiency worsened TAC-induced cardiac hypertrophy, while Ecsit-X4 compensation independently rescued hypertrophic phenotypes in Ecsit cKO mice. Mechanistically, ECSIT-X4 localized to the mitochondria and interacted with STAT3, leading to increased STAT3 levels and enhanced serine 727 phosphorylation in cardiomyocyte mitochondria, thereby promoting strong mitochondrial bioenergetics. This study identified a novel transcript variant of ECSIT localized in the mitochondria of adult cardiomyocytes and highlights its potential as a therapeutic target for heart failure.},

  abstract     = {Regulation of the immune response is key to promoting bone regeneration by electroactive biomaterials. However, how electrical signals at the micro- and nanoscale regulate the immune response and subsequent angiogenesis during bone regeneration remains to be elucidated. Here, the distinctly different surface potential distributions on charged poly(vinylidene fluoridetrifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)) matrix surfaces are established by altering the dimensions of ferroelectric nanofillers from 0D BaTiO 3 nanoparticles (homogeneous surface potential distribution, HOPD) to 1D BaTiO 3 nanofibers (heterogeneous surface potential distribution, HEPD). Compared to HOPD, HEPD is significantly better at inducing the M2 polarization of macrophages and promoting neovascularization, which results in accelerated bone regeneration in vivo. The transcriptomic analysis reveals that macrophages modulated by HEPD display high expression levels of pro-angiogenic genes, which is corroborated by tube-formation assays, RT-qPCR, and western blot analyses in vitro. Mechanistic explorations elucidate activation of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, which in turn induces the polarization of macrophages toward a pro-angiogenic phenotype. This study elucidates the cascade of biological processes by which heterogeneous electrical signals at the micro- and nanoscale modulate macrophage functions to promote vascularization and bone regeneration. Hence, this study provides new insights into how the micro- and nanoscale distribution characteristics of electrical signals facilitate bone regeneration.},

The cryogels CG1[Cl]–CG3[Cl] adsorb chlorine with capacities of 0.22–0.26 g Cl 2 /g cryogel as an average over three adsorption-desorption cycles. The adsorption process is based on the reversible and selective halogen bonding of chlorides (Cl − ) with chlorine (Cl 2 ) forming the corresponding trichloride ([Cl 3 ] − ) species, indicated by Raman spectroscopy. The reversibility of chlorine adsorption is shown by applying heat and vacuum to the loaded cryogel CG1[Cl 3 ] releasing 63% of the adsorbed chlorine within 3 h and 72% within 16 h. The unique ability to selectively adsorb chlorine in the presence of other gases is successfully employed for the selective adsorption of chlorine from a gas mixture, potentially enabling the recycling of chlorine from tail gas streams.},

However, the emission wavelengths of the current aqueous organic room-temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials are limited to green and red bands, while the blue part is rarely reported, thus limiting the development of a full-color RTP system. Theoretically, carboxylated benzene is expected to be blue phosphorescence-emissive, but only green phosphorescence is observed in solid, due to the strong intermolecular π–π stacking that decreases the energy gap. Herein, the use of water-dispersible layered double hydroxide (ZnAl-LDH) is proposed for isolating Ph-(COOH) n and the distance between the adjacent chromophores is confirmed to be larger (≈7.0 Å) than the threshold of π–π interaction. Deep-blue phosphorescence with a lifetime over 0.1 s, and a maximum luminescence quantum yield of 42%, is harvested in the aqueous phase. The long-lived deep-blue phosphorescence is successfully explored for high-temperature display and luminescent dyes.},

  abstract     = {Non-close-packed crystalline arrays of colloidal particles in an elastic matrix exhibit mechanochromism. However, small interparticle distances often limit the range of reversible color shifts and reduce reflectivity during a blueshift. A straightforward, reproducible strategy using matrix swelling to increase interparticle distance and improve mechanochromic performance is presented. Photonic composites are initially prepared with silica particle arrays embedded in an elastomer matrix at volume fractions of 0.35–0.5. To increase interparticle distance, the composites are immersed in an elastomer-forming monomer, causing the matrix to swell, followed by photopolymerization, thereby producing liquid-free composites. The degree of swelling is controllable up to 3.16, depending on monomer choice, matrix volume fraction, and crosslinking density. The process can be repeated to further increase swelling up to 10.36. This method can reduce the volume fraction of silica particles from 40% to 3.8%, while interparticle distance increases from 53 to 257 nm. The swollen photonic composites exhibit a full visible spectrum under compression, while minimizing reflectivity loss. This allows red-colored photonic composites to be transformed into vivid multicolor patterns when compressed with stamps featuring spatial height variations.},

This study introduces a single-atom iron, coordinated by nitrogen atoms in a 3D hierarchical porous carbon fiber (Fe─N-PCF), which enhances ion and electron transport, improves nucleation and diffusion kinetics, and reduces energy barriers for potassium deposition. Molten potassium infusion experiments confirm the Fe─N-PCF&#39;s strong potassiphilic properties, accelerating adsorption kinetics and improving potassium deposition performance. According to the Scharifker-Hills model, traditional carbon fiber substrates without potassiphilic sites cause 3D instantaneous nucleation, leading to dendritic growth. In contrast, the integration of single-atom and hierarchical porosity promotes uniform 3D progressive nucleation, leading to dense metal deposition, as confirmed by dimensionless i 2 /i max 2 versus t/t max plots and real-time in situ optical microscopy. Consequently, in situ X-ray diffraction demonstrated stable potassium cycling for over 1900 h, while the Fe─N-PCF@K||PTCDA full cell retained 69.7% of its capacity after 2000 cycles (72 mAh g −1 ), with a low voltage hysteresis of 0.876 V, confirming its strong potential for high energy density and extended cycle life, paving the way for future advancements in energy storage technology.},

Mesenchymal stem cells-derived small extracellular vesicles (MSC-sEVs) have shown anti-inflammatory effects in OA models, while persistent existence of senescent chondrocytes still promotes cartilage destruction. Therefore, improving the targeted elimination ability on senescent chondrocytes is required to facilitate the translation of MSC-sEVs in OA treatment. In this study, versatile engineered MSC-sEVs are developed to targetedly clear senescent chondrocytes and maintain cartilage metabolic homeostasis. Specifically, MSC-sEVs are loaded with siRNA mouse double minute 2 homologue (siMDM2) and modified with cartilage-targeting peptide WYRGRL-PEG 2K -DSPE (WPD), named WPD-sEVs siMDM2 . The results demonstrate versatile modification improves the cellular uptake of MSC-sEVs in chondrocytes, and thus improves the antiaging effects. Importantly, multifunctional modification enhances cartilage penetration ability and extends joint retention time of MSC-sEVs. In both post-traumatic OA mice and naturally aged mice, WPD-sEVs siMDM2 more effectively eliminates senescent chondrocytes and maintained matrix metabolic homeostasis. By using the P53 phosphorylation inhibitor, the essential role MDM2-P53 pathway in the antiaging function of WPD-sEVs siMDM2 on chondrocytes is verified. In ex vivo cultured human OA cartilage explants, it is confirmed that WPD-sEVs siMDM2 alleviates senescent phenotype. Altogether, the findings suggest that WPD-sEVs siMDM2 have promising translational potential for OA treatment.},

Lipidomics reveal that silencing TRIM21 reduce the arachidonic acid production, and inhibit ferroptosis.

TRIM21 interacts with EPHX1 through its SPRY domain and promotes ubiquitin-mediated degradation of EPHX1 via K33- and K48-linked ubiquitination at the K105 site. Given the targeting potential, this work screens Bezafibrate to block the interaction between TRIM21 and EPHX1 and validates its sensitizing effect. In summary, TRIM21 promotes tumour growth and gemcitabine resistance in PC by inhibiting EPHX1-mediated arachidonic acid metabolism. This provides a novel and promising target for clinical treatment of PC.},

  abstract     = {Cofactors such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and its phosphorylated form (NADPH) play a crucial role in natural enzyme-catalyzed reactions for the synthesis of chemicals. However, the stoichiometric supply of NADH for artificial synthetic processes is uneconomical. Here, inspired by the process of cofactor NADPH regeneration in photosystem I (PSI), catalyst-modified photocathodes are constructed on the surface of polythiophene-based semiconductors ( PTTH ) via self-assembly for photoelectrochemical catalytic NADH regeneration. With the assistance of viologen ( vi 2+ ) electron transfer mediators (similar function as Ferredoxin in PSI) linked to the [Rh(Cp * )(bpy)] catalyst, the Rh-vi 2+ @PTTH photocathode exhibits higher photocurrent density (−665 µA cm −2 ) with a high apparent turnover frequency (TOF, 168.4 h −1 ) under a relatively positive potential (0.0 V vs RHE). In addition, through holistic functional mimics of the photosystem, a tandem photoelectrochemical cell is constructed by assembling a CoPi@BiVO 4 photoanode (artificial photosystem II, PSII) with the Rh-vi 2+ @PTTH photocathode. This system achieves a production rate of 42.5 µ m h −1 cm −2 and a TOF of 179.3 h −1 without an externally applied bias for NADH regeneration. The photo-generated NADH is directly employed to assist glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) in the catalytic conversion of α-ketoglutarate to L-glutamate. This study presents a novel strategic approach for constructing bias-free photoelectrochemical NADH regeneration systems.},

  abstract     = {Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S)-mediated protein S-sulfhydration has been shown to play critical roles in several diseases. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the predominant population of immune cells present within solid tumor tissues, and they function to restrict antitumor immunity. However, no previous study has investigated the role of protein S-sulfhydration in TAM reprogramming in breast cancer (BC). Therefore, the aim is to investigate whether protein S-sulfhydration can regulate TAM reprogramming and its underlying mechanism in BC. The results showed that in BC, the CTH-H 2 S axis is positively correlated with the presence of an anti-tumor phenotype in TAMs. NaHS, as an H 2 S donor, repolarized TAMs into M1 macrophages to block the tumor-promoting activities of TAMs both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, H 2 S-mediated S-sulfhydration of the protein chaperone glucose-regulated-protein 78 (GRP78) induced endoplasmic reticulum transmembrane protein kinase-1α (IRE-1α) dissociation from GRP78, which enhanced the phosphatase activity of IRE-1α itself in BC-TAMs, while the Cys420 site mutation of GRP78 interfered with these effects. Collectively, GRP78 S-sulfhydrylation mediated by H 2 S at the Cys420 residue decreased the tumor burden and inhibited lung metastasis of BC through reprograming TAMs via activating the IRE-1α pathway, indicating that targeting GRP78 S-sulfhydration represents a promising intervention for TAM-M1 repolarization in BC.},

However, their radiotherapeutic efficacy is limited by hypoxia in deep-seated tumors and short half-lives of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Herein the conjugation of a nitric oxide (NO) donor, S-nitroso-N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine (SNAP), to the Hf 12 secondary building units (SBUs) of Hf-5,5′-di-p-benzoatoporphyrin MOL is reported to afford SNAP/MOL for enhanced cancer radiotherapy. Under X-ray irradiation, SNAP/MOL efficiently generates superoxide anion (O 2 −. ) and releases nitric oxide (NO) in a spatio-temporally synchronized fashion. The released NO rapidly reacts with O 2 −. to form long-lived and highly cytotoxic peroxynitrite which diffuses freely to the cell nucleus and efficiently causes DNA double-strand breaks. Meanwhile, the sustained release of NO from SNAP/MOL in the tumor microenvironment relieves tumor hypoxia to reduce radioresistance of tumor cells. Consequently, SNAP/MOL plus low-dose X-ray irradiation efficiently inhibits tumor growth and reduces metastasis in colorectal and triple-negative breast cancer models.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a cornerstone technology in clinical diagnostics and in vivo research, offering unparalleled visualization capabilities. Despite significant advancements in the past century, traditional 1 H MRI still faces sensitivity limitations that hinder its further development. To overcome this challenge, hyperpolarization methods have been introduced, disrupting the thermal equilibrium of nuclear spins and leading to an increased proportion of hyperpolarized spins, thereby enhancing sensitivity by hundreds to tens of thousands of times. Among these methods, hyperpolarized (HP) 129 Xe MRI, also known as ultrasensitive 129 Xe MRI, stands out for achieving the highest polarization enhancement and has recently received clinical approval. It effectively tackles the challenge of weak MRI signals from low proton density in the lungs. HP 129 Xe MRI is valuable for assessing structural and functional changes in lung physiology during pulmonary disease progression, tracking cells, and detecting target molecules at pico-molar concentrations. This review summarizes recent developments in HP 129 Xe MRI, including its physical principles, manufacturing methods, in vivo characteristics, and diverse applications in biomedical, chemical, and material sciences. In addition, it carefully discusses potential technical improvements and future prospects for enhancing its utility in these fields, further establishing HP 129 Xe MRI&#39;s importance in advancing medical imaging and research.},

  abstract     = {Owing to their attractive antitumor effects, aminated fullerene derivatives are emerging as promising therapeutic drugs for cancer. However, their in vivo applications are severely limited due to cation toxicity. To address this problem, human heavy chain ferritin (HFn), possessing natural biocompatibility is utilized, to develop a novel supramolecular assembly drug delivery system. Specifically, tetra[4-(amino)piperidin-1-yl]-C 60 (TAPC) is selected as the representative aminated fullerene, and a layer-by-layer assembly strategy is designed to controllably assemble TAPC with the negatively charged HFn into a hierarchical coassembly (H@T@H) via electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds. In this ordered multilayer structure, the surface displayed HFn endows the inner TAPC with biocompatibility, tumor-targeting and blood-brain barrier crossing ability. Additionally, the electrostatic assembly mode enables the acid-responsive disassembly of H@T@H to release TAPC in lysosomes. In the orthotopic glioma mouse model, the HFn-assembled TAPC (H@T@H) shows higher brain accumulation and a stronger inhibitory effect on glioma than polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated TAPC. Moreover, in an experimental metastasis mouse model, H@T@H have significant preventive and therapeutic effects on tumor metastasis. Encouragingly, the ferritin-based supramolecular assembly strategy has been proven to have broad applicability for various aminated fullerene derivatives, showing promising potential for tackling the in vivo delivery challenges of cationic drugs.},

However, assessing specific DNA helicase activity in living cells remains challenging. Herein, the first anchor-embedded duplex (ATED) probe, 17GC , is constructed to uniquely monitor the unwinding activity of Werner syndrome helicase (WRN), a clinical anticancer target. This probe integrates biophysical screening and molecular simulation approaches. The 17GC probe consists of two components: the first one is a bubble structure as an anchor for recruiting WRN in cells, and the second one is GC-rich double helices on both ends of the bubble, which allow high sensitivity in detecting WRN activity. In vitro evaluations demonstrate that 17GC is highly sensitive and specific to WRN (LOD = 33.5 p m ) compared to a wide range of other enzymes, including helicases and nucleases. Cellular evaluation reveals that the ATED probe exhibits remarkable performance in monitoring WRN helicase activity and assessing the inhibitory efficiency of clinical WRN inhibitors in various cell types. This study introduces a novel approach for designing specific and sensitive probes for DNA helicases in cells, which holds promise for biological characterization and drug development.},

However, the molecular basis underlying the role of Hspa13 in regulating Bregs function and lupus pathogenesis remains unclear. In this study, Bregs display higher Hspa13 expression than IL-10 − B cells. Induction of IL-10 production is weakened in B cells with Hspa13 knockdown or knockout. Hspa13 binds to the IL-10 promoter via the TATA or CAAT box and activates IL-10 transcription in the nucleus. Furthermore, Hspa13 positive cells are enriched in marginal zone (MZ) B cells to regulate IL-10 production. Stimulated B220 + B or MZ B cells from CD19 cre Hspa13 fl/fl mice for Breg induction show an impaired capacity to promote CD4 + Foxp3 + regulatory T cells (Treg) differentiation. In lupus MRL/lpr mice, a decline in Treg differentiation is accompanied by decreased Hspa13 expression in both Bregs and MZ B cells. Moreover, adoptive transfusion of Bregs and MZ B cells from CD19 cre Hspa13 fl/fl mice fails to increase the frequency of Tregs, attenuate renal pathology, or decrease anti-dsDNA antibody levels.

  abstract     = {Approximately 50% of the patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) are primarily nonresponsive to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy or lose their responsiveness over time. The gut microbiota plays an important role in the resistance of UC to anti-TNF therapy; however, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Here, it is found that the transplantation of gut fecal microbiota from patients with UC alters the diversity of the gut microbiota in dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis mice and may affect the therapeutic responsiveness of mice to infliximab. Furthermore, the abundances of Romboutsia and Fusobacterium increase in the tissues of patients with UC who do not respond to anti-TNF therapy. Differentially abundant metabolites are mainly enriched in nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism in NCM460 cells after Fusobacterium nucleatum infection. Mechanistically, F. nucleatum promotes the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ) salvage pathway by upregulating NAMPT expression, which subsequently leads to the activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and promotes the secretion of inflammatory factors, ultimately inhibiting the therapeutic response to anti-TNF drugs.

  abstract     = {Hole-transport layers (HTL) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with an n-i-p structure are commonly doped by bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (TFSI) salts to enhance hole conduction. While lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) dopant is a widely used and effective dopant, it has significant limitations, including the need for additional solvents and additives, environmental sensitivity, unintended oxidation, and dopant migration, which can lead to lower stability of PSCs. A novel ionic liquid, 1-(2-methoxyethyl)-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide (MMPyTFSI), is explored as an alternative dopant for 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD). MMPy ions act as a surface passivator, reducing defects on the perovskite surface, while TFSI ions facilitate p-type doping. MMPyTFSI functions as an efficient dopant, maintaining excellent performance even when tetrahydrofuran (THF) is utilized as a solvent in place of chlorobenzene (CB), while significantly reducing the environmental impact of the process. The optimized PSC achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.10% and demonstrates enhanced long-term stability in all aging tests for over 1000 h in a humid atmosphere, at high temperature, and under simulated sunlight illumination. These results demonstrate that MMPyTFSI is an effective and environmentally friendly dopant for producing stable and efficient PSCs.},

Here, a three-step screen and design strategy is developed for gaining customized chemo-sensors, through Structure modeling; MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical Systems) analysis, and Performance verification . With such a strategy, the coordination hanging anion mechanism is screened out for reversible nerve agent detection and shows reversible emission enhancement by 25.8 times with DCP, ultrasensitive vapor phase detection (5.7 ppb), and rapid response(10 s) and recovery speed (20 s).

Additionally, the advanced meta-devices M-2B and M-4B are designed to generate two-vector and four-vector Bessel beams with tunable spatial polarization distributions. These meta-devices demonstrate dynamic multi-polarization beam modulation, validated through simulations and experiments.

  abstract     = {Understanding the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mechanism is pivotal for improving the overall efficiency of water electrolysis. Despite methylammonium lead halide perovskites (MAPbX 3 ) have shown promising OER performance due to their soft-lattice nature that allows lattice-oxygen oxidation of active α-PbO 2 layer surface, the role of A-site MA or X-site elements in the electrochemical reconstruction and OER mechanisms has yet to be explored. Here, it is demonstrated that the OER mechanism of perovskite@zeolite composites is intrinsically dominated by the A-site group of lead-halide perovskites, while the type of X-site halogen is crucial for the reconstruction kinetics of the composites. Using CsPbBr x I 3- x @AlPO-5 ( x = 0, 1, 2, 3) as a model OER catalyst, it is found that the CsPbBr 3 @AlPO-5 behaves oxygen-intercalation pseudocapacitance during surface restructuring due to absence of halogen-ion migration and phase separation in the CsPbBr 3 , achieving a larger diffusion rate of OH − within the core-shell structure. Moreover, distinct from the single-metal-site mechanism of MAPbBr 3 @AlPO-5, experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that the soft lattice nature of CsPbBr 3 triggers the oxygen-vacancy-site mechanism via the CsPbBr 3 /α-PbO 2 interface, resulting in excellent OER performance. Owing to the variety and easy tailoring of lead-halide perovskite compositions, these findings pave a way for the development of novel perovskite@zeolite type catalysts for efficient oxygen electrocatalysis.},

  abstract     = {Graphene aerogels (GAs) with engineered architectures are a promising material for applications ranging from filtration to energy storage/conversion. However, current preparation approaches involve the combination of multiple intrinsically-different methodologies to achieve graphene-synthesis and architecture-engineering, complicating the entire procedure. Here, a novel approach to prepare GAs with engineered architectures based on the laser-upcycling of protein biowaste, hemoglobin, is introduced. Laser scanning achieves graphene-synthesis concurrently with architecture-engineering through the localized graphitization of hemoglobin along the laser-scan path, enabling the direct preparation of engineered GAs. The laser-upcycled GAs are uniquely decorated with fibrous graphitic structures, which significantly improves the surface area. Such structural formation is attributable to the inherent iron content of hemoglobin which leads to the formation of iron-based nanoparticles that catalyze the formation of nano-structured graphene. By leveraging the high electrical conductivity and unique structural morphology, the laser-upcycled GAs are applied as electrodes of symmetrical 3D supercapacitors. The fabricated supercapacitors exhibited a high specific capacitance (≈54.9 F g −1 ) and excellent cycle stability (≈94% retention), attributable to the laser-engineered architecture facilitating ion diffusion even for thick electrodes. Not only does this study provide a novel approach to prepare GAs with engineered architectures but showcases the potential of laser-upcycling in preparing advanced functional materials for future devices.},

  abstract     = {Sigal peptides have garnered remarkable efficacy in rejuvenating photoaged skin and delaying senescence. Nevertheless, their low solubility and poor permeability bring about a formidable challenge in their transdermal delivery. To address this challenge, bioactive ionic liquids (ILs) synthesized from natural glycyrrhizic acid (GA) and oxymatrine (OMT) with eminent biocompatibility is first prepared. The components ratios and inherent forming mechanisms of GA-OMT (GAO) are optimized by molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations. Remarkably, GAO can significantly improve the sparingly soluble properties of palmitoyl pentapeptide-4 (PAL-4), a model peptide drug. Subsequently, GAO self-assembled micelles loading PAL-4 (GAO/PAL-4-SM) are fabricated without additional auxiliary materials. The permeation and subcutaneous retention of PAL-4 are significantly promoted with 10wt.% GAO-SM. Moreover, GAO ILs facilitated PAL-4 permeation by enhancing its miscibility and interaction with stratum corneum (SC), offering a pulling effect and micellar structures for PAL-4, as elucidated by computational simulations. In cellular and animal photoaging experiments, GAO/PAL-4-SM possessed remarkable capabilities in boosting collagen and hyaluronic acid regeneration, mitigating inflammation and apoptosis, accelerating macrophage M2 polarization, thereby lessening skin wrinkles and leveraging elasticity. Collectively, the research innovatively designed an ILs self-assembled nano-micellar transdermal delivery system to enhance the permeability and anti-photoaging effect of signal peptides.},

  abstract     = {Spinal cord injury (SCI) impairs the central nervous system and induces the myelin-sheath-deterioration because of reactive oxygen species (ROS), further hindering the recovery of function. Herein, the simultaneously emergency treatment and dynamic luminescence severity assessment (SETLSA) strategy is designed for SCI based on cerium (Ce)-doped upconversion antioxidant nanoenzymes (Ce@UCNP-BCH). Ce@UCNP-BCH can not only efficiently eliminate the SCI localized ROS, but dynamically monitor the oxidative state in the SCI repair process using a ratiometric luminescence signal. Moreover, the classic basso mouse scale score and immunofluorescence analysis together exhibit that Ce@UCNP-BCH effectively facilitates the regeneration of spinal cord including myelin sheath, and promotes the functional recovery of SCI mice. Particularly, the study combines snATAC-eq and snRNA-seq to reveal the heterogeneity of spinal cord tissue following Ce@UCNP-BCH treatment. The findings reveal a significant increase in myelinating oligodendrocytes, as well as higher expression of myelination-related genes, and the study also reveals the gene regulatory dynamics of remyelination after treatment. Besides, the ETLSA strategy synergistically boosts ROS consumption through the superoxide dismutase (SOD)-related pathways after SOD-siRNA treatment. In conclusion, this SETLSA strategy with simultaneously blocking and dynamic monitoring oxidative stress has enriched the toolkit for promoting SCI repair.},

Development of clothing textiles with prolonged passive temperature-adaptive thermoregulation without external energy consumption is much needed for protection from thermal stress and energy saving, but very challenging. Here, a temperature-adaptive thermoregulation filament (TATF) consisting of thermoresponsive vacuum cavities formed by the temperature-responsive volume change of the material confined in the cellular cores of the filament is proposed. Using a droplet-based microfluidic system, the cellular core/sheath filament using octadecane (OD) as a temperature-responsive volume-changing material to form droplet cellular cores within the thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) sheath is fabricated. It is found that the fabric made of TATF has a remarkable temperature adaptive thermal conductivity, which increases by 83% as the mean fabric temperature increases from 20 °C to 35 °C, due to the volume change of vacuum cavities in the cellular cores of the filament in response to temperature. TATF fabrics have no problem associated with undesirable appearance changes or leakage of encapsulated molten materials as some existing thermoregulatory textiles do, and can therefore have wide applications in functional clothing for prolonged passive personal thermal management.},

Here, a new strategy is developed by employing this aberrant Cu(II)/Fe(III) to catalyze bond cleavage for fluorescent imaging of them. A short series of near-infrared fluorescent molecules ( NIRB1−NIRB6 ) is devised as substrates, wherein the specific C═C bonds can be effectively cleaved to activate red fluorophore by Cu(II)/Fe(III) catalyzing. Representatively, NIRB1 is applied for fluorescent imaging of Cu(II)/Fe(III) in living cells, zebrafish, and Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD)-afflicted mouse brains which is of significance to monitor metal safety.

  abstract     = {Flammability is a significant challenge in polymer-based electronics. In this regard, triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have enabled a safe means for harvesting mechanical energy for conversion into electrical energy. However, most existing polymers used for TENGs are sourced from petroleum-based raw materials and are highly flammable, which can further accelerate the spread of fire and harm the ecological environment. In addition, the existing intrinsic flame-retardant TENGs are not elastic at room temperature, which may potentially damage the flexible equipment and harm firefighters. This study presents an intrinsic flame-retardant bio-based elastic phytic acid polyurethane (PUPA) synthesized using a simple and efficient one-pot polycondensation. The cross-linked structure and polar phosphorus-containing segments of PUPA are fabricated into PUPA-TENG, demonstrating a superior elasticity (elongation up to 660%), flame retardancy (UL94 V-0), impact resistance (34.71 MJ m −3 ), and dielectric constant ( D k = 9.57). Consequently, this study provides a simple strategy for tailoring TENGs toward environmentally friendly and secure power generators and electronics, which can effectively reduce fire hazards and potentially be applied to other fire-risk fields such as personal protection, firefighting, and new energy.},

  abstract     = {Drug resistance is an important factor for prostate cancer (PCa) to progress into refractory PCa, and abnormal lipid metabolism usually occurs in refractory PCa, which presents great challenges for PCa therapy. Here, a cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) inhibitor sulfosuccinimidyl oleate sodium (CD36i) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) siRNA (siSCD1) are selected to inhibit lipid uptake and synthesis in PCa, respectively. To this end, a multiresponsive drug delivery nanosystem, HA@CD36i-TR@siSCD1 is designed. The hyaluronic acid (HA) gel “shell” of HA-TR nanosystem can release drugs in response to the acidic tumor microenvironment and hyaluronidase, and the tumor targeting (TR) cationic micellar “core” can release drugs in response to glutathione. This multiresponsive drug release is beneficial for the exogenous inhibition of lipid uptake by CD36i and the endogenous inhibition of lipid synthesis by siSCD1. The established HA-TR nanosystem has good tumor targeting ability and tumor penetration ability, and that HA@CD36i-TR@siSCD1 has good synergistic effects, which can significantly restrain the growth, invasion, and metastasis of PCa. Moreover, under high-fat conditions, the tumors are more sensitive to HA@CD36i-TR@siSCD1 treatment, almost no accumulation of lipid droplets is observed in HA@CD36i-TR@siSCD1-treated tumors, with enhanced antitumor immunity. Hence, this study provides a new treatment option for refractory PCa patients, especially those with a high-fat diet.},

The UC function of Er 3+ and plasmon resonance effect of Bi 2 O 3- x greatly improves the utilization of sunlight.

Furthermore, localized temperature increase, induced by photothermal effects, enhanced the chemical reaction kinetics. Benefiting from the distinctive construction, the Bi 3 O 4 Br:Er 3+ @Bi 2 O 3- x heterojunctions exhibit excellent performance in the photocatalytic degradation of bisphenol A that is 2.40 times and 4.98 times greater than that of Bi 3 O 4 Br:Er 3+ alone under full-spectrum light irradiation and near-infrared light irradiation, respectively.

Hitherto, there is no NLO scandium (Sc) chalcogenides experimentally studied. Here, new quaternary Sc thiophosphate CsScP 2 S 7 (CSPS) was synthesized by the facile metal oxide-boron-sulfur/reactive flux hybrid solid-state method. It crystallizes in the monoclinic chiral space group C 2, and the layered structure is composed by the new ScP 2 S 11 functional motifs built by ScS 6 octahedra and P 2 S 7 dimers, and the structure-performance analysis reveals that the hyperpolarizability of ScP 2 S 11 is much greater than the assembled units (ScS 6 and PS 4 ), which makes the first NLO Sc chalcogenide CSPS exhibits strong NLO response (0.8 × AGS) and high laser-induced damage threshold (LIDT) (4.3 × AGS), and a wide bandgap of 3.10 eV. With the coordination number&#39;s reduction of rare-earth (RE) ion and the rearrangement of P 2 S 7 dimers, the centrosymmetric structure of CsREP 2 S 7 family can be broken via substitution with the smallest RE element Sc to form the noncentrosymmetric structure.

  abstract     = {Mitochondrial dysfunction is a crucial event in acute kidney injury (AKI), leading to a metabolic shift toward glycolysis and increased lactate production. Lactylation, a posttranslational modification derived from lactate, plays a significant role in various cellular processes, yet its implications in AKI remain underexplored. Here, a marked increase in lactate levels and pan-Kla levels are observed in kidney tissue from AKI patients and mice, with pronounced lactylation activity in injured proximal tubular cells identified by single-cell RNA sequencing. The lactylation of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) is identified at lysine 52 (K52la), revealing that ALDH2 lactylation exacerbates tubular injury and mitochondrial dysfunction. Conversely, the ALDH2 K52R mutation alleviates these injuries in HK-2 cells and adeno-associated virus-infected kidney tissues in mice. Furthermore, ALDH2 lactylation can be modulated by upregulating SIRT3 in vivo and in vitro, which reduces ALDH2 lactylation, mitigating tubular injury and mitochondrial dysfunction. Mechanistically, immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry analysis demonstrates an interaction between ALDH2 and prohibitin 2 (PHB2), a crucial mitophagy receptor. ALDH2 lactylation promotes the ubiquitination-proteasomal degradation of PHB2 to inhibit mitophagy and worsen mitochondrial dysfunction. These findings highlight the critical role of endogenous lactate in AKI and propose ALDH2 lactylation as a potential therapeutic target.},

Here, robust and epitaxial Gd: HfO2-based film memristors are reported and construct a weighted echo state graph neural network (WESGNN). Benefiting from the optimized epitaxial films, the high switching speed (20 ns), low energy consumption (2.07 fJ), multi-value storage (4 bits), and high endurance (10 9 ) outperform most memristors. Notably, thanks to the appropriately dispersed conductance distribution (standard deviation = 7.68 nS), the WESGNN finely regulates the relative weights of input nodes and recursive matrix to realize state-of-the-art performance using the MUTAG and COLLAB datasets for graph classification tasks. Overall, robust and epitaxial film memristors offer nanoscale scalability, high reliability, and low energy consumption, making them energy-efficient hardware solutions for graph learning applications.},

Excessive activation of immune cells and damage of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are the main factors that exacerbate lung injury. Here, the multifaceted immunomodulatory nanocomplexes targeting the proinflammatory neutrophilic activation and ROS damage are established. The S100A8/9 inhibitor, ABR2575, is loaded in the nanocomplexes, which effectively blocks the neutrophils-S100A8/A9- toll-like receptors (TLRS)-Inflammasome signaling in ALI. Synergically, the SiH nanosheets are encapsulated together with ABR2575 into the core of poly(lactic- co -glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanosponges, to achieve sustainable hydrogen release for the alleviation of ROS-induced lung tissue injury, and also promote the M2 polarization of macrophages. This novel combination strategy is proven to significantly suppress the infiltration of neutrophils and pro-inflammatory macrophages into the lungs, decrease the activation of neutrophils and pro-inflammatory monocytes in the blood, facilitate the anti-inflammatory polarization of macrophages and monocytes, and reduce the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in both the lung and blood circulation, all of which alleviate the lung injuries in preclinical murine ALI models.

  abstract     = {Liquid fertilizers, particularly when integrated with precision irrigation systems, offer a more efficient and sustainable alternative to traditional solid nitrogen fertilizers. The industrial production of ammonium nitrate (NH 4 NO 3 ) is environmentally detrimental due to its reliance on fossil fuels. This study introduces an innovative air-to-NOx-to-NH 4 NO 3 pathway for synthesizing liquid nitrogen fertilizer. The process employs an underwater multi-bubble plasma reactor powered by nanosecond pulse to generate aqueous NOx, which is then partially reduced to NH 4 NO 3 through electrocatalysis. Results show that the highest NOx production rate, 786.5 mol h −1 , is achieved when the N 2 /O 2 ratio closely resemble that of air, and short pulse rise/fall times significantly increase NOx yield. Further plasma diagnostic and global plasma chemistry modeling indicate that short rise/fall times facilitate simultaneous dielectric barrier discharge and spark discharge, synergistically enhancing nitrogen fixation efficiency. The partially electro-reduced liquid NH 4 NO 3 fertilizer significantly improves plant growth, with stem length and leaf length increasing by 91.26% and 54.72%, respectively. Cost estimation reveals that 44.22% of the production cost is attributed to electricity consumption, underscoring the potential for optimization with renewable energy integration. Overall, the study provides new insight for the sustainable production and in-place utilization of liquid nitrogen fertilizers which may advance sustainable agriculture.},

  abstract     = {The development of the mammalian neocortex is precisely regulated by temporal gene expression, yet the temporal regulatory mechanisms of cortical neurogenesis, particularly how radial glial cells (RGCs) sequentially generate deep to superficial neurons, remain unclear. Here, the hnRNP family member Syncrip (hnRNP Q) is identified as a key modulator of superficial neuronal differentiation in neocortical neurogenesis. Syncrip knockout in RGCs disrupts differentiation and abnormal neuronal localization, ultimately resulting in superficial cortical layer defects as well as learning and memory impairments in mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis demonstrated that the knockout of Syncrip disrupts the late-stage neurogenesis, stalling transcriptional progression in RGCs. Mechanistically, Syncrip maintains the transcription of temporal process-related transcription factors by recruiting stabilization complexes through phase separation, crucially regulating the Notch signaling pathway that determines the fate of RGCs. Furthermore, pathogenic human mutations in Syncrip weaken its phase-separation capability, failing to form stable complexes normally. Thus, Syncrip acts as a mediator of posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms, governing the fate progression of RGCs and the advancement of intrinsic temporal programs. This study establishes an intracellular mechanism for posttranscriptional regulation of progressive fate determination in cortical neurogenesis.},

  abstract     = {Intestinal fibrosis, a severe complication of Crohn&#39;s disease (CD), is linked to chronic inflammation, but the precise mechanism by which immune-driven intestinal inflammation leads to fibrosis development is not fully understood. This study investigates the role of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in intestinal fibrosis in CD patients and a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced mouse model. Elevated MDSCs are observed in inflamed intestinal tissues prior to fibrosis and their sustained presence in fibrotic tissues of both CD patients and murine models. Depletion of MDSCs significantly reduces fibrosis, highlighting their key role in the fibrotic process. Mechanistically, MDSC-derived mCCL6 activates fibroblasts via the CCR1-MAPK signaling, and interventions targeting this axis, including neutralizing antibodies, a CCR1 antagonist, or fibroblast-specific Ccr1 knockout mice reduce fibrosis. In CD patients with stenosis, human CCL15, analogous to mCCL6, is found to be elevated in MDSCs and activated fibroblasts. Additionally, CXCR2 and CCR2 ligands are identified as key mediators of MDSC recruitment in intestinal fibrosis. Blocking MDSC recruitment with CXCR2 and CCR2 antagonists alleviates intestinal fibrosis. These findings suggest that strategies targeting MDSC recruitment and mCCL6/hCCL15 signaling could offer therapeutic benefits for intestinal fibrosis.},

Here the control of the pore orientation is demonstrated with a dealloying analogy, reduction-induced decomposition, achieved in flow cells. Via forced convection, the self-organization is placed under the control of sufficiently rapid mass transport to suppress pore branching and align 100 nm-wide ligaments and pores along the direction of reaction propagation, boosting the permeability by an order of magnitude while retaining the large surface area. The pore orientation can be further manipulated with a flow field for an orientation pattern akin to the expected fluid pattern, enabling a nanoporous silver electrode to deliver a peak power of 0.3 W cm −2 in a redox-flow battery, outperforming commercial carbon electrodes.},

  abstract     = {Rapid temperature contrast hydrotherapy by water immersion has been utilized by athletes for effective sports recovery. However, its application at some training or competition venues is limited by high water consumption, bucky size, personal hygiene, and inconvenience. Here, a novel portable system equipped with highly effective, lightweight, and hygienic wearable fluidic fabric device is reported, that replaces direct water immersion. The measured heat transfer coefficient between the skin and the fabric is 98.5 W m −2 K −1 , which is 92% of that in direct water immersion at 10 °C and significantly higher than that by previously reported cooling garments. The core layer, a flexible heat transfer panel (FHTP), can switch between cold and hot modes (5–40 °C) over an area of 0.3 m 2 . The contact condition between skin and the deformable FHTP has been considered in a new verified heat transfer model. Optimization of the parameters has resulted in excellent heat transfer performance. This fluidic fabric also holds potential in diverse applications, such as enhancing thermal safety and comfort in extreme environments (e.g., personal thermal management systems and fire-protection suits), supporting cryotherapy and thermotherapy in rehabilitation and healthcare, and simulation of total tactile sensations in virtual reality.},

  abstract     = {Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common malignancies for male individuals globally. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) initially demonstrated significant efficacy in treating PCa; however, most cases of PCa eventually progress to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which becomes increasingly challenging to manage. Notably, the loss or disruption of primary cilia in PCa cells may play a critical role in the progression of the disease, and there are no reports on the role of circular RNAs in ciliogenesis. Thus, this warrants further investigation.In this study, key circular RNAs linked to prostate cancer progression, and enzalutamide resistance is identified. Specifically, it is found that hsa_circ_0005185 interacts with OTUB1 and RAB8A, serving as a molecular scaffold. Hsa_circ_0005185 mediates the binding of the deubiquitinase OTUB1 to RAB8A, resulting in the deubiquitination of RAB8A. Consequently, the stable expression of RAB8A promotes the regeneration of primary cilia and enhances the production of GLI3R, an inhibitory factor in the Hedgehog signaling pathway, thereby suppressing AR activity and slowing the progression of CRPC.},

However, the integration of chirality within inorganic materials remains a critical challenge and developments of chirality-induced bionic bone implants are still in infancy. In this view, novel chiral hydroxyapatite (CHA) coated Ti alloys are successfully synthesized by a sophisticated chiral molecule-induced self-assembly method for the first time. The obtained samples are characterized by stereospecific L-/D-/Rac-chiral hierarchical morphology, nanotopography rough surfaces, improved hydrophilicity, and bioactivity. Following implantation into rat femoral condyle defects, the distinct stereospecific chiral hierarchical structures exhibit highly enantioselective bone-implants interactions, wherein the left-handed chirality of L-CHA strongly promotes osteoporotic osseointegration and vice versa for right-handed chirality of D-CHA. Consistently, in vitro assays further validate the superior enantiomer-dependent osteoporotic osseointegration ability of L-CHA, mainly by manipulating desired immunomodulation coupled with enhanced neurogenesis, angiogenesis, and osteogenesis. Moreover, as analyzed by transcriptomic RNA-seq, a new discovery of down-regulated IL-17 signaling pathway is considered predominately responsible for the desired immunomodulation ability of L-CHA. These results provide new insights into biological multifunctionality and mechanism underlying L-chirality&#39;s roles for bone healing, thus may inspiring developments of new generation of chiral biomaterials.},

However, both ScCas9 and its evolved Sc++ variant still exhibit low genome editing efficiency in plants, particularly at the less preferred NTG and NCG PAM targets. In this study, a chimeric SpcRN++ variant is engineered by grafting the recognition (REC) domain of SpCas9 into the Sc++ variant, incorporating the R221K/N394K mutations, and retaining the positively charged loop of S. anginosus Cas9. The SpcRN++ variant exhibits a higher genome editing capacity and wider target range than the Sc++ variant in rice protoplasts and stable transgenic plants. Further evidence indicates that nSpcRN++-based A3A/Y130F and TadA8e exhibit enhanced cytosine and adenine editing efficiency in plants. Finally, herbicide-resistant rice germplasms are produced by targeting the OsACC gene using nSpcRN++-based adenine base editors. These results demonstrate that SpcRN++ is a powerful tool for genome editing in plants, and this integrative protein engineering strategy holds promise for engineering other Cas9 proteins.},

Oral treatment of live B. intestinihominis (LBI) considerably ameliorates hyperglycemia and liver metabolic disorders in HFD/STZ-induced T2D models and db/db mice. LBI-derived acetate has similar protective effects against T2D. Mechanistically, acetate enhances fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) through inhibition of histone deacetylase 9 (HDAC9) to increase H3K27 acetylation at the FGF21 promoter. The screening puerarin from Gegen Qinlian decoction in a gut microbiota-dependent manner improved hyperglycemia and liver metabolic disorders by promoting the growth of B. intestinihominis .

One challenge of MSI heterogeneity analysis is performing an objective segmentation to differentiate the biological tissue into distinct regions with unique characteristics. However, current methods struggle due to the insufficient incorporation of biological context and high computational demand. To address these challenges, a novel deep learning-based approach is proposed, GraphMSI, which integrates metabolic profiles with spatial information to enhance MSI data analysis. Our comparative results demonstrate GraphMSI outperforms commonly used segmentation methods in both visual inspection and quantitative evaluation. Moreover, GraphMSI can incorporate partial or coarse biological contexts to improve segmentation results and enable more effective three-dimensional MSI segmentation with reduced computational requirements. These are facilitated by two optional enhanced modes: scribble-interactive and knowledge-transfer. Numerous results demonstrate the robustness of these two modes, ensuring that GraphMSI consistently retains its capability to identify biologically relevant sub-regions in complex practical applications. It is anticipated that GraphMSI will become a powerful tool for spatial heterogeneity analysis in MSI data.},

However, stabilizing the high density of PM-N x sites remains a challenge, primarily due to the inherently high free energy of isolated metal atoms, predisposing them to facile atomic agglomeration. Herein, a molten salt-assisted synthesis strategy is proposed to prepare porous PM 1 /N-C Pores (PM = Ru, Pt, and Pd) electrocatalysts with densely accessible PM-N x sites. A hierarchically porous N-doped carbon substrate (N-C Pores ), synthesized via the NaCl-assisted pyrolysis of zeolitic imidazolate framework-8, effectively improves the utilization of PM-N x sites by increased reactants accessible surface area and reduced mass transfer resistance. In accordance with theoretical calculations, the as-prepared Ru 1 /N-C Pores , featuring superior intrinsic active Ru-N 4 sites, exhibit outstanding ORR turnover frequency of 6.19 e − site −1 s −1 , and outperforms the commercial Pt/C with a 5.3-fold of mass activity (5.83 ± 0.61 A mg −1 ) at 0.8 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. The commendable activity and stability of Ru 1 /N-C Pores in a real fuel cell device further affirm its practical applicability.},

While the analysis of PXRD often requires extensive human manual intervention, and most automated method only achieved at coarse-grained level. The more difficult and important task of fine-grained crystal structure prediction from PXRD remains unaddressed. This study introduces XtalNet, the first equivariant deep generative model for end-to-end crystal structure prediction from PXRD. Unlike previous crystal structure prediction methods that rely solely on composition, XtalNet leverages PXRD as an additional condition, eliminating ambiguity and enabling the generation of complex organic structures with up to 400 atoms in the unit cell. XtalNet comprises two modules: a Contrastive PXRD-Crystal Pretraining (CPCP) module that aligns PXRD space with crystal structure space, and a Conditional Crystal Structure Generation (CCSG) module that generates candidate crystal structures conditioned on PXRD patterns. Evaluation on two MOF datasets (hMOF-100 and hMOF-400) demonstrates XtalNet&#39;s effectiveness. XtalNet achieves a top-10 Match Rate of 90.2% and 79% for hMOF-100 and hMOF-400 in conditional crystal structure prediction task, respectively. XtalNet enables the direct prediction of crystal structures from experimental measurements, eliminating the need for manual intervention and external databases.

Key solutions are presented for stimulation, wave decoding, and stiffness reconstruction of shear waves at multiple harmonic frequencies, all tuned to provide consistent stiffness values across resolutions from microns to millimeters. OMTHE&#39;s versatility is demonstrated by simulations, phantoms, Bacillus subtilis biofilms, zebrafish embryos and adult zebrafish, reflecting the diversity of biological systems from a mechanics perspective.

  abstract     = {The developmental competence and epigenetic progression of oocytes gradually become dysregulated with increasing maternal age. However, the mechanisms underlying age-related epigenetic regulation in oocytes remain poorly understood. Zygote arrest proteins 1 and 2 (ZAR1/2) are two maternal factors with partially redundant roles in maintaining oocyte quality, mainly known by regulating mRNA stability. In addition to this known function, it is found that ZAR1/2 is required for oocyte epigenetic maturation and zygotic reprogramming. Zar1/2 -deleted oocytes exhibited reduced levels of multiple histone modifications and of the expression of corresponding histone modifiers, along with over-condensed chromatin, leading to compromised minor zygotic genome activation and deficient embryo development following fertilization. Cytoplasmic ZAR1/2 participated in intranuclear epigenetic maturation by binding the transcripts encoding histone modifiers and regulating their stability and translational activity. Moreover, oocytes from aged mice exhibited similar histone-modification deficiencies as the Zar1/2 -deleted oocytes. ZAR1/2 mRNA and protein levels are downregulated in oocytes from mice and women with advanced ages, suggesting ZAR1/2 as regulators of epigenetic changes with reproductive aging. This study presents a new nucleo-cytoplasmic interaction mechanism that is involved in preventing oocyte epigenetic aging. Further, ZAR1/2 represents potential gene targets for diagnosis and clinical interventions in age-associated deficiencies in oocyte and embryo development.},

However, they may suffer delamination and/or debonding due to their low interfacial toughness. In addition, they usually exhibit a small measurement range resulting from their limited stiffness variation range. In this paper, soft silicone-based capacitive sensors are developed by using a customized multimaterial 3D printer. By curing silicone materials simultaneously, the continuous conductive and dielectric layers achieve a substantial interfacial toughness of 1036 J·m −2 . The sensor with tilted thin-plate dielectrics exhibits interfacial toughness of 645 J·m −2 or 339 J·m −2 in the transverse or longitudinal direction, respectively. Additionally, the sensors demonstrate a broad measurement range from 0.85 Pa to 5000 kPa. This extended range is facilitated by the significant stiffness variation of the separated tilted thin-plate dielectrics, ranging from 0.56 kPa to 19.76 MPa. Two applications of these fully printed soft sensors, including an intelligent sensorized insole and a robotic hand combining both soft actuators and soft sensors are showcased. It is believed that the strategy, employing 3D printing for soft microstructured sensors, is a general approach not only applicable for improving the performance of soft sensors, but also conducive to designing powerful soft functional devices.},

Therefore, the recognition of G4s by specific proteins is crucial for modulating physiological and pathological pathways. Given the growing interest in DNA G4s, a deeper understanding of the proteins that interact with them and their molecular recognition is imperative. This study demonstrates that KHSRP binds to these DNA structures. Biophysical analyses provide insights into the thermodynamics, kinetics, and structural aspects of these interactions, showing that G4 structural variability significantly influences KHSRP binding, in which the KH3 protein domain plays a key role. Validation of these interactions in cancer cells further highlights their biological relevance. Notably, the G4 ligand pyridostatin affects KHSRP/G4 interactions both in vitro and in cells, suggesting that small molecules can modulate this molecular recognition. These findings underscore KHSRP&#39;s potential role in regulating cellular mechanisms through binding to G4-forming DNA, positioning it as a possible therapeutic target in cancer.},

  abstract     = {Mild hyperthermia therapy has garnered interest as an adjunctive treatment for bone repair. However, its optimal timing, duration, and underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, how mild hyperthermia supports bone repair during the early stages is assesed. These findings reveal that mild hyperthermia accelerates bone regeneration by dynamically regulating inducible nitric oxide synthase/arginase 1 (iNOS/Arg1) balance. This process involves macrophage polarization to the M1 phenotype through iNOS activation, followed by a rapid transition to the M2 phenotype through Arg1 activation after 3 days of sustained mild hyperthermia. RNA-Seq reveals that a single day of mild hyperthermia induced immune alterations aligned with the early inflammatory phase of bone repair, characterized by osteoclast activation, cell recruitment, and neovascularization, thereby preparing for the transition to the repair phase. Experiments involving subcutaneous abscesses, subcutaneous embedding, and critical cranial bone defects further confirm that early mild hyperthermia treatment dynamically regulates macrophage phenotypes. This regulation enhances early antibacterial activity, promotes angiogenesis, and facilitates the transition from inflammation to repair, ultimately accelerating bone-defect repair. This study is the first to elucidate the dual temporal effects of early mild hyperthermia on immune regulation, offering insights into the optimal timing and duration of photothermal therapy following bone repair surgery.},

In this study, personalized dorsal and ventral forebrain organoids (DFOs/VFOs) are generated derived from brain astrocytes of patients with FCD type II (FCD II). The pathological features of dysmorphic neurons, balloon cells, and astrogliosis are successfully replicated in patient-derived DFOs, but not in VFOs. It is noteworthy that cardiomyocyte-like cells correlated with dysmorphic neurons are generated through the high activation of BMP and WNT signaling in some of the FCD-organoids and patient cortical tissues. Moreover, functional assessments demonstrated the occurrence of epileptiform burst firing and propagative self-assembling neuronal hyperactivity in both FCD-DFOs and VFOs. Additionally, the heterotopic cardiomyocyte-organoids demonstrated the capacity for cardiomyocyte contraction and rhythmic firing. The presence of these cardiomyocytes contributes to the hyperactivity of neural networks in cardioids-DFOs assembly. In conclusion, the personalized region-specific forebrain organoids derived from FCD patient astrocytes effectively recapitulate heterogeneous pathological features, offering a valuable platform for the development of precise therapeutic strategies.},

  abstract     = {Biopharmaceuticals are the fastest-growing class of drugs in the healthcare industry, but their global reach is severely limited by their propensity for rapid aggregation. Currently, surfactant excipients such as polysorbates and poloxamers are used to prevent protein aggregation, which significantly extends shelf-life. Unfortunately, these excipients are themselves unstable, oxidizing rapidly into 100s of distinct compounds, some of which cause severe adverse events in patients. Here, the highly stable, well-defined, and modular nature of amphiphilic polyacrylamide-derived excipients is leveraged to isolate the key mechanisms responsible for excipient-mediated protein stabilization. With a library of compositionally identical but structurally distinct amphiphilic excipients, a new property is quantified, compositional dispersity, that is key to excipient performance and utilized this property to rationally design new ultra-stable surfactant excipients that increase the stability of a notoriously unstable biopharmaceutical, monomeric insulin, by an order of magnitude. This comprehensive and generalizable understanding of excipient structure-function relationships represents a paradigm shift for the formulation of biopharmaceuticals, moving away from trial-and-error screening approaches toward rational design.},

These findings indicate combined filamentary RS and ferroelectric switching occurs in devices with designed electrodes, having an ON/OFF ratio of over 100 during about 10 5 cycles. Transport measurements of modified device stacks show no change in SOT when the ferroelectric YHO layer is replaced with an equivalent hafnia-based layer, Hf 0.5 Zr 0.5 O 2 (HZO). However, incomplete SOT is observed for variations in the top electrode thickness or material, as well as LSMO electrode thickness. This underscores the importance of employing oxygen-reactive electrodes and a bottom electrode with reduced conductivity to stabilize SOT.

However, controllably tuning nanochannel spaces with specific sizes and simultaneously achieving high mechanical strength remain the main challenges. In this work, the inter-sheet gallery d-spacing of graphene oxide (GO) membrane is successfully tailored with high mechanical strength via a general radical-induced polymerization strategy. The introduced amide groups from N-Vinylformamide significantly reinforce the 2D nanochannels within the freestanding membranes, resulting in an ultrahigh tensile strength of up to 105 MPa. The d-spacing of the membrane is controllably tuned within a range of 0.799–1.410 nm, resulting in a variable water permeance of up to 218 L m −2 h −1 bar −1 (1304% higher than that of the pristine GO membranes). In particular, the tailored membranes demonstrate excellent water permeance stability (140 L m −2 h −1 bar −1 ) in a 200-h long-term operation and high selectivity of solutes under harsh conditions, including a wide range of pH from 4.0 to 10.0, up to a loading pressure of 12 bar and an external temperature of 40 °C. This approach comprehensively achieves a balance between sieving performance and mechanical strength, satisfying the requirements for the next-generation molecular sieving membranes.},

Hybrid epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) cells within the tumors are correlated with augmented proliferative capacity and facilitation of lung metastasis. Single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomic sequencing are employed to reveal the hybrid EMT subsets within the vascular fibroblast microenvironment. These hybrid EMT cells exhibit a pro-tumorigenic impact in vitro. Notably, cadherin 11 (CDH11), a specific marker for hybrid EMT cells, may exert its regulatory role in cellular function by interfering with branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) metabolism by inhibiting branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase to activate the mammalian target of the rapamycin pathway, thus making it a potential therapeutic target for SACC. Furthermore, celecoxib and its derivatives are specific CDH11 inhibitors that regulate BCAA metabolism, increase reactive oxygen species production, and subsequently activate the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of the interferongene pathway (cGAS-STING). They also inhibit lung metastasis in NOD-SCID mice in vivo. Overall, these findings suggest a promising treatment strategy that targets hybrid EMT cells to mitigate lung metastasis in SACC. Celecoxib may serve as a promising clinical intervention for the treatment of lung metastases in patients with SACC.},

However, the pre-vascularization of liver organoids without affecting liver parenchymal specification remains a long-lasting challenge, which is essential for their application in regenerative medicine. Here, the large-scale formation of pre-vascularized human hepatobiliary organoids (vhHBOs) is presented without affecting liver epithelial specification via a novel strategy, namely nonparenchymal cell grafting (NCG). Endothelial and mesenchymal cells are grafted to human hepatobiliary organoids (hHBOs) at the different liver epithelial differentiation stages without supplementing with nonparenchymal culture medium and growth factors. Endothelial grafting at the stage of hepatic maturation offers an optimal integration efficiency compared to the stage of hepatic specification. Additionally, grafting with mesenchymal proves crucial in endothelial invading and sprouting into the liver epithelial cells during the establishment of vhHBOs. Ectopic liver implants into mice further displayed integration of vhHBOs into mice vascular networks. Notably, transplanted vhHBOs self-organized into native liver tissue like hepatic zone and bile ducts, indicating their potential to regenerate damaged hepatic and bile duct tissues.

  abstract     = {Monitoring deep wounds is challenging but necessary for high-quality medical treatment. Current methodologies for deep wound monitoring are typically limited to indirect clinical symptoms or costly non-real-time imaging diagnosis. Herein, a smart system is proposed that enables in situ monitoring of deep wounds’ status through a semi-implantable device composed of 2 seamlessly connected functional components: 1) the well-designed, microchannel-structured sampling needles that efficiently and conveniently collect samples from deep wound anatomical locations, and 2) the multiplex biochemical testing compartment that facilitates the immediate and persistent detection of multiple biochemical indicators based on a color image processing software accessible to a conventional smartphone. With the 3 representative preclinical deep wound models, the study demonstrates the device&#39;s potential to monitor wound infection, inflammation, healing progress, and reduce inflammation when applied to deep skin injury, surgical implantation, and postoperative intestinal leakage. The device&#39;s capability to rapidly and accurately identify pathogenic bacteria is also demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo, potentially facilitating precise intervention in infected wounds. Coupled with the device&#39;s favorable biocompatibility and cost-effectiveness, this intelligent system emerges as a promising tool for safe and effective management of complicated deep wounds.},

  abstract     = {β-secretase (BACE1) is instrumental in amyloid-β (Aβ) production, with overexpression noted in Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD) neuropathology. The interaction of Aβ with the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) facilitates cerebral uptake of Aβ and exacerbates its neurotoxicity and neuroinflammation, further augmenting BACE1 expression. Given the limitations of previous BACE1 inhibition efforts, the study explores reducing BACE1 expression to mitigate AD pathology. The research reveals that the anticancer agent 6-thioguanosine (6-TG) markedly diminishes BACE1 expression without eliciting cytotoxicity while enhancing microglial phagocytic activity, and ameliorate cognitive impairments with reducing Aβ accumulation in AD mice. Leveraging advanced deep learning-based tool for target identification, and corroborating with surface plasmon resonance assays, it is elucidated that 6-TG directly interacts with RAGE, modulating BACE1 expression through the JAK2-STAT1 pathway and elevating soluble RAGE (sRAGE) levels in the brain. The findings illuminate the therapeutic potential of 6-TG in ameliorating AD manifestations and advocate for small molecule strategies to increase brain sRAGE levels, offering a strategic alternative to the challenges posed by the complexity of AD.},

  abstract     = {High soluble protein expression in heterologous hosts is crucial for various research and applications. Despite considerable research on the impact of codon usage on expression levels, the relationship between protein sequence and expression is often overlooked. In this study, a novel connection between protein expression and sequence is uncovered, leading to the development of SRAB (Strength of Relative Amino Acid Bias) based on AEI (Amino Acid Expression Index). The AEI served as an objective measure of this correlation, with higher AEI values enhancing soluble expression. Subsequently, the pre-trained protein model MP-TRANS (MindSpore Protein Transformer) is developed and fine-tuned using transfer learning techniques to create 88 prediction models (MPB-EXP) for predicting heterologous expression levels across 88 species. This approach achieved an average accuracy of 0.78, surpassing conventional machine learning methods. Additionally, a mutant generation model, MPB-MUT, is devised and utilized to enhance expression levels in specific hosts. Experimental validation demonstrated that the top 3 mutants of xylanase (previously not expressed in Escherichia coli ) successfully achieved high-level soluble expression in E. coli . These findings highlight the efficacy of the developed model in predicting and optimizing gene expression based on protein sequences.},

In particular, distinct anisotropic screening behaviors are predicted to occur in Dirac nodal line semimetals (DNLSMs) due to their peculiar anisotropic low-energy dispersion. Despite the recent extensive theoretical research, experimental observations of exotic charge screening in DNLSMs remain elusive, which is partly attributed to the coexisting trivial bands near the Fermi energy. This study reports the first direct observation of highly anisotropic charge-screening behavior in the DNLSM SrAs 3 . Through atomically resolved conductance measurements, a highly anisotropic charge-screening pattern around charged impurities on a surface is demonstrated. Moreover, the combination of model studies and first-principles calculations reveals the unique nature of the screening anisotropy in DNLSMs. The results of this study are expected to pave the way for understanding the profound collective behavior of interacting low-energy fermions in topological materials.},

Although the mortality rate of the COVID-19 infection is now declining, it is often accompanied by new clinical sequelae with different symptoms such as fatigue after infection, loss of smell. The degree of age, gender, virus infection seems to be weakly correlated with clinical symptoms. Human genetic variation plays a significant role in the sequelae of the COVID-19 infection. This study aims to analyze the genomic differences between individuals with different COVID-19 sequelae. In this study, the exomes of 97 patients with Omicron with 8 unique clinical manifestations are sequenced, and conducted a systematic analysis. Based on non-negative matrix factorization algorithms, the trinucleotide mutation spectrum of four long-term COVID-19 genomes is summarized and found that individuals with different clinical symptoms have unique DNA mutation patterns and indel patterns. By constructing a Genomic Fingerprinting Framework, the driver genes of variation in each symptomatic population are deciphered and analyzed. This study showed that population-specific mutational fingerprint differences are the main cause of heterogeneity in long-term COVID-19 sequelae.

Here, a global synthesis including 3240 observations from 199 published isotope pairing studies is conducted and finds that denitrification governs microbial N loss globally (79.8±0.4%). Significantly, anammox is more important in aquatic than terrestrial ecosystems worldwide and can contribute up to 43.2% of N loss in global seawater. Global maps for N loss associated with denitrification and anammox are further generated and show that the contribution of anammox to N loss decreases with latitude for soils and sediments but generally increases with substrate depth. This work highlights the importance of anammox as well as denitrification in driving ecosystem N losses, which is critical for improving the current global N cycle model and achieving sustainable N management.},

  abstract     = {Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) accounts for about 90% of esophageal cancer cases. The lack of effective therapeutic targets makes it difficult to improve the overall survival of patients with ESCC. Reticulon 4 Interacting Protein 1 (RTN4IP1) is a novel mitochondrial oxidoreductase. Here, a notable upregulation of RTN4IP1 is demonstrated, which is associated with poor survival in patients with ESCC. RTN4IP1 depletion impairs cell proliferation and induces apoptosis of ESCC cells. Furthermore, c-Myc regulates RTN4IP1 expression via iron regulatory protein 2 (IRP2) at the post-transcriptional level. Mechanistically, RTN4IP1 mRNA harbors functional iron-responsive elements (IREs) in the 3′ UTR, which can be targeted by IRP2, resulting in increased mRNA stability. Finally, RTN4IP1 depletion abrogates amino acid uptake and induces amino acid starvation via downregulation of the amino acid transporters SLC1A5, SLC3A2, and SLC7A5, indicating a possible pathway through which RTN4IP1 contributes to ESCC carcinogenesis and progression. In vivo studies using cell-derived xenograft and patient-derived xenograft mouse models as well as a 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide-induced ESCC model in esophageal-specific Rtn4ip1 knockout mice demonstrate the essential role of RTN4IP1 in ESCC development. Thus, RTN4IP1 emerges as a key cancer-promoting protein in ESCC, suggesting therapeutic RTN4IP1 suppression as a promising strategy for ESCC treatment.},

Previous reviews on lattice metamaterials have largely focused on a specific/single physical field, with limited discussion on their multi-physical properties, interaction mechanisms, and multifunctional applications. Accordingly, this article critically reviews the design principles, structure-mechanism-property relationships, interaction mechanisms, and multifunctional applications of multi-physical lattice metamaterials enabled by AM techniques. First, lattice metamaterials are categorized into homogeneous lattices, inhomogeneous lattices, and other forms, whose design principles and AM processes are critically discussed, including the benefits and drawbacks of different AM techniques for fabricating different types of lattices. Subsequently, the structure–mechanism–property relationships and interaction mechanisms of lattice metamaterials in a range of physical fields, including mechanical, acoustic, electromagnetic/optical, and thermal disciplines, are summarized to reveal critical design principles. Moreover, the multifunctional applications of lattice metamaterials, such as sound absorbers, insulators, and manipulators, sensors, actuators, and soft robots, thermal management, invisible cloaks, and biomedical implants, are enumerated. These design principles and structure-mechanism-property relationships provide effective design guidelines for lattice metamaterials in multifunctional applications.},

Timely diagnosis and intervention can significantly reduce the risk of new-onset stroke in patients with MMD. However, the current diagnostic methods are invasive and expensive, and non-invasive diagnosis using biomarkers of MMD is rarely reported. To address this issue, nanoparticle-enhanced laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI MS) was employed to record serum metabolic fingerprints (SMFs) with the aim of establishing a non-invasive diagnosis method for MMD. Subsequently, a diagnostic model was developed based on deep learning algorithms, which exhibited high accuracy in differentiating the MMD group from the HC group (AUC = 0.958, 95% CI of 0.911 to 1.000). Additionally, hierarchical clustering analysis revealed a significant association between SMFs across different groups and vascular cognitive impairment in MMD. This approach holds promise as a novel and intuitive diagnostic method for MMD. Furthermore, the study may have broader implications for the diagnosis of other neurological disorders.},

  abstract     = {Neuropathic pain, one of the most refractory pain diseases, remains a formidable medical challenge. There is still an unmet demand for effective and safe therapies to address this condition. Herein, a rat model of nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain is first established to explore its pathophysiological characteristics. Recognizing the role of neuroinflammation, an inflammation-resolving amphiphilic conjugate PPT is designed and synthesized by simultaneously conjugating polyethylene glycol, phenylboronic acid pinacol ester, and Tempol onto a cyclic scaffold. PPT can self-assemble into nanomicelles (termed PPTN). Following intravenous injection, PPTN preferentially accumulates in the injured nerve, ameliorates the neuroinflammatory milieu, and promotes nerve regeneration, thereby shortening neuropathic pain duration in rats. Moreover, the Ca 2+ channel α2δ1 subunit is identified as a therapeutic target by RNA-sequencing analysis of the injured nerve. Based on this target, a mimicking peptide (AD peptide) is screened as an analgesic. By packaging AD peptide into PPTN, a combination nano-analgesic APTN is developed. Besides potentiated anti-hyperalgesic effects due to site-specific delivery and on-demand release of AD peptide at target sites, APTN simultaneously inhibits neuroinflammation and promotes nerve regeneration by reprogramming macrophages via regulating MAPK/NF-kB signaling pathways and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, thus affording synergistic efficacies in treating nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain.},

  abstract     = {The translation of cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) into biogenic gene delivery systems is limited by relatively inefficient loading strategies. In this work, the loading of various nucleic acids into small EVs via their spontaneous hybridization with preloaded non-lamellar liquid crystalline lipid nanoparticles (LCNPs), forming hybrid EVs (HEVs) is described. It is demonstrated that LCNPs undergo pH-dependent structural transitions from inverse hexagonal ( H II ) phases at pH 5 to more disordered non-lamellar phases, possibly inverse micellar ( L 2 ) or sponge ( L 3 ) phases, at pH 7.4, which are particularly suitable for inducing a controlled hybridization process with EVs. State-of-the-art single-particle analysis techniques reveal that LCNPs interact with various EV subpopulations at physiological conditions and that ≈40% of HEVs are loaded with the genetic cargo. Importantly, this study demonstrates that EV membrane proteins remain accessible on HEV surfaces, with their intrinsic enzymatic activity unaffected after the hybridization process. Finally, HEVs show in vitro improved transfection efficiencies compared to unhybridized LCNPs. In summary, this versatile platform holds potential for loading various nucleic acid molecules into native EVs and may help developing EV-based therapeutics.},

  abstract     = {Introducing distinctive functional groups to expand the structural diversity and improve the intrinsic properties of parent molecules has been an essential pursuit in organic chemistry. By using perfluoroalkyl halide (PFAH) as a nontraditional, readily available, ideal 1,2-difluoroalkenyl coupling partner, a defluorinative cyclization reaction of enamides for the construction of fluoroalkenyl oxazoles is first developed. The selective and controllable two-fold cleavage of vicinal C(sp 3 )─F bonds in PFAH not only enables the introduction of a specific 1,2-difluoroalkenyl moiety with ease but also results in the functionalization of two C(sp 2 )─H bonds of enamides without the need for metal catalyst, photocatalyst, oxidant, or light. The method can be applied to the late-stage modification of complex molecules, synthesis of biological-relevant oxazole analoges, and scale-up synthesis, which all further highlight the real-world utility of this protocol. Mechanistic studies reveal that the reaction possibly proceeds through a radical perfluoroalkylation, consecutive C─F bond heterolytic cleavage, and cyclization process. In addition, the in situ formed perfluoroalkyl radical which may also serve as an essential hydrogen abstractor.},

  abstract     = {Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) within the tumor microenvironment (TME) contribute to the malignant progression of tumors by exerting immunosuppressive effects. Bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) have been widely demonstrated in various types of solid tumors. LPS can promote the malignant progression of tumors, which mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, a type of MDSC-like tumor cells (MLTCs) is found in tumor tissues induced by low-dose and long-term LPS stimulation. MLTCs can simultaneously express tumor cell and MDSCs markers. Similar to MDSCs, MLTCs can produce arginine, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen species and inhibit the activity of NK and T cells to promote the formation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment. MLTCs can also promote tumor cell proliferation and vasculogenic mimicry formation. CRISPR-Cas9 activity screening studies identified RNA-binding Fox-1 homolog 3 (Rbfox3) as a critical protein for MLTCs formation after LPS treatment. Rbfox3 can transcriptionally regulate the expression of Ass1 in the form of phase-separated particles. Crocin can inhibit the generation of MLTCs by disrupting phase-separated particles of Rbfox3 and enhance the anti-tumor effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).},

Notably, matrix rigidity has emerged as a pivotal regulator of macrophage activation through mechanotransduction. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the interplay between mechanical and biochemical cues within the nuclear milieu remain elusive. Here We elucidate how the increased matrix rigidity drives macrophages to amplify alternatively-activated (M2 phenotype) signaling cooperatively with biochemical cues (e.g., IL4/13) through altered nuclear mechanics. We demonstrate that reconstructed podosome-like F-actins and contractility induce nucleus deformation, opening nuclear pores, which facilitates nuclear translocation of the key transcription factor STAT6. Furthermore, the altered nuclear mechanics increases chromatin accessibility induced by H3K9 methylation, particularly of M2-associated gene promoters. These cooperative events of the mechano-chemical signaling at the cytoskeletal-to-nuclear domains facilitate M2 transcriptional activation and cellular functions. We further evidence the rigidity-primed M2 macrophages are immunosuppressive and accumulated within stiffened tumors in patients. This study proposes a mechanism by which matrix mechanics crosstalks with biochemical signals to potentiate macrophage activation through nuclear mechanosensing and chromatin modifications, offering insights into macrophage mechanobiology and its therapeutic modulations.},

  abstract     = {Personalized neoantigen cancer mRNA vaccines are promising candidates for precision medicine. However, the difficulty of identifying neoantigens heavily hinders their broad applicability. This study developed a universal strategy of anti-tumor mRNA vaccine by harnessing “off-the-shelf” immunity to known antigens. First, the model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) is used for mRNA vaccine design. In vitro test indicated that this mRNA vaccine reprogrammed tumor cells that can be recognized and killed by OVA-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). In situ mRNA vaccine notably inhibited tumor growth across three subcutaneous solid tumor models in mice. Further single-cell sequencing analyses revealed that mRNA vaccination act to reshape the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) toward more proinflammatory characteristics. Strikingly, this framework of mRNA-based strategy can be applied to two clinical pathogen antigens, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (SRBD). Interestingly, the mRNA-based strategy largely recapitulated the scenario of spontaneous cancer regression following pathogen infection or vaccination. Collectively, this study provides not only proof of concept for universal anti-tumor mRNA therapy, but also mechanistic insights in echoing the long-standing puzzle of spontaneous cancer regression.},

  abstract     = {Liver metastasis is the main cause of cancer-related mortality. During the metastasis process, circulating carcinoma cells hardly pass through narrow capillaries, leading to nuclear deformation. However, the effects of nuclear deformation and its underlying mechanisms on metastasis need further study. Here, it is shown that mechanical force-induced nuclear deformation exacerbates liver metastasis by activating the cGAS-STING pathway, which promotes splenocyte infiltration in the liver. Mechanical force results in nuclear deformation and rupture of the nuclear envelope with inevitable DNA leakage. Cytoplasmic DNA triggers the activation of cGAS-STING pathway, enhancing the production of IL6, TNFα, and CCL2. Additionally, splenocyte recruitment by the proinflammatory cytokines support carcinoma cell survival and colonization in the liver. Importantly, both intervening activity of cGAS and blocking of splenocyte migration to the liver efficiently ameliorate liver metastasis. Overall, these findings reveal a mechanism by which mechanical force-induced nuclear deformation exacerbates liver metastasis by regulating splenocyte infiltration into the liver and support targeting cGAS and blocking splenocyte recruitment as candidate therapeutic approaches for liver metastasis.},

  abstract     = {Inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a promising approach to elicit enduring antitumor immune responses. Hence, extensive efforts are being made to develop ICD inducers. Herein, a cascaded dual-atom nanozyme with Fe and Cu sites (FeCu-DA) as an efficient ICD inducer is presented. The Fe and Cu dual-atom sites synergistically enhance peroxidase (POD) and catalase activities, effectively converting intratumoral hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) to hydroxyl radicals (·OH) and oxygen (O 2 ). Moreover, FeCu-DA exhibits superior glutathione-oxidase (GSH-OXD) activity, catalyzing GSH oxidation to generate H 2 O 2 , enabling cascaded catalysis for sustainable ∙OH generation and reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) resistance by consuming GSH. Steady–state kinetic analysis and density functional theory calculations indicate that FeCu-DA exhibits a higher catalytic rate and efficiency than Fe single-atom nanozymes (Fe-SA) because of its stronger interactions with H 2 O 2 . Its POD activity is 948.05 U mg −1 , which is 2.8-fold greater than that of Fe-SA. Furthermore, FeCu-DA exhibits impressive photothermal effects and photothermal-enhanced cascaded catalysis kinetics for ROS generation, thereby inducing potent ICD. Combined with anti-PD-L1 antibody (αPD-L1) blockade, FeCu-DA shows synergistic enhancement in treatment under near-infrared irradiation. This study provides insights for designing efficient dual-atom nanozymes and demonstrates their potential in ICD-induced cancer immunotherapy.},

  abstract     = {Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 4 (TRAF4), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is frequently overexpressed in tumors. Although its cytoplasmic role in tumor progression is well-documented, the precise mechanisms underlying its nuclear localization and functional contributions in tumor cells remain elusive. This study demonstrated a positive correlation between the expression of nuclear TRAF4 and both tumor grades and stemness signatures in human cancer tissues. Notably, reduced nuclear TRAF4 led to decreased stemness properties and metastatic dormancy of tumor cells. Conversely, restoring nuclear TRAF4 in TRAF4-knockout (TRAF4-KO) cells augmented these cellular capabilities. Within the nucleus, the TRAF domain of TRAF4 interacted with c-Jun, thereby stimulating its transcriptional activity. This interaction subsequently led to an enhancement of the promoter activity of interleukin-8 (IL-8), which is identified as a mediator of nuclear TRAF4-induced tumor dormancy. Additionally, activation of AKT signaling by nerve growth factor facilitated TRAF4 phosphorylation at Ser242, enhancing its interaction with 14-3-3θ and promoting its nuclear translocation. Importantly, pharmacological modulation of TRAF4 nuclear translocation is found to suppress tumor tumorigenicity and metastasis in tumor models. This study highlights the critical role of nuclear TRAF4 in regulating tumor stemness and dormancy, positioning it as a potential therapeutic target for metastatic and refractory cancers.},

  abstract     = {The filterless single-pixel imaging technology is anticipated to hold tremendous competitiveness in diverse imaging applications. Nevertheless, achieving single-pixel color imaging without a filter remains a formidable challenge. Here a lead-free perovskite hemispherical photodetector is reported for filterless single-pixel color imaging. Through passivating the active vacancy and antisite defects with functional chemical groups, the trap density of the perovskite film can be dramatically reduced to half of the pristine one, which results in a stable device with 0.69 nA standard deviation (SD) of the current fluctuations for over 10 000 s. The exceptional stability and remarkable low light response capability of passivated lead-free perovskite devices ensure reliable and repeated distinguishment to high-frequency color information of Fourier patterns. High-resolution color imaging with 256 × 256 pixels can be achieved by integrating the Bayer template with Fourier patterns and designing a corresponding color restoration algorithm. Notably, its imaging quality surpasses commercial silicon photomultiplier tubes (SiPMs) under low light intensities or high-temperature conditions as demonstrated by the larger signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This work presents a novel approach for applying perovskite photodetectors in single-pixel color imaging, propelling the advancement of filterless color imaging technology.},

  abstract     = {Periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory disease, is the leading cause of tooth loss in adults and is one of the most prevalent and complex oral conditions. Oxidative stress induced by the excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leads to periodontitis, which is closely associated with pathological processes, including mitochondrial dysfunction of periodontal cells and local immune dysregulation. However, current treatment modalities that target single pathological processes have limited long-term therapeutic effects. Herein, a multifunctional Yolk–Shell nanozyme, Au@CeO 2 -dimethyl fumarate (DMF), which comprehensively addresses the oxidative stress-induced pathophysiological processes of periodontitis through antioxidant activity, mitochondrial maintenance, and immune modulation mechanisms, is described. For material design logic, functionally complementary Au and CeO 2 formed an excellent photothermally regulated high-efficiency nanozyme, which also provided an ideal drug carrier for DMF. As for the therapeutic logic, Au@CeO 2 -DMF restores mitochondrial dysfunction and immune dysregulation, which also contributes to endogenous ROS elimination, thereby achieving long-term stable therapeutic effects. In a rat model, local Au@CeO 2 -DMF photothermal therapy effectively alleviated ROS-induced tissue damage and restored periodontal homeostasis. Altogether, this study presents a novel antioxidant nanozyme for managing alveolar bone loss under prolonged oxidative stress and demonstrates the importance of comprehensive intervention in key pathological processes in periodontitis treatment design.},

Understanding the interactions between various types of cells in the TME can suggest innovative therapeutic strategies. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) and clinical samples, fibroblast growth factor-19 (FGF19, rodent FGF15) is found to mediate a significant interaction between CRC cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), activating the hepatic stellate cells (HSCs)-to-CAFs differentiation. In various CRC metastatic mouse models, it is shown that FGF15 has a more pronounced effect on liver metastasis compared to pulmonary metastasis. More importantly, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are also identified from the RNA-Seq dataset upon the activation of HSCs by FGF19 and compared the DEGs in matched primary and metastatic mRNA samples from patients with CRC liver metastasis (CRCLM), it is found that the ANGPTL4 gene is significantly associated with HSCs activation. Different mouse models also demonstrated the impact of the FGF19/ANGPTL4 axis on the severity of CRCLM. Importantly, disruption of this axis significantly inhibits CRCLM in vivo. This study is among the first to demonstrate the impact of the FGF19/ANGPTL4 axis on CRCLM, offering a novel therapeutic strategy.},

  abstract     = {Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is the most lethal tumor arising from thyroid follicular epithelium. Lenvatinib is an off-label use option for ATC patients in many countries but an approved prescription in Japan. However, lenvatinib resistance is a substantial clinical challenge. Clinical ATC samples including lenvatinib-resistant tumors are used to build patient-derived cells and patient-derived xenografts. High-throughput drug screening and synergy analyses are performed to identify an effective combination partner for lenvatinib. Cellular functions are detected by cell senescence, apoptosis, cell cycle, cell viability and colony formation assays. CDK2 inhibition showed the significant synthetic lethality with lenvatinib via inhibiting G1/S transition and inducing cell senescence in ATC. High expression of CDK2 is associated with lenvatinib resistance and poor clinical outcomes of ATC patients. Lenvatinib increased protein expression of CDK2 in lenvatinib-resistant ATC cells. Mechanistically, lenvatinib inhibited protein degradation of CDK2 via reducing CDK2&#39;s interaction with the RACK1-FBW7 complex, which is involved in ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of CDK2. Combination of CDK2 inhibitors in clinical trials (Dinaciclib or PF-07104091) and lenvatinib markedly suppressed growth of xenograft tumors from the lenvatinib-resistant patient. The findings support the combination therapy strategy of lenvatinib and CDK2 inhibitor for lenvatinib-resistant ATC patients with high CDK2 expression.},

  abstract     = {Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD) is characterized by the deposition of misfolded α-synuclein (α-syn) in the brain. Converging evidence indicates that the intracellular transmission and subsequent templated amplification of α-syn are involved in the onset and progression of PD. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the cell-to-cell transmission of pathological α-syn remain poorly understood. Microglia is highly activated in the brains of PD patients. Here, it is shown that depletion of microglia slows the spread of pathological α-syn pathology in mice injected with α-syn fibrils. Microglia phagocytose α-syn fibrils and transform them into more toxic species. The phagocytosis of α-syn fibrils by microglia is partially mediated by triggering a receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), a transmembrane protein expressed on the surface of microglia. The endocytosed α-syn fibrils are then cleaved by the lysosomal proteinase asparagine endopeptidase (AEP) to generate truncated α-syn 1–103 fibrils with enhanced seeding activity. Knockout of TREM2 and AEP impedes the endocytosis and cleavage of α-syn fibrils, respectively. The results demonstrate that TREM2-mediated phagocytosis of α-syn fibrils by microglia and subsequent AEP-mediated cleavage of α-syn fibrils contribute to the spread of α-syn in the brain. Blocking either of these two steps attenuates the progression of α-syn pathology.},

To overcome these barriers, a novel micro-electric-field (μ-EF) process is introduced that enhances particle alignment during fabrication with reduced distance between anode and cathode. This process produces hyper-thick (≈700 µm) electrodes with low tortuosity and improved ion diffusion. The μ-EF electrodes achieve high areal capacities (≈8 mAh cm −2 ), while maintaining power density and long cycle life. The electrodes show stable performance under high C-rate cycling and retain structural integrity after 1000 cycles at 2 C. By offering a scalable solution to the challenges of thick electrode fabrication, the μ-EF process represents a significant advancement for high-capacity LIBs in electric vehicles and energy storage systems.},

Ace tylation Ta rgeting C himera (AceTAC), a novel technology is previously reported that hijacks lysine acetyltransferases p300/CBP to acetylate the p53Y220C mutant. However, p300/CBP are the only acetyltransferases harnessed for AceTAC development to date. In this study, it is demonstrated for the first time that the TAF1 acetyltransferase can be recruited to acetylate p53Y220C. A novel TAF1-recruiting AceTAC, MS172 is discovered, which effectively acetylates p53Y220C lysine 382 in a concentration-, time- and TAF1-dependent manner via inducing the ternary complex formation between p53Y220C and TAF1. Notably, MS172 suppresses the proliferation in multiple p53Y220C-harboring cancer cell lines more potently than the previously reported p300/CBP-recruiting p53Y220C AceTAC MS78 with little toxicity in p53 WT and normal cells. Additionally, MS172 is bioavailable in mice and suitable for in vivo efficacy studies. Lastly, novel upregulation of metallothionine proteins by MS172-induced p53Y220C acetylation is discovered using RNA-seq and RT-qPCR studies. This work demonstrates that TAF1 can be harnessed for AceTAC development and expands the very limited repertoire of the acetyltransferases that can be leveraged for developing AceTACs, thus advancing the targeted protein acetylation field.},

  abstract     = {Type-I photosensitizers (PSs) are among the most potential candidates for photodynamic therapy (PDT), as their low dependence on oxygen endow them with many advantages for treating hypoxic tumor. However, most of the reported type-I PSs have a contingency of molecular design, because electron transfer (ET) reaction is more difficult to achieve than energy transfer (EET) process. Therefore, it is urgent to understand molecular design mechanisms for type-I PSs. In this review, the two ways to achieve the type-I PSs, i.e., inhibiting EET process (type-II) or enhancing ET process (type-I), are detailly explained. In response, the current design strategies of type-I PSs are summarized from two perspectives: indirect strategy (inhibiting EET process: reducing the energy of the lowest triplet excited state (T 1 ) to lower than the energy required for the excitation energy transfer to produce singlet oxygen) and direct strategy (enhancing ET process: promoting the ET efficiency of PSs to generate superoxide radicals). The construction of direct strategy can be realized by forming an electron-rich microenvironment, providing an electron-deficient intermediate transmitter, and introducing an enhanced electron transfer capacity primitive.},

  abstract     = {The rational design of multicomponent heterostructure is an effective strategy to enhance the catalytic activity of electrocatalysts for water and seawater electrolysis in alkaline conditions. Herein, MOF-derived nitrogen-doped carbon/nickel-cobalt sulfides coupled vertically aligned Rhenium disulfide (ReS 2 ) on carbon cloth (NC-CoNi 2 S 4 @ReS 2 /CC) are constructed via hydrothermal and activation approaches. Experimental and theoretical analysis demonstrates that the strong interactions between multiple interfaces promote electron redistribution and facilitate water dissociation, thereby optimizing *H adsorption energy for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Meanwhile, the adsorption energies of oxygenated intermediates are balanced to reduce the thermodynamic barrier for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Consequently, NC-CoNi 2 S 4 @ReS 2 /CC shows smaller overpotentials of 87 and 253 mV for HER and OER at 10 mA cm −2 , with a lower Tafel slope and R ct than control samples. Superior catalytic stability is confirmed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) for 1000 cycles and CA test for 56 h. Furthermore, NC-CoNi 2 S 4 @ReS 2 /CC presents exceptional electrocatalytic activity in both alkaline water/seawater electrolytes. Stability assessments reveal that NC-CoNi 2 S 4 @ReS 2 /CC maintains a highly catalytic activity in both water and seawater, owing to the corrosion-resistant properties of the sulfur species at the interface. These findings highlight the importance of designing heterostructure electrocatalysts for clean hydrogen production.},

  abstract     = {High-performance boiling surfaces are in great demand for efficient cooling of high-heat-flux devices. Although various micro-/nano-structured surfaces have been engineered toward higher surface wettability and wickability for enhanced boiling, the design and fabrication of surface structures for realizing both high critical heat flux (CHF) and high heat transfer coefficient (HTC) remain a key challenge. Here, a novel “electrode-transpose” all-electrochemical strategy is proposed to create superhydrophilic microporous surfaces with higher dendrites and larger pores by simply adding an electrochemical etching step prior to the multiple electrochemical deposition steps. Enabled by the high nucleation density and high wicking capability, a high boiling performance is shown on such “etching-then-deposition” surfaces with simultaneously high CHF of 2,641 ± 10 kW m −2 and high HTC of 214 ± 6 kW (m 2 K) −1 , which are more than 2.5 and 4.3-fold enhanced from those on smooth surfaces, respectively. A very stable morphology and boiling performance of such surfaces subject to consecutive tests are also shown. Using this strategy, such superhydrophilic microporous layers are fabricated on curved surfaces with larger areas, both on spheres and slender cylinders, and demonstrate excellent boiling performance in quenching tests. This facile, geometry-adaptive, durable, and scalable strategy is very promising for making high-performance boiling surfaces for large-scale industrial applications.},

  abstract     = {Promoting tumor cell senescence arrests the cell cycle of tumor cells and activates the immune system to eliminate these senescent cells, thereby suppressing tumor growth. Nevertheless, PD-L1 positive senescent tumor cells resist immune clearance and possess the ability to secret various cytokines and inflammatory factors that stimulate the growth of tumor cells. Consequently, drugs capable of both triggering senescence in tumor cells and concurrently diminishing the expression of PD-L1 to counteract immune evasion are urgently needed. Here, a berberine derivative B68 is developed, which specifically induces tumor cell senescence by targeting BMI1. B68 also involves the degradation of PD-L1 by targeting CSN5, thereby disrupting the immunosuppressive PD-1/PD-L1 interaction and enabling rapid clearance of senescent tumor cells. This approach simultaneously inhibits tumor progression and activates T cell immunity, as evidenced by the robust antitumor response following B68-induced immunization of senescent cancer cells. Moreover, the synergistic effect of B68 with anti-CTLA4 therapy further enhances antitumor immunity, and its ability to induce senescence in cancer cells triggers a strong protective response by dendritic and CD8 + T cells. These findings provide a scientific basis for developing a new tumor treatment strategy based on senescence induction and lay the foundation for further preclinical research.},

  abstract     = {Aneuploidy eggs are a common cause of human infertility, spontaneous abortion, or trisomy syndromes. The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) plays a crucial role in preventing aneuploidy in oocytes, yet it is unclear if additional mechanisms exist to ensure oocyte adherence to this checkpoint. It is now revealed that the microtubule-associated protein NUSAP can prevent oocytes from evading the SAC and regulate the speed of the cell cycle. Mechanistically, the study identifies NUSAP as a novel stabilizer of the E3 ubiquitin ligase APC/C CDH1 , protecting CDH1 from SCF BTRC -mediated degradation. Depletion of NUSAP reduces CDH1 protein level, leading to abnormal spindle assembly and chromosome alignment, and disrupting the balance of cell cycle proteins. This misregulated balance causes oocytes to evade the SAC. Consequently, these abnormal oocytes not only fail to arrest at metaphase but also accelerate the cell process, ultimately resulting in the production of aneuploid eggs. Together, the findings not only clarify the existence of mechanisms that ensure oocytes compliance with the spindle assembly checkpoint but also expand the new functions of NUSAP beyond its role as a microtubule- associated protein.},

  abstract     = {The design of cathode/electrolyte interfaces in high-energy density Li-ion batteries is critical to protect the surface against undesirable oxygen release from the cathodes when batteries are charged to high voltage. However, the involvement of the engineered interface in the cationic and anionic redox reactions associated with (de-)lithiation is often ignored, mostly due to the difficulty to separate these processes from chemical/catalytic reactions at the cathode/electrolyte interface. Here, a new electron energy band diagrams concept is developed that includes the examination of the electrochemical- and ionization- potentials evolution upon batteries cycling. The approach enables to forecast the intrinsic stability of the cathodes and discriminate the reaction pathways associated with interfacial electronic charge-transfer mechanisms. Specifically, light is shed on the evolution of cationic and anionic redox in high-energy density lithium-rich 0.33Li 2 MnO 3 ·0.67LiNi 0.4 Co 0.2 Mn 0.4 O 2 (HE-NCM) cathodes, particularly those that undergo surface modification through SO 2 and NH 3 double-gas treatment to suppress the structural degradation. The chemical composition and energy distribution of the occupied and unoccupied electronic states at the different charging/discharging states are quantitatively estimated by using advanced spectroscopy techniques, including operando Raman spectroscopy. The concept is successfully demonstrated in designing artificial interfaces for high-voltage olivine structure cathodes enabling stable battery operation up to 5.1 V versus Li + /Li.},

However, unfavorable morphology and low photon-to-electron conversion in the acceptor range continue to limit the photocurrent generation and overall device performance. Herein, benzoic anhydride, a low-cost polar molecule with excellent synergistic properties, is introduced in combination with the traditional additive 1-chloronaphthalene to optimize the aggregation of nonfullerene acceptors. This dual additive approach precisely modulates the morphology of various acceptors, significantly enhancing device performance. Notably, the method induces the formation of fine fibers with dense polymorph structures in BTP-base derivatives, achieving an optimal balance between exciton dissociation and charge collection in the active layers. As a result, the external quantum efficiency of the optimal devices is markedly improved in the wavelength range of 700–850 nm. Ultimately, power conversion efficiencies of 18.27% and 19.59% are achieved for devices comprising PM6:Y6 and PM6:L8-BO, respectively. The results reveal a convenient and effective method to control the morphology of nonfullerene acceptors and improve the photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells, paving the way for more efficient and practical organic photovoltaic technologies.},

The primary function of traditional burn dressings is to prevent infection and facilitate tissue repair. However, these dressings are not intended for the inflammatory pain and depression that often occur during recovery. This study describes a self-healing hydrogel H@EFCP, which is designed to alleviate inflammatory pain and post-burn depression in burn injuries. This hydrogel is synthesized through the cross-linking of carboxymethyl chitosan with borate ester chelates formed from epigallocatechin gallate and 4-formylphenylboronic acid. The incorporated Prussian blue nanoparticles increase the ability of H@EFCP to regulate the inflammatory process. H@EFCP is effective in the treatment of skin burns by reducing oxidative stress and improving the microenvironment of peripheral inflammation in mice. This modulation consists of a reduction of central nervous system inflammation and the risk of post-burn depression. Behavioral assays indicate that the hydrogel significantly reduces feelings of despair and anxiety after burns. Consequently, H@EFCP provides a dual-effect solution for the care and recovery of burn patients, including both burn repair and the associated psychological effects.},

These findings indicate that tumor cells at the leading-edge area demonstrate enhanced proliferation and are tightly associated with the stroma, including endothelial cells and POSTN+ FAP+ fibroblasts. Notably, CD8+ T cells in this region exhibit a naive phenotype with low cytotoxicity and signs of exhaustion, likely due to compromised antigen presentation by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The predominant CD8+ T cell subset, mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, recruits SPP1+ macrophages within the stroma. This interaction, along with the presence of POSTN+ cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and endothelial cells, forms a unique “triad structure” that fosters tumor growth and ICC progression.

Additionally, the integration of one-way water supply in tapered channels with interfacial evaporation of STHE, mimicking plant transpiration, collaboratively facilitates upward water transfer for a reliable solar-driven water evaporation rate of ≈2.26 kg m −2 h −1 under one sun irradiation. Even in a brine of 15.0 wt % solution, no salt crystals are observed on the surface of STHE. Hemispheric structure and superhydrophilicity are conducive to oil repellence. This work provides pivotal inspiration for constructing next-generation solar generators of high-efficiency, salt-tolerance, and anti-oil-fouling.},

  abstract     = {Exosome-based drug delivery holds significant promise for cancer chemotherapy. However, current methods for loading drugs into exosomes are inefficient and cost-prohibitive for practical application. In this study, boron clusters are mixed with doxorubicin (DOX) and exosomes, enabling the efficient encapsulation of DOX into exosomes through a superchaotropic effect. Exosomes loaded with DOX and boron clusters (EDB) exhibit superior permeability and the ability to deliver higher concentrations of DOX into DOX-resistant breast cancer cells. Mechanistic analysis reveals that boron clusters form a supramolecular complex with DOX, which facilitates sustained drug release and effectively inhibits P-glycoprotein-mediated DOX efflux. As a result, EDB significantly enhance apoptosis in DOX-resistant breast cancer cells and suppress tumor growth in cases where DOX alone is ineffective, thereby extending the survival of nude mice. In summary, boron clusters effectively facilitate the incorporation of DOX into exosomes and inhibit DOX efflux, offering a novel strategy to overcome DOX resistance.},

Here, on-surface coordination chemistry is used to synthesize on Ag(111) and superconducting Pb(111) an iron-based spin chain by using pyrene-4,5,9,10-tetraone (PTO) precursors as ligands. Using low-temperature scanning probe microscopy, their structures and low-energy spin excitations of coordinated Fe atoms are compared with high S = 2 spin-state. Although the chain and coordination centers are identical on both substrates, the long-range spin–spin coupling due to a superexchange through the ligand on Ag is not experimentally observed on Pb(111). This reduction of spin-spin interactions on Pb in tunneling spectra is ascribed to the depletion of electronic states around the Fermi level of the Pb(111) superconductor as compared to silver.},

Midbrain dopaminergic neurons generate both tonic and phasic action potential (AP) firing patterns in behavior mice. Besides AP numbers, whether and how different AP firing patterns per se modulate DA release remain largely unknown. Here by using in vivo and ex vivo models, it is shown that the AP frequency per se modulates DA release through the D2 receptor (D2R), which contributes up to 50% of total DA release. D2R has a voltage-sensing site at D131 and can be deactivated in a frequency-dependent manner by membrane depolarization. This voltage-dependent D2R inhibition of DA release is mediated via the facilitation of voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels (VGCCs). Collectively, this work establishes a novel mechanism that APs per se modulate DA overflow by disinhibiting the voltage-sensitive autoreceptor D2R and thus the facilitation of VGCCs, providing a pivotal pathway and insight into mammalian DA-dependent functions in vivo.},

  abstract     = {Biomolecular sensors with single-molecule resolution are composed of multitudes of transducers that measure state changes related to single-molecular binding and unbinding events. Conventionally, signals are aggregated from many individual transducers in order to achieve sufficient statistics. However, by aggregating signals, transducer-to-transducer differences are lost and heterogeneities cannot be studied. Here, transducers with single-molecule resolution over long time spans are studied, enabling the collection of sufficient statistics from independent transducers. This allows comparisons between transducers that reveal fundamental heterogeneities in their molecular assemblies related to stochastic variations. The study is performed with biosensing by particle motion, a sensing methodology with thousands of particles that dynamically interact with a sensing surface. The signals of individual particles are studied for series of modulations of analyte concentration over 25 h. The results show large differences in individual concentration-dependent responses. Monte Carlo simulations clarify that heterogeneities can be attributed to stochastic fluctuations in the numbers of binder molecules, and that gradual changes of the response characteristics can be related to losses of molecules in the single-particle transducers. The results give insights into molecular and temporal heterogeneities of continuous transducers with single-molecule resolution and explain how sensors can be engineered to achieve robust, precise, and stable biomolecular monitoring.},

In this work, a versatile and robust drift correction technique is presented for single-molecule localization-based super-resolution microscopy. It is based on the displacement analysis of bright-field image features of the specimen with oblique illumination. By leveraging the monotonic relationship between the displacement of image features and axial positions, this method can precisely measure the drift of the imaging system in real-time with sub-nanometer precision in all three dimensions, over a broad axial range, and for various samples, including those with closely matched refractive indices. The performance of this method is validated against conventional marker-assisted techniques and demonstrates its high precision in super-resolution imaging across various biological samples. This method paves the way for fully automated drift-free super-resolution imaging systems.},

  abstract     = {Symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF) provides nitrogen for soybean. A primary challenge in enhancing yield through efficient SNF lies in striking a balance between its high energy consumption and plant growth. However, the systemic transcriptional reprogramming during nodulation remains limited. Here, this work conducts a comprehensive RNA-seq of the roots, cotyledons and leaves of inoculated-soybean. This work finds 88,814 mRNAs and 6,156 noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) across various organs. Notably, this work identifies 6,679 nodulation-regulated mRNAs (NR-mRNAs), 1,681 long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) (NR-lncRNAs), and 59 miRNAs (NR-miRNAs). The majority of these NR-RNAs are associated with plant-microbial interaction and exhibit high organ specificity. Roots display the highest abundance of NR-ncRNAs and the most dynamic crosstalk between NR-lncRNAs and NR-miRNAs in a GmNARK-dependent manner. This indicates that while each tissue responds uniquely, GmNARK serves as a primary regulator of the transcriptional control of nodulated-plants. Furthermore, this work proves that lnc-NNR6788 and lnc-NNR7059 promote nodulation by regulating their target genes. This work also shows that the nodulation- and GmNARK-regulated (NNR) lnc-NNR4481 negatively regulates nodulation through miR172c within a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network. The spatial organ-type transcriptomic atlas establishes a benchmark and provides a valuable resource for integrative analyses of the mechanism underlying of nodulation and plant growth balance.},

This study visibly probed the evolution of the Co 3 d -band center during charge and discharge using advanced inverse photoemission spectroscopy/ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (IPES/UPS), which offers reliable evidence and are consistent well with theoretical calculations. This, coupled with in situ Raman and X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electrochemical data, co-evidences a novel pre-activating S redox mechanism in LSBs: LiPSs desert/insert in C-N matrixes within a series of Co@NCNT-based separators. The insight of the S redox pre-activation is discovered that the Co 3 d -band center downshifts to hybridized with S 2 p orbitals in LiPSs, giving rise to a more pronounced S covalency and thus accelerating the conversion of LiPSs to S₈. Benefiting from these advantages, the optimized LSB possesses a minimal decay rate of 0.0058% after 200 cycles at a high discharge rate of 10 C. This study provides new insights into LSB mechanisms and supports conventional theoretical models of the d -band center&#39;s impact on LSB performance.},

To address this limitation, a microphysiological system (MPS) is established to examine how varying levels of shear stress impact cartilage homeostasis. The system allows for the cultivation of 3D chondrogenic microconstructs (CMCs) derived from human mesenchymal stromal cells, simulating both physiological and pathophysiological shear stress. Inflammation is induced via TNF-α or activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells to model cartilage damage, enabling the evaluation of therapeutic interventions. The study demonstrates the development of an arthritis-like phenotype and successful restoration of cartilage conditions through a JAK inhibitor under physiological shear stress. Physiological shear stress is identified as a critical factor in maintaining cartilage integrity.

The parasites have distinct gene expression patterns at different stages to enable stage specific life activities, but the underlying regulatory mechanisms are largely unknown. In this study, a nuclear complex is identified that controls the expression of developmentally regulated genes. This complex consists of the AP2 family transcription factor AP2XII-5, the epigenetic factors MORC and HDAC3, as well as a novel AP2XII-5 interacting protein 1 (AIP1) that stabilizes this complex. At the tachyzoite stage when the parasites proliferate rapidly by asexual endodyogeny, AP2XII-5 binds to the promoter regions of developmentally activated genes and recruits MORC and HDAC3 to suppress their expression. When sexual commitment and merozoite development are triggered, the abundance of AP2XII-5 decreases and its suppression on target genes is relieved. In contrast to MORC and HDAC3, which regulate Toxoplasma development but are also essential for tachyzoite growth, AP2XII-5 and AIP1 are dispensable for tachyzoite proliferation in vitro. These data suggest that while MORC and HDAC3 have broad regulatory activities, forming a complex with AP2XII-5 and AIP1 enables them to specifically regulate gene expression during development.},

However, the efficiency of OWS has been forced by the sluggish kinetics of the four-electron oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The replacement of OER by alternative electrooxidation of small molecules with more thermodynamically favorable potentials may fundamentally break the limitation and achieve hydrogen production with low energy consumption, which may also be accompanied by the production of more value-added chemicals than oxygen or by electrochemical degradation of pollutants. This review critically assesses the latest discoveries in the coupled electrooxidation of various small molecules with OWS, including alcohols, aldehydes, amides, urea, hydrazine, etc. Emphasis is placed on the corresponding electrocatalyst design and related reaction mechanisms (e.g., dual hydrogenation and N–N bond breaking of hydrazine and C═N bond regulation in urea splitting to inhibit hazardous NCO − and NO − productions, etc.), along with emerging alternative electrooxidation reactions (electrooxidation of tetrazoles, furazans, iodide, quinolines, ascorbic acid, sterol, trimethylamine, etc.). Some new decoupled electrolysis and self-powered systems are also discussed in detail.

Nanoparticles are versatile and effective tools for therapeutic delivery to specific organelles. Nanoparticles offer several advantageous characteristics, including a high surface area-to-volume ratio for efficient therapeutic loading and the ability to attach targeting moieties (tethers) that enhance delivery. The choice of nanoparticle shape, size, composition, surface properties, and targeting ligands depends on the desired target organelle and therapeutic effect. Various nanoparticle platforms have been explored for organelle targeting, such as liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, dendrimers, and inorganic nanoparticles. In this review, current and emerging approaches to nanoparticle design are examined in the context of various diseases linked to organelle dysfunction. Specifically, advances in nanoparticle therapies targeting organelles such as the nucleus, mitochondria, lysosomes/endosomes, Golgi apparatus, and endoplasmic reticulum are comprehensively and critically discussed.},

  abstract     = {Crystalline thermoelectric materials, especially SnSe crystals, have emerged as promising candidates for power generation and electronic cooling. In this study, significant enhancement in ZT is achieved through the combined effects of lattice distortions and band convergence in multiple electronic valence bands. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that cation vacancies together with Pb substitutional doping promote the band convergence and increase the density of states (DOS) near the Fermi surface of SnSe, leading to a notable increase in the Seebeck coefficient ( S ). The complex defects formed by Sn vacancies and Pb doping not only boost the Seebeck coefficient but also optimize carrier concentration ( n H ) and enhance electrical conductivity ( σ ), resulting in a higher power factor ( PF ). Furthermore, the localized lattice distortions induced by these defects increase phonon scattering, significantly reducing lattice thermal conductivity ( κ lat ) to as low as 0.29 W m −1 K −1 at 773 K in Sn 0.92 Pb 0.03 Se. Consequently, these synergistic effects on phonon and electron transport contribute to a high ZT of 1.8. This study provides a framework for rational design of high-performance thermoelectric materials based on first-principles insights and experimental validation.},

The resulting ultraflexible sensor integrates carbon nanotubes/liquid metal hybrids and iron powders within an Ecoflex matrix. The optimization of this composition enables the creation of an uncured resin ideal for Direct Ink Writing (DIW) and a cured sensor with exceptional electromechanical, thermal, and magnetic performance. Notably, the sensor achieves a wide linear strain range of 350% and maintains a stable Gauge Factor of 19.8, offering an ultralow detection limit of 0.1% strain and a rapid 83-ms response time. Beyond superior strain sensing capabilities, the sensor exhibits outstanding thermal endurance for temperatures exceeding 300 °C, enhanced thermal conductivity, and a consistent resistance-temperature relationship, making it well-suited for high-temperature applications. Moreover, the inclusion of iron particles provides magnetic responsiveness, enabling synergistic applications in location and speed detection, particularly in home care. Leveraging DIW facilitates the creation of complex-shaped sensors with multiple functional materials, significantly broadening the sensor&#39;s capabilities.

While inhibiting dysregulated PANX1 has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy for many pathological conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), low efficacy, or poor specificity of classical PANX1 inhibitors introduces uncertainty for their applications in basic and translational research. Here, hit-to-lead optimization is performed and a naphthyridone, compound 12 , is identified as a new PANX1 inhibitor with an IC 50 of 0.73 µ m that does not affect pannexin-homologous LRRC8/SWELL1 channels. Using structure–activity relationship analysis, mutagenesis, cell thermal shift assays, and molecular docking, it is revealed that compound 12 directly engages PANX1 Trp74 residue. Using a dextran sodium sulfate mouse model of IBD, it is found that compound 12 markedly reduced colitis severity, highlighting new PANX1 inhibitors as a proof-of-concept treatment for IBD.

In addition, a detailed analysis is presented on the designed lenses and pixels, which are all fabricated by two-photon polymerization lithography. Though Fresnel lenses are susceptible to chromatic aberrations, the results show that they can be used for imaging pixels that produce a wide range of colors at low numerical aperture ( NA ≈0.2). The images have acceptable color contrast, corresponding to a simulated normalized modulation transfer function ( MTF ) of ≈0.6 averaged across wavelengths in the visible spectrum.

This study addresses the challenge of controlling Cas12a activity, especially in the context of nucleic acid detection where the inherent incompatibility between isothermal amplification and CRISPR reactions complicates accurate diagnostics. An RNA G-quadruplex (RG4) structure at the 5′ end of crRNA is introduced to modulate Cas12a activity accurately without the need for chemical modifications. The results indicate that the presence of RG4 does not significantly impact Cas12a&#39;s cleavage activity but can be controlled by RG4 stabilizers, enabling the suppression and subsequent restoration of Cas12a activity with potential for precise activity control. Moreover, the use of RG4 is expanded by incorporating it into split crRNA, introducing RG4 directly at the 5′ end of the direct repeat (DR) region, enabling tailored activity regulation for different targets by matching with various Spacer regions. Additionally, a light-controlled one-pot method for activating Cas12a is developed, thereby enhancing the accuracy and sensitivity of clinical samples. This study showcases the pioneering use of RG4 in manipulating Cas12a activity, streamlining diagnostics, and paving the way for advances in clinical nucleic acid testing.},

  abstract     = {Low back pain (LBP) caused by nucleus pulposus degeneration and calcification leads to great economic and social burden worldwide. Unexpectedly, no previous studies have demonstrated the association and the underlying mechanism between nucleus pulposus tissue degeneration and calcification formation. Secreted Phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1) exerts crucial functions in bone matrix mineralization and calcium deposition. Here, a novel function of SPP1 is reported, namely that it can aggravate nucleus pulposus cells (NPs) degeneration by negatively regulating extracellular matrix homeostasis. The degenerated NPs have a higher mineralization potential, which is achieved by SPP1. Mechanistically, SPP1 can accelerate the degeneration of nucleus pulposus cells by activating integrin α5β1 (ITGα5/β1), aggravating mitochondrial damage and inhibiting mitophagy. SPP1-ITGα5/β1 axis inhibits mitophagy by PINK1/PARKIN pathway blockade. In conclusion, SPP1 activates ITGα5/β1 to inhibit mitophagy, accelerates NPs degeneration, and induces calcification, thereby leading to intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) and calcification, identifying the potentially unknown mechanism and relationship between IVDD and calcification. Important insights are provided into the role of SPP1 in nucleus pulposus calcification in IVDD by inducing nucleus pulposus cell senescence through inhibition of mitophagy and may help develop potential new strategies for IVDD treatment.},

  abstract     = {Karyotype diversity plays an important role in speciation and diversification. However, gymnosperms, particularly conifers, exhibit remarkable karyotype uniformity. To explore the evolutionary processes shaping karyotypes in gymnosperms, the karyotype evolutionary history is reconstructed through comparative genomic analyses. Synteny analysis confirms the absence of ancient polyploidy in conifers and its rarity across the gymnosperms as a whole. Further analysis reveals convergent patterns of reciprocal translocations between nonhomologous chromosomes in conifer genomes. Centromeric-centromeric reciprocal translocations (CRTs) have been identified as the primary mechanism of karyotype evolution in conifers, while telomeric-centromeric reciprocal translocations (TRTs) significantly contributed to descending dysploidy within Cupressales. A graph-based method is utilized to infer the detailed evolutionary pathways from the proto-gymnosperm karyotype ( n = 12) to modern conifer karyotypes ( n = 11–12). In conclusion, the scarcity of both polyploidy and dysploidy contributes to the karyotype uniformity of gymnosperms and potentially also to their lower species richness compared to angiosperms. However, the pervasive CRTs and occasional TRTs underlie this “apparent uniformity”, supporting the “karyotype orthoselection” hypothesis. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms maintaining karyotype uniformity in conifers and the role of karyotype evolution in their diversification.},

  abstract     = {Squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (HNSCC) originate in the upper aerodigestive tract, including the oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx. Current treatments of locally advanced HNSCC often lead to high treatment failure, and disease recurrence, resulting in poor survival rates. Advances in mRNA technologies and lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery systems led to several clinical trials involving LNP-CRISPR-Cas9 mRNA-based therapeutics. Despite these advances, achieving cell-type-specific extrahepatic mRNA delivery is still challenging. This study introduces a safe and effective intratumoral EGFR-targeted CRISPR-LNP delivery strategy for knocking out SOX2, which is a cancer-specific gene. To assess their therapeutic potential, it is shown that LNPs made from ionizable lipids with helper lipids co-encapsulating Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA targeting SOX2 (sgSOX2), lead to a ≈60% reduction in HNSCC cell viability in vitro. Next, using a xenograft HNSCC mouse model, targeted delivery of 𝜶EGFR- CRISPR-sgSOX2-LNPs to HNSCC cells resulted in a 90% inhibition of tumor growth and a 90% increase in survival for &gt; 84 days, with tumor disappearance observed in 50% of the mice. These findings emphasize the potential of targeted mRNA-Cas9-LNPs in clinically accessible solid tumors, specifically in reaching tumor cells and inducing persistent therapeutic responses in tumors with high-recurrence rates like HNSCC.},

Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) have been associated with favorable outcomes in certain cancers. However, the relationship between TLS and MIBC remains unclear. A multi-omics approach is utilized, leveraging single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, bulk RNA sequencing, and immunohistochemistry, to investigate the roles of B cells and TLS in MIBC. These findings indicate that elevated levels of B cells and TLS correlate with improved prognoses in patients with MIBC, aligning with the robust antitumor immune responses observed in the TLS region. From a mechanistic perspective, CXCL13 serves as a critical cytokine for TLS formation in MIBC, primarily secreted by clonally expanded CXCL13+ T cells. This cytokine interacts with the CXCR5 receptor on NR4A2+ B cells, promoting TLS development. Plasma cells arising within the TLS microenvironment predominantly produce the IGHG antibody, potentially enhancing the phagocytic capabilities of C1QC+ macrophages. From an application standpoint, a TLS-specific gene signature is developed that effectively predicts outcomes in MIBC and other cancers. This study highlights the prognostic potential of TLS in MIBC and reveals immune mechanisms, offering insights for personalized treatment strategies.},

  abstract     = {Simultaneous rheological, polarized light imaging, and small-angle X-ray scattering experiments (Rheo-PLI-SAXS) are developed, thereby providing unprecedented level of insight into the multiscale orientation of hierarchical systems in simple shear. Notably, it is observed that mesoscale alignment in the flow direction does not develop simultaneously across nano-micro lengthscales in sheared suspensions of rod-like chiral-nematic (meso) phase forming cellulose nanocrystals. Rather, with increasing shear rate, orientation is observed first at mesoscale and then extends to the nanoscale, with influencing factors being the aggregation state of the hierarchy and concentration. In biphasic systems, where an isotropic phase co-exists with self-assembled liquid crystalline mesophase domains, the onset of mesodomain alignment towards the flow direction can occur at shear rates nearing one decade before a progressive increase in preferential orientation at nanoscale is detected. If physical confinement prevents the full formation of a cholesteric phase, mesoscale orientation occurs in shear rate ranges that correspond to de-structuring at nanoscale. Interestingly, nano- and mesoscale orientations appear to converge only for biphasic suspensions with primary nanoparticles predominantly made up of individual crystallites and in a high-aspect ratio nematic-forming thin-wall nanotube system. The nano-micro orientation propagation is attributed to differences in the elongation and breakage of mesophase domains.},

  abstract     = {The electrochemical N 2 reduction reaction (NRR) currently represents a green and sustainable approach to ammonia production. However, the further progress of NRR is significantly hampered by poor catalytic activity and selectivity, necessitating the development of efficient and stable electrocatalysts. Herein, a nanoporous Fe–Mo bimetallic nitride (Fe 3 N-MoN) is synthesized using a molten-salt preparation method. This catalyst demonstrates notable NRR performance, achieving a high NH 3 yield rate of 45.1 µg h −1 mg −1 and a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 26.5% at −0.2 V (vs RHE) under ambient conditions. Detailed experimental studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the fabricated interface between Fe 3 N and MoN effectively modulates the surface electronic structure of the catalyst. The interface induces an increase in the degree of electron deficiency at the nitrogen-vacancy sites on the catalyst surface, allowing N 2 molecules to occupy the nitrogen vacancies more easily, thereby promoting N 2 adsorption/activation during the NRR process. Consequently, the Fe 3 N-MoN catalyst exhibits outstanding NRR activity. The insights gained from fabricating the Fe 3 N-MoN interface in this work pave the way for further development of interfacial engineering to prepare high-efficient electrocatalyst.},

  abstract     = {As electronics advance toward higher performance and adaptability in extreme environments, traditional metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) face challenges due to physical constraints such as Boltzmann&#39;s law and short-channel effects. Nanoscale air channel transistors (NACTs) present a promising alternative, leveraging their vacuum-like channel and Fowler–Nordheim tunneling characteristics. In this study, a novel circular gate NACT (CG-NACT) is purposed, fabricated on a 4-inch silicon-based wafer using a CMOS-compatible process. By employing an innovative gate control mechanism, the transistors achieve an ultralow SS of only 0.15 mV dec −1 and maintain the average SS remained at 1.5 mV dec −1 over three decades of drain current. Additionally, our CG-NACTs deliver milliamper-level drain current at a low drain voltage of 0.7 V, with a maximum on/off ratio of 7.82×10 6 . Notably, CG-NACTs remain highly stable even at high temperatures of up to 150 °C and under irradiation. Furthermore, the practical application of CG-NACTs is successfully implemented by designing an inverter circuit for the first time.},

Although artificial neural networks (ANNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in various tasks, they still encounter challenges including excessive parameterization, high training costs and limited generalization capabilities, etc. C. elegans , boasting a simple nervous system consisting of merely 302 neurons, is capable of exhibiting complex behaviors such as aversive olfactory learning. This research pinpoints key neural circuit related to aversive olfactory learning in C. elegans by means of behavioral experiment and high-throughput RNA sequencing, and then translates it into an architecture of ANN for image classification. Furthermore, other ANNs for image classification with different architectures are constructed for comparative performance analysis to underscore the advantages of the bio-inspired designed architecture. The results show that the ANN inspired by the aversive olfactory learning neural circuit in C. elegans attains higher accuracy, greater consistency and faster convergence rate in the image classification task, particularly when dealing with more complex classification challenges. This study not only demonstrates the potential of bio-inspired design in improving the capabilities of ANNs but also offers a novel perspective and methodology for future ANNs design.},

  abstract     = {Cuproptosis that utilizes copper ionophore to induce programmed cell death holds promise for enhancing the effectiveness of conventional anticancer therapies and triggering efficient adaptive immune responses. However, the non-tumor-specific release of Cu ions can induce cuproptosis and cause irreversible damage to normal tissues. To maximize the therapeutic effects of tumor-specific cuproptosis, this work reports for the first time the regulation of degradation behaviors of Cu-based nanomaterials using graphene quantum dots (GQDs) as a protection layer. The deposition of GQDs not only avoids the degradation of Cu 2 O nanocubes under normal physiological conditions, but also sensitizes their sonodynamic activity due to the formation of Z-scheme heterojunctions. The tumor-specific released Cu ions achieve the cascade amplification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation through Cu + -mediated Fenton-like reaction and Cu 2+ -facilitated GSH depletion. More importantly, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) can be reversed by the greatly enhanced ROS levels and high-efficiency cuproptosis, ultimately inducing immunogenic cell death that promotes robust systemic immune responses for the eradication of primary tumors and suppression of distant tumors. This work provides a novel paradigm for the integration of SDT, CDT, cuproptosis, and immunotherapy in a controlled manner to achieve tumor-specific antitumor therapy by controlling the degradation behaviors of Cu-based nanomaterials.},

While immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting PD-1/PD-L1 have brought new hope, their efficacy is limited by low response rates and significant immune-mediated adverse events (irAEs). Through multi-omics data analysis, it is discovered that the spatial co-localization of CD73 and PD-L1 in melanoma correlates with improved progression-free survival (PFS), suggesting a synergistic potential of their inhibitors. Building on these insights, a novel therapeutic strategy using calcium phosphate (CaP) nanoparticles is developed for the co-delivery of aPD-L1 and APCP, a CD73 inhibitor. These nanoparticles, constructed via a biomineralization method, exhibit high drug-loading capacity and pH-responsive drug release. Compared to free aPD-L1, the CaP-delivered aPD-L1 effectively avoids systemic side effects while significantly enhancing anti-tumor efficacy, surpassing even a 20-fold dose of free aPD-L1. Furthermore, the co-delivery of aPD-L1 and APCP via CaP nanoparticles demonstrates a synergistic anti-tumor effect, with substantial immune activation and prevention of tumor recurrence through immune memory effects. These findings suggest that the co-delivery of aPD-L1 and APCP using CaP nanoparticles is a promising approach for improving melanoma immunotherapy, achieving enhanced efficacy and reduced toxicity.},

Recently, a new form of high-entropy MXenes has been reported, which contains an increased number of elemental species that can increase the configurational entropy and reduce the Gibbs free energy. The unique structure and composition lead to a range of intriguing and tunable characteristics. Herein, the fabrication of high-entropy MXene TiVNbMoC 3 T x (T = surface terminations) with a layer of polydopamine is reported, followed by immobilization of a phthalocyanine-based fluorophore for imaging and the peptide sequence QRHKPREGGGSC for targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpressed in cancer cells. The resulting nanocomposite exhibits high biocompatibility and superior photothermal property. Upon laser irradiation at 808 nm, the light-to-heat conversion efficiency is up to 56.1%, which is significantly higher than that of conventional 2D materials. In vitro studies show that these nanosheets could be internalized selectively into EGFR-positive cancer cells and effectively eliminate these cells mainly through photothermal-induced apoptosis. Using 4T1 tumor-bearing mice as an animal model, the nanosheets could accumulate at the tumor and effectively eradicate the tumor upon laser irradiation without causing noticeable adverse effects to the mice.},

  abstract     = {Oxidative stress is believed to play critical pathophysiological roles in ischemic brain injury, and the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway is recognized as the most crucial endogenous antioxidant stress damage route. Some research have demonstrated that Nrf2 play critical roles in oxidative stress after ischemic stroke, but the underlying mechanism are not fully elucidated. This study reveals that Nrf2 is modified by SUMOylation and identifies Sentrin/SUMO-specific protease 6 (SENP6) as a negative regulator of Nrf2 SUMOylation. Notably, SENP6 binds to and mediates the deSUMOylation of Nrf2, which in turn inhibits antioxidant response by enhancing ubiquitination-dependent degradation of Nrf2, thereby reducing its transcriptional activity, inducing oxidative stress and aggravating neuronal apoptosis after ischemic stroke. Additionally, blocking the interaction between SENP6 and Nrf2 with a cell membrane-permeable peptide (Tat-Nrf2) preserves the SUMOylation of Nrf2, effectively attenuates oxidative stress, and rescues neurological functions in mice subjected to ischemic stroke. Furthermore, no toxicity is observed when high doses Tat-Nrf2 are injected into nonischemic mice. Collectively, this study uncovers a previously unidentified mechanism whereby SUMOylation of Nrf2 regulates oxidative stress and strongly indicates that interventions targeting SENP6 or its interaction with Nrf2 may provide therapeutic benefits for ischemic stroke.},

A promising approach for improving thrombolysis efficiency is utilizing the permanent magnetically actuated locomotion of nanorobots. However, the thrombolytic drug transportation efficiency is challenged by in-plane rotating locomotion and the insufficient drug penetration limits further improvement of thrombolysis. Inspired by ciliary movement for cargo transportation in human body, in this study, cilia-mimic locomotion of magnetic colloidal collectives is realized under torque-force vortex magnetic field (TFV-MF) by a designed rotating permanent magnet assembly. This cilia-mimic locomotion mode can generate more disturbances to the fluids to improve thrombolytic drug transportation and the increased height and area of colloidal collectives boosted the imaging capability. In addition, low-intensity ultrasound is applied to enhance colloids infiltration by producing the fiber breakage and inducing erythrocyte deformation. In vitro thrombolytic experiments demonstrate that the thrombolysis efficiency increased by 16.2 times compared with that of pure tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) treatments. Furthermore, in vivo rat models of femoral vein thrombosis confirmed that this approach can achieve blood flow recanalization more quickly. The proposed cilia-mimic locomotion of magnetic colloidal collectives combined with low-intensity ultrasound irradiation mode provides a new insight of therapeutic interventions for vascular thrombus by enhancing drug penetration.},

Tissue sample analysis reveals both shared and distinct characteristics of brain tumors, highlighting significant disparities between BrMs and gliomas with differentially activated upstream pathways of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway that have been scarcely discussed previously. Novel proteins and phosphosites such as NSUN2, TM9SF3, and PRKCG_S330 are also detected, exhibiting a high correlation with reported clinical traits, which may serve as potential immunohistochemistry (IHC) biomarkers. Moreover, tumor-specific altered phosphosites and glycosites on FN1 are highlighted as potential therapeutic targets. Further validation of 110 potential noninvasive biomarkers yields three biomarker panels comprising a total of 19 biomarkers (including DES, VWF, and COL1A1) for accurate discrimination of two types of brain tumors and normal controls.

Macrophages play a critical role in the initiation, progression, and resolution of acute gout, with the cellular profiles closely linked to their activation and polarization. This suggests that metabolic regulation can be of significance in managing gouty inflammation. In this study, it is demonstrated that melatonin, a natural hormone, modulates the metabolic remodeling of inflammatory macrophages by shifting their metabolism from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation, further altering functions of the pathogenic macrophage. To improve melatonin delivery to the inflamed sites, macrophage membrane-coated melatonin-loaded liposomes (MLT-MLP) are developed. Benefiting from the inflammation-homing characteristic of macrophage membrane, such engineered liposomes effectively target the inflamed site and demonstrate potent anti-inflammatory effects, achieving an enhanced amelioration of acute gouty arthritis. In conclusion, this study proposes a novel strategy aimed at metabolic reprogramming of macrophages to attenuate the pathological injuries in acute gout, providing a potential therapeutic strategy of gout-associated diseases, especially gouty arthritis.},

Despite new developments in nanotechnology in the treatment of PD, in-depth exploration of their biological effects, in particular, the specific mechanisms of inflammation inhibition are lacking. Herein, using the stable cascade catalysis channel formed by polydopamine (PDA), imidazole groups, and Cu ions, a microgel system comprising functional monomers [superoxide dismutase (SOD) with double bonds, PDA, 2-methacryloyloxy ethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC), and Cu ions] is proposed for managing PD. The microgel can be efficiently delivered to the brain aided by MPC, after which a multi-level regulatory strategy targeting neurons and microglia can be initiated. The catalytic activity cascade elicited by SOD and Cu ions can regulate the anti-inflammatory phenotypic transformation of microglia by relieving oxidative stress. Meanwhile, the dopamine (DA) released from PDA can facilitate DA storage and neurogenesis, inhibiting CX3CL1 release and the CX3CR1 receptor on microglia and further regulating the CX3CL1/CX3CR1-NF-κB-NLRP3 signaling pathway in microglia to inhibit neuroinflammation.

  abstract     = {Despite being a groundbreaking approach to treating colorectal cancer (CRC), the efficacy of immunotherapy is significantly compromised by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and dysbiotic intestinal microbiota. Here, leveraging the superior carrying capacity and innate immunity-stimulating property of living bacteria, a nanomedicine-engineered bacterium, LR-S-CD/CpG@LNP, with optical responsiveness, immune-stimulating activity, and the ability to regulate microbiota metabolome is developed. Immunoadjuvant (CpG) and carbon dot (CD) co-loaded plant lipid nanoparticles (CD/CpG@LNPs) are constructed and conjugated to the surface of Limosilactobacillus reuteri (LR) via reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive linkers. The inherent photothermal and photodynamic properties of oral CD/CpG@LNPs induce in situ cytotoxic ROS generation and immunogenic cell death of colorectal tumor cells. The generated neoantigens and the released CpG function as a potent in situ vaccine that stimulates the maturation of immature dendritic cells. The mature dendritic cells and metabolites secreted by LR subsequently facilitated the tumor infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eradicate colorectal tumors. The further in vivo results demonstrate that the photo-immunotherapy and intestinal microbial metabolite regulation of LR-S-CD/CpG@LNPs collectively suppressed the growth of orthotopic colorectal tumors and their liver metastases, presenting a promising avenue for synergistic treatment of CRC via the oral route.},

  abstract     = {Paclitaxel (PTX) is a first-line chemotherapeutic drug for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) but it can induce indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) activation, which severely lowers down its immuno-chemotherapeutic effect. To address this issue, a smart peptide hydrogelator Nap–Phe–Phe–Phe–Lys–Ser–Thr–Gly–Gly–Lys–Ala–Pro–Arg–OH ( Nap-T ), which co-assembles with PTX and an IDO inhibitor GDC0919 to form a hydrogel GP@Gel Nap-T, is rationally designed. Upon specific phosphorylation by pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), an overexpressed biomarker of NSCLC, Nap-T is gradually converted to Nap–Phe–Phe–Phe–Lys–Ser–Thr(H 2 PO 3 )–Gly–Gly–Lys–Ala–Pro–Arg–OH ( Nap-Tp ), leading to dehydrogelation and sustained release of PTX and GDC0919 within NSCLC tissues. The released PTX exerts chemotherapy on NSCLC cells as well as immunogenic cell death induction, while GDC0919 promotes the immuno-chemotherapeutic effect of PTX through IDO inhibition. We find that GP@Gel Nap-T enhances the infiltration of tumor-infiltrating immune cells and reduces the number of immunosuppressive cells in either tumor tissues or tumor-draining lymph nodes, thus enhancing the immuno-chemotherapy of PTX toward NSCLC. With this PKM2-responsive drug release strategy, the smart peptide hydrogel platform might be applied for NSCLC treatment in clinic in near future.},

Currently, the challenges in treating postoperative residual GSCs are mainly due to the lack of materials for incision and GSCs targeting. In this study, a neurotransmitter-mimicking nanovesicle (PMVS-P) based on platelet membrane-derived vesicle (PMV) with anti-GSC drug salinomycin (SAL)-loading and polydopamine (PDA)-surface is synthesized. PMVS-P exhibits surgical incision targeting ability and specifically identified GSCs with highly expressed D2 dopamine receptor (D2DR), a central nervous system neurotransmitter receptor, thus suppressing GBM recurrence.

The optimized Li 3-3 y Ho 1+ y Cl 6- x Br x achieves an ionic conductivity of 3.8 mS cm −1 at 25 °C, the highest reported for holmium halide materials. 6,7 Li nuclear magnetic resonance and relaxometry investigations unveil enhanced ion dynamics with bromination, attaining a Li + motional rate neighboring 116 MHz. X-ray diffraction analyses reveal mixed-anion-induced phase transitions with disproportionate octahedral expansions and distortions, creating Ho-free planes with favorable energetics for Li + migration. Bond valence site energy analysis highlights preferred Li + transport pathways, particularly in structural planes devoid of Ho 3+ blocking effects. Molecular dynamics simulations corroborate enhanced Li + diffusion with Br − introduction into Li 3 HoCl 6 . Li-Ho electrostatic repulsions in the (001) plane presumably drive Li + diffusion into the Ho-free (002) layer, enabling rapid intraplanar Li + motion and exchange between the 2d and 4h sites. Li 3-3 y Ho 1+ y Cl 6- x Br x also demonstrates good battery cycling stability.

Carbon-based substrates can release from microplastics and contribute to terrestrial carbon pools, but how these emerging organic compounds influence carbon mineralization and sequestration remains unknown. Here, microcosm experiments are conducted to determine the bioavailability of microplastic-derived dissolved organic matter (MP-DOM) in soils and its contribution to mineral-associated carbon pool. The underlying mechanisms are identified by estimating its spectroscopic and molecular signatures and comparing its sorption properties on model minerals with natural organic matter (NOM). The results show that MP-DOM leads to 21–576% higher CO 2 emissions and 34–83% lower mineral-associated organic carbon in soils than NOM, depending on the type of plastic polymer. DOM from biodegradable microplastics induces higher CO 2 emissions than conventional microplastics. It is found that MP-DOM is 7.96 times more labile than NOM, making it more accessible for microbial utilization. The lower degree of humification, fewer polar functional groups, and higher H/C ratios in MP-DOM also led to 3.96 times less sorption with mineral particles. The findings provide insights into the effects of microplastics on soil carbon storage and highlight their consequences for wider terrestrial carbon cycling and climate warming.},

  abstract     = {Radiodynamic therapy that employs X-rays to trigger localized reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation can tackle the tissue penetration issue of phototherapy. Although calcium tungstate (CaWO 4 ) shows great potential as a radiodynamic agent benefiting from its strong X-ray absorption and the ability to generate electron–hole (e − -h + ) pairs, slow charge carrier transfer and fast e − -h + recombination greatly limit its ROS-generating performance. Herein, via a one-pot wet-chemical method, oxygen vacancy-rich amorphous/crystalline heterophase CaWO 4 nanoparticles (Ov-a/c-CaWO 4 NPs) with enhanced radiodynamic effect are synthesized for radiodynamic-immunotherapy of cancer. The phase composition and oxygen vacancy content of CaWO 4 can be easily tuned by adjusting the solvothermal temperature. More intriguingly, the amorphous/crystalline interfaces and abundant oxygen vacancies accelerate charge carrier transfer and suppress e − -h + recombination, respectively, enabling synergistically improved ROS production from X-ray-irradiated Ov-a/c-CaWO 4 NPs. In addition to directly inducing oxidative damage of cancer cells, radiodynamic generation of ROS also boosts immunogenic cell death to provoke a systemic antitumor immune response, thereby allowing the inhibition of both primary and distant tumors as well as cancer metastasis. This study establishes a synergistic enhancement strategy involving the integration of phase and defect engineering to improve the ROS generation capacity of radiodynamic-immunotherapeutic anticancer nanoagents.},

Immunosuppression is a major factor contributing to the infection chronicity of S. aureus PJI, posing significant treatment challenges. This study investigates the relationship between the immunosuppressive biofilm milieu and S. aureus PJI outcomes in both discovery and validation cohorts. This scRNA-seq analysis of synovium from PJI patients reveals an expansion and heightened activity of monocyte-related myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs) and regulatory T cells (Treg). Importantly, CXCL16 is significantly upregulated in M-MDSCs, with its corresponding CXCR6 receptor also elevated on Treg. M-MDSCs recruit Treg and enhance its activity via CXCL16-CXCR6 interactions, while Treg secretes TGF-β, inducing M-MDSCs proliferation and immunosuppressive activity. Interfering with this cross-talk in vivo using Treg-specific CXCR6 knockout PJI mouse model reduces M-MDSCs/Treg-mediated immunosuppression and alleviates bacterial burden. Immunohistochemistry and recurrence analysis show that PJI patients with CXCR6 high synovium have poor prognosis. This findings highlight the critical role of CXCR6 in Treg in orchestrating an immunosuppressive microenvironment and biofilm persistence during PJI, offering potential targets for therapeutic intervention.},

  abstract     = {There is an urgent necessity to devise efficient tactics to tackle the inevitable development of resistance to osimertinib, which is a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor used in treating EGFR-mutant nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study demonstrates that combining itraconazole with osimertinib synergistically reduces the proliferation and migration, enhances the apoptosis of osimertinib-resistant cells, and effectively inhibits the growth of osimertinib-resistant tumors. Mechanistically, itraconazole combined with osimertinib promotes the proteasomal degradation of sonic hedgehog (SHH), resulting in inactivation of the SHH/Dual-specificity phosphatase 13B (DUSP13B)/p-STAT3 and Hedgehog pathways, suppressing Myc proto-oncogene protein (c-Myc). Additionally, DUSP13B interacts with signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and modulates its phosphorylation. Interestingly, it is observed that SHH overexpression partially rescues the synergistic effects of this combination treatment strategy through the SHH/DUSP13B/p-STAT3 signaling axis. Moreover, it is found that SHH, (GLI1), p-STAT3, and DUSP13B play significant predictive roles in osimertinib resistance. In lung adenocarcinoma, p-STAT3 is positively correlated with SHH but negatively correlated with DUSP13B. Together, these results highlight the crucial role of itraconazole in reversing the acquired resistance to osimertinib and provide a scientific rationale for the therapeutic strategy of combining osimertinib with itraconazole.},

Human and mouse periodontitis tissues show elevated FAP and reduced osteolectin (OLN), an endogenous FAP inhibitor, indicating a FAP/OLN imbalance. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed gingival fibroblasts (GFs) as the primary FAP and OLN source, with periodontitis-associated GFs showing increased reactive oxygen species, cellular senescence, and mTOR pathway activation. Rapamycin treatment restored the FAP/OLN balance in GFs. Recombinant FAP increased pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and osteoclast differentiation in macrophages, exacerbating periodontal damage, whereas FAP inhibition reduced macrophage inflammation, collagen degradation, and bone resorption in experimental periodontitis. Therefore, senescent fibroblasts drive the FAP/OLN imbalance through mTOR activation, contributing to periodontitis progression. Consequently, targeting FAP may offer a promising therapeutic strategy for periodontitis.},

The catalytic cores of telomerase involve a reverse transcriptase and the human telomerase RNA (hTR). However, current detection of telomerase is largely limited to its activity at the tissue and single-cell levels. To reveal the precise distribution of subcellular hTR and telomerase activity, here a modular engineered DNA nanodevice (DNA-ND) is designed capable of imaging hTR and telomerase activity in cytoplasm and nucleus, enabling colocalization analysis. DNA-ND is a modular DNA complex comprising hTR and telomerase activity detection modules, which respectively sense intercellular hTR and telomerase activity via target-sensitive allosteric transition of DNA switches, actuating orthogonal activation of fluorescence signals to achieve in situ co-imaging of hTR and telomerase activity. By integrating DNA-ND with specific localized signals, the DNA-ND based precise profiling of colocalization of hTR and telomerase activity in different cell lines as well as their dynamic changes during pharmacological interventions is demonstrated. Notably, the results suggest that the locations of hTR and telomerase activity are not exactly overlapped, indicating the influence of intracellular environment on the binding of hTR to telomerase.},

  abstract     = {The anti-tumor efficacy of current pharmacotherapy is severely hampered due to the adaptive evolution of tumors, urgently needing effective therapeutic strategies capable of breaking such adaptability. Metabolic reprogramming, as an adaptive survival mechanism, is closely related to therapy resistance of tumors. Colorectal cancer (CRC) cells exhibit a high energy dependency that is sustained by an adaptive metabolic conversion between glucose and glutamine, helping tumor cells to withstand nutrient-deficient microenvironments and various treatments. We discover that transition metal vanadium (V) effectively inhibits glucose metabolism in CRC and synergizes with glutaminase inhibitors (BPTES) to disrupt CRC&#39;s energy dependency. Thus, a dual energy metabolism suppression nanosystem (VSi-BP@HA) is engineered by loading BPTES into V-doped hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles. This nanosystem effectively dampens CRC energy metabolism, eradicating 33% of tumors in mice. Strikingly, the cell biological and preclinical model datasets provide compelling evidence showing that VSi-BP@HA not only reverses CRC cells chemo-resistance but also drastically potentiates anti-PD1 immunotherapy. Therefore, this nanosystem provides not only a promising approach to suppress CRC, but also a potential adjunct tool for enhancing chemotherapy and immunotherapy.},

  abstract     = {Photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT) have emerged as promising treatment options, showcasing immense potential in addressing both oncologic and nononcologic diseases. Single-component organic phototherapeutic agents (SCOPAs) offer advantages compared to inorganic or multicomponent nanomedicine, including better biosafety, lower toxicity, simpler synthesis, and enhanced reproducibility. Nonetheless, how to further improve the therapeutic effectiveness of SCOPAs remains a challenging research area. This review delves deeply into strategies to improve the performance of PDT or PTT by optimizing the structural design of SCOPAs. These strategies encompass augmenting reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, mitigating oxygen dependence, elevating light absorption capacity, broadening the absorption region, and enhancing the photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE). Additionally, this review also underscores the ideal strategies for developing SCOPAs with balanced PDT and PTT. Furthermore, the potential synergies are highlighted between PDT and PTT with other treatment modalities such as ferroptosis, gas therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. By providing a comprehensive analysis of these strategies, this review aspires to serve as a valuable resource for clinicians and researchers, facilitating the wider application and advancement of SCOPAs-mediated PDT and PTT.},

  abstract     = {Poor response to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) remains an obstacle in the treatment of gastric cancer (GC). Super enhancers (SEs) are crucial for determining tumor cell survival under drug pressure. SE landscapes related to 5-FU-resistance are mapped to GC using chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-Seq). SiRNA transcription factors (TFs) screen determines master TF Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 3 Group C Member 1 (NR3C1) activated by SE. High NR3C1 expression driven by SE correlated with 5-FU resistance in patient-derived organoids (PDOs). Phase separation formed by NR3C1 is observed using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). NR3C1 protein and Mediator promoted SE-related gene transcription via phase separation. SEs and NR3C1 co-binding patterns are explored using Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation (CUT&amp;Tag) sequencing. 5-FU-related genes driven by NR3C1 are identified using epigenetic reader inhibitor JQ1 and NR3C1 specific inhibitor Cort108297. NR3C1 knockdown increases 5-FU sensitivity and alters the SE landscape through enhancer reprogramming, reducing downstream 5-FU-related target genes. JQ1 and Cort108297 both improve 5-FU efficacy in PDOs and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) by destroying SEs or inhibiting NR3C1. In conclusion, SE-driven NR3C1 promotes 5-FU resistance in GC. SE destruction and NR3C1 inhibition lead to enhancer reconstruction and reduce 5-FU-related gene transcription, providing alternative therapeutic strategies for improving 5-FU sensitivity.},

  abstract     = {Aortic aneurysm is a life-threatening disease caused by progressive dilation of the aorta and weakened aortic walls. Its pathogenesis involves an imbalance between connective tissue repair and degradation. CD34 + cells comprise a heterogeneous population that exhibits stem cell and progenitor cell properties. However, the role of CD34 + cells in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) remains unclear. In this study, downregulated CD34 expression is observed in aneurysmal aortas from both patients and mouse models compared to that in non-dilated aortas. Furthermore, by combining Cd34 -CreER T2 ;Rosa26-tdTomato;( Apoe −/− ) lineage tracing, bone marrow transplantation, and single-cell sequencing, it is found that during AAA development, non-bone marrow CD34 + cells are activated to transdifferentiate into Periostin + myofibroblasts, thereby contributing to the formation of fibrotic collars. Dual recombinase-based lineage tracing confirms the presence and involvement of CD34 + /Periostin + myofibroblasts in fibrotic collar formation during AAA development. Functionally, selective depletion of systemic or non-bone marrow CD34 + cells, as well as CD34 + /Periostin + myofibroblasts, by diphtheria toxin significantly exacerbates AAA progression and increases disease mortality. Mechanistically, it is identified that the PDGF-PDGFRb-PI3K axis is indispensable for Periostin + myofibroblast generation from non-bone marrow CD34 + cells in AAA, offering a new therapeutic target for patients with AAA at a high risk of rupture.},

On top of that, condensin II establishes eukaryotic chromosome territories, while cohesin organizes the vertebrate genome by extruding chromatin loops and forming topologically associating domains (TADs). Thus far, the formation and roles of these chromatin structures in plants remain poorly understood. This study integrates Hi-C data from diverse plant species, demonstrating that nuclear DNA content influences large-scale chromosome conformation and affects the finer details of compartmental patterns. These contrasting compartmental patterns are distinguished by gene-to-gene loops and validated through cytological observations. Additionally, a novel chromatin domain type associated with tandem duplicate gene clusters is identified. These domains are independent of H3K27me3-mediated chromatin compartmentalization and exhibit evolutionary conservation across species. Gene pairs within TAD-like domains are younger and show higher levels of coexpression. These domains potentially promote the formation of tandem duplicates, a property appears unique to the Actinidia family. Overall, this study reveals functional chromatin domains in plants and provides evidence for the role of three-dimensional chromatin architecture in gene regulation and genome evolution.},

  abstract     = {Disulfidptosis is a newly discovered type of regulated cell death triggered by disulfide bond accumulation and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) depletion due to glucose deprivation. However, the regulatory mechanisms involving additional cellular circuits remain unclear. Excessive disulfide bond accumulation can impair endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis and activate the ER stress response. In this study, we found that SLC7A11-mediated disulfidptosis upon glucose deprivation is accompanied by ER stress induction. Pharmacological inhibition of SLC7A11-mediated cystine uptake or cystine withdrawal not only blocks disulfidptosis under glucose starvation but also suppresses the ER stress response, indicating a close link between these processes. Moreover, inhibitors targeting the ER stress response promote disulfidptosis, while ER stress inducers suppress glucose starvation-induced disulfidptosis in SLC7A11-high-expressing cells, suggesting a protective role for ER stress during disulfidptosis. Similar effects are observed in cells treated with glucose transporter inhibitors (GLUTi). Finally, combined treatment with ER stress inhibitors and GLUTi significantly suppresses tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo by inducing disulfide stress and subsequent disulfidptosis. In summary, these findings reveal a novel role for ER stress in regulating disulfidptosis and provide theoretical insights into the potential application of GLUTi and ER stress inhibitors in cancer therapy.},

  abstract     = {Isoniazid and rifampicin co-therapy are the main causes of anti-tuberculosis drug-induced liver injury (ATB-DILI) and acute liver failure, seriously threatening human health. However, its pathophysiology is not fully elucidated. Growing evidences have shown that fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) play a critical role in diverse aspects of liver pathophysiology. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of FGFs in the pathogenesis of isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RIF)-induced liver injury. Through systematic screening, this study finds that hepatic FGF1 expression is significantly downregulated in both mouse model and human patients challenged with INH and RIF. Hepatocyte-specific Fgf1 deficiency exacerbates INH and RIF-induced liver injury resulted from elevated bile acids (BAs) synthases and aberrant BAs accumulation. Conversely, pharmacological administration of the non-mitogenic FGF1 analog – FGF1 ΔHBS significantly alleviated INH and RIF-induced liver injury via restoring BAs homeostasis. Mechanically, FGF1 repressed hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 α ( Hnf4α ) transcription via activating FGF receptor 4 (FGFR4)-ERK1/2 signaling pathway, thus reducing BAs synthase. The findings demonstrate hepatic FGF1 functions as a negative regulator of BAs biosynthesis to protect against INH and RIF-induced liver injury via normalizing hepatic BAs homeostasis, providing novel mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of ATB-DILI and potential therapeutic strategies for treatment of ATB-DILI.},

This study introduces a novel one-pot and low-temperature polyol approach for synthesizing support-free, connected nanoparticles with non-Pt metal cores and Pt shells. Unlike conventional heat treatment methods, the developed support-free and Fe-free connected Pd core @Pt shell (Pd@Pt) nanoparticle catalyst possesses a stable nanonetwork structure with a high surface area. This approach can precisely control the atomic-level structure of the Pt shell on the Pd core at a low deposition temperature. The optimized Pd@Pt catalyst with a Pt/Pd atomic ratio of 0.8 and a Pt shell thickness of 1.1 nm exhibits a threefold improvement in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) mass activity compared to that of commercial carbon-supported Pt nanoparticle catalyst (Pt/C). Durability evaluation demonstrated 100% retention of specific activity after 10,000 load cycles, owing to the stable nanonetwork and uniform coverage of the Pt shell. In addition, the support-free, connected core–shell nanoparticle catalyst overcomes the carbon corrosion issues commonly associated with conventional carbon-supported catalysts while simultaneously improving both ORR activity and load cycle durability. These findings highlight the potential of this innovative approach to develop support-free catalysts for polymer electrolyte fuel cells and other energy devices.},

However, the emergence of radioresistance has become a major cause of radiotherapy failure and disease progression. Therefore, overcoming radioresistance to achieve highly effective treatment for refractory tumors is significant yet challenging. Here, pH-responsive DSPE-PEoz modified hollow Bi 2 Se 3 -RSL3/diABZi (DP-HBN/RA) nanomedicine is designed as a radiation sensitizer for efficient treatment of triple-negative breast cancer by simultaneously amplifying ferroptosis and immune system activation. DP-HBN/RA can efficiently concentrate X-ray radiation energy inside the tumor, thereby promoting precise ionizing radiation exposure in tumor cells to produce large amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to lipid peroxidation-induced ferroptosis. Meanwhile, ferroptotic cell death is intensified through the inactivation of GPX4 by RSL3 released from DP-HBN/RA to acidic conditions in the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, DP-HBN/RA enhances RT efficacy to exacerbate unrepairable DNA damage and release DNA fragments that activate the cGAS-STING signal pathway, evoking a systematic immune response. Ingeniously, the released diABZi reinforces cGAS-STING activation to boost the immunology antitumor effect.

  abstract     = {Silicosis is a fatal occupational pulmonary disease that is characterized by irreversible replacement of lung parenchyma by aberrant Exracellular matrix (ECM). Metabolic reprogramming is a crucial mechanism for fibrosis. However, how the metabolic rewiring shifts the ECM homeostasis toward overaccumulation remains unclear. Herein, a phenotype with reduction in fatty acid oxidation (FAO) but enhanced glycolysis in myofibroblasts is shown. Perturbation of the glycolytic and FAO pathways, respectively, reveals distinct roles in the metabolic distribution of ECM deposition and degradation. Suppressed glycolysis leads to a decrease in insoluble ECM, primarily due to the inhibition of ECM-modifying enzyme activity and a decrease in glycine synthesis. Notably, promoted FAO facilitates the intracellular degradation pathway of ECM. In addition, the findings revealed that hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) serves as a crucial metabolic regulator in the transition from FAO to glycolysis, thereby playing a significant role in ECM deposition in silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Further, the promotion of FAO, inhibition of glycolysis and HIF-1α reduce ECM production and promote ECM degradation, ultimately impeding the progression of fibrosis and providing therapeutic relief for established pulmonary fibrosis in vivo. These findings unveil the metabolic rewire underpinning the deposition of ECM in silica-induced lung fibrosis and identify novel targets for promoting regression of pulmonary fibrosis.},

  abstract     = {Circulating lactate is a critical biomarker for sepsis-induced acute lung injury (S-ALI) and is strongly associated with poor prognosis. However, whether elevated lactate directly promotes S-ALI and the specific mechanism involved remain unclear. Here, this work shows that lactate causes pulmonary endothelial glycocalyx degradation and worsens ALI during sepsis. Mechanistically, lactate increases the lactylation of K18 of histone H3, which is enriched at the promoter of EGR1 and promotes its transcription, leading to upregulation of heparanase in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells. In addition, multiple lactylation sites are identified in EGR1, and lactylation is confirmed to occur mainly at K364. K364 lactylation of EGR1 facilitates its interaction with importin-α, in turn promoting its nuclear localization. Importantly, this work identifies KAT2B as a novel lactyltransferase whose GNAT domain directly mediates the lactylation of EGR1 during S-ALI. In vivo, suppression of lactate production or genetic knockout of EGR1 mitigated glycocalyx degradation and ALI and improved survival outcomes in mice with polymicrobial sepsis. Therefore, this study reveals that the crosstalk between metabolic reprogramming in endothelial cells and epigenetic modifications plays a critical role in the pathological processes of S-ALI.},

  abstract     = {Digital PCR (dPCR) has transformed nucleic acid diagnostics by enabling the absolute quantification of rare mutations and target sequences. However, traditional dPCR detection methods, such as those involving flow cytometry and fluorescence imaging, may face challenges due to high costs, complexity, limited accuracy, and slow processing speeds. In this study, SAM-dPCR is introduced, a training-free open-source bioanalysis paradigm that offers swift and precise absolute quantification of biological samples. SAM-dPCR leverages the robustness of the zero-shot Segment Anything Model (SAM) to achieve rapid processing times (&lt;4 seconds) with an accuracy exceeding 97.10%. This method has been extensively validated across diverse samples and reactor morphologies, demonstrating its broad applicability. Utilizing standard laboratory fluorescence microscopes, SAM-dPCR can measure nucleic acid template concentrations ranging from 0.154 copies µL −1 to 1.295 × 10 3 copies µL −1 for droplet dPCR and 0.160 × 10 3 to 3.629 × 10 3 copies µL −1 for microwell dPCR. Experimental validation shows a strong linear relationship (r 2 &gt; 0.96) between expected and determined sample concentrations. SAM-dPCR offers high accuracy, accessibility, and the ability to address bioanalytical needs in resource-limited settings, as it does not rely on hand-crafted “ground truth” data.},

  abstract     = {Defective clearance and accumulation of α-synuclein (α-Syn) is the key pathogenic factor in Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD). Recent studies emphasize the importance of E3 ligases in regulating the degradation of α-Syn. However, the molecular mechanisms by which deubiquitinases regulate α-Syn degradation are scarcely studied. In this study, it is found that the protein levels of α-Syn are negatively regulated by ovarian tumor protease deubiquitinase 5 (OTUD5) which protects dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the PD model. Mechanistically, OTUD5 promotes K63-linked polyubiquitination of α-Syn independent of its deubiquitinating enzyme activity and mediates its endolysosomal degradation by recruiting the E3 ligase neural precursor cell expressed developmentally downregulated 4 (NEDD4). Furthermore, OTUD5 conditional knockout in DA neurons results in more severe α-Syn related pathology and dyskinesia after injection of α-Syn preformed fibrils (PFF). Overall, the data unveil a novel mechanism to regulate the degradation of α-Syn and provide a new therapeutic strategy to alleviate DA neurodegeneration.},

Yet, the suturing of soft tissues ensuring damage-free tissue bonding during these procedures remains challenging due to missing haptics and the fulcrum effect. Laser tissue soldering has potential in overcoming these issues, offering atraumatic seamless tissue fusion. To ensure the precision and safety of laser tissue soldering, the study introduces feedback-controlled fluorescent nanothermometry-guided laser tissue soldering using nanoparticle-protein solders within endoscopic and robotic contexts. Temperature-sensitive fluorescent nanoparticles embedded in the solder provide surgeons with immediate feedback on tissue temperatures during laser application, all while within the confines of minimally invasive (robotic) surgical setups. By integrating fluorescent nanothermometry-guided laser tissue surgery into endoscopic and robotic surgery, the study paves the way for a new approach for safe and atraumatic soft tissue joining, especially in regions where traditional suturing is unfeasible.},

  abstract     = {The resistance of tumors to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) may be intricately linked to cellular senescence, although definitive clinical validation remains elusive. In this study, comprehensive pan-cancer scRNA-seq analyses identify fibroblasts as exhibiting the most pronounced levels of cellular senescence among tumor-associated cell populations. To elucidate this phenomenon, a fibroblast senescence-associated transcriptomic signature (FSS), which correlated strongly with protumorigenic signaling pathways and immune dysregulation that fosters tumor progression, is developed. Leveraging the FSS, the machine learning (ML) framework demonstrates exceptional accuracy in predicting ICI response and survival outcomes, achieving superior area under curve (AUC) values across validation, testing, and in-house cohorts. Strikingly, FSS consistently outperforms established signatures in predictive robustness across diverse cancer subtypes. From an integrative analysis of 17 CRISPR/Cas9 libraries, CDC6 emerges as a pivotal biomarker for pan-cancer ICI response and prognostic stratification. Mechanistically, experimental evidence reveals that CDC6 in tumor cells orchestrates fibroblast senescence via TGF-β1 secretion and oxidative stress, subsequently reprogramming the tumor microenvironment and modulating ICI response. These findings underscore the translational potential of targeting fibroblast senescence as a novel therapeutic strategy to mitigate immune resistance and enhance antitumor efficacy.},

Due to the current lack of antibiotic discovery and development, new strategies to fight MDR bacteria are urgently needed. Efforts to develop new antibiotic adjuvants to increase the effectiveness of existing antibiotics and design delivery systems are essential to address this issue. Here, a bioinspired delivery system equipped with combination therapy and paracellular transport is shown to enhance the efficacy against bacterial infections by improving oral delivery. A screening platform is established using an in vitro-induced high polymyxin-resistant strain to acquire plumbagin, which enhances the efficacy of polymyxin. Functionalized milk extracellular vesicles (FMEVs) coloaded with polymyxin and plumbagin cleared 99% of the bacteria within 4 h. Mechanistic studies revealed that the drug combination damaged the membrane, disrupted energy metabolism, and accelerated bacterial death. Finally, FMEVs are efficiently transported transcellularly through the citric acid-mediated reversible opening of the tight junctions and showed high efficacy against an MDR Escherichia coli -associated peritonitis–sepsis model in mice. These findings provide a potential therapeutic strategy to improve the efficacy of combination therapy by enhancing oral delivery using a biomimetic delivery platform.},

Monitoring these indicators can be crucial for early detection of chronic conditions, steering toward proactive healthcare management. This study delves into a thermoelectric sensor e-tattoo designed for detailed skin temperature mapping. Utilizing a novel design, this sensor detects temperature variations across thermoelectric stripes, leveraging screen-printed films of p-type Bi 0.35 Sb 1.65 Te 3 , n-type Bi 2 Te 2.8 Se 0.2 , and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) for enhanced thermoelectric and flexible properties.

Sophisticated drug delivery systems that maintain protein stability, prolong therapeutic effects, and reduce administration frequency are urgently required. Herein, a mechanoresponsive hydrogel is developed contained within a soft robotic drug delivery (SRDD) device. In a step-change from previously reported systems, pneumatic actuation of this system releases the cationic therapeutic protein Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) in a bioactive form which is required for therapeutic angiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessels, in numerous clinical conditions. The ability of the SRDD device to release bioactive VEGF in a spatiotemporal manner from the hydrogel is tested in diabetic rats – a model in which angiogenesis is difficult to stimulate. Daily actuation of the SRDD device in the diabetic rat model significantly increased cluster of differentiation 31+ (CD31+) blood vessel number (p = 0.0335) and the diameter of alpha-smooth muscle actin+ (α-SMA+) blood vessels (p = 0.0025) compared to passive release of VEGF from non-actuated devices.

  abstract     = {Developing novel cold-adapted nanozymes and elucidating their mechanisms of action remains a great challenge. Inspired by natural oxidases that utilize high-spin and high-valent metal-oxygen intermediates to achieve high efficiency at low temperatures, in this study, a series of MnO x nanomaterials with varied valence and spin states are synthesized. The activity assay revealed that the oxygen vacancy-engineered ε -MnO 2 nanozyme displayed excellent cold-adapted oxidase-like properties, and no observable activity loss is observed in the temperature range of −20 to 45 °C. The superior performance is attributed to the high-spin Mn(III)–O species coupled with its induced Jahn–Teller effect, which facilitates the dissociation and activation of oxygen at low temperatures. As a proof of concept, an excellent cold-adapted δ -MnO 2 nanozyme can be obtained using Mn 3 O 4 as the precursor by regulating the spin state of Mn(III). Moreover, a novel and effective degradation strategy for corn stalk at low temperature is built based on the robust cold-adapted oxidase-like activity of ε -MnO 2 . These results not only provide new insights for the rational design of cold-adapted nanozymes but also broaden the application of nanozymes in low-temperature industrial processes.},

  abstract     = {The important role of PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) in tumors has garnered increasing attention. However, research on their role in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains limited. Elevated levels of piRNA-137463 have been linked to poor prognosis in LUAD patients. Inhibition of piRNA-137463 curbed the proliferation, migration, and invasion of LUAD cells, enhanced T cell cytotoxicity through increased IFN-γ secretion, disrupted cholesterol metabolism, and reduced intracellular cholesterol, lipid raft content, and PD-L1 expression in LUAD cells. Bioinformatic prediction identified a potential interaction between piRNA-137463 and lncRNA LOC100128494. Inhibiting piRNA-137463 increased the stability and expression of LOC100128494, which further modulated insulin-induced gene 1 protein (INSIG1) levels via a competitive endogenous RNA network involving LOC100128494 and miR-24-3p. Notably, the effect of piRNA-137463 in LUAD cells is dependent on the expression of LOC100128494 and INSIG1. Inhibiting the expression of piRNA-137463 with AntagopiRNA-137463 suppressed tumor growth and metastasis via LOC100128494 in nude mice and enhanced the response of LUAD to anti-PD-1 therapy in immune-competent mice. In summary, this study elucidates the role of piRNA-137463 in the reprogramming of cholesterol metabolism, which drives the progression of LUAD, thereby identifying a new target for the comprehensive clinical management of LUAD.},

  abstract     = {The functional and pharmacological significance of dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) in psychiatric and neurological disorders is well elucidated. However, the roles of DRD4 in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain unclear. This study observes a significant upregulation of DRD4 expression in clinical samples, which is negatively correlated with patient prognosis. In vitro, overexpression of DRD4 causes a constitutive activation of β-Arrestin2/PP2A/AKT independent of dopamine. Interestingly, this classical signaling pathway is not associated with the phenotype of DRD4-promoted migration and invasion in CRC cells. Instead, DRD4 interacts with transforming growth factor beta receptors (TGFBR1 and TGFBR2) to activate Smad2 phosphorylation and promote Smad2/Smad4 complex nucleus translocation. Then, SNAI1 and JAG1 are transcriptionally activated to induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition and enhance the metastatic potential of CRC. Notably, the COOH-terminal domain is identified as the key intracellular region for the pro-metastatic roles of DRD4. Furthermore, treatment with a TGFBR1 inhibitor combined with a BMP inhibitor effectively counteracts the pro-metastatic effects induced by DRD4 both in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, these findings uncover an unconventional role for DRD4 beyond its classic function as a neurotransmitter receptor. The intracellular signaling of DRD4 interacting with TGFBR1 can be targeted pharmacologically for CRC therapy.},

  abstract     = {Harvesting sustainable clean energy from natural water evaporation holds great promise to provide continuous power for portable and wearable electronics. However, poor portability and complex fabrication processes hinder the low-cost and large-scale integration of flexible evaporation-driven electricity generators (FEEGs). Herein, a fully-printed flexible evaporation-driven generator (PFEEG) is developed. Utilizing custom-formulated functional inks, the asymmetric structures, current collectors, and hygroscopic water storage units can be manufactured by a patternable, scalable, and layer-by-layer deposition technique of screen printing. Thus, a PFEEG unit (0.5 cm × 1 cm × 38 µm) can generate a voltage of ≈0.8 V over a wide relative humidity (RH) range from 20% to 90%, and a maximum power density of 1.55 µW cm −2 at 70% RH. An array of 200 PFEEGs connected in series or parallel can produce voltages up to 152.41 V or a current up to 1.02 mA. Furthermore, the scalable PFEEG array can not only be seamlessly connected with the printed flexible circuit but can also be integrated with a humidity sensor and display arrays to form a self-powered printed flexible sensing system.

Bone-targeting AAV of Xcr1 can improve bone formation in osteoporosis mice, suggesting that XCR1 can be a new susceptibility gene for osteoporosis.

  abstract     = {Cyclohexanone oxime, a critical precursor for nylon-6 production, is traditionally synthesized via the hydroxylamine method under industrial harsh conditions. Here is present a one-step electrochemical integrated approach for the efficient production of cyclohexanone oxime under ambient conditions. This approach employed the coupling of in situ electro-synthesized H 2 O 2 over a cobalt (Co)-based electrocatalyst with the titanium silicate-1 (TS-1) heterogeneous catalyst to achieve the cyclohexanone ammoximation process. The cathode electrocatalyst is consisted of atomically dispersed Co sites and small Co nanoparticles co-anchored on carboxylic multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CoSAs/SNPs-OCNTs), which delivered superior electrocatalytic activity toward the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e − ORR) with high-efficient H 2 O 2 production in 0.1 m sodium phosphate (NaPi). Theoretical calculations revealed that the introduction of Co nanoparticles effectively optimized the binding strength of * OOH species on Co atomic sites, thus facilitating the 2e − ORR. The subsequent tandem catalytic system achieved a high cyclohexanone conversion of 71.7% ± 1.1% with a cyclohexanone oxime selectivity of 70.3% ± 0.6%. In this system, the TS-1 catalyst effectively captured the * OOH intermediate and activated the in situ generated H 2 O 2 to form Ti-OOH species, which promoted the formation of hydroxylamine and thereby enhanced the oxime production performance.},

  abstract     = {Despite considerable advancements in the treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC), the overall survival rate for patients with advanced CRC remains below 50%, primarily due to challenges posed by drug resistance and metastasis. Here, a novel “Three-in-One” Cu-based metal-organic framework nanozyme with peroxidase-like (POD-like) activity has been successfully developed, aiming to promote CRC cell death by dual targeting of oxidative stress and copper ion homeostasis, which could promote CRC cell death via apoptosis and cuproptosis, and facilitate hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) degradation, leading to the reversal of chemoresistance in tumor therapy. These nanozymes, composed of copper and 2-propylimidazole (Cu-PrIm), feature a distorted Cu-N4 catalytic active center that mimics natural enzyme structures consisting of copper and histidine residues, endowing them with enzyme-like activities. The antitumor efficacy of Cu-PrIm nanozymes is validated in various in vivo models of CRC. Especially Cu-PrIm nanozymes exhibit excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability, and a tolerable toxicity profile in mouse models, making them a strong candidate for clinical translation. Taken together, the study introduces a novel therapeutic paradigm in CRC treatment by targeting these vulnerabilities and leveraging the potential using “Three-in-One” Cu-PrIm nanozymes to address multiple pathways simultaneously.},

Fe doping can induce structure reconstruction of nanozymes with abundant defect production, including Fe substitution and oxygen vacancies (OVs), which markedly increased multiple enzyme-mimicking activity. Catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) enzyme-like performance of Fe-VO x can effectively reprogram jawbone microenvironment to restore mitochondrial dysfunction and enhance mitophagy. Moreover, the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect of Fe-VO x made it a good photothermal nanoagents for inhibiting jaw infection.

  abstract     = {Collagen fiber skeleton from animal skin is an ideal substrate for electronic skin (e-skin). However, the interface mismatch between conductive materials and skeleton and the monotonicity of conductive network still hinder its creation. Herein, a novel collagen fiber-based e-skin with dual-mode conduction of NaCl and conductive spheres (IECS) is accomplished by loading organohydrogel into the skeleton via “permeation and self-assembly”. The resulting interpenetrating network produces a 3D continuous, conductive pathway and strong interface interaction with high-density hydrogen bonding, thus exhibiting excellent strength (24.5 MPa), conductivity (14.82 S m −1 ), sensing performance (sensitivity of 16.64), and environmental stability. The physical structure (3D skeleton, interpenetrating network) and chemical interaction (interface interaction, salting-out) achieve energy dissipation. Meanwhile, the sensitivity is enhanced by dual-mode conduction, conductive sphere array, and deformation amplification induced by collagen fibers. Additionally, the strong bonding ability between glycerin and collagen fibers with water molecules provides anti-freezing and moisture-retention characteristics. Thus, the strategic synergy of compositional and structural design makes IECS a promising force-sensing part of piezoresistive sensor for human movement, pulse frequency, cipher transmission, and pressure distribution. In short, IECS presents a multifunctional platform for the invention of high-performance e-skin with on-demand property, which offers great application potential in wearable electronics.},

  abstract     = {The rational design of microwave absorption (MA) material featuring light weight, wide absorption bandwidth, and infrared stealth property is crucial for military stealth and health protection but remains challenging. Herein, an innovative N-doped carbon nanocage-in-microcage structure with tunable carbon-coated Ni (NC/Ni(HS)) is reported via a reliable Ni-catalyzed and Ni-templated method. The hierarchically hollow structure of nanocage-in-microcage composites can optimize the impedance matching and respond to multiple reflections and scattering of incident microwaves and infrared waves. Moreover, the magnetic Ni nanoparticles improve the synergistic interactions between confined heterointerfaces and promote interfacial polarization. Such an ingenious structure endows NC/Ni(HS) with outstanding MA performance and infrared stealth properties. Specifically, NC/Ni(HS)-10 with an optimal dielectric property, exhibits excellent MA performance. At an ultralow fill loading of 4 wt.%, a wide absorption bandwidth of 6.16 GHz is achieved at a thickness of 2.63 mm, and a strong reflection loss of −63.67 dB is obtained at a thickness of 2.00 mm. In addition, NC/Ni(HS)-10 shows a low infrared emissivity in the range of 3‒14 µm, which is the key to compatibility with infrared stealth. This work paves the way for the design of advanced MA materials that meet the requirements of multispectral-compatible stealth.},

  abstract     = {Photoelectric conversion in ferroelectric crystals can support many important applications in modern on-chip technology, but suffering from two problems, low responsive current and narrow responsive range. Especially, wide-gap ferroelectric oxides are only active at short-wavelength ultraviolet region with weak photocurrent at nanoampere levels. Here, a bifunctional design strategy of ferroelectric-order and electronic-band to improve the photocurrent and extend the responsive range simultaneously, is proposed. In a Cu-doped KTa 1− x Nb x O 3 (KTN) perovskite crystal, a conductive channel is constructed by “head-to-head” ferroelectric domains, associated with the emergence of micrometer-scale supercells. In addition, the introduction of Cu + ion can induce defect levels, thus extending the responsive range beyond the inherent absorption of pure KTN. Through rational device optimization, a record self-powered responsivity of 5.23 mA W −1 is realized in Cu:KTN photodetector, which is two orders of magnitude higher than undoped KTN crystal. The temperature-dependent light diffraction and photocurrent show that the ferroelectric-order is dominated in this photoresponse behavior. Moreover, Cu:KTN detector is active in the broadband range from 390 to 1030 nm, covering ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared regions. This work provides an effective method for the design of next-generation self-powered photodetectors with ultrahigh responsivity and ultrawide responsive range.},

  abstract     = {Superlattice materials have emerged as promising candidates for water electrocatalysis due to their tunable crystal structures, electronic properties, and potential for interface engineering. However, the catalytic activity of transition metal-based superlattice materials for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is often constrained by their intrinsic electronic band structures, which can limit charge carrier mobility and active site availability. Herein, a highly efficient electrocatalyst based on a VS 2 -VS heterodimensional (2D-1D) superlattice with sulfur vacancies is designed addressing the limitations posed by the intrinsic electronic structure. The enhanced catalytic performance of the VS 2 -VS superlattice is primarily attributed to the engineered heterojunction, where the work function difference between the VS 2 layer and VS chain induces a charge separation field that promotes efficient electron-hole separation. Introducing sulfur vacancies further amplifies this effect by inducing quantum localization of the separated electrons, thereby significantly boosting HER activity. Both theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the superlattice achieves a ΔG H* of −0.06 eV and an impressively low overpotential of 46 mV at 10 mA·cm −2 in acidic media, surpassing the performance of commercial Pt/C while maintaining exceptional stability over 15 000 cycles. This work underscores the pivotal role of advanced material engineering in designing catalysts for sustainable energy applications.},

Flexible biomedical devices that enable sustained ocular drug delivery and can regulate the drug release rate according to physiological conditions are highly desirable for glaucoma treatments, addressing both low drug bioavailability and poor patient compliance from manual drug administration, and improving treatment outcomes. Inspired by the structure and reciprocating motion of fish dorsal fins, a drug-eluting contact lens based on deformable microstructures for non-invasive ocular surface drug delivery is developed. Liquid drugs are stored within the interstices of the deformable microstructural units, allowing for continuous drug release through diffusion upon contact with the ocular surface. Finite element analysis is utilized to study the intraocular drug transport dynamics of glaucoma and optimize the overall layout of the device. Microstructural units undergo deformation under loading, altering the interstitial spaces and modulating the drug release rate. This device can adaptively adjust its drug release rate based on changes in intraocular pressure (IOP) and can be proactively regulated in response to cyclic eye loads, accommodating elevated IOP caused by varying body postures and activities. As a flexible, non-invasive, highly dynamic, and adaptive drug delivery platform, it holds significant potential for future biomedical applications.},

  abstract     = {The identification of ferroptosis-sensitive cancers is critical for the application of ferroptosis-inducing therapies in cancer therapy. Here, patient-derived organoid screening models of colorectal cancer are established to identify tumors that are sensitive to ferroptosis-inducing therapy. This study discovers that patient-derived tumors characterized by mitophagy deficiency are hypersensitive to ferroptosis-inducing therapies. Mechanistically, a novel negative feedback regulatory pathway of lipid peroxidation is identified, which is one of the important intrinsic anti-ferroptosis mechanisms of cancer cells. Lipid peroxidation-mediated endoplasmic reticulum stress transcriptionally upregulates Parkin to promote mitophagy through ATF4. Mitophagy limits the generation of lipid peroxidation products and subsequently inhibits ferroptosis by inhibiting the accumulation of mitochondrial ROS. Mitophagy-deficient tumors lack this anti-ferroptotic mechanism, unleashing the generation of lipid peroxidation and potent ferroptotic cell death induced by erastin, RSL3, cysteine deprivation, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy. More importantly, ferroptosis-inducing therapy selectively inhibits the growth and distant metastasis of mitophagy-deficient tumors in vivo. In summary, patient-derived organoids of colorectal cancer patients for screening ferroptosis-sensitive tumors are established, providing a paradigm for identifying that patient-derived tumors are sensitive to ferroptosis-inducing therapies. This study concludes that mitophagy-deficient tumors are vulnerable to ferroptosis induction, which may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for tumors deficient in mitophagy.},

  abstract     = {Antifungal resistance, particularly the rise of multidrug-resistance strains, poses a significant public health threat. In this study, the study identifies a novel multidrug-resistance gene, msp-8 , encoding a helicase, through experimental evolution with Neurospora crassa as a model. Deletion of msp-8 conferred multidrug resistance in N. crassa , Aspergillus fumigatus , and Fusarium verticillioides . However, the transcript levels of genes encoding known drug targets or efflux pumps remain unaltered with msp-8 deletion. Interestingly, MSP-8 interacted with ribosomal proteins, and this mutant displays compromised ribosomal function, causing translational disturbance. Notably, inhibition of protein translation enhances resistance to azoles, amphotericin B, and polyoxin B. Furthermore, MSP-8 deficiency or inhibition of translation reduces intracellular ketoconazole accumulation and membrane-bound amphotericin B content, directly causing antifungal resistance. Additionaly, MSP-8 deficiency induces cell wall remodeling, and decreases intracellular ROS levels, further contributing to resistance. The findings reveal a novel multidrug resistance mechanism independent of changes in drug target or efflux pump, while MSP-8 deficiency suppresses protein translation, thereby facilitating the development of resistance with fitness cost. This study provides the first evidence that MSP-8 participates in protein translation and that translation suppression can cause multidrug resistance in fungi, offering new insights into resistance mechanisms in clinical and environmental fungal strains.},

The β FL has shown a 123% increase, from −1.66 Oe/(MA cm − 2 ) to -3.8 Oe/(MA cm − 2 ). As a result, the multilayered Ta/Pt/Ta (0.3 nm insertion)/Co/Ta structure leads to a notable decrease in J c , exceeding a remarkable 90% compared to the simpler Ta/Pt/Co/Ta structure, ultimately achieving a significantly low value of 2.7 MA cm − 2 .

Investigations into the surface curvature on SACs are still ongoing, and the impact of the concave surface is often overlooked. In this work, theoretical calculations indicate that curved surfaces, particularly those with concavity, can optimize the electronic structures of single Fe sites and facilitate the reductive release of *OH. A carbon sphere featuring uniformly oriented channels and a chiral multi-shelled carbon hollow nanosphere are selected as carbon matrices due to their accessible concave and/or convex surfaces. After loading Fe species, the resulting catalysts with Fe SA in curved surfaces exhibit excellent oxygen reduction reaction activity ( E 1/2 = ≈0.89 V), strong methanol tolerance, and favorable long-term stability. Impressively, a solid-state flexible Zn–air battery based on this catalyst exhibits a remarkable durability over 40 h with a high peak power density of 122.1 mW cm −2 and excellent charge–discharge performance at different bending angles.

The activation of molecular imaging probe (pCY-pairs) by consumption of endogenous caspase-3 initiates fluorescence resonance energy transfer-guided theranostic pattern, aiming to restore mitochondrial dysfunction-induced oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in alveolar epithelial cells II (AECs II). This process sequentially resists the expression of interleukin-1β and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor through combined with nintedanib, further suppressing abnormal injury of AECs II and persistent migration and proliferation of inflammatory cells. Especially, the homeostasis of injured AECs II diminishes excessive accumulation of transforming growth factor-β to restrain myofibroblasts proliferation and collagen deposition, thereby amplifying the possibility of reversing PF.

  abstract     = {Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a prevalent clinical syndrome with high morbidity and mortality. Accumulating studies suggest mitochondrial dysfunction as the typical characteristics and key process of AKI, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. The YME1-like 1 (YME1L1) ATPase, an inner mitochondrial membrane protein, is screened and identified to be downregulated in renal tubular epithelial cells of various mouse models and patients of AKI. Dramatically, restoration of YME1L1 expression significantly alleviates cisplatin-induced AKI and subsequent chronic kidney disease (CKD) through attenuating mitochondrial dysfunction via maintaining optic atrophy 1 (OPA1)-mediated mitochondrial energy metabolism homeostasis. Mechanistically, the upregulated expression of sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1c (SREBP1c) is demonstrated to be responsible for cisplatin-mediated transcriptional inhibition of YME1L1 via directly binding to its promoter region. Moreover, cisplatin-induced methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3)-mediated m6A modification enhances SREBP1c mRNA stability, thereby upregulating its expression. Notably, both depletion of SREBP1c and renal tubule-specific overexpression of YME1L1 markedly ameliorate cisplatin-induced AKI and its transition to CKD. Taken together, these findings suggest that METTL3-mediated SREBP1c upregulation contributes to AKI and its progression to CKD through disrupting mitochondrial energy metabolism via transcriptionally suppressing YME1L1. Targeting the SREBP1c/YME1L1 signaling may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy against AKI.},

The optimal 3DOM material made by templating with PS microspheres with a diameter of ≈350 nm, 3DOM-Ca80Mn10Zr10, shows a solar light absorptance of ≈74.1% and an initial energy storage density of 1706.4 kJ kg −1 . Importantly, it gives an impressive energy storage density loss of &lt; 6.0% and maintains above 1600 kJ kg −1 after 125 cycles. The density functional theory calculations reveal that the co-doping of Mn and Zr into the CaO crystal lattice offers a strong affinity to [Ca 4 O 4 ] clusters, as a result, the anti-sintering of CaO NPs is significantly enhanced under high temperature.},

  abstract     = {Emerging evidence suggests that the sterile alpha-motif (SAM) and histidine-aspartate (HD) domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) is implicated in various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, its precise role in tumor cells and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the expression patterns, prognostic values, and functional role of SAMHD1 in HCC progression. We constructed liver tissue microarrays using tumor and paired paratumor tissue specimens from 187 patients with primary HCC. Our findings indicate that nuclear SAMHD1 protein levels are increased in tumors compared to paratumor tissues. Moreover, nuclear SAMHD1 levels decline in advanced tumor stages, with higher SAMHD1 nuclear staining correlating with favorable prognostic outcomes. Hepatocyte-specific SAMHD1 knockout mice, generated by crossing SAMHD1 fl/fl mice with Alb-cre mice, showed accelerated tumor progression in a diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced HCC model. In hepatoma cell lines, nuclear overexpression of SAMHD1 inhibited cell proliferation by stalling mitosis, independent of its deoxynucleotide triphosphohydrolase (dNTPase) function. Mechanistically, SAMHD1 interacts with the cohesin complex in nucleus, enhancing sister chromatid cohesion during cell division, which delays metaphase progression. Our findings suggest that nuclear SAMHD1 plays a critical role in slowing HCC progression by regulating mitosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target by manipulating cohesin dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics is critically dependent on the precise modulation of the interactions between the key oxygen intermediates and catalytic active sites. Herein, a novel electrocatalyst is reported, featuring nitrogen-doped carbon-supported ultra-small copper oxide nanoparticles with the broken-symmetry C 4v coordination filed sites, achieved by a mild γ-ray radiation-induced method. The as-synthesized catalyst exhibits an excellent ORR activity with a half-wave potential of 0.873 V and shows no obvious decay over 50 h durability in alkaline solution. This superior catalytic activity is further corroborated by the high-performance in both primary and rechargeable Zn–air batteries with an ultrahigh-peak-power density (255.4 mW cm −2 ) and robust cycling stability. The experimental characterizations and density functional theory calculations show that the surface Cu atoms are configured in a compressed octahedron coordination. This geometric arrangement interacts with the key intermediate OH * , facilitating localized charge transfer and thereby weakening the Cu─O bond, which promotes the efficient transformation of OH * to OH − and the subsequent desorption, and markedly accelerates kinetics of the rate-determining step in the reaction. This study provides new insights for developing the utilization of γ-ray radiation chemistry to construct high-performance metal oxide-based catalysts with broken symmetry toward ORR.},

  abstract     = {Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) therapy application to attenuate myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MI/R) injury in clinical practice remains challenging. The secretome, derived from hypoxia-preconditioned cardiomyocytes (SHPC), potentially mimics the IPC microenvironment and facilitates IPC clinical translation. This study aims to determine whether SHPC can be a feasible alternative to IPC for attenuating MI/R injury, and to identify the functional factor of SHPC. The ultrafiltration technique is applied to generate an SHPC formulation that is intramyocardially injected before reperfusion in a murine MI/R model. The effects of SHPC on cardiomyocyte apoptosis, pyroptosis, and neutrophil polarization are evaluated. Secretomics, neutralizing antibodies, and recombinant proteins are employed to identify the functional factor in SHPC. Co-immunoprecipitation assays, RNA sequencing, and site-directed mutagenesis are conducted to investigate the underlying mechanism. Additionally, a recombinant functional factor-encapsulated hydrogel is developed for intrapericardial injections (iPC). An intramyocardial SHPC injection in MI/R-injured mice strikingly reduces infarct size and the expression of cardiac injury biomarker while improving cardiac function. SHPC eliminated mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and triggered neutrophil polarization to reduce cardiomyocyte apoptosis/pyroptosis upon hypoxia/reoxygenation injury. Stanniocalcin 1 (Stc1) is identified as the functional factor in SHPC, mediating hypoxic microenvironment. Mechanistically, hypoxia-preconditioned cardiomyocytes secrete Stc1 into the microenvironment and activate calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) that increases Stat3 phosphorylation at Ser727 via nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2)-mediated S-nitrosylation, thereby decreasing cardiomyocyte apoptosis/pyroptosis in an autocrine mechanism. Simultaneously, Stc1 facilitates cardiomyocyte-neutrophil crosstalk, thereby triggering neutrophil polarization to reduce inflammatory damage via the CaSR/NOS2/Stat3 axis in a paracrine mechanism. Pericardial delivery of a recombinant rStc1-encapsulated hydrogel has extended the therapeutic time window of rStc1, improving long-term cardiac function. The hypoxia microenvironment preconditioning, which mimicked by SHPC, attenuated MI/R injury via Stc1-mediated cardiomyocyte self-protection and neutrophil polarization. This study suggests that SHPC, with hypoxia preconditioning factor Stc1, represents a clinically feasible alternative to IPC for attenuating MI/R injury.},

The comparison of the entropy concept in alloys, ceramics, and non-metallic glass is discussed. As a typical example, the activation and preservation of the entropy stabilized effect of a typical niobosilicate glass system at different temperatures are studied. The relation between the micro-configurations and the entropic property is analyzed. Via the entropy engineering strategy, the crystallization of the niobosilicate glass can be manipulated. As a result, the LiNbO 3 nanocrystal-in-glass (NiG) composite with high crystallinity is developed, which exhibits 8 times higher nonlinearity compared with the β -BBO crystal.

  abstract     = {Flame-retardant phosphate-based electrolytes effectively enhance lithium-ion battery safety but suffer from poor compatibility with graphite anodes and high-voltage cathodes, hindering scalability. Fluorinated phosphates, though widely used, increase interfacial resistance at the anode, degrading performance. In this work, carbonate solvents with strong polarity are introduced to prevent tris(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) phosphate (TFEP) from participating in the solvation structure of lithium ions. This strategy forms a quasi-localized high-concentration solvation structure, thereby restricting the reduction of TFEP and its impact on the graphite anode. The LiNi 0.8 Mn 0.1 Co 0.1 O 2 (NCM811) | Graphite (Gr) pouch cell with optimized electrolyte exhibits a capacity retention rate of 80.1% after 370 cycles at 0.5C, which is much more stable than the electrolyte with TFEP-involved solvation structure (capacity retention rate: 47.1% after 300 cycles). The corresponding pouch cell with cut-off voltage to 4.5 V exhibits a capacity retention rate of 82.8% after 125 cycles, significantly outperforming cells employing commercial carbonate electrolytes (capacity retention rate: 56.9% after 125 cycles). Thus, the developed quasi-localized high-concentration solvation structure can effectively stabilize the electrode interface, greatly enhancing the cycling performance of phosphate-based flame-retardant electrolytes.},

Although magnetic damping can be enhanced by the band hybridization between ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic materials at the interface, the contribution of individual subbands on the hybridized bands to magnetic damping is fully unexplored. Here, it is found that magnetic damping α eff is modified by the Fermi level in Fe/GeTe heterostructures via Bi doping. By combining angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, the enhancement of damping originated from the strongly hybridized band structures between Fe and the surface Rashba bands of GeTe are unveiled. More interestingly, the Fermi level modulates the density of states (DOS) ratio between the subbands of GeTe and the total DOS of hybridized states, which is directly proportional to the magnetic damping. This work gives an insightful physical understanding of the magnetic damping influenced by the hybridized band structures and opens a novel avenue to manipulate magnetic damping by band engineering.},

Such a TCa/SPN/a is constructed to exhibit X-ray response for the activatable delivery of mitochondria-targeting Ca compound and cGAMP as stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist.

  abstract     = {The high transmissibility and mutation ability of coronaviruses enable them to easily escape existing immune protection and also pose a challenge to existing antiviral drugs. Moreover, drugs only targeting viruses cannot always attenuate the “cytokine storm”. Herein, a synthetic heparan sulfate (HS) mimetic, HMSA-06 is reported, that exhibited antiviral activities against both the SARS-CoV-2 prototype and Omicron strains by targeting viral entry and replication. Of particular note, HMSA-06 demonstrated more potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects than PG545 and Roneparstat. SARS-CoV-2 is reported to hijack autophagy to facilitate its replication, therefore boosting autophagy can attenuate SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is revealed that HMSA-06, but not a similar HS mimetic that failed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2, can upregulate cellular autophagy flux. In addition, HMSA-06 was found to robustly block the NLRP3-mediated inflammatory reaction in SARS-CoV-2 infected THP-1 derived macrophages as evidenced by a reduction in inflammasome formation and the subsequent decreased secretion of mature caspase-1 and IL-1β. The HMSA-06&#39;s inflammation inhibitory function is further confirmed using a LPS/ATP-stimulated THP-1 macrophage model. Altogether, this study has identified a promising HS mimetic to combat SARS-CoV-2-associated diseases by inhibiting viral infection and attenuating viral-induced inflammatory reaction, providing insights into the development of novel anti-coronavirus drugs in the future.},

  abstract     = {Rechargeable Li–SO 2 batteries offer low-cost, high-energy density benefits and can leverage manufacturing processes for the existing primary version at a commercial scale. However, they have so far only been demonstrated in an “open-system” with continuous gas supply, preventing practical application. Here, the utilization and reversibility of SO 2 along with the lithium stability are addressed, all essential for long-life, high-energy batteries. The study discovers that high SO 2 utilization is achievable only from SO 2 dissolved in electrolytes between the lithium anode and carbon cathode. This results from a unique osmosis phenomenon where SO 2 consumption increases salt concentration, driving the influx of organic solvents rather than SO 2 from outside the current path. This insight leads to configure a bobbin-cell with all electrolytes between the electrodes, realizing nearly 70% of SO 2 utilization, &gt; 12x greater than in conventional coin cells. To improve reaction rate and SO 2 reversibility, triphenylamine is employed to the electrolyte, creating an electron-rich environment that alleviates the disproportionation of discharge products. Incorporating this additive into a bobbin-cell with a lithium protective layer yields a cell with a projected energy density exceeding 183.2 Wh kg −1 .

  abstract     = {Effective regulation and reconstruction of the microenvironment are critical for the regeneration of chronic wounds. Diabetic wounds, in particular, pose a significant clinical challenge due to increased oxidative stress and dysfunctional healing processes. In this study, a novel therapeutic strategy is developed using 3D copper-magnesium bimetallic antioxidant nano-enzymes (Cu/Mg-MOF) to mitigate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and restore redox balance through electron transfer. To optimize delivery, a thermo-sensitive hydrogel composed of chitosan (CS) and ε -polylysine (PL) is designed, serving as an efficient carrier for the nano-enzymes. This Cu/Mg-MOF@CS/PL hydrogel exhibits excellent physical properties, including injectability, softness, and biocompatibility, making it ideal for application in diabetic wounds. In a diabetic wound model, treatment with Cu/Mg-MOF@CS/PL hydrogel significantly accelerated wound healing, with a closure rate of 90.6% by day 14, compared to just 55.4% in the untreated group. The hydrogel effectively promoted key aspects of wound healing, such as collagen deposition, re-epithelialization, angiogenesis, and immunomodulation. These findings underscore the potential of the Cu/Mg-MOF@CS/PL hydrogel as a promising therapeutic system for enhancing the healing of diabetic wounds.},

  abstract     = {Overcoming acquired resistance to Osimertinib remains a critical challenge in treating NSCLC. This research indicates that Osimertinib-resistant cells exhibit a strong dependence on glutamine metabolism. However, targeting GLS1 shows limited anticancer effects, probably because it cannot fully block the glutamine metabolic pathway. The investigation reveals that a more effective strategy involves simultaneously inhibiting both ASCT2 and GLS1. After confirming the efficacy of this dual-targeting approach against Osimertinib-resistant cells in preclinical models, the potential of utilizing a broad-spectrum glutamine metabolism antagonist is further explored to achieve superior antitumor efficacy. DON, broad-spectrum glutamine antagonist, presents toxicity issues. Herein, the high NQO1 expression in Osimertinib-resistant NSCLC cells is leveraged to design an NQO1-responsive DON prodrug, 10e (LBJ-10e). This prodrug demonstrates superior safety compared to natural DON and greater antitumor activity against resistant tumors compared to the clinical phase II drug DRP104. These findings may address the clinical limitations of GLS1 allosteric inhibitors and underscore prodrug strategies in effectively treating Osimertinib-resistant lung cancer, providing a foundation for future clinical trials.},

However, the flexoelectric paradigm currently lacks a strategy to effectively tune the strain gradient for optimal electro-mechanical coupling. This study proposes a quantized collision model accessible through ionic irradiation technology to explore the flexoelectricity and precisely modulate the strain gradient. The lattice strain is introduced in SrTiO 3 (STO) single crystals and tuned broadly by irradiation with ions of He + , C + , and P + at dose of 1 × 10 14 and 2 × 10 15 ion cm −2 , respectively. Under C + ion irradiation at a dose of 2 × 10 15 ion cm −2 , thin-film X-ray diffraction reveals a strain gradient up to ≈0.65% nm −1 . The resulted polarization is found to orient out-of-plane, as observed through X-ray reciprocal space mapping and high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy. Piezoresponse force microscopy characterization reveals that the electric-induced out-of-plane polarization reversal emerges at room temperature, corresponding to a stain gradient ≈0.05% nm −1 in STO&#39;s flexoelectric response. This study demonstrates that ion irradiation is an effective strategy for precisely tuning the flexoelectric properties.},

However, a limited choice of constituent molecules restricts their property space and potential applications. To overcome this challenge, an innovative approach coupling molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and a novel graph variational autoencoder (VAE) model for inverse design of vitrimer chemistries with desired glass transition temperature ( T g ) is presented. The first diverse vitrimer dataset of one million chemistries is curated and T g for 8,424 of them is calculated by high-throughput MD simulations calibrated by a Gaussian process model. The proposed VAE employs dual graph encoders and a latent dimension overlapping scheme which allows for individual representation of multi-component vitrimers. High accuracy and efficiency of the framework are demonstrated by discovering novel vitrimers with desirable T g beyond the training regime. To validate the effectiveness of the framework in experiments, vitrimer chemistries are generated with a target T g = 323 K. By incorporating chemical intuition, a novel vitrimer with T g of 311–317 K is synthesized, experimentally demonstrating healability and flowability. The proposed framework offers an exciting tool for polymer chemists to design and synthesize novel, sustainable polymers for various applications.},

  abstract     = {Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is the leading cause of hepatic graft dysfunction, resulting from hepatocyte damage. Nevertheless, given the few specialized therapeutics available in hepatic IRI, additional mechanistic insights into hepatocyte damage are required. Here, the protein solute carrier family 39 member 14 (SLC39A14) is identified as a pro-ferroptosis target in hepatocytes of human liver allografts through single-cell RNA sequencing analysis. SLC39A14 knockdown significantly mitigated hepatic IRI by preventing hepatocyte ferroptosis in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, the inhibition of SLC39A14 suppressed non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI) uptake by hepatocytes, thereby reducing iron overload and cell ferroptosis. Moreover, human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) are found to exhibit a notable therapeutic effect on hepatic IRI by downregulating SLC39A14 expression. Exosomes derived from hBMSCs delivered abundant miR-16-5p into hepatocytes, which post-transcriptionally suppressed the expression of SLC39A14 and reduced cell ferroptosis induced by hepatic IRI. In conclusion, SLC39A14 triggers hepatic IRI by mediating NTBI uptake into hepatocytes and inducing hepatocyte ferroptosis. Moreover, hBMSC-based therapy is promising to reverse this progression of hepatic IRI.},

  abstract     = {Photoelectrochemical (PEC) CO 2 reduction using a photocathode is an attractive method for making valuable chemical products due to its simplicity and lower overpotential requirements. However, previous PEC processes have often been diffusion-limited leading to low production rates of the CO 2 reduction reaction, due to inefficient gas diffusion through the liquid electrolyte to the catalyst surface, particularly at high current densities. In this study, a gas-permeable photocathode in a continuous flow PEC reactor is incorporated, which facilitates the direct supply of CO 2 gas to the photocathode-electrolyte interface, unlike dark reaction-based flow reactors. This concept is demonstrated using Ag-TiO 2 on carbon paper, illuminated through a quartz window and flowing liquid electrolyte. CO 2 supply is managed via pressure and flow control on the non-illuminated side of the carbon paper. The photocurrent density is significantly influenced by the flow rates and pressure of CO 2 gas, and the electrolyte flow rates. Compared to the traditional H-cell, the continuous PEC flow reactor achieves ≈10-fold increase in CO faradaic efficiency, 30-fold increase in production rate and 16-fold increase in stability without catalyst modifications. This work provides essential insights into the design and application of continuous gas-liquid flow PEC reactor systems, highlighting their potential for other PEC reactions.},

Electrochemical ion intercalation between stacked layers offers a promising approach to stabilize bulk metastable phases and to explore the effects of extreme carrier doping and strain. However, in situ characterization methods to study the structural evolution and dynamical functional properties of these intercalated materials remains limited. Here a novel experimental platform is presented capable of simultaneously performing electrochemical lithium-ion intercalation and multimodal ultrafast characterization of the lattice using both electron diffraction and nonlinear optical techniques. Using the layered semimetal WTe 2 as a model system, the interlayer shear phonon mode that modulates stacking between 2Dlayers is probed, showing that small amounts of lithiation enhance the amplitude and lifetime of the phonon, contrary to expectations. This results from the dynamically fluctuating and anharmonic structure between nearly degenerate phases at room temperature, which can be stabilized by electronic carriers accompanying the inserted lithium ions. At high lithiation, the T d ’ structure emerges and quenches the phonon response. This work defines new approaches for using electrochemistry to engineer the dynamic structure of 2D materials.},

  abstract     = {Bacterial infections resistant to antimicrobial treatments, particularly those caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( P. aeruginosa ), frequently lead to elevated mortality rates. Tackling this resistance using therapeutic combinations with varied mechanisms has shown considerable promise. In this study, a bioinspired nanocarrier is successfully designed and engineered for targeted antibiotic delivery and toxin/bacteria clearance. This is achieved by encapsulating antibiotic-loaded framework nucleic acids with hybrid cell membranes acquired from neutrophils and platelets. By coating the hybrid membrane outside the shell, nanocarriers are endowed with the function of neutrophil-like chemotaxis and platelet-like bacteria adhesion to achieve the first stage of inflammation targeting. Based on the specific binding of bacteria toxin to the hybrid membrane, the release of antibiotic-loaded framework nucleic acids is triggered by toxin-mediated membrane lysis to fulfill the second stage of toxin neutralization and bacteria killing. Meanwhile, the immunomodulation potential of framework nucleic acids enables nanocarriers to accomplish the third stage of reversing the immunosuppressive microenvironment. In mouse models of acute and chronic P. aeruginosa pneumonia, the nanocarriers can reduce bacterial burden at a low dosage and decrease mortality with negligible toxicity. In sum, these findings have illustrated the remarkable capability of nanocarriers in treating recalcitrant bacterial infections.},

To address this, a hierarchical-targeting antioxidant nanodrug has been developed with a folic acid moiety (HAND) designed for high-resolution drug delivery in AKI treatment. For the first time, HAND enables sequential targeting from the kidney to the most severely damaged proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs), ultimately concentrating in the DNA-rich mitochondria and nucleus. As a result, HAND effectively scavenges ROS in situ, protecting both mitochondria and nuclei along with their vital genetic material. This action restores mitochondrial function, mitigates DNA oxidation and fragmentation, reduces apoptosis, and inhibits cGAS/STING-mediated sterile inflammation. Consequently, HAND demonstrates remarkable efficacy in safeguarding injured kidneys during AKI. Overall, this work pioneers a hierarchical, high-resolution antioxidant strategy, providing innovative guidance for the development of AKI therapies.},

  abstract     = {Embryonic muscle fiber formation determines post-birth muscle fiber totals. The previous research shows SYISL knockout significantly increases muscle fiber numbers and mass in mice, but the mechanism remains unclear. This study confirms that the SYISL gene, maternal gut microbiota, and their interaction significantly affect the number of muscle fibers in mouse embryos through distinct mechanisms, as SYISL knockout alters maternal gut microbiota composition and boosts butyrate levels in embryonic serum. Both fecal microbiota transplantation and butyrate feeding significantly increase muscle fiber numbers in offspring, with butyrate inhibiting histone deacetylases and increasing histone acetylation in embryonic muscle. Combined analysis of RNA-seq between wild-type and SYISL knockout mice with ChIP-seq for H3K9ac and H3K27ac reveals that SYISL and maternal microbiota interaction regulates myogenesis via the butyrate-HDAC-H3K9ac/H3K27ac pathway. Furthermore, scRNA-seq analysis shows that SYISL knockout alone significantly increases the number and proportion of myogenic cells and their dynamics, independently of regulating histone acetylation levels. Cell communication analysis suggests that this may be due to the downregulation of signaling pathways such as MSTN and TGFβ. Overall, multiple pathways are highlighted through which SYISL influences embryonic muscle development, offering valuable insights for treating muscle diseases and improving livestock production.},

  abstract     = {Precious metal electrical contact materials are pivotal in microelectronic devices due to their excellent chemical stability and electrical properties. Their practical application is hindered by the strength, contact resistance, and high cost. Multi-principal elements alloys (MPEAs) provide the possibility to develop cost-effective materials with enhanced mechanical properties. To address this, a novel precious metal MPEA, PdAgCuAuPtZn alloy, is designed, which exhibits significant solid solution strengthening and aging strengthening effects. The ultimate tensile strength increases from 747 MPa in the solution state to 1126 MPa in the aged state, while resistivity remains low. This study presents the first systematic investigation into the strengthening mechanisms of precious metal MPEAs using nanoindentation technology. These findings indicate that the aging strengthening of the alloy is attributed to spinodal decomposition (SD) and chemical short-range order (CSRO) in the matrix. Furthermore, the precipitation structure with Cu-rich and Ag-rich phases gradually replaces the matrix, primarily accounting for aging softening. Additionally, it is discovered that precipitation structure can be strengthened by CSRO formed in the Cu-rich phase, thus providing an innovative strengthening in PdAgCuAuPtZn alloy. These results will be beneficial to both deeply understanding the aging behaviors of PdAgCuAuPtZn alloys and designing high-performance precious metal MPEAs.},

  abstract     = {Leveraging functional materials to develop advanced personal protective equipment is of significant importance for cutting off the propagation of infectious diseases, yet faces ongoing challenges owing to the unsatisfied antimicrobial efficiency. Herein a hierarchically porous cerium metal–organic framework (Ce-MOF) boosting the antimicrobial performance by intensifying catalytic reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and bacterial entrapment simultaneously is reported. This Ce-MOF presents dendritic surface topography and hierarchical pore channels where the Lewis acid Ce sites are dispersedly anchored. Attributing to this sophisticated nanoarchitecture rendering the catalytic Ce sites highly accessible, it shows a ca. 1800-fold activity enhancement for the catalytic conversion of atmospheric oxygen to highly toxic ROS compared to traditional CeO 2 . Additionally, the dendritic and negative-charged surface engineered in this Ce-MOF substantially enhances the binding affinity toward positive-charged bacteria, enabling the spatial proximity between the bacteria and the short-lived ROS and therefore maximizing the utilization of highly toxic ROS to inactivate bacteria. It is demonstrated that this Ce-MOF-integrated face mask displays almost 100% antimicrobial efficacy even in insufficient light and dark scenarios. This work provides important insights into the design of antibacterial MOF materials by a pore- and surface-engineering strategy and sheds new light on the development of advanced self-antimicrobial devices.},

  abstract     = {Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) is an important chemical in synthetic chemistry with huge demands. Photocatalytic synthesis of H 2 O 2 via oxygen reduction and water oxidation reactions (ORR and WOR) is considered as a promising and desirable solution for on-site applications. However, the efficiency of such a process is low due to the poor solubility of molecular oxygen and the rapid reverse reaction of hydroxyl radicals ( • OH) with hydrogen atoms (H). Here, a strategy is proposed to boost the H 2 O 2 evolution via oxidation of water by employing a H acceptor ( A , nitrocyclohexane), an • OH mediator ( M , dioxane), and a photocatalyst (CdS nanosheets). While • OH radicals are stabilized by dioxane to produce ketyl radicals prior to the formation of H 2 O 2 , H atoms are effectively utilized in the generation of cyclohexanone oxime, an important intermediate in the production of Nylon 6. The system displays a rapid kinetic accumulation of H 2 O 2 (0.13 min −1 ) to a high concentration (6.6 m M ). At optimum reaction conditions, a high quantum efficiency (16.6%) and light-to-chemical conversion efficiency (4.9%) can be achieved under 410 nm irradiation.},

  abstract     = {The significant interest in perovskite oxides stems from their compositional and structural flexibility, particularly in the field of electrochemistry. In this study, the double E strategy (exsolution and electrodeposition strategies) is successfully devised for synthesizing perovskite-based bifunctional electrocatalysts, enabling simultaneous OER and HER applications with exceptional catalytic performance. The synthesized R-LCTFe/Ni catalyst exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic activity, delivering low overpotentials of 349 and 309 mV at 10 mA cm −2 for OER and HER, respectively, indicating substantial improvements in the inherent electrocatalytic activity. Moreover, the impressive stability of R-LCTFe/Ni under alkaline conditions underscores its potential for practical water electrolysis applications. The superior bifunctional electrocatalytic performance can be attributed to the reduced charge transfer resistance and the synergistic cooperation between exsolved Fe nanoparticles and electrodeposited Ni compounds. The successful development of the R-LCTFe/Co catalyst further confirms the transferability of the double E strategy. Compared to R-LCTFe/Ni, the overpotential of R-LCTFe/Co is 58 mV higher for OER, yet 48 mV lower for HER at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 . This study provides an efficient and promising approach for the fabrication of highly active perovskite-based electrocatalysts, contributing valuable insights into the design of bifunctional electrocatalysts for OER and HER.},

  abstract     = {Chondrocyte senescence is a key driver of osteoarthritis (OA). Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress can induce chondrocyte senescence. However, the specific mechanisms by which senescence contributes to OA progression are not fully understood. Here, it is attested that Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) is significantly upregulated in osteoarthritic chondrocytes in both humans and mice. DPP4 promotes oxidative stress and cellular senescence in chondrocytes through excessive mitochondrial fission in an enzyme-independent manner. Intra-articular injection of adeno-associated virus 2 to upregulate DPP4 in chondrocytes promotes post-traumatic and aging-induced OA in mice in an enzyme-independent manner. Mechanistically, DPP4 competitively binds to Myosin heavy chain 9 (MYH9), interfering with its E3 ubiquitin ligase Carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP), and thereby upregulates MYH9 expression. Finally, a small molecule, 4,5-Dicaffeoylquinic acid is identified, which disrupts the interaction between DPP4 and MYH9, thereby ameliorating post-traumatic and aging-induced OA in mice caused by DPP4 upregulation. The study indicates that the non-enzymatic activity of DPP4 is a promising target for OA treatment.},

However, the increased tumor hypoxia and acidification will lead to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) featuring exhausted T cells, limiting the effectiveness of subsequent therapies following TACE. Herein, a stable water-in-oil lipiodol Pickering emulsion by employing calcium phosphate nanoparticles (CaP NPs) as stabilizers is developed and used to encapsulate L-arginine (L-Arg), which is known for its ability to modulate T-cell metabolism. The obtained L-Arg-loaded CaP-stabilized lipiodol Pickering emulsion (L-Arg@CaPL) with great emulsion stability can not only neutralize the tumor acidity via reaction of CaP NPs with protons but also enable the release of L-Arg, thereby synergistically promoting the reinvigoration of exhausted CD8 + T cells and effectively reversing tumor immunosuppression. As a result, TACE therapy with L-Arg@CaPL shows greatly improved therapeutic responses as demonstrated in an orthotopic liver tumor model in rats. This study highlights an effective yet simple nanoparticle-stabilized Pickering emulsion strategy to promote TACE therapy via modulation of the immunosuppressive TME, presenting great potential for clinical translation.},

This study demonstrates for the first time that VDBP is highly expressed in core emotion-related brain regions of mice susceptible to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). Specifically, the overexpression of microglia (MG)-derived VDBP in the prelimbic leads to depression-like behavior and aggravates CUMS-induced depressive phenotypes in mice, whereas conditional knockout of MG-derived VDBP can reverse both neuronal damage and depression-like behaviors. Mechanistically, the binding of MG-derived VDBP with the neuronal receptor megalin mediates the downstream SRC signaling pathway, leading to neuronal and synaptic damage and depression-like behaviors. These events may be caused by biased activation of inhibitory neurons and excitatory–inhibitory imbalance. Importantly, this study has effectively identified MG-derived VDBP as a pivotal mediator in the interplay between microglia and neurons via its interaction with the neuronal receptor megalin and intricate downstream impacts on neuronal functions, thus offering a promising therapeutic target for MDD.},

Here, a kind of soft fibers, which consist of hot melt adhesive particles, magnetizable microparticles, and ferroferric oxide microparticles embedded in a thermoplastic polyurethane matrix are proposed. The soft fibers can achieve wireless self-healing and reversible bonding of the fibers by eddy current heating and can be actuated by magnetic fields. Moreover, the soft fibers are recyclable and printable. Building on this material foundation, an integrated material-structure-actuation printing strategy using soft fibers for the design and fabrication of soft robots are reported. The robots printed by this strategy can achieve their untethered motions and wireless self-healing. Soft gripper, soft crawling robot, and soft multi-legged robot, are then fabricated which demonstrates the self-healing, self-reconfigurable, self-amputating, and sustainable performances of soft robots so as to adapt to different environments and tasks. This integrated material-structure-actuation printing strategy using soft fibers is universal, easy to implement, and mass-manufactured, opening a door for sustainable, eco-friendly, untethered, self-reconfigurable, self-amputating soft robots.},

While PTEN&#39;s role in neuronal growth is recognized, its long-term activation changes post-TBI and its effects on sensory-motor circuits are not well understood. Here, it is demonstrated that the neuronal knockout of PTEN (PTEN-nKO) significantly enhances both structural and functional recovery over the long term after TBI. Importantly, in vivo, DTI-MRI revealed that PTEN-nKO promotes white matter repair post-TBI. Additionally, calcium imaging and electromyographic recordings indicated that PTEN-nKO facilitates cortical remapping and restores sensory-motor pathways. Mechanistically, PTEN negatively regulates the Akt/mTOR pathway by inhibiting Akt, thereby suppressing mTOR. Raptor is a key component of mTORC1 and its suppression impedes axonal regeneration. The restoration of white matter integrity and the improvements in neural function observed in PTEN-nKO TBI-treated mice are reversed by a PTEN/Raptor double knockout (PTEN/Raptor D-nKO), suggesting that mTORC1 acts as a key mediator. These findings highlight persistent alterations in the PTEN/Akt/mTORC1 axis are critical for neural circuit remodeling and cortical remapping post-TBI, offering new insights into TBI pathophysiology and potential therapeutic targets.},

Engineered nor@MSC-EVs are fabricated by loading Arg1 inhibitor nor-NOHA into MSC-EVs for studying the therapeutic effect and mechanism of psoriasis. The nor@MSC-EVs exhibited profound suppression of the NF-κB signaling pathway by targeting Arg1/polyamine-mediated DCs/Th17 axis through scavenging self-antigens, resulting in superior mitigation of skin lesions and modulation of local and systemic metabolic and immunological disorders compared to the MSC-EVs and clinically used anti-IL17A both in vitro and in vivo.

Here, this study applies multi-omics analyses to characterize the biochemical, proteomic, and metabolomic profiles of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in clinical human cohorts to investigate disease development and recovery processes occurring due to PHH. Integrative multiomics analysis suggests that the over-representation of ferroptosis, calcium, calcium ion binding, and cell adhesion signaling pathways is associated with PHH. Bioinformatic analysis indicates that chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4) is discovered as a CSF biomarker and positively correlated with the ventricular size and the rate of periventricular leukomalacia. Next, it is further demonstrated that these signaling pathways are dysregulated in the choroid plexus (ChP) in PHH by using in vitro cellular experiments and rat models of PHH, whereas CSPG4 silencing can suppress ferroptosis, cell adhesion function, and the intracellular flow of Ca 2+ . These findings broaden the understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of PHH and suggest that CSPG4 may be an effective therapeutic target for PHH.},

Indeed, the infection and inflammatory response in the early stages as well as blood vessel formation and tissue regeneration in the later stages fundamentally impact the outcomes of urethral wound healing. Innovatively, an integrated whole-process repair hydrogel (APF/C/L@dECM) is designed. After rigorous testing, it is found that hydrogels formed by hydrophobic association and double cross-linking of amide bonds can procedurally regulate wound healing in all phases to match the repair process. In rabbit models of urethral wound, APF/C/L@dECM hydrogel can achieve scarless reconstruction with significantly better results than other hydrogels. Noteworthily, multi-stage mechanistic explorations reveal the expression profiles of inflammation, vascularization, and extracellular matrix secretion-related genes in wound tissue at different times.

  abstract     = {Elevated uptake of saturated fatty acid palmitic acid (PA) is associated with tumor metastasis; however, the precise mechanisms remain partially understood, hindering the development of therapy for PA-driven tumor metastasis. The Hippo–Yes-associated protein (Hippo/YAP) pathway is implicated in cancer progression. Here it is shown that a high-palm oil diet potentiates tumor metastasis in murine xenografts in part through YAP. It is found that the palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC15 is a YAP-regulated gene that forms a feedback loop with YAP. Notably, PA drives the ZDHHC15-YAP feedback loop, thus enforces YAP signaling, and hence promotes tumor metastasis in murine xenografts. In addition, it is shown that ZDHHC15 associates with Kidney and brain protein (KIBRA, also known as WW- and C2 domain-containing protein 1, WWC1), an upstream component of Hippo signaling, and mediates its palmitoylation. KIBRA palmitoylation leads to its degradation and regulates its subcellular localization and activity toward the Hippo/YAP pathway. Moreover, PA enhances KIBRA palmitoylation and degradation. It is further shown that combinatorial targeting of YAP and fatty acid synthesis exhibits augmented effects against metastasis formation in mice fed with a Palm diet. Collectively, these findings uncover a ZDHHC15-YAP feedback loop as a previously unrecognized mechanism underlying PA-promoted tumor metastasis and support targeting YAP and fatty acid synthesis as potential therapeutic targets in PA-driven tumor metastasis.},

However, improving the self-healing efficiency remains a significant work that severely limits their further development. Here, a strategy to fabricate anti-corrosion coatings with efficient self-healing properties based on microfluidic electrospinning technologies and UV-curable healing agents is reported. The damaged composite coating contains core–shell nanofibers that can be completely healed within only 30 min, indicating an outstanding healing efficiency. The corrosion current density ( I corr ) of the composite coatings containing core–shell nanofibers (abbreviated as composite coatings) is lower than the coatings without any fibers (abbreviated as pure resin coatings) during the test of repeated damage and healing cycles, showing superior resistance to corrosion and repeated self-healing property. The composite coating has even better mechanical properties such as tensile strength, bending strength, and impact strength than the pure resin coating, which are explained by simulating the deformation process. These excellent properties greatly improve the practicability of self-healing coatings in the application of anti-corrosion, especially in some special fields.},

To efficiently produce spike signals upon exposure to external stimuli, compact neuron devices are required for signal detection and their encoding into spikes in a single device. Herein, it is demonstrated that Mott oscillative spike neurons can integrate sensing and ceaseless spike generation in a compact form, which emulates the process of evoking photothermal sensing in the features of biological photothermal nociceptors. Interestingly, frequency-tunable and repetitive spikes are generated above the threshold value ( P th = 84 mW cm −2 ) as a characteristic of “threshold” in leaky-integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons; the neuron devices successfully mimic a crucial feature of biological thermal nociceptors, including modulation of frequency coding and startup latency depending on the intensity of photothermal stimuli. Furthermore, Mott spike neurons are self-adapted after sensitization upon exposure to high-intensity electromagnetic radiation, which can replicate allodynia and hyperalgesia in a biological sensory system. Thus, this study presents a unique approach to capturing and encoding environmental source data into spikes, enabling efficient sensing of environmental sources for the application of adaptive sensory systems.},

  abstract     = {Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) travel through the vasculature to seed secondary sites and serve as direct precursors of metastatic outgrowth for many solid tumors. Heterotypic cell clusters form between CTCs and white blood cells (WBCs) and recent studies report that a majority of these WBCs are neutrophils in patient and mouse models. The lab discovered that CTCs produce tubulin-based protrusions, microtentacles (McTNs), which promote reattachment, retention in distant sites during metastasis and formation of tumor cell clusters. Neutrophil-CTC clusters help CTCs survive the harsh vascular environment to promote successful metastasis, however, the specific mechanism of this interaction is not fully understood. Utilizing TetherChip technology, it is found that primary and differentiated neutrophils produce McTNs composed of detyrosinated and acetylated α-tubulin and vimentin. Neutrophil McTNs aid in cluster formation, migration, and reattachment, which are suppressed with the tubulin-depolymerizing agent, Vinorelbine. Co-culturing differentiated neutrophils and tumor cells formed heterotypic clusters that enhanced migration. CTC-neutrophil clusters have higher metastatic efficiency, and by demonstrating that neutrophils form McTNs, a new possible mechanism for how neutrophils interact with tumor cells is revealed. These findings further support the idea that developing cluster-disrupting therapies can provide a new targeted strategy to reduce the metastatic potential of cancer cells.},

  abstract     = {Atherosclerosis and its associated cardio-cerebrovascular complications remain the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Current lipid-lowering therapies reduce only approximately one-third of the cardiovascular risk. Furthermore, vascular restenosis and thrombotic events following surgical interventions for severe vascular stenosis significantly contribute to treatment failure. This highlights the urgent need for novel therapeutic targets to manage atherosclerosis and prevent restenosis and thrombosis after vascular injury. This study identifies TTK protein kinase (TTK) as a key regulator of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) phenotypic switching in the context of postinjury neointimal formation and atherosclerosis. Mechanistically, TTK upregulation in VSMCs phosphorylates p120-catenin, leading to β-catenin nuclear accumulation and dissociation of the myocardin (MYOCD)/serum response factor (SRF) complex. Deletion of TTK specifically in VSMCs reduces postinjury neointimal formation in vascular injury models and attenuates atherosclerotic lesions in ApoE −/− mice. Notably, oral administration of the TTK inhibitor CFI-402257 mitigated neointimal formation without impairing reendothelialization and reduced atherosclerotic lesions in ApoE −/− mice without altering lipid levels. These findings suggest that targeting TTK, through inhibitors or alternative strategies, represents a promising approach to simultaneously prevent postinjury restenosis and treat atherosclerosis.},

  abstract     = {Disturbances in the brain fluid balance can lead to life-threatening elevation in intracranial pressure (ICP), which represents a vast clinical challenge. Targeted and efficient pharmaceutical therapy of elevated ICP is not currently available, as the molecular mechanisms governing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) secretion are largely unresolved. To resolve the quantitative contribution of key choroid plexus transport proteins, this study employs mice with genetic knockout and/or viral choroid plexus-specific knockdown of aquaporin 1 (AQP1) and the Na + , K + , 2Cl − cotransporter 1 (NKCC1) for in vivo determinations of CSF dynamics, ex vivo choroid plexus for transporter-mediated clearance of a CSF K + load, and patient CSF for [K + ] quantification. CSF secretion and ICP management occur independently of choroid plexus AQP1 expression, whereas both parameters are reduced by 40% upon choroid plexus NKCC1 knockdown. Elevation of [K + ] CSF increases the choroid plexus Na + /K + -ATPase activity, and favors inwardly-directed net NKCC1 transport, which, together, promote CSF K + clearance, while maintaining undisturbed CSF secretion rates. CSF from patients with post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus does not display elevated [K + ] CSF , suggesting that NKCC1 maintains net outward transport direction during post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus formation. Direct or indirect therapeutic modulation of choroid plexus NKCC1 can thus be a potential promising pharmacological approach against brain pathologies associated with elevated ICP.},

  abstract     = {Although left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are an alternative to heart transplantation, their artificial surfaces often lead to serious thrombotic complications requiring high-risk device replacement. Coating blood-contacting surfaces with antithrombogenic endothelial cells is considered an effective strategy for preventing thrombus formation. However, this concept has not yet been successfully implemented in LVADs, as severe cell loss is to be expected, especially on the impeller surface with high prothrombogenic supraphysiological shear stress. This study presents a strategy that exploits the magnetic attraction of the impeller on ECs loaded with iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) to minimize shear stress-induced cell detachment from the rotating magnetic impeller while ensuring antithrombogenic EC adhesion, especially as a bridge until they formed their adhesion-promoting matrix. In contrast to polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-coated IONPs, more efficient and safer cell loading is achieved with sodium citrate (Cit)-stabilized IONPs, where incubation with 6.6 µg iron mL-1 Cit-IONPs for 24 h resulting in an average internalization of 23 pg iron per cell. Internalization of Cit-IONP significantly improved cell attraction to the highly magnetic impeller surface without affecting cell viability or antithrombogenic function. This protocol is key for the development of a biohybrid LVAD impeller that can prevent life-threatening thrombosis and hemorrhage in a future clinical application.},

The expansion of stem cell differentiation potential has been a hot topic in developmental biology for years, particularly with respect to the generation totipotent-like stem cells. Here, the study describes the establishment of totipotency in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) via the deletion of a single gene, Pdzk1 . Pdzk1 -knockout (KO) ESCs substantially contribute to the fetus, placenta, and yolk sac in chimera assays but can also self-organize to form standard blastocyst-like structures containing the three lineages efficiently; thus, they exhibit full developmental potential as early blastomeres. Single-cell transcriptome and bulk RNA-seq comprehensive analyses revealed that Pdzk1 -KO activates several lineage inducers ( C1qa , C1qb , Fgf5 , and Cdx2 ) to break down barriers between embryonic and extraembryonic tissues, making these lineages switch smoothly and resulting in a totipotent-like state. This versatile and scalable system provides a robust experimental model for differentiation potency and cell fate studies.},

  abstract     = {The evaporation of drops on solid surfaces is a ubiquitous natural phenomenon, and their dynamics play a pivotal role in many biological, environmental, and industrial processes. However, the complexity of the underlying mechanisms has largely confined previous studies to liquid drop evaporation under atmospheric conditions. In this study, the first comprehensive investigation of the evaporation dynamics of conducting polymer-containing drops under controlled vacuum environments is presented. Utilizing high-speed imaging of a drop within a vacuum chamber, it is observed that the evaporation of a sessile drop under vacuum conditions unfolds through four distinct stages: Constant Contact Radius (CCR), Constant Contact Angle (CCA), Increasing Contact Angle (ICA), and Stick and Slip (S&amp;S) modes. The detailed analysis of the force balance reveals that the depinning dynamics of the contact line, significantly driven by vacuum-induced forces, are the primary factor distinguishing these evaporation modes. A modified diffusion-limited model specifically tailored for vacuum conditions is further developed, which closely aligns with the experimental data on volume reduction over time. Importantly, the study demonstrates that by carefully adjusting the vacuum level, it is possible to precisely manipulate the final film morphology, with uniform deposition achieved at an optimal pressure of 20 kPa. This research introduces a novel approach for controlling drop evaporation dynamics in vacuum, with potential applications in advanced manufacturing processes.},

The framework utilizes a denoising super-resolution model (Denoising Inference Variational Autoencoder Super-Resolution (DIVAESR)) to effectively mitigate shot noise and thereby obtain substantially clearer atomic-resolved iDPC-STEM images.

  abstract     = {Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are evolving toward higher electrode count and fully implantable solutions, which require extremely low power densities (&lt;15mW cm −2 ). To achieve this target, and allow for a large and scalable number of channels, flexible electronics can be used as a multiplexing interface. This work introduces an active analog front-end fabricated with amorphous Indium-Gallium-Zinx-Oxide (a-IGZO) Thin-Film Transistors (TFTs) on foil capable of active matrix multiplexing. The circuit achieves only 70nV per sqrt(Hz) input referred noise, consuming 46µW, or 3.5mW cm −2 . It demonstrates for the first time in literature a flexible front-end with a noise efficiency factor comparable with Silicon solutions (NEF = 9.8), which is more than 10X lower compared to previously reported flexible front-ends. These results have been achieved using a modified bootstrap-load amplifier. The front end is tested by playing through it recordings obtained from a conventional BCI system. A gesture classification based on the flexible front-end outputs achieves 94% accuracy. Using a flexible active front end can improve the state-of-the-art in high channel count BCI systems by lowering the multiplexer noise and enabling larger areas of the brain to be monitored while reducing power density. Therefore, this work enables a new generation of high channel-count active BCI electrode grids.},

  abstract     = {Thermal conductivity enhancement in polymers is vital for advanced applications. This study introduces a novel method to align hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) nanosheets within polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrices using a Halbach array to create a highly uniform magnetic field. This technique achieves significant improvements in thermal conductivity by effectively aligning hBN nanosheets. This research shows that hBN nanosheets, when aligned, can drastically enhance thermal conductivity in PDMS composites. Specifically, 10 wt.% vertically aligned hBN nanosheets in a rotating magnetic field achieve a thermal conductivity of 3.58 W mK −1 , an impressive 1950% increase over pure PDMS. Additionally, the study explores the effects of orientation on dielectric properties, finding that the orientation of hBN nanosheets also improves electrical insulation and increases the dielectric constant while maintaining extremely low dielectric losses. For a vertically oriented sample, the dielectric constant reaches ≈14, and dielectric losses are as low as 0.0049 at 100 Hz, highlighting their potential for energy storage capacitors. This approach not only enhances thermal management but also maintains or improves electrical insulation, offering promising advances for polymer composites in various technological applications.},

  abstract     = {Corneal blindness is a significant reason for visual impairment globally. Researchers have been investigating several methods for corneal regeneration in order to cure these patients. Biomaterials are favored due to their biocompatibility and capacity to promote cell adhesion. A variety of natural and synthetic biomaterials, along with decellularized cornea, have been employed in corneal wound healing. Commonly utilized natural biomaterials encompass proteins such as collagen, gelatin, and silk fibroin (SF), as well as polysaccharides including alginate, chitosan (CS), hyaluronic acid (HA), and cellulose. Synthetic biomaterials primarily consist of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL), and poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). Bio-based materials and their composites are primarily utilized as hydrogels, films, scaffolds, patches, nanocapsules, and other formats for the treatment of blinding ocular conditions, including corneal wounds, corneal ulcers, corneal endothelium, and stromal defects. This review attempts to summarize in vitro, preclinical, and clinical trial studies relevant to corneal regeneration using biomaterials within the last five years, and expect that these experiences and outcomes will inspire and provide practical strategies for the future development of biomaterials for corneal regeneration. Furthermore, potential improvements and difficulties for these biomaterials are discussed.},

Current cleansing options are insufficient to disrupt and remove tenacious biofilms; antibiotic treatments, on the other hand, often fall short against these biofilm-embedded bacteria. This study explores an non-antibiotic approach that extends beyond conventional porphyrin-based phototherapy by using blue light (BL) in conjunction with ferric ions (Fe(III)) to disrupt and eradicate biofilms. The dual not only degraded biofilm extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in mono-species and polymicrobial biofilms by specifically targeting carboxyl-containing polysaccharides within the matrix but also exhibited broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity by affecting key components of the outer membrane and cell wall. Bacteria, such as K. pneumoniae , with compromised EPS after photolysis, demonstrated increased susceptibility to macrophage phagocytosis. Disruption of the polymicrobial biofilm structure also enhanced the bacterial susceptibility to bactericidal drugs. Treating wounds infected by mixed-species biofilm in diabetic mice demonstrated a substantial reduction in bacterial colonization and improved tissue repair. The BL-Fe(III) modality offers a safe, efficient alternative for managing chronic wound infections, making it ideal for repeated, non-invasive use at home, especially in resource-limited areas.},

Overcoming this challenge, the realization of high-stability, room-temperature polarization-sensitive THz photodetectors (PDs) leveraging the thermoelectric effect of Cs 0.05 (FA 0.85 MA 0.15 ) 0.95 Pb(I 0.85 Br 0.15 ) 3 (CsFAMA)/metasurfaces is presented.

Owning to THz surface plasmon polariton (SPP) resonance effect and more boundary effect, the I-shaped PDs exhibit superior performance, achieving a response of up to 94 V/W, with a response time of 138 µs, a low noise-equivalent power of 5.03 pW/Hz 1/2 and an anisotropy ratio of 1.38 under 0.1THz laser irradiation. Furthermore, the PD&#39;s stability is verified with the anisotropy ratio decreased by only 2% and polarization imaging results after 240 days of storage in air condition.

  abstract     = {The vascular response following injury is pivotal for successful bone-defect repair but constitutes a major hurdle in the field of regenerative medicine. Throughout this process, vessel stabilization is crucial to provide an adequate nutrient supply and facilitate efficient waste removal. Therefore, this study investigated whether promoting vascular stabilization improves bone defect repair outcomes. The findings show that insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP) 7 exhibits a novel biological function in attenuating vascular permeability and enhancing vascular wall integrity. The potential underlying mechanism involves the up-regulation of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) expression by IGFBP7 on endothelial cell membrane, followed by activation of the downstream PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and upregulated expression of the tight junction protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). IGFBP7 delayed administration in mice with cranial defects significantly improved bone defect healing by increasing ZO-1 and CD31 co-localization within vessel walls and optimizing the perfusion function of the final vascular network. Furthermore, the application of the typical tight junction regulator AT1001 effectively promoted ZO-1-dependent vascular stabilization and facilitated bone defect repair. This study presents a new approach to enhance bone defect healing via vascular stabilization-targeted interventions and significantly advances the understanding of the complex interplay between osteogenesis and angiogenesis in bone defect healing.},

Ubiquitination enzyme screening identifies augmented amounts of ubiquitin-specific protease 19 (USP19) in IFLT versus CLT grafts. The upregulation of USP19 in the grafts is correlated with reduced pathological Suzuki&#39;s score, lower post-transplant peak liver enzyme level, and less early allograft dysfunction in liver transplant recipients. USP19 overexpression mitigates post-transplant liver injury in mice. Mechanistically, USP19 inhibits the degradation of solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) by removing its K63-linked ubiquitin chains. Notably, USP19 overexpression reduces ferroptosis and IRI in a SLC7A11-dependent manner in mice. Collectively, USP19-mediated suppression of hepatocyte ferroptosis via deubiquitinating SLC7A11 is a key mechanism by which IFLT abrogates graft IRI.},

  abstract     = {Sperm swimming is essential for reproduction, with movement strategies adapted to specific environments. Sperm navigate by modulating the symmetry of their flagellar beating, but how they swim forward with asymmetrical beats remains unclear. Current methods lack the ability to robustly detect the flagellar symmetry state in free-swimming spermatozoa, despite its importance in understanding sperm motility. This study uses numerical simulations to investigate the fluid mechanics of sperm swimming with asymmetrical flagellar beats. Results show that sperm rotation regularizes the swimming motion, allowing persistently progressive swimming even with asymmetrical flagellar beats. Crucially, 3D sperm head orientation, rather than the swimming path, provides critical insight into the flagellar symmetry state. Sperm rotations during swimming closely resemble spinning-top dynamics, with sperm head precession driven by the helical beating of the flagellum. These results may prove essential in future studies on the role of symmetry in microorganisms and artificial swimmers, as body orientation detection has been largely overlooked in favor of swimming path analysis. Altogether, this rotational mechanism provides a reliable solution for forward propulsion and navigation in nature, which would otherwise be challenging for flagella with broken symmetry.},

Here, inspired by vascularity supporting cellular architectures in the tissues and organs, a novel vascularized hiPSC-heps spheroid based on microfluidic microcapsules is presented for liver repair via orthotopic transplantation. The microcapsules are comprised of aqueous cores that facilitate hiPSC-hep aggregating into spheroids, and hybrid hydrogel shells of sodium alginate and hyaluronic acid methacryloyl (HAMA). By selectively degrading the alginate, the microcapsules are imparted with porous HAMA shells, which not only allowed human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to attach and form vascularized networks, but also facilitated communication between HUVECs and hiPSC-heps. The specific spatial distributions of these cells in the vascularized hiPSC-hep spheroids can provide nutrition support, promote the hepatic functions, and avoid immune cell attacks. Based on these features, it is illustrated that the vascularized hiPSC-hep spheroids can repair the acute failing liver more effectively, indicating their practical values in clinical liver repair.},

  abstract     = {Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) diagnosis is challenging because noninfectious diseases mimic its clinical features. The altered host response and respiratory microbiome following LRTIs have the potential to differentiate LRTIs from noninfectious respiratory diseases (non-LRTIs). Patients suspected of having LRTIs are retrospectively enrolled and a clinical metatranscriptome test is performed on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Transcriptomic and metagenomic analysis profiled the host response and respiratory microbiome in patients with confirmed LRTI ( n = 126) or non-LRTIs ( n = 75). Patients with evidenced LRTIs exhibited enhanced pathways on chemokine and cytokine response, neutrophile recruitment and activation, along with specific gene modules linked to LRTIs status and key blood markers. Moreover, LRTIs patients exhibited reduced diversity and evenness in the lower respiratory microbiome, likely driven by an increased abundance of bacterial pathogens. Host marker genes are selected, and classifiers are developed to distinguish patients with LRTIs, non-LRTIs, and indeterminate status, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80 to 0.86 and validated in a subsequently enrolled cohort. Incorporating respiratory microbiome features further enhanced the classifier&#39;s performance. In summary, a single metatranscriptome test of BALF proved detailed profiles of host response and respiratory microbiome, enabling accurate LRTIs diagnosis.},

Mechanistically, loss of COX4I1 induced mitochondrial stress and ferroptosis, disrupting mitochondrial ultrastructure and oxidative phosphorylation. CRISPR gene tiling scans, coupled with mitochondrial proteomics, dissected critical regions within COX4I1 essential for leukemia cell survival, providing detailed insights into the mitochondrial Complex IV assembly network. Furthermore, COX4I1 depletion or pharmacological inhibition of Complex IV (using chlorpromazine) synergized with venetoclax, providing a promising avenue for improved leukemia therapy.

  abstract     = {The development of primary liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC] and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma [ICC]) is linked to its physical microenvironment, particularly extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness. Potential anticancer strategies targeting ECM stiffness include prevention/reversal of the stiffening process and disruption of the response of cancer cells to mechanical signals from ECM. However, each strategy has limitations. Therefore, the authors propose integrating them to maximize their strengths. Compared with HCC, ICC has a stiffer ECM and a worse prognosis. Therefore, ICC is selected to investigate mechanisms underlying the influence of ECM stiffness on cancer progression and application of the integrated anticancer strategy targeting ECM stiffness. In summary, immunofluorescence results for 181 primary liver cancer tissue chips (ICC, n = 91; HCC, n = 90) and analysis of TCGA mRNA-sequencing demonstrate that ECM stiffness can affect phenotypes of primary liver cancers. The YAP1/ABHD11-AS1/STAU2/ZYX/p-YAP1 pathway is a useful entry point for exploration of specific mechanisms of mechanical signal conduction from the ECM in ICC cells and their impact on cancer progression. Moreover, a synergistic anticancer strategy targeting ECM stiffness (ICCM@NPs + siABHD11-AS1@BAPN) is constructed by integrating ECM softening and blocking intracellular mechanical signal transduction in ICC and can provide insights for the treatment of cancers characterized by stiff ECM.},

  abstract     = {Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune disease characterized by extensive skin and internal organ fibrosis. However, the mechanism underlying fibrosis remains unclear, and effective treatments for halting or reversing fibrosis are lacking. In this study, single-cell RNA sequencing is used to obtain a comprehensive overview of skin cells from patients with SSc and healthy controls. A subset of basal cells with high chitinase 3-like 1 (Chi3L1) expression, which potentially plays an important role in fibroblast activation, is identified in SSc. Subsequently, patients with SSc are present with increased expression of Chi3L1 in the skin and serum, and elevated serum levels are associated with skin induration and pulmonary function. Furthermore, Chi3L1 promoted the differentiation of SSc dermal fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, and Chi3L1-deficient (Chi3L1-/-) mice showed amelioration of fibrosis in a bleomycin-induced SSc (BLM-SSc) model. Mechanistically, Chi3L1 mediates fibroblast activation primarily by interacting with interleukin-17 receptor A (IL-17RA), thereby initiating downstream nuclear factor kappa B and mitogen-activated protein kinases signaling pathways. Moreover, the anti-fibrotic effect of IL-17RA antagonists in BLM-SSc mice is demonstrated. In conclusion, Chi3L1 is a potential biomarker for the degree of fibrosis in SSc. Chi3L1 and its receptor, IL-17RA, are promising therapeutic targets for patients with SSc.},

However, the intrinsically inferior thermodynamic stability and laborious crystallization kinetics control under humidity interference limit the fabrication of blue perovskite emitters in ambient air. Here, air-processed pure-bromide quasi-2D blue perovskite films are achieved with stabilized lattice and tunable emission by interstitial doping of trivalent metallic cations. This strategy improves the formation energy of the perovskite lattice, promotes energy transfer between different n phases, and suppresses intrinsic electron-phonon coupling in the perovskite films. The emission-controllable blue PeLEDs are fabricated in ambient air for the first time. The champion deep blue PeLED shows maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 2.05% and luminance of 246.56 cd m −2 , which are comparable to the state-of-the-art of similar devices fabricated in glovebox. The work pioneers a simple method of electronic structure engineering to tune the emission of air-processed blue perovskite, breaking the limitations of thermodynamic stability and crystallization kinetics control of perovskite in ambient air.},

Metal–organic framework (MOF) membranes have been attracting intensive attention for gas sieving, but it is difficult to manufacture MOF membranes in scalability and precisely tune their transport property. In this study, Gel-thermal processing of linker-mixed MOF crystal-glass composite membranes is reported directly, with the mechanism of adjusting metal-linker bond strengths and angles to disrupt long-range periodicity of MOFs and promote glass phase formation, for sharply sorption-preferential gas separation. This strategy can be realized by using a simple, solvent/precursor-less, and cost-effective gel-thermal approach with two steps of gel coating and thermal conversion, thereby constructing crystal-glass composite membranes in a controllable, processable, versatile, and environmentally friendly route. Moreover, the mixed linkers enable preferential gas affinities and the ultramicroporous glasses can eliminate any membrane defects. The membranes exhibit outstanding gas separation performance for the challenging systems of CH 4 /N 2 and O 2 /N 2 , with mixture selectivities up to 9.3 and 9.6, respectively, far exceeding those of polymer, MOF, and mixed-matrix membranes. The study provides an available route for architecting high-performance membranes for gas separations.},

  abstract     = {Inhibitors targeting cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) to block cell cycle progression have been effective in treating hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, but triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains largely resistant, limiting their clinical applicability. The study reveals that transcription regulator cyclin-dependent kinase7 (CDK7) is a promising target to circumvent TNBC&#39;s inherent resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors. Combining CDK4/6 and CDK7 inhibitors significantly enhances therapeutic effectiveness, leading to a marked decrease in cholesterol biosynthesis within cells. This effect is achieved through reduced activity of the transcription factor forkhead box M1 (FOXM1), which normally increases cholesterol production by inducing SREBF1 expression. Furthermore, this dual inhibition strategy attenuates the recruitment of sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (SREBP1) and p300 to genes essential for cholesterol synthesis, thus hindering tumor growth. This research is corroborated by an in-house cohort showing lower survival rates in TNBC patients with higher cholesterol production gene activity. This suggests a new treatment approach for TNBC by simultaneously targeting CDK4/6 and CDK7, warranting additional clinical trials.},

However, whether targeting PBRM1 has the potential to enhance immunotherapy efficacy in patients with wild-type PBRM1 and the upstream pathways that regulate PBRM1 protein stability remain unclear. Here, it is demonstrated that PBRM1 knockdown induced M1 macrophage polarization and infiltration, which enhanced the efficacy of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in RCC. Meanwhile, CDC20 catalyzes K27 ubiquitination of PBRM1 and promotes its degradation via p62-mediated selective autophagy. A bicyclic peptide (PB1-p62) is designed and constructed to target PBRM1 and p62, thereby promoting the degradation of PBRM1. As a result, the efficacy of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy is enhanced, leading to improved overall survival rates in syngeneic mouse tumor models. Overall, this finding suggest the clinical application of PB1-p62 and provide a novel approach for enhancing the effectiveness of immunotherapy in RCC patients with wild-type PBRM1.},

  abstract     = {High serum level of palmitic acid(PA) is implicated in pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. PA serves as the substrate for protein palmitoylation. However, it is still unknown whether palmitoylation is involved in PA-induced cardiovascular dysfunction. Here, in clinical cohort studies of 1040 patients with coronary heart disease, high level of PA is associated with risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and death. In ApoE −/− mice, 10 mg/kg −1 PA treatment induces blood pressure elevation, cardiac contractile dysfunction, endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerotic plaqueformation. In endothelial cells, inhibition of palmitoylation bypalmitoyl-transferase inhibitor 2-BP eliminates PA-induced endothelial injury, whereas promotion of palmitoylation by depalmitoylase inhibitor ML349 exacerbates the harmful effect of PA. Palmitoyl-proteomics analysis identifies pyruvate kinase isozyme type M2 (PKM2) as the palmitoylated protein responsible for PA-induced endothelial injury, and Cys31 as the predominant palmitoylated site. PKM2-C31S mutants (cysteine replaced by serine) prevents PA-induced endothelial injury. Endothelial-specific AAV-C31S PKM2 endo ameliorates cardiovascular dysfunction caused by PA in ApoE −/− mice. Mechanistically, PKM2-C31 palmitoylation impairs PKM2 tetramerization to inhibit its pyruvate kinase activity and endothelial glycolysis. Finally, zDHHC13 is identified as the palmitoyl acyltransferase of PKM2. In conclusion, these findings suggest that PKM2-C31 palmitoylation contributes to PA-induced endothelial injury and cardiovascular dysfunction.},

Herein, NiFe-based metal-organic framework (MOF) is used as a precursor to prepare W-doped nickel-iron phosphide (W-NiFeP) nanosheet arrays by ion exchange and phosphorylation, which exhibit a high electrocatalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), featuring an overpotential of only −179 mV to achieve the current density of 100 mA cm −2 in alkaline media. Notably, electrochemical activation of W-NiFeP facilitates the in situ formation of phosphate groups producing W,P-NiFeOOH, which, in conjunction with the W co-doped amorphous layers, leads to a high electrocatalytic performance toward GCR, due to enhanced proton transfer and adsorption of reaction intermediates, as confirmed in experimental and theoretical studies. Thus, the two-electrode electrolyzer of the W-NiFeP/NF||W,P-NiFeOOH/NF for HER||GCR needs only a low cell voltage of 1.56 V to deliver 100 mA cm −2 at a remarkable hydrogen production efficiency of 1.86 mmol h −1 , with a high glucose conversion (98.0%) and formic acid yields (85.2%).

Herein, a multistage regulation (MSR) strategy for addressing these challenges is proposed via the introduction of fluorine-rich small molecules with multiple active points (i.e., 1-[Bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)methyl]- 2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzene (TFSP)) into the precursor solution of the perovskite film. The addition of TFSP effectively delays and regulates the crystallization and growth process of the perovskite film for larger grains and fewer defects, and it effectively improves the coverage of self-assembled molecules for efficient charge transport. The multiple active points of TFSP induce a strong binding affinity with uncoordinated defects in the perovskite film. Moreover, the high fluorine content of TFSP induces strong electronegativity to establish a high binding strength between the perovskite film and electron transport layer. Finally, PSCs prepared by the MSR strategy demonstrated an optimal power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.46% and maintained 91.16% of the initial PCE under nonpackaged air conditions and at a relative humidity of 45% after 3000 h.},

In particular, high relative humidity (RH) commonly causes severe MHP degradation, which poses a major obstacle to long-term device operation. Herein, high RH-induced growth of anisotropic MHP structures on glass surfaces is reported under 25 °C and atmospheric conditions on a basis of glass corrosion by moisture. Nanowires (NWs) with tunable length and composition are obtained under 85% RH air, and water molecule-induced facet engineering of perovskite is established for anisotropic growth. Importantly, single-mode photonic lasing in these MHP NWs with thickness at sub-100-nm scale (down to 75 nm ∼ 1/7 lasing wavelength) is achieved via both one-photon and multiphoton pumping. These nanowire lasers exhibited high quality factor (&gt;3000), high degree of polarization (≈0.9), and excellent stability under laser irradiation.

However, tumor radioresistance limits its efficacy. Hydrogen gas has anticancer properties and can enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy. However, its role in radiotherapy sensitization has rarely been reported. Many current hydrogen delivery methods involve hydrogen-generating nanomaterials, such as magnesium-based nanomaterials. This study introduces an AZ31 magnesium alloy 125 I seed strand (termed AMASS) with pH-dependent slow-release hydrogen characteristics and excellent mechanical properties. AMASS can be implanted into tumors via minimally invasive surgery, releasing hydrogen around the 125 I seeds. In vitro experiments showed that hydrogen from AMASS degradation significantly inhibited tumor proliferation, increased apoptosis, disrupted redox homeostasis and mitochondrial membrane potential, reduced adenosine triphosphate levels, and induced DNA damage due to 125 I radiation. In mouse xenograft and rabbit liver tumor models, hydrogen from AMASS showed superior therapeutic effects compared with 125 I seeds alone, with no noticeable side effects. In addition, AMASS has a uniform radiation dose distribution and simple implantation. Therefore, hydrogen from AMASS enhanced 125 I seed efficacy, supporting the further promotion and application of 125 I seed implantation in cancer therapy.},

  abstract     = {Unlike animals, plants are unable to move and lack specialized immune cells and circulating antibodies. As a result, they are always threatened by a large number of microbial pathogens and harmful pests that can significantly reduce crop yield worldwide. Therefore, the development of new strategies to control them is essential to mitigate the increasing risk of crops lost to plant diseases. Recent developments in genetic engineering, including efficient gene manipulation and transformation methods, gene editing and synthetic biology, coupled with the understanding of microbial pathogenicity and plant immunity, both at molecular and genomic levels, have enhanced the capabilities to develop disease resistance in plants. This review comprehensively explains the fundamental mechanisms underlying the tug-of-war between pathogens and hosts, and provides a detailed overview of different strategies for developing disease resistance in plants. Additionally, it provides a summary of the potential genes that can be employed in resistance breeding for key crops to combat a wide range of potential pathogens and pests, including fungi, oomycetes, bacteria, viruses, nematodes, and insects. Furthermore, this review addresses the limitations associated with these strategies and their possible solutions. Finally, it discusses the future perspectives for producing plants with durable and broad-spectrum disease resistance.},

  abstract     = {Mammalian pre-implantation development is a complex process involving sophisticated regulatory dynamics. WD repeat domain 36 (WDR36) is known to play a critical role in mouse early embryonic development, but its regulatory function in human embryogenesis is still elusive due to limited access to human embryos. The human pluripotent stem cell-derived blastocyst-like structure, termed a blastoid, offers an alternative means to study human development in a dish. In this study, after verifying that WDR36 inhibition disrupted polarization in mouse early embryos, it is further demonstrated that WDR36 interference can block human blastoid formation, dominantly hindering the trophectoderm lineage commitment. Both transcriptomics and targeted metabolomics analyses revealed that WDR36 interference downregulated glucose metabolism. WDR36 can interact with glycolytic metabolic protein lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), thereby positively regulating glycolysis during the late stage of human blastoid formation. Taken together, the study has established a mechanistic connection between WDR36, glucose metabolism, and cell fate determination during early embryonic lineage commitment, which may provide potential insights into novel therapeutic targets for early adverse pregnancy interventions.},

However, the mechanism of CD47 ubiquitination on tumor immune escape remains unclear. Here it is found that TRAF2 bound to the C-terminal of CD47 cytoplasmic fragment and induced its ubiquitination, leading to inhibition of CD47 autophagic degradation by disrupting its binding to LC3, which in turn inhibited macrophage phagocytosis and promoted tumor immune escape. In contrast, loss of TRAF2 facilitated CD47 autophagic degradation and inhibited tumor immune escape. Moreover, autophagy induction promoted CD47 degradation and enhanced the efficacy of CD47 antibody anti-tumor immunotherapy. These findings revealed a novel mechanism of ubiquitination of CD47 on tumor immune escape.},

  abstract     = {The proline amino acid and prolyl residues of peptides/proteins confer unique biological and biochemical properties that motivates the development of proline-selective analysis. The study focuses on one specific class of problem, the detection of single amino acid variants involving proline, and reports a Pro-selective electrochemiluminescence (ECL) method. To develop this method, the A1-/A2- variants of milk&#39;s β-casein protein are investigated because it is a well-established example and abundant samples are readily available. Specifically, β-casein has 209 amino acids with 34 (or 35) proline residues: the A1-variant has a Pro-to-His substitution at position 67 (relative to the A2 variant). The study shows that proline&#39;s strong luminescence allows the generic discrimination of: Pro from other amino acids; an A2-oligopeptide from an A1-oligopeptide; the A2-β-casein variant from the A1-variant; and commercially-available A2 milks from A1-containing regular milks. The evidence indicates that luminescence depends on proline content and accessibility, as well as signal quenching. Compared to conventional immunoassays, the ECL method is simple, rapid, and inexpensive. Further, the ECL-method is Pro-selective (vs molecularly-selective like typical immunoassays) which should make it broadly useful for studying the role of proline in biology and especially useful for tracking the digestion of proline-rich proteins in the diet.},

  abstract     = {The ability to “switch on” adhesion between a thin hydrogel and a biological tissue can be useful in biomedical applications such as surgery. One way to accomplish this is with an electric field, a phenomenon termed electroadhesion (EA). Here, it is shown that cationic gels can be adhered by EA to tissues across all of biology . This includes tissues from animals, including humans and other mammals; birds; fish; reptiles (e.g., lizards); amphibians (e.g., frogs), and invertebrates (e.g., shrimp, worms). Gels can also be adhered to soft tissues from plants, including fruit (e.g., plums) and vegetables (e.g; carrot). In all cases, EA is induced by a low electric field (DC, 10 V) applied for a short time (20 s). After the field is removed, the adhesion persists. The adhesion can also be reversed by applying the field with opposite polarity. In mammals, EA is strong for many tissues (e.g., arteries, muscles, and cornea), but not others (e.g., adipose, brain). Tissues with anisotropic structure show anisotropic adhesion strength by EA. The higher the concentration of anionic polymers in a tissue, the stronger its adhesion to cationic gels. This underscores that EA is mediated by the electrophoresis of chain segments across the gel-tissue interface.},

Herein, the electron transfer mechanism between fluorophores and peroxalate-H 2 O 2 reaction is investigated and the singlet/triplet electron exchange is utilized to achieve long-persistent chemiluminescence imaging and synergistic type-I/II/III photodynamic therapy. As a proof-of-concept, the photosensitizers of carbon nanodots (CDs)-loaded chlorin e6 (CDs-Ce6) are designed and integrated with the peroxalate molecules, and the as-prepare polymer carbon nanodots ( p -CDs) exhibit novel tumor microenvironment (TME)-responsive long-persistent near-infrared CL and photochemical reactions, evoking the in vivo imaging and synergistic dynamic therapy in tumor tissue. Mechanistically, the excess reactive oxygen species in TME can trigger the chemically initiated singlet/triplet electron exchange between the hydrophobic CDs-Ce6 and peroxalate-derived 1,2-dioxetanes and thus the excess excited singlet/triplet electron of the CDs-Ce6 can ensure the long-persistent near-infrared CL, type I/II photochemical production of hydroxyl radicals, superoxide radical and singlet oxygen, and type III photochemical damage of maladjusted biomacromolecules, enabling the long-persistent near-infrared biological imaging and enhanced cancer therapy.

  abstract     = {While animals across species typically experience suppressed consciousness and an increased arousal threshold during sleep, the responsiveness to specific sensory inputs persists. Previous studies have demonstrated that rhythmic and continuous vibration can enhance sleep in both animals and humans. However, the neural circuits underlying vibration-induced sleep (VIS) and its potential therapeutic benefits on neuropathological processes in disease models remain unclear. Here, it is shown that intermittent vibration, such as cycles of 30 s on followed by 30 s off, is more effective in inducing sleep compared to continuous vibration. A clear evidence is further provided that allatostatin A (AstA)-GABA signaling mediates short-term intermittent vibration-induced sleep (iVIS) by inhibiting octopaminergic arousal neurons through activating GABA A receptors. The existence of iVIS in mice is corroborated, implicating the GABAergic system in this process. Finally, intermittent vibration not only enhances sleep but also reduces amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition and reverses memory defects in Alzheimer&#39;s disease models. In conclusion, the study defines a central neural circuit involved in mediating short-term iVIS and the potential implications of vibration in treating sleep-related brain disorders.},

A novel polyimide (PI) aerogel-based sandwich-structural composite is developed to meet such a requirement in this study. This composite is based on a unidirectional fluorinated PI (FPI) aerogel as a lower layer, a nondirectional conventional PI aerogel as a middle layer, and a nondirectional FPI aerogel/paraffin phase-change composite as an upper layer. The lower layer exhibits a unique unidirectional porous microstructure and an ultralow dielectric constant of 1.04. The upper layer possesses a dynamical temperature regulation capability thanks to its loaded paraffin having a high latent heat capacity of 242.7 J g −1 . The presence of the nondirectional PI aerogel middle layer can effectively prevent against the leakage of paraffin from the upper layer to the surface of the composite. Through a rational integration of three functional layers, the developed sandwich-structured composite not only can provide gradient thermal protection for hot objects over a long period but also exhibits an excellent wave-transparent capability to establish communication between two electromagnetically shielded electronic devices. With such prominent thermal insulation and wave-transparent functions, the sandwich-structured composite exhibits great potential for specific applications in aircraft, spacecraft, radar systems, and satellite communication.},

  abstract     = {Circularly polarized light (CPL) is inherently chiral and is regarded as one possible source for the origin of homochirality. Coincidentally, chiral metal nanoparticles have great prospects in asymmetric photochemical reactions since they can enhance the chiral light-matter interactions. Nonetheless, little is known about how the spin angular momentum of light competes with the chiral electromagnetic field in the vicinity of a chiral nanoparticle during the chiral induction and amplification process. Here, an asymmetric photo-polymerization system is presented where the chiral bias can be selectively regulated by the combination of chiral fields CPL and Ag nanoparticles, either constructively or destructively. Synergistic chiral amplification effect is observed when the handedness of both are matched, while the opposite-handed CPL can overrule the polymer helicity during the chain propagation process when the chiral near-field is weak. There is a bifurcation point in the chiral bias for the orthogonal control of the polymer helicity during the asymmetric photo-polymerization process, favoring for programmable chiroptical micropatterns and multi-channel independent information encoding. This work not only highlights opportunities for selectively regulating the asymmetric photopolymerization but also is highly valuable for fundamental understanding of the symmetry breaking in photochemical reactions.},

  abstract     = {Narrow-bandgap (NBG) Sn–Pb mixed perovskite solar cells (PSCs) represent a promising solution for surpassing the radiative efficiency of single-junction solar cells. The unique bandgap tunability of halide perovskites enables optimal tandem configurations of wide-bandgap (WBG) and NBG subcells. However, these devices are limited by the susceptibility of Sn 2+ in the NBG bottom cell to being oxidized to Sn 4+ , creating detrimental Sn vacancies. Herein, a novel approach that replaces Sn particles with Ni particles is introduced as the reducing agent for Sn–Pb mixed perovskite precursor solutions. The ferromagnetic properties of Ni enable simple magnetic filtration, eliminating the filtration issues associated with Sn particles. Ni particles can be reused up to five times without significantly affecting the PSC&#39;s performance. Additionally, Ni effectively mitigates the oxidation of Sn 2+ due to its low reduction potential (−0.23 V), thereby enhancing device performance. Single-junction Sn–Pb mixed PSCs prepared using Ni achieve a power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.29%, retaining over 90% of their initial efficiency after 1250 h. Furthermore, Ni-based all-perovskite tandem solar cells combining 1.77 eV WBG top cells with 1.25 eV NBG bottom cells achieve a remarkable PCE of 28.13%.

  abstract     = {Most wearable biosensors aimed at capturing psychological state target stress biomarkers in the form of physical symptoms that can correlate with dysfunction in the central nervous system (CNS). However, such markers lack the specificity needed for diagnostic or preventative applications. Wearable biochemical sensors (WBSs) have the potential to fill this gap, however, the technology is still in its infancy. Most WBSs proposed thus far target cortisol. Although cortisol detection is demonstrated as a viable method for approximating the extent and severity of psychological stress, the hormone also lacks specificity. Multiplex WBSs that simultaneously target cortisol alongside other viable stress-related biochemical markers (SBMs) can prove to be indispensable for understanding how psychological stress contributes to the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric illnesses (NPIs) and, thus, lead to the discovery of new biomarkers and more objective clinical tools. However, none target more than one SBM implicated in NPIs. Till this review, cortisol&#39;s connection to dysfunctions in the CNS, to other SBMs, and their implication in various NPIs has not been discussed in the context of developing WBS technology. As such, this review is meant to inform the biosensing and neuropsychiatric communities of viable future directions and possible challenges for WBS technology for neuropsychiatric applications.},

While indocyanine green (ICG)-based near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence (FL) surgical navigation enhances the visual identification of tumor margins, its accuracy remains subjective, underscoring the need for quantitative approaches. In this study, a high spatiotemporal fluorescence lifetime (FLT) imaging technology is developed in the second near-infrared window (NIR-II, 1000–1700 nm) for quantitative tumor margin detection, utilizing folate receptor-targeted ICG nanoprobes (FPH-ICG). FPH-ICG exhibits a significantly prolonged NIR-II FLT (750 ± 7 ps vs 260 ± 3 ps) and increased NIR-II FL brightness (FPH-ICG/ICG = 3.8). In vitro and in vivo studies confirm that FPH-ICG specifically targets folate receptor-α (FRα) on SK-OV-3 ovarian cancer cells, achieving high-contrast NIR-II FL imaging with a signal-to-background ratio of 10.8. Notably, NIR-II FLT imaging demonstrates superior accuracy (90%) and consistency in defining tumor margins compared to NIR-II FL imaging (58%) in both SK-OV-3 tumor-bearing mice and clinical tumor samples. These findings underscore the potential of NIR-II FLT imaging as a quantitative tool for guiding surgical tumor margin detection.},

  abstract     = {Exploring ionogels with superior conductivity, mechanical properties, and long-lasting room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) offers considerable potential for new-generation optoelectronics. However, reports on ionogels remain limited owing to the contradiction between the flexibility required for stretching and the rigidity necessary for RTP and load-bearing within the same ionogels. Here, a facile strategy is reported to enhance the toughness and extend the RTP of ionogels by salting-out-induced microphase separation, which results in the formation of an IL-rich phase (soft) for stretching and ionic conduction and a polymer-rich phase (stiff) for energy dissipation and clustering-triggered phosphorescence. The obtained ionogels exhibit high stretchability (≈400% strain), toughness (≈∼20 MJ m −3 ), ionic conductivity (8.4 mS cm −1 ), and ultralong afterglow lifetime (112.4 ms). This strategy is applicable to chromophores with color-tunable phosphorescence. By leveraging observable full-color RTP and real-time electrical signals in response to diverse stimuli (i.e., stretching and pressing), an intelligent grasping strategy is developed for robust hand pose reconstruction. In addition, a tactile-visual fusion recognition keyboard is created with dual functionality of information encryption and signal transmission. The ease of fabrication, wide tunability, and multifunctionality will help expand the scope of ionogels for smart devices.},

Extra intracellular Cu induces cuproptosis and chemodynamic therapy (CDT), which further cascades immunogenic cell death (ICD) and activates antitumor immune responses. However, the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment (TIM) attenuates the efficiency of the immune response. Herein, a biomimic nanodrug (ECNM) is fabricated, of which ES, Cu 2+ and NLG919 (an IDO1 inhibitor) are integrated via a self-assembly process and subsequently coated with 4T1 cell membrane. ECNM can overcome the typical drawbacks of ES, ameliorating the stability and half-life of ES by membrane-coating and enhancing its tumor accumulation and internalization via homotypic targeting. It is worth mentioning that, the addition of NLG919 is also beneficial to the system circulation stability of ES and reduces the non-specific ES release. After internalization, ECNM dissociates via the glutathione-responsive process and exhibits comprehensive antitumor capabilities, including cuproptosis, CDT and TIM reversing, thereby eliciting ICD and optimizing the antitumor immune response. Furthermore, ECNM not only accelerates tumor regression but also gains a strong abscopal effect and displays the potential of tumor vaccination. Overall, ECNM can activate antitumor immunity via cuproptosis and CDT, together with TIM reversing, for cancer treatment.},

Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop treatment strategies for HL. At present, the main treatment strategies for HL are hearing aids and cochlear implants (CIs), which cannot achieve a radical cure for HL. Relevant studies have shown that the most fundamental treatment strategy for sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is to regenerate hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) through stem cells to repair the structure and function of cochlea. In addition, physical stimulation strategies, such as electricity, light, and magnetism have also been used to promote SGN regeneration. This review systematically introduces the classification, principle and latest progress of the existing hearing treatment strategies and summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of each strategy. The research progress of physical regulation mechanism is discussed in detail. Finally, the problems in HL repair strategies are summarized and the future development direction is prospected, which could provide new ideas and technologies for the optimization of hearing treatment strategies and the research of SGN repair and regeneration through physical regulation.},

Herein, a novel lobaplatin-loaded lipiodol emulsion (denoted as ICN-LPE) is developed by constructing a lipiodol Pickering emulsion (LPE) stabilized with iron-doped carbon nanozymes (ICN) to mitigate the issue of lipiodol-water separation. This novel emulsion not only solves the instability of conventional lipiodol emulsions, but also facilitates the sustained release of lobaplatin. More importantly, upon entry into tumor cells, ICN catalyze the generation of reactive oxygen species via the Fenton-like reaction while simultaneously consuming intracellular glutathione, thereby inducing tumor cell death via chemodynamic therapy. By integrating chemotherapy and chemodynamic therapy, ICN-LPE demonstrates a synergistic antitumor effect and effectively inhibits tumor growth in a rabbit liver tumor model. Therefore, our ICN-LPE shows an appealing clinical application prospect for TACE.},

However, the intrinsic phenotypic instability of SCV has hindered a thorough investigation of its pathogenic mechanisms. In this study, phenotypically stable SCV strains are successfully recovered from clinical specimens, characterized by elevated drug resistance and reduced immunogenicity. Multi-omics analysis revealed that the acquired high drug resistance is associated with altered flux in the purine metabolism pathway, attributable to mutations in the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase ( hpt ) gene. Furthermore, this study innovatively discovered that lonidamine, an inhibitor of cellular energy metabolism, can effectively mitigate SCV resistance to β-lactam antibiotics, thereby facilitating its eradication. The underlying mechanism involves the reprogramming of purine metabolism. Therefore, a co-delivery system for lonidamine and oxacillin is constructed with amino-modified dendritic mesoporous silica as a carrier, which showed high efficacy and safety in combating SCV both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Overall, this study elucidated the pathogenic mechanisms of a class of clinically isolated SCV isolates with hpt mutations and provided a paradigm for treating SCV-associated osteomyelitis by reprogramming purine metabolism.},

However, the specific cellular and neural circuit mechanisms underlying the generation of RRB remain unclear. In this study, it is reported that the absence of the ASD-related protein Neuroligin 1 (NLGN1) in dopamine receptor D2-expressing medium spiny neurons (D2-MSNs) in the dorsal striatum is associated with the duration and frequency of self-grooming and digging behaviors. The Nlgn1 -deficient D2-MSNs are hyperactivated, which correlates with excessive self-grooming and digging behaviors. Inhibiting the activity of D2-MSNs reduces the duration and frequency of these RRBs. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the generation of self-grooming and digging behaviors depends on distinct patterns of D2-MSN activity. Finally, through single-nucleus RNA sequencing (sn-RNAseq) and protein detection verification, it is revealed that the overactivation of protein kinase C (PKC) in Nlgn1 -deficient mice contributes to excessive repetitive behaviors and increased neuronal excitability. In this study, potential mechanisms are proposed for the generation of self-grooming and digging behaviors, as well as suggest possible treatments and interventions ASD.},

Here, we present a type of smart and flexible watchband that includes a mini flexible electrode array based on Mo-Au filament mesh, combined with mesoscopic hybridized silk fibroin films. As the layer in contact with the skin, waterborne polyurethane and SF create a highly flexible and permeable meso-hybridized SF/WPU layer, ensuring skin-friendliness and comfortable wearing. The flexible FM electrodes are created by integrating Mo-Au FM into 2D-interconnected networks. Molybdenum filaments provide high rigidity and are coated with Aurum to enhance conductivity. The use of Mo-Au FMs in warp-knitted patterns results in high SNR (43.22 dB), high sensitivity (44.43 mV/kg), and significant motion noise reduction due to the pattern&#39;s elastic deformability and skin-gripping properties. Leveraging these unique technologies, these smart watchbands excel in prolonged sensing operation, grasping force detection, and gesture recognition. Through smart raining via deep learning, we achieved an unparalleled recognition rate (96% across 20 volunteers of different genders) among other EMG sensing devices.

Moreover, it holds a notable charge transfer amount (stands for a long service life) within operation period that outperforms all reported metal-free electrocatalysts. Operando differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) with isotope labeling identifies the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM). A variety of spectroscopic techniques and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the p -band center of these catalysts can be shifted stepwise to optimize the oxygen intermediate adsorption and lower the reaction energy barrier. This work provides a novel perspective for enhancing the electrocatalytic performance of metal-free COFs.},

  abstract     = {Single-cell MALDI mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) of lipids and metabolites &gt;200 Da has recently come to the forefront of biomedical research and chemical biology. However, cell-targeting and metabolome-preserving methods for analysis of low mass, hydrophilic metabolites (&lt;200 Da) in large cell populations are lacking. Here, the PRISM-MS ( PR escan I maging for S mall M olecule – M ass S pectrometry) mass-guided MSI workflow is presented, which enables space-efficient single cell lipid and metabolite analysis. In conjunction with giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) as MSI ground truth for cell-sized objects and Monte Carlo reference-based consensus clustering for data-dependent identification of cell subpopulations, PRISM-MS enables MSI and on-cell MS2-based identification of low-mass metabolites like amino acids or Krebs cycle intermediates involved in stimulus-dependent cell activation. The utility of PRISM-MS is demonstrated through the characterization of complex metabolome changes in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated microglial cells and human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia. Translation of single cell results to endogenous microglia in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures indicates that LPS-activation involves changes of the itaconate-to-taurine ratio and alterations in neuron-to-glia glutamine-glutamate shuttling. The data suggests that PRISM-MS can serve as a standard method in single cell metabolomics, given its capability to characterize larger cell populations and low-mass metabolites.},

  abstract     = {Vascular calcification (VC) in type 2 diabetes (T2D) poses a serious threat to the life and health of patients. However, its pathogenesis remains unclear, resulting in a lack of effective treatment for the root cause. It is found that both intestinal Bacteroides fragilis (BF) and peripheral M2 monocytes/macrophages are significantly elevated in patients with T2D VC. M2 macrophages are identified as a significant risk factor for T2D VC. Both BF and their extracellular vesicles (EV) promote T2D VC and facilitate macrophage M2 polarization. Macrophages clearance significantly antagonized BF EV-induced T2D VC in mice. Mechanistically, EV-rich double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) activates stimulator of interferon response cGAMP interactor 1 (Sting), promotes myocyte enhancer factor 2D (Mef2d) phosphorylation, upregulates tribbles pseudokinase 1 (Trib1) expression, and induces macrophage M2 polarization. Concurrently, Mef2d activated by the EV targets and upregulates the expression of pro-calcification factor Serpine1, thereby exacerbating T2D VC. Clinical studies have shown that Serpine1 is significantly elevated in the peripheral blood of patients with T2D VC and is closely associated with T2D VC. In summary, this study reveals that intestinal BF promotes Trib1 expression through the EV-Sting-Mef2d pathway to induce macrophage M2 polarization and upregulates serpin family E member 1 (Serpine1) expression, thereby aggravating T2D VC. The findings provide a new theoretical and experimental bases for optimizing the strategies for prevention and treatment of T2D VC.},

  abstract     = {Under low blue light (LBL) conditions, soybean exhibits classic shade avoidance syndrome (SAS) with exaggerated stem elongation (ESE), leading to lodging and yield reduction in dense farming. Recently, mRNA modification by N6-methyladenosine (m6A) has emerged as a crucial epigenetic mechanism regulating plant biological processes; however, its impact on shade avoidance remains unexplored. In this study, the double mutants, gmmtas , that are impaired in two m 6 A writer genes, GmMTAa and GmMTAb that encode m 6 A methyltransferases or m 6 A writers are generated. It is found that the gmmtas mutants showed a substantial reduction of m6A levels, a dwarf phenotype, and a diminished sensitivity to LBL. Further investigation of the gmmtas mutants demonstrates that GmMTA regulates shade avoidance response by altering the expression of GmCRY1s , GmSPAs , and GmCOP1s , resulting in increased accumulation of GmSTFs that are known to suppress the shad avoidance response in response to LBL in soybean. The findings reveal a novel molecular mechanism regulating shade resistance in soybean, providing insights into the epigenetic mechanisms of plant adaptation to changing light environments and paving the way for the development of shade-tolerant soybean varieties.},

Herein, a novel nanocomposite combining silicon nanoparticles and carbon-doped titania, C-TiO 2 /SiNPs, is designed as a fluorescence probe and visible-light photocatalyst to simultaneously monitor and degrade oxytetracycline (OTC). C-TiO 2 /SiNPs emit blue fluorescence, which can be quenched by OTC through inner filter effect. Meanwhile, green fluorescence is turned on upon OTC addition by aggregation-induced emission. Thus, C-TiO 2 /SiNPs successfully act as a fluorescence colorimetric probe for quantitation and semi-quantitation of OTC. Additionally, C-TiO 2 /SiNPs show adorable visible-light photocatalytic activity toward OTC, achieving a removal rate of 93.3% in 30 min. This process is driven by the superoxide radicals, holes and hydroxyl radicals produced by C-TiO 2 /SiNPs under visible light irradiation. The total toxicities obviously reduce after OTC is degraded by C-TiO 2 /SiNPs. The concentration during the OTC degradation can be estimated by naked eyes through the change of fluorescence color, but also precisely quantified by a fluorometer. This study innovatively develops a one-stone-two-birds strategy to achieve simultaneous degradation and in situ real-time detection of OTC, paving a promising paradigm for the highly efficient monitoring and removal of residual drugs.},

  abstract     = {Integrated biochemical and biophysical signals regulate embryonic development. Correct neural tube formation is critical for the development of central nervous system. However, the role of microgravity in neurodevelopment and its underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, the effects of stimulated microgravity (SMG) on the development of human brain organoids are investigated. SMG impairs N-cadherin-based adherens junction formation, leading to neural tube defects associated with dysregulated self-renewal capacity and neuroepithelial disorganization in human brain organoids. Bulk gene expression analyses reveal that SMG alters Hippo and BMP signaling in brain organoids. The neuropathological deficits in SMG-treated organoids can be rescued by regulating YAP/BMP/ID1 axis. Furthermore, sing-cell RNA sequencing data show that SMG results in perturbations in the number and function of neural stem and progenitor cell subpopulations. One of these subpopulations senses SMG cues and transmits BMP signals to the subpopulation responsible for tube morphogenesis, ultimately affecting the proliferating cell population. Finally, SMG intervention leads to persistent neurologic damage even after returning to normal gravity conditions. Collectively, this study reveals molecular and cellular abnormalities associated with SMG during human brain development, providing opportunities for countermeasures to maintain normal neurodevelopment in space.},

This approach aims to reduce data movement between sensory and computing units, minimizing the need for data transfer and conversion at the sensor-processor interface. Here, an optical neuromorphic synaptic (ONS) device is demonstrated by homogeneously integrating optical-sensing and synaptic functionalities into a unified material platform, constructed exclusively by all-inorganic perovskite CsPbBr 3 quantum dots (QDs). The dual functionality of each unit within the ONS device, which can be operated as either an optical sensor or a synaptic device depending on applied electrical polarity, provides significant advantages over previous heterogeneous integration methods, particularly regarding material selection, structural compatibility, and device fabrication complexity. The ONS device exhibits distinct wavelength responses essential for emulating colored image recognition capability inherent in the human visual system. Additionally, the seamless integration of electronics and photonics within a unified material system establishes a novel paradigm for optical retrieval, enabling real-time perception of the encoded status of the ONS device.

Rationally arranging Pt particles on carbon support is the primary approach for reducing mass transport resistance. Herein, using a unique method coupling Hybrid Reverse Monte Carlo, molecular dynamics simulations, and experimental measurements, a Pt particle arrangement strategy is proposed to reduce local oxygen transport resistance, based on a molecular-level understanding of its impact. The densely arranged Pt particles with a small interparticle distance lead to the denser ionomer layer due to the co-attraction effect, leading to a high local oxygen transport resistance. The nonuniformly arranged Pt particles with various interparticle distances cause the heterogeneous ionomer density, inducing the heterogeneous oxygen transport. Increasing the Pt-Pt interparticle distance from 2 to 5 nm substantially reduces the local oxygen transport resistance by over 50%. The uniform arrangement of Pt particles makes the ionomer layer density more homogeneous, resulting in more uniform oxygen transport. Therefore, uniformly arranging Pt particles with an interparticle distance of &gt;5 nm on carbon support is preferred for reducing local oxygen transport resistance and improving the homogeneity of oxygen transport.},

However, graft failure that results from suboptimal regeneration and pathological remodeling has hindered their clinical adoption. Recent advances in vascular biology highlight the pivotal role of COUP-TFII in orchestrating endothelial identity, angiogenesis, safeguarding against atherosclerosis, and mitigating vascular calcification. Here, plasmid DNA (pDNA) encoding COUP-TFII is incorporated into decellularized allografts to realize localized delivery. Comprehensive in vitro investigation complemented by a bone marrow transplantation model on genetic-lineage-tracing mouse revealed the underlying mechanisms of COUP-TFII in regulating vascular regeneration and remodeling. COUP-TFII augmented endothelialization and inhibited calcification in decellularized allografts by modulating the Ang1/Tie2/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway that dictates the fate of Sca-1 + stem/progenitor cells. Heparin-polyethyleneimine nanoparticles (HEPI) are prepared as COUP-TFII pDNA nanocarriers (COUP-TFII@HPEI) and used to modify decellularized allografts, achieving long-term and stable overexpression of COUP-TFII. Functionalized grafts are evaluated in rat abdominal artery replacement models, demonstrating enhanced neo-artery regeneration without calcification.

This study introduces an eco-friendly patterning technique leveraging membrane swelling properties by applying mechanical stress during dehydration under fixed constraints.

This innovation facilitates ion conduction via locally shortened pathways. Membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) with patterned commercial membranes demonstrated significantly improved performance and durability compared to MEAs with conventional catalyst-coated substrates and flat membranes under pure water-fed conditions. The universal applicability of this technique was confirmed using in-house fabricated anion exchange membranes, achieving exceptional current densities of 13.7 A cm −2 at 2.0 V in 1.0 M potassium hydroxide (KOH) and 2.8 A cm −2 at 2.0 V in pure water at 60 °C. Furthermore, the scalability of the technique was demonstrated through successful fabrication and operation of large-area cells.

  abstract     = {Aberrant upregulation of hepatic lipogenesis induced by chronic and excessive alcohol consumption is a critical driver of the progression of alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), however, no effective approaches inhibiting lipogenesis are currently available for treating ALD patients. Moreover, little is known about whether and how nonethanol ingredients in alcoholic beverages regulate the pathogenesis of ALD. Here the discovery of a small molecule that activates the production and secretion of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is reported. It is shown that the activator ethyl lactate, a nonethanol ingredient found in distilled liquors, ameliorates alcoholic hepatosteatosis, inflammation and acute-on-chronic liver injury by stimulating FGF21. In response to chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding or fasting, ethyl lactate mimics lipogenesis lowering effects by stimulating FGF21 production through the NAD + -dependent deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) signaling pathway. These ethyl lactate-mediated beneficial effects are abolished by inhibition of SIRT1 through injection of EX527. Importantly, FGF21 deficiency in hepatocytes blocks the downregulation of lipogenesis by ethyl lactate and exacerbates alcoholic steatosis, inflammation and liver injury. The regulatory mechanism is discussed during the pathophysiological conditions and suggests new lines of research into the therapeutic use of a foodborne small molecule ethyl lactate.},

  abstract     = {Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is combined with sonodynamic therapy (SDT) to increase response rates and enhance anticancer efficacy. However, the “always on” property of most sonosensitizers in reducing tumor microenvironment (TME) compromises the therapeutic outcome of sonoimmunotherapy and exacerbates adverse side effects. Precisely controllable strategies combining sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) gas therapy with cancer immunotherapy can address these issues but remain lacking. Herein an “activatable SO 2 nanosonosensitizer” for precise sono-gaseous checkpoint trimodal therapy of orthotopic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is reported, whose full activity is initiated by ultrasound (US) irradiation in the reducing TME. This “activatable SO 2 nanosonosensitizer,” Aza-DNBS nanoparticles (NPs), are established by self-assembling Aza-boron-dipyrromethene based sonosensitizer molecules and 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonate (DNBS)-caged SO 2 prodrug. The activity of Aza-DNBS NPs is initially silenced, and the sonodynamic, gaseous, and immunosuppressive TME reprogramming activities are precisely awakened under US irradiation. Due to the glutathione-responsiveness of Aza-DNBS NPs, Aza-DNBS NPs can generate large amounts of SO 2 for gas therapy-enhanced SDT, which triggers robust immunogenic cell death activation and reprogramming of the immunosuppressive TME, thereby significantly suppressing orthotopic tumor growth and delaying lung metastasis. Thus, this study represents a strategy for designing a generic nanoplatform for precisely combined immunotherapy of orthotopic HCC.},

  abstract     = {Big data and artificial intelligence are driving increasing demand for high-density data storage. Probe-based data storage, such as mechanical storage using an atomic force microscope tip, is a potential solution with storage densities exceeding hard disks. However, the storage medium must be modifiable on the nanoscale. While polymers are promising storage media, they face challenges with synthesis, erasing temperatures, and stability. Here, a low-cost and robust polymer system is reported that allows repeated writing, reading and erasing. The polymer is made by inverse vulcanization, providing a network of S─S bonds that can be broken and re-formed repeatedly. This property is leveraged in mechanical indentation to encode information, and thermal S─S metathesis and polymer re-flow to erase. Exquisite control of indentation depth is possible over 1–30 nm. This control enables data encoding not just as a function of the presence or absence of an indent, but also indentation depth. This ternary coding increases the data density four-fold over binary coding. Furthermore, the coding can be done at room temperature which is rare for mechanical information storage. The low cost, ease of synthesis, and dynamic S─S bonds in these polymers are a promising advance in polymer storage media for probe-based data storage.},

  abstract     = {Tumor therapeutic strategies based on mitochondrial damage have become an emerging trend. However, the low drug delivery efficiency caused by lysosomal sequestration and the activation of protective mitochondrial autophagy severely restricts the therapeutic efficacy. Herein, an in situ transformable nanoparticle named KCKT is developed to promote lysosomal escape and directly damage mitochondria while blocking mitochondrial autophagy. KCKT exhibits acid responsiveness for precise self-assembly into nanofibers within the lysosomes of cancer cells. The massive accumulation of nanofibers and excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under sonodynamic therapy synergistically induce lysosomal damage. This facilitates the escape of nanofibers from lysosomal sequestration, thereby enhancing drug delivery. Subsequently, the escaped nanofibers specifically aggregate around the mitochondria for long-term retention and generate ROS under ultrasound irradiation to induce mitochondrial damage. Notably, due to lysosomal dysfunction, damaged mitochondria cannot be cleared by autophagy, further aggravating oxidative damage. These results reveal that KCKT effectively improves drug delivery and mitochondria-targeted therapy efficiency by blocking protective autophagy. These findings hold significant potential for advancing the field of mitochondria-targeted therapy.},

Boundary conditions for the security requirements are established and discussed as well as experimentally investigated for a specific setup based on printing and optical analysis of pigment-carrier composites. In the context of the applied methods, this setup promises to be mathematically unclonable, steady, reproducible, collision resistant and non-invertible and illustrates the feasibility of a physical one-way function. Based on this, a framework for proof of physical work is conceptualized, which has the potential of a drastically lower CO 2 footprint.

With the advent of atomically thin 2D van der Waals (vdW) magnets, a pertinent question is whether such compounds could make their way into this realm where interactions can be tailored so that unconventional states of matter can be assessed. Here, it is shown that square islands of CrGeTe 3 vdW ferromagnets distributed in a grid manifest antiferromagnetic correlations, essential to enable frustration resulting in an artificial spin-ice. By using a combination of SQUID-on-tip microscopy, focused ion beam lithography, and atomistic spin dynamic simulations, it is shown that a square array of CGT island as small as 150 × 150 × 60 nm 3 have tunable dipole–dipole interactions, which can be precisely controlled by their lateral spacing. There is a crossover between non-interacting islands and significant inter-island anticorrelation depending on how they are spatially distributed allowing the creation of complex magnetic patterns not observable at the isolated flakes. These findings suggest that the cross-talk between the nano-patterned magnets can be explored in the generation of even more complex spin configurations where exotic interactions may be manipulated in an unprecedented way.},

  abstract     = {Epigenetic control of cell fates is a critical determinant to maintain cell type stability and permit differentiation during embryonic development. However, the epigenetic control mechanisms are not well understood. Here, it is shown that the histone acetyltransferase reader protein BRD8 impairs the conversion of primed mouse EpiSCs (epiblast stem cells) to naive mouse ESCs (embryonic stem cells). BRD8 works by maintaining histone acetylation on promoters and transcribed gene bodies. BRD8 is responsible for maintaining open chromatin at somatic genes, and histone acetylation at naive-specific genes. When Brd8 expression is reduced, chromatin accessibility is unchanged at primed-specific genes, but histone acetylation is reduced. Conversely, naive-specific genes has reduced repressive chromatin marks and acquired accessible chromatin more rapidly during the cell type conversion. It is shown that this process requires active histone deacetylation to promote the conversion of primed to naive. This data supports a model for BRD8 reading histone acetylation to accurately localize the genome-wide binding of the histone acetyltransferase KAT5. Overall, this study shows how the reading of the histone acetylation state by BRD8 maintains cell type stability and both enables and impairs stem cell differentiation.},

  abstract     = {Spinel-type nickel ferrite (Ni x Fe 3-x O 4 , x≤1) is a widely used electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Due to the lower hybridization of metal- d and oxygen- p orbitals, the OER process on Ni x Fe 3-x O 4 follows the sluggish adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM). Generally, activating the lattice oxygen to trigger the lattice-oxygen-mediated mechanism (LOM) can enhance the OER activity. Herein, to trigger the LOM pathway while maintaining high stability, iron foam (IF)-supported Ni 0.75 Fe 2.25 O 4 (NiFeO) with geometrical defects of [NiO 6 ] (nickel cation coordinated with six oxygen anions) units and higher ratio of Fe to Ni cations in octahedral sites ( d -NiFe HR O/IF) is prepared by ion-exchanging with polar aprotic solvent followed by annealing. As a result, as-synthesized d -NiFe HR O/IF exhibits excellent activity (at 295 mV overpotential to achieve 100 mA cm −2 ), fast kinetics (Tafel slope of only 34.6 mV dec −1 ), and high stability (maintaining a current density of 100 mA cm −2 over 130 h) for the OER. The theoretical calculations reveal that the construction of octahedral defect in Ni x Fe 3-x O 4 enhances the overlap of Fe- d and O- p orbitals, which can activate the lattice oxygen. Therefore, increasing the ratio of Fe to Ni will further improve the lattice oxygen redox activity, and thus trigger the fast LOM pathway, ultimately facilitating the OER process.},

This condition is strongly associated with the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), but how MAFLD affects the development and progression of CVD, particularly concerning vascular calcification, remains unclear. Herein, extracellular vesicles (EVs) are identified from steatotic hepatocytes as a trigger that accelerated the progression of both vascular intimal and medial calcification. Steatotic hepatocytes are found to release more EVs, which are able to reach the vascular tissue, be taken up by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), and promote their osteogenic differentiation. Within these toxic vesicles, a protein cargo is identified called lectin galactoside-binding soluble 3 binding protein (Lgals3bp) that acted as a potent inducer of osteochondrogenic transformation in VSMCs. Both the inhibition of EV release and the liver-specific knockdown of Lgals3bp profoundly attenuated vascular calcification. This work partially explains the reason for the high incidence of vascular calcification in MAFLD and unveils a novel mechanism that may be used to prevent or treat cardiovascular complications in patients with MAFLD.},

  abstract     = {Chemoresistance poses a critical obstacle in bladder cancer (BCa) treatment, and effective interventions are currently limited. Elevated oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) has been linked to cancer stemness, a determinant of chemoresistance. However, the mechanisms underlying increased OXPHOS during cancer cell chemoresistance remain unclear. This study revealed that the mitochondrial translational activator of cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (TACO1) is linked to stemness and cisplatin resistance in BCa cells. Mechanistically, mitochondrial TACO1 enhances the translation of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (MTCO1), promoting mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) by upregulating OXPHOS, consequently driving cancer stemness and cisplatin resistance. Intriguingly, the mitochondrial translocation of TACO1 is mediated by the heat shock protein 90 β (HSP90β), a process that requires circFOXK2 as a scaffold for the TACO1-HSP90β interaction. The mutations at the binding sites of TACO1-circFOXK2-HSP90β disturb the ternary complex and inhibit cancer stemness and cisplatin resistance in BCa cells by suppressing the MTCO1/OXPHOS/mtROS axis. Clinically, BCa patients with increased mitochondrial TACO1 expression respond poorly to cisplatin treatment. This study elucidates the mechanisms by which TACO1 promotes BCa stemness and cisplatin resistance, providing a potential target for mitigating cisplatin resistance for BCa and a biomarker for predicting cisplatin response.},

The discovery of effective therapies against antibiotic-resistant pathogens has become an urgent need, necessitating innovative approaches to accelerate the identification and development of novel antibacterial agents. On the other hand, the expression of the β-lactam-hydrolyzing enzyme (β-lactamase), the major cause of bacterial resistance to β-lactam antibiotics, provides a distinctive opportunity to visualize bacterial infection, evaluate the efficacy of existing antibiotics, screen for novel antibacterial agents, and optimize drug dosing regimens in live animals. Herein, a hydrophilicity-switching, self-immobilizing, near-Infrared fluorogenic β-lactamase probe for the highly sensitive imaging of bacterial infection in live mice is reported. This probe, in addition to a significant increase in fluorescence upon selective hydrolysis by β-lactamases as conventional β-lactamase probes, also massively enriches within β-lactamase-expressing bacteria (over 1500-folds compared to the incubation medium), which renders excellent sensitivity in the imaging of bacterial infections in living animals. This agent has proven to enable the assessment of antibiotic therapeutic efficacy and potency of β-lactamase inhibitors in living animals in a non-invasive and much more convenient manner.},

Herein, the chirality evolution of supramolecular helices based on l -phenylalanine derivative (LPF) and naphthylamide derivate (NDIAPY) is achieved by the strategy of electron transfer (ET) assisted secondary nucleation. ET from LPF to NDIAPY can be triggered by 5 s UV irradiation on left-handed LPF-NDIAPY co-assemblies, leading to NDIAPY radical anions and partial disassembly of the helices. Meanwhile, spontaneous reversion of radical anions into monomers occurs upon removal of UV light, and the surface of residual co-assemblies can accelerate the reversion process. This surface accelerated reversion of ET further facilitates the secondary nucleation-elongation events, giving rise to the formation of scale-amplified and g vale-increased left-handed helices. Meanwhile, chirality evolution controlled by ET assisted secondary nucleation process can be also realized by adding the prepared LPF-NDIAPY co-assemblies into the total ET system. This study may provide a useful approach to constructing and modulating diverse chiral structures by manipulating the secondary nucleation process.},

  abstract     = {Root systems are crucial organs for crops to absorb water and nutrients. Conducting phenotypic analysis on roots is of great importance. To date, methods for root system phenotypic analysis have predominantly focused on semantic segmentation, integrating phenotypic extraction software to achieve comprehensive root phenotype analysis. This study demonstrates the feasibility of instance segmentation tasks on in situ root system images. An improved YoloV8n-seg network tailored for detecting elongated roots is proposed, which outperforms the original YoloV8seg in all network performance metrics. Additionally, the post-processing method introduced reduces root identification errors, ensuring a one-to-one correspondence between each root system and its detection box. The experiment yields phenotypic parameters for fine-grained roots, such as fine-grained root length, diameter, and curvature. Compared to traditional parameters like total root length and average root diameter, these detailed phenotypic analyses enable more precise phenotyping and facilitate accurate artificial intervention during crop cultivation.},

  abstract     = {Understanding tissue-specific RNA landscapes is essential for uncovering the functional mechanisms of key organs in mammals. However, current knowledge remains limited, as short-read RNA sequencing—the predominant method for assessing gene expression—depends on incomplete gene annotations and struggles to resolve the diverse transcripts produced by genes. To address these limitations, an integrative approach combining nanopore direct RNA sequencing (DRS), ATAC-Seq, and short-read RNA-seq is used. This method enabled the analysis of RNA landscapes across major mouse organs under fasting and fed conditions, representing two extremes of the caloric cycle. This study uncovered tens of thousands of novel transcripts and identified hundreds of genes with tissue-specific expression, revealing additional layers of regulated pathways within each organ that conventional short-read RNA-seq cannot resolve. By profiling transcript expression across multiple organs under identical conditions, it is conducted comparative analyses exposing significant differences in transcript isoforms and regulations. Moreover, nanopore DRS revealed dynamic changes in poly(A) tail length and m6A modifications of transcripts, many regulated in a tissue-specific manner. These changes likely contribute to functional differentiation and metabolic specialization of various organs. Collectively, this findings reveal previously unrecognized layers of gene regulation, offering new insights into the metabolic basis of organ function.},

By analyzing the SHG signal intensity, which is directly related to the electric field at the interface between the semiconductor channel and gate insulator, critical electrical parameters such as the threshold voltage (V TH ) and flat-band voltage (V FB ) are successfully determined. These findings demonstrate a strong correlation between SHG signals and V TH and V FB in InGaZnO TFTs under various process conditions. Notably, the method achieves an unprecedented resolution of ΔV FB below 100 mV in assessing electrical properties through SHG measurements, surpassing conventional spectroscopy techniques. Furthermore, a system is developed to monitor and image the TFT array operation and performance, enabling us to distinguish between pass and fail devices and measure the V TH distribution based on the SHG intensity. This approach facilitates early failure detection and supports efficient curing during manufacturing, thereby marking significant advancements in TFT technology and quality control processes.},

  abstract     = {Multiple myeloma (MM) is a cancer of plasma cells caused by abnormal gene expression and interactions within the bone marrow (BM) niche. The BM environment significantly influences the progression of MM. Celastrol, a natural compound derived from traditional Chinese medicine, exhibits significant anticancer effects. This study aimed to identify specific targets of celastrol and develop more effective and less toxic treatment options for MM. Celastrol is used as a probe to determine its specific target, pyridoxine-5′-phosphate oxidase (PNPO). Increased levels of PNPO are associated with poor outcomes in MM patients, and PNPO promotes MM cell proliferation and induces osteoclast differentiation through exosomes. Mechanistically, PNPO oxidizes disheveled 3 M282 (DVL3), leading to abnormal activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Based on the critical sites of PNPO R95/K117 , Eltrombopag is identified as a potential therapeutic candidate for MM. In addition, the experiments showed its efficacy in mouse models. Eltrombopag inhibited the growth of MM cells and reduced bone lesions by disrupting the interaction between PNPO and DVL3, as supported by preliminary clinical trials. The study highlights the importance of PNPO as a high-risk gene in the development of MM and suggests that Eltrombopag may be a promising treatment option.},

Then, ALKBH5 upregulated FBXL5 expression by m 6 A demethylation, which is dependent on the ALKBH5 H204 amino acid site and specific m 6 A sites on FBXL5 mRNA. Finally, the ALKBH5-FBXL5 axis reduces intracellular reactive oxygen species levels, leading to PI3K/AKT and NF-kB pathway inhibition and consequently suppresses NSCLC proliferation and metastasis in vitro and in vivo.

Therefore, to improve the response rate of immunotherapy and reduce pulmonary fibrosis, this study designed and prepared an intelligent nanodrug based on dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DMSNs) loaded with a sono-sensitive agent protoporphyrin IX (PpIX). Additionally, a reactive oxygen species (ROS) sensitive linker is used to attach the immunotherapeutic drug PD-L1 inhibitor (aPD-L1) to DMSNs via covalent bonds. The external ultrasound (US) activates PpIX to generate ROS, which breaks the linker to release aPD-L1 to induce sonodynamic therapy (SDT) and immunotherapy. This sono-immnotherapy approach demonstrated excellent outcomes in tumor inhibition, eliciting immune responses, and reducing pulmonary fibrosis.

Traditional treatments often fail to effectively eliminate inflammation and ensure adequate drainage, leading to prolonged healing time and a high recurrence rate. Herein, a new class of quaternized molecular brush-grafted injectable microgel (denoted as GAA@CNT- g -PVBTMA) is developed through thermal polymerization and mechanical fragmentation to promote the healing process of anal fistula. Benefiting from the fragmented morphology with a porous structure, the microgel can effectively fill the fistula and facilitate the drainage of exudate. Owing to the electrostatic interactions between the positively charged quaternized carbon nanotube molecular brush (CNT- g -PVBTMA) and the negatively charged inflammatory cytokines, GAA@CNT- g -PVBTMA microgel exhibits excellent anti-inflammatory properties with scavenging rates of 92.6% for tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and 92.5% for interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Rat inflammatory anal fistula model demonstrates that the microgel can effectively reduce inflammation and epithelialization of the fistula, thereby promoting the healing of the anal fistula. By integrating effective filling, adequate drainage, and excellent anti-inflammatory properties, GAA@CNT- g -PVBTMA microgel provides a promising new direction for the treatment of anal fistula.},

  abstract     = {Atherosclerotic plaque rupture mainly contributes to acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Insufficient repair of these plaques leads to thrombosis and subsequent ACS. Central to this process is the modulation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) phenotypes, emphasizing their pivotal role in atherosclerotic plaque stability and healing post-disruption. Here, an expansion of FSP1 + cells in a tandem stenosis (TS) model of atherosclerotic mice is unveiled, predominantly originating from VSMCs through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses and VSMC lineage tracing studies. Further investigation identified TEA domain transcription factor 1 (TEAD1) as the key transcription factor driving the trans-differentiation of VSMCs into fibroblast-like cells. In vivo experiments using a TS model of plaque rupture demonstrated that TEAD1 played a crucial role in promoting plaque stability and healing post-rupture through pharmacological or TEAD1-AAV treatments. Mechanistically, it is found that TEAD1 promoted the expression of fibroblast markers through the Wnt4/β-Catenin pathway, facilitating the trans-differentiation. Thus, this study illustrated that TEAD1 played a critical role in promoting the trans-differentiation of VSMCs into fibroblast-like cells and subsequent extracellular matrix production through the Wnt4/β-Catenin pathway. Consequently, this process enhanced the healing mechanisms following plaque rupture, elucidating potential therapeutic avenues for managing atherosclerotic instability.},

Herein, it is shown that MAD patients achieved inflammaging with different pro-inflammatory cytokines compared to progeria-(HGPS) patient. Characterization of MAD iPSC-derived Mesenchymal stem cells (MAD-iMSC) uncovers deregulated mitochondrial Ca +2 as the primary cause of inflammaging, mediated through inflammasome formation rather than the cGAS-STING pathway. Moreover, MAD-iMSCs extracellular vesicles (EVs) can also upregulate mitochondrial Ca +2 in healthy cells. This deregulated Ca +2 homeostasis is indirectly mediated by mitochondrial calcium mediator, signal transducer, and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3), situated on the mitochondrial associated membrane (MAM). Inflammaging is mitigated by various FDA-approved MAM-STAT3 upstream inhibitors, such as (Tocilizumab) or by correcting R527C mutation with CRISPR/CAS9. These results provide new insights into MAD disease and propose targeting defective mitochondrial Ca +2 homeostasis as a promising therapy for reversing immunosenescence.},

Notably, DNA methylation undergoes adaptive changes in neurological disorders, emerging as a promising target for neuromodulation. In this study, systemic administration of PTX leads to a decrease in the expression of the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3a, while concurrently upregulating the expression of Gabrb1 mRNA and its encoded GABA A Rβ1 protein in the medial PFC (mPFC) of male mice. Overexpression of DNMT3a in the mPFC alleviates PTX-induced pain hypersensitivity, and anxiety-like behavior in these mice. Additionally, it reverses the PTX-induced increase in inhibitory synaptic transmission in the pyramidal neurons of the mPFC. Mechanistically, the upregulation of GABA A Rβ1 in the mPFC is linked to the reduced expression of DNMT3a and DNA hypomethylation at the promoter region of the Gabrb1 gene. Furthermore, a long-term diet rich in methyl donors alleviates PTX-induced pain hypersensitivity and anxiety-like behavior in mice. These findings suggest that the DNMT3a-mediated upregulation of GABA A Rβ1 in the mPFC contributes to PTX-induced neuropathic pain and anxiety, highlighting DNA methylation-dependent epigenetic regulation as a potential therapeutic target for addressing chemotherapy-induced cortical dysfunction.},

However, the interplay and underlying mechanisms of how these factors synergistically induce PTSD remain inadequately elucidated. Here, mice in the TBI (induced by biological shock tube blast injury) and PTSD (induced by single prolonged stress method) groups both displayed symptoms of PTSD behaviors, with the TBI+PTSD (composite model) group exhibiting more severe manifestations. The result of snRNA-seq demonstrated a noticeable increase in the population of Gabra6 + neurons in the prefrontal cortex region of mice in the TBI+PTSD group. Knocking down cortical Gabra6 mitigated PTSD-related behavioral outcomes. Mechanistically, the Smad3/4 complex activation led to the upregulation of Gabra6 expression in cortical neurons. Interaction of Gabra6 with Homer1 activated downstream cAMP signaling pathways. Homer1 KO-Nestin mice show reduced susceptibility to PTSD. Subsequently, the efficacy of monoclonal antibody intervention at the 218 site of Gabra6 in ameliorating PTSD development is verified. This study suggests that TBI and stressors act as independent components in PTSD development, with Gabra6 + neurons pivotal in synergistically facilitating PTSD formation. Strategies geared toward minimizing exposure to singular or combined stressors may effectively diminish the risk of developing PTSD.},

  abstract     = {The immunosuppressive residual tumor microenvironment (IRTM) is a key factor in the high recurrence and metastasis rates of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after microwave ablation (MWA). Cholesterol-rich tumor fragments significantly contribute to IRTM deterioration. This study developed a cholesterol-targeted catalytic hydrogel, DA-COD-OD-HCS, to enhance the synergy between MWA and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for HCC treatment. Cholesterol oxidase (COD), modified with dimethyl maleic anhydride (DA) for release in acidic IRTM, is used to degrade cholesterol. Oxydextran (OD) and hemin-chitosan (HCS) formed a dual network gel, ensuring long-term fixation of COD and hemin in the IRTM post-MWA. In both in vitro and in vivo HCC models, DA-COD-OD-HCS effectively released COD, degraded cholesterol, and induced tumor cell ferroptosis, enhancing the antitumor immune response. Combined with anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy, this strategy inhibited primary tumor growth and distant metastases, without side effects on adjacent tissues. This work highlights that cholesterol-targeting catalytic hydrogels fueled by tumor debris can significantly improve the efficacy of MWA and ICIs, offering a novel therapeutic approach for HCC.},

  abstract     = {Neurosyphilis (NS) is a clinical condition caused by infection of the central nervous system (CNS) by Treponema pallidum ( Tp ) that can lead to asymptomatic meningitis and more serious neurological diseases, such as dementia and blindness. However, current studies on the pathogenesis of NS are limited. Here, through the integration analysis of proteomics and single-cell transcriptomics, Toll-like/NF-κB signaling is identified as the key pathway involved in CNS damage caused by Tp . Moreover, monocyte-derived macrophages are key cells involved in the inflammatory response to Tp in the CNS of NS patients. In addition, it is found that inflammatory cells in peripheral blood may cause neurological damage through disruption of the blood‒brain barrier (BBB) in individuals with NS. Notably, activation of the Toll-like/NF-κB signaling pathway, as well as dysregulation of neural function, is likewise validated in an in vitro NS brain organoid model. In conclusion, the results revealed the mechanisms of inflammation-mediated brain injury in Tp -induced NS and provided new ideas for the clinical treatment of Tp infection.},

  abstract     = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a lethal disease with substantial unmet medical needs. While aberrant epithelial remodeling is a key factor in IPF progression, the molecular mechanisms behind this process remain elusive. Harnessing a 3D patient-derived organoid model and multi-omics approach, the first inventory of the connection between metabolic alteration, chromatin accessibility, and transcriptional regulation in IPF aberrant epithelial remodeling is provided. This remodeling is characterized by an increase in chromatin accessibility, particularly at JUNB motif-enriched promoter regions proximal to transcription start sites of metabolic and pro-fibrotic genes. Mechanistically, JUNB undergoes O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine modification (O-GlcNAcylation), a critical step in modulating pro-fibrotic responses to chronic injury. This modification is pivotal in fostering the emergence of aberrant epithelial basal cells in the alveolar niche, a proposed driver of IPF pathology. Specific deletion of O-GlcNAcylation sites on JUNB attenuates the metaplastic differentiation of basal cells, thereby aiding in the restoration of the alveolar lineage. Together, the findings reveal a novel link between metabolic dysregulation and cell fate regulation at the chromatin level in fibrosis, mediated by the O-GlcNAc-JUNB axis, suggesting avenues for the development of new therapeutic strategies in IPF.},

Using an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven target discovery platform, two unreported therapeutic targets, guanylate-binding protein 2 (GBP2) and hematopoietic cell kinase (HCK) are identified, along with a drug repurposing target, integrin beta 2 (ITGB2) for the treatment of endometriosis. GBP2, HCK, and ITGB2 are upregulated in human endometriotic specimens. siRNA-mediated knockdown of GBP2 and HCK significantly reduced cell viability and proliferation while stimulating apoptosis in endometrial stromal cells. In subcutaneous and intraperitoneal endometriosis mouse models, siRNAs targeting GBP2 and HCK notably reduced lesion volume and weight, with decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis within lesions. Both subcutaneous and intraperitoneal administration of Lifitegrast, an approved ITGB2 antagonist, effectively suppresses lesion growth. Collectively, these data present Lifitegrast as a previously unappreciated intervention for endometriosis treatment and identify GBP2 and HCK as novel druggable targets in endometriosis treatment. This study underscores AI&#39;s potential to accelerate the discovery of novel drug targets and facilitate the repurposing of treatment modalities for endometriosis.},

  abstract     = {Liver metastasis is a common cause of death in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, but epigenetic remodeling and metabolic reprogramming for CRC liver metastasis remain unclear. The study revealed that the Lyn/RUVBL1 complex is highly expressed in CRC and is closely correlated with liver metastasis. On the one hand, ATAC-seq and HiCut suggested that Lyn/RUVBL1 regulates the expression of TRIB3 through the POL II-mediated chromatin conformation of TRIB3 and thus the expression of β-catenin. This promotes the proliferation and migration of CRC through β-catenin-mediated upregulation of MMP9 and VEGF. On the other hand, metabolomics revealed that Lyn/RUVBL1 regulates the expression of PGE2 through the enzyme COX2, thereby promoting arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism. CUT-Tag showed that Lyn/RUVBL1 silencing reduces the H3K27ac level in the COX2 promoter. Then, it is found that COX2 is regulated by the transcription factor FOXA1. Lyn/RUVBL1 modulates AA metabolism by regulating the chromatin accessibility of FOXA1. AA metabolism promotes the metastasis of CRC by affecting β-catenin nuclear translocation and upregulating MMP9 and VEGF. These findings suggest that the Lyn/RUVBL1 complex mediates epigenetic remodeling to regulate the metabolic reprogramming of AA, highlighting its role in promoting the metastasis of CRC.},

  abstract     = {Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is characterized by abnormal bile acid metabolites and altered gut microbiota, with no effective treatments available. Vancomycin, a glycopeptide antibiotic, has emerged as a promising candidate. However, the mechanism by which vancomycin impacts the progression of PSC remains unknown. Mice treated with vancomycin exhibit increased hepatic collagen deposition and injury, due to the inhibition of intestinal FXR-FGF15/19 axis and the elevation of bile acid levels. These effects are associated with the reduction in Clostridia XIVa , especially Clostridium scindens ( C. scindens ). Gavage of C. scindens alleviates vancomycin-induced bile acid accumulation and liver fibrosis via activating intestinal FXR-FGF15/19 signaling. Similar effects are observed in mice treated with engineered Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 that are capable of expressing bile acid 7α-dehydratas (BaiE) from C. scindens (EcN-BaiE). Activating intestinal FXR-FGF15/19 signaling by fexaramine (Fex) or recombinant protein FGF19 reverse vancomycin-induced liver injury and fibrosis. These results demonstrate that long-term oral vancomycin exacerbates cholestatic liver injury, while C. scindens mitigates this effect by activating the intestinal FXR-FGF15/19 signaling pathway. This underscores the importance of monitoring bile acid levels in PSC patients receiving vancomycin treatment and suggests that C. scindens may serve as a potential therapeutic approach for PSC patients.},

  abstract     = {Kawasaki disease (KD) is a severe acute febrile illness and systemic vasculitis that causes coronary artery aneurysms in young children. Platelet hyperreactivity and an aberrant immune response are key indicators of KD; however, the mechanism by which hyperactive platelets contribute to inflammation and vasculopathy in KD remains unclear. A cytokine-mediated positive feedback loop between KD platelets and monocytes is identified. KD platelet–monocyte aggregates (MPAs) are mediated by an initial interaction of P-selectin (cluster of differentiation 62P, CD62p) and its glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL-1). This is followed by a coordinated interaction of platelet glycoprotein (GP)Ibα with monocyte CD11b. Monocyte-activated platelets initiate transforming growth factor (TGF)β1 release, which results in nuclear localization of nuclear factor kappaB in monocytes, therefore, driving the phenotypic conversion of classical monocytes (CD14 + CD16 − ) into proinflammatory monocytes (CD14 + CD16 + ). The platelet-activated monocytes release interleukin-1 and tissue necrotic factor-α, which promote further platelet activation. KD-induced inflammation and vasculopathy are prevented by inhibiting the components of this positive feedback loop. Notably, mice deficient in platelet TGFβ1 show less MPA and CD14 + CD16 + monocytes, along with reduced inflammation and vasculopathy. These findings reveal that platelet–monocyte interactive proteins (CD62p/PSGL-1 and (GP)Ibα/CD11b) and cytokine mediators (platelet TGFβ1) are potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for KD vasculopathy.},

The HMP1G NPs responded to H + and glutathione in the TME, releasing Mn 2+ , GSNO, and 1-MT. The released Mn 2+ catalyzed the production of abundant reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide from hydrogen peroxide and GSNO, and the generated nitric oxide, synergistically with 1-MT, inhibited the accumulation of kynurenine mediated by IDO1 in the tumor. Mechanistically, HMP1G NPs downregulated tumor cell-derived IDO1 via the aryl hydrocarbon receptor/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3/interleukin signaling axis to improve kynurenine/tryptophan metabolism and immunosuppression. In a murine breast cancer model, treatment with HMP1G NPs elicited effective antitumor immunity and enhanced survival outcomes.

This mechanism manifests when light scattering from nanometer-sized clusters including a specific case of self-assembled nanostructures that form a long-range translational order but local disorder (crystal-liquid duality). In this paper, a new strategy based on both cases for the light-matter-interaction enhancement in a direct bandgap semiconductor – lead halide perovskite CsPbBr 3 – by using electric pulse-driven structural disorder, is addressed. The disordered state allows the generation of confined photons, and the formation of an electronic continuum of static/dynamic defect states across the forbidden gap (Urbach bridge). Both mechanisms underlie photon-momentum-enabled electronic Raman scattering (ERS) and single-photon anti-Stokes photoluminescence (PL) under sub-band pump. PL/ERS blinking is discussed to be associated with thermal fluctuations of cross-linked [PbBr 6 ] 4- octahedra. Time-delayed synchronization of PL/ERS blinking causes enhanced spontaneous emission at room temperature.

Here, we propose an AI-powered computational framework for accelerated and democratized patient-specific modeling of AS hemodynamics from computed tomography (CT). First, we demonstrate that the automated meshing algorithms can generate task-ready geometries for both computational and benchtop simulations with higher accuracy and 100 times faster than existing approaches. Then, we show that the approach can be integrated with fluid-structure interaction and soft robotics models to accurately recapitulate a broad spectrum of clinical hemodynamic measurements of diverse AS patients.

Large protein language models (PLMs) present excellent potential to reshape protein research by accelerating the determination of protein functions and the design of proteins with the desired functions. The prediction and design capacity of PLMs relies on the representation gained from the protein sequences. However, the lack of crucial 3D structure information in most PLMs restricts the prediction capacity of PLMs in various applications, especially those heavily dependent on 3D structures. To address this issue, S-PLM is introduced as a 3D structure-aware PLM that utilizes multi-view contrastive learning to align the sequence and 3D structure of a protein in a coordinated latent space. S-PLM applies Swin-Transformer on AlphaFold-predicted protein structures to embed the structural information and fuses it into sequence-based embedding from ESM2. Additionally, a library of lightweight tuning tools is provided to adapt S-PLM for diverse downstream protein prediction tasks. The results demonstrate S-PLM&#39;s superior performance over sequence-only PLMs on all protein clustering and classification tasks, achieving competitiveness comparable to state-of-the-art methods requiring both sequence and structure inputs. S-PLM and its lightweight tuning tools are available at https://github.com/duolinwang/S-PLM/ .},

  abstract     = {Proteases are important modulators of inflammation, but they remain understudied in material-induced immune response, which is critical to clinical success of biomedical implants. Herein, molecular expression and proteolytic activity of three distinct proteases, namely neutrophil elastase, matrix metalloproteinases, cysteine cathepsins (cathepsin-K and cathepsin-B) are comprehensively profiled, in the subcutaneous host response of immuno-competent mice against different biomaterial implants. Quantitative non-invasive monitoring with activatable fluorescent probes reveals that different microparticulate materials induce distinct levels of protease activity with degradable poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid inducing the strongest signal compared to nondegradable materials such as polystyrene and silica oxide. Furthermore, protein expression of selected proteases, attributable to both their inactive and active forms, notably deviates from their activities associated only with their active forms. Protease activity exhibits positive correlations with protein expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin 6 but negative correlation with pro-fibrotic cytokine transforming growth factor β1. This study also demonstrates the predictive utility of protease activity as a non-invasive, pro-inflammatory parameter for evaluation of the anti-inflammatory effects of model bioactive compounds on material-induced host response. Overall, the findings provide new insights into protease presence in material-induced immune responses, facilitating future biomaterial assessment to evoke appropriate host responses for implant applications.},

In this study, an implantable, modulus-tunable, and ultrasound-powered MXene/PVA hydrogel-based tumor treatment device (UP-MPH-TTD), which generates specific electromagnetic alternating fields that disrupt the mitosis of cancer cells without adversely affecting normal neurons is developed. The MXene/PVA hydrogel is used to form a tumor treatment field due to its high biocompatibility, excellent flexibility, and high conductivity, which improves ultrasonic electrical conversion efficiency and significantly reduces the size of the equipment. The implantable UP-MPH-TTD is wirelessly ultrasound-powered, small-sized, lightweight, and simply structured, significantly boosting therapeutic efficiency and reducing restrictions on patient movement. In vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed the device&#39;s therapeutic effect, demonstrating a ≈92% inhibition rate in the growth of clinical tumor cells and a 73% reduction in tumor area in tumor-bearing mice. The promising results indicate the broad application potential of the device in the treatment and prognostic improvement of GBM.},

  abstract     = {The core component of the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex, Beclin 1, takes part in different protein networks, thus switching its role from inducing autophagy to regulating autophagosomal maturation and endosomal trafficking. While assessed in neurons, astrocytes, and microglia, its role is far less investigated in myelinating glia, including Schwann cells (SCs), responsible for peripheral nerve myelination. Remarkably, the dysregulation in endosomal trafficking is emerging as a pathophysiological mechanism underlying peripheral neuropathies, such as demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) diseases. By knocking out Beclin 1 in SCs here a novel mouse model ( Becn1 cKO) is generated, developing a severe and progressive neuropathy, accompanied by involuntary tremors, body weight loss, and premature death. Ultrastructural analysis revealed abated myelination and SCs displaying enlarged cytoplasm with progressive accumulation of intracellular vesicles. Transcriptomic and histological analysis from sciatic nerves of 10-day and 2-month-old mice revealed pro-mitotic gene deregulation and increased SCs proliferation at both stages with axonal loss and increased immune infiltration in adults, well reflecting the progressive motor and sensory functional impairment that characterizes Becn1 cKO mice, compared to controls. The study establishes a further step in understanding key mechanisms in SC development and points to Beclin 1 and its regulated pathways as targets for demyelinating CMT forms.},

  abstract     = {The application of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has revolutionized the management of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). However, disease relapse and progression particularly due to persistent leukemia stem cells (LSCs) remain a big challenge in the clinic. Therefore, validation of the therapeutic vulnerability in LSCs is urgently needed. This study verifies the critical role of protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) in the maintenance of CML LSCs. It is found that PRMT1 promotes the survival and serially plating abilities of human primary CML LSCs. Genetic deletion of Prmt1 significantly delays the leukemogenesis and impairs the self-renewal of LSCs in BCR-ABL – driven CML mice. PRMT1 regulates LSCs and leukemia development depending on its methyltransferase activity. Pharmacological inhibition of PRMT1 activity by MS023 remarkably eliminates LSCs and prolongs the survival of CML mice. Mechanistical studies reveal that PRMT1 promotes transcriptional activation of ribosomal protein L29 (RPL29) via catalyzing asymmetric dimethylation of histone H4R3 (H4R3me2a) at its gene promoter region. PRMT1 augments the global protein synthesis via RPL29 in CML LSCs. Taken together, the findings provide new evidence that histone arginine methylation modification regulates protein synthesis in LSCs and highlight PRMT1 as a valuable druggable target for patients with CML.},

The active layers are mats of P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE)-based nanofibers, embedded in an elastomeric matrix of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The electrodes are made of a mixture of carbon black and PDMS, bonded to the active layers by electrostatic adhesion force. The effects of the nanofibers in the soft actuators are investigated. Specimens of the soft actuator are realized that differ in the thickness of the nanofibrous mats used for the active layers, that is, 60 and 120 μm. An electromechanical characterization is performed to analyze and measure the axial force and axial displacements of the soft actuators when different electric fields are applied to the specimens in the transversal direction. The experimental results show that the presence of P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE)-based nanofibers enhances the force-to-weight ratio of the soft actuators by up to 43.5%, and the energy density by up to 12.9%, compared to a control specimen with the active layer made of PDMS only.},

Wood as a substrate reduces processing steps and enables the integration of intelligent functionalities in wooden furniture, offering biodegradability, nontoxicity, and derivation from renewable sources. In this work, sustainably printed transistors using zinc oxide nanoparticles as the active layer and honey electrolyte on wood substrates are demonstrated as a promising approach to reduce the environmental footprint of electronics. Despite the substrate&#39;s high roughness, the transistor exhibits excellent performance for screen-printed devices, with low on-voltage of 0.32 ± 0.12 V and high I on /I off of (2.4 ± 0.9) × 10 4 . Further analysis of hysteresis in transfer curves under varying scan rates and sweep ranges reveals the device&#39;s ability to adjust memory windows and on-current. Notably, these devices successfully emulate synapses, exhibiting neural facilitation and plasticity, indicating a shift toward sustainable computing. The device&#39;s dynamic response to single and successive presynaptic pulses demonstrates its ability to adjust synaptic weight, transition from transient to persistent memory, and pulse width-, frequency-, voltage-, and number-dependent excitatory postsynaptic currents. The successful emulation of the learning–forgetting–relearning–forgetting process underscores the device&#39;s potential for use in sustainable high-performance neuromorphic systems.},

  abstract     = {For energy- and time-efficient artificial intelligence (AI) computing, implementing hardware-based spiking neural networks (SNNs) has become a core technology. In SNNs, synaptic devices store weights in memory, and neurons process received weighted information and generate spike signals. Upon feeding spike signals into synaptic arrays, the synaptic weights multiply the signals, which subsequently sum up to perform vector-matrix multiplication (VMM). Simultaneous access to multiple synaptic devices, however, reduces the equivalent resistance of these synaptic arrays. This reduction alters the voltage division between the pre-synaptic array and the input resistance of the neuron circuit, distorting the read voltage across synaptic devices. This phenomenon is known as the fan-in problem, which leads to non-ideal VMM operations and degrades system accuracy. To address this issue, a novel compensated current mirror (CCM) neuron circuit is proposed, which incorporates a single additional transistor into a conventional current mirror. This CCM neuron achieves exceptional current linearity ( R 2 &gt; 0.999) and efficiently compensates for VMM error with low complexity and energy consumption (3.33 pJ spike −1 ). Furthermore, the CCM neuron demonstrates ≈7-%p higher inference accuracy than conventional ones when integrated with a 512 × 512 large-scale synaptic array, which is comparable to the accuracy of software-based SNNs.},

On the other hand, visually impaired users rely on tactile displays as one of the key communication devices to interact with the digital world. However, due to their working mechanism and the uneven surface of tactile displays, one of the key features of screens for sighted users is surprisingly challenging to implement: precision touch input. To overcome this, a hand gesture recognition system is developed using a frequency-modulated continuous wave millimeter-wave radar. A multifeature encoder method is used to obtain the range and velocity information from the radar to translate the data into spectrogram images. Gesture recognition is implemented for common input gestures: single/double-click, swipe-right/left, scroll-up/down, zoom-in/out, and rotate-anticlockwise/clockwise. The gesture recognition and classification are based on machine learning, support vector machines, deep learning, and convolutional neural network approaches. The chosen model You-Only-Look-Once (YOLOv8) shows a high accuracy of 97.1% by iterating only 30 epochs with only 500 collected data samples per gesture. This research paves the way toward using radar sensors not only for tactile displays but also for other digital devices in human–computer interaction.},

  abstract     = {Fluidic control systems target unique applications where conventional electronics fail. However, current fluidic control systems face challenges in accessible fabrication, reproducibility, and modifiable characteristics such as operating pressure and instability count. Herein, fused deposition-modeled compliant mechanisms with flexing beams and soft linear actuators for fluid switching and the control of soft robotic systems are introduced. A linear actuator switches a compliant mechanism to cut off airflow through off-the-shelf tubing. The modular compliant logic devices can be configured as normally open or normally closed switches, as NOT, AND, and OR gates, and as nonvolatile memory elements. Their use is demonstrated in controlling a fluidic stepper motor, a worm-like robot, and a fluidic display. These fluidic switches are printable using inexpensive desktop 3D printers, can be reliably reproduced in large quantities, and offer a wide range of modifiable parameters, including scalability, adaptability in operating pressure, and the tunability of instability counts for computational and memory functions.},

  abstract     = {Switchable surface adhesion at a small scale is crucial for robot end-effector design, allowing the manipulation of small objects such as semiconductors, optical lenses, and precision mechanical parts. In this work, a detailed characterization of a millimeter-scale (1–5 mm) adhesion modulation method is performed, demonstrating its effectiveness for switching adhesion on small, lightweight objects with smooth surfaces. This modulation phenomenon arises from the viscoelastic behavior when PDMS interacts with a rigid surface and is controlled via microvibration. A maximum apparent adhesion enhancement of 2400% and a reduction of 50% are achieved with a 1 mm-diameter PDMS hemisphere vibrating at a 30 μm amplitude and a 700 Hz frequency. The effects of different parameters, including size, actuation amplitude/frequency, surface roughness, and material properties, on adhesion performance are carefully measured and analyzed. A monotonic increase in maximum adhesion is observed with increased device size and surface smoothness, while nonlinear relationships of other factors are generalized with a numerical model. A long working lifespan and high endurance are also observed during the characterization. This work serves as a practical reference for the further design of small-scale soft grippers, highlighting its continuous, large modulation range, simple structure, and flexible control.},

Hodgkin–Huxley (H–H) neurons based on memristors feature great merits of high bio-plausibility and low hardware cost. However, a universal design rule of memristive H–H neurons is still lacking, hindering its development and applications. Herein, a universal H–H neuron circuit structure is proposed and its feasibility based on NbO x memristors is demonstrated. The constructed neuron achieves 23 types of firing behaviors observed in biological neurons, simplifying the communication between neurons. To better understand the correlation between circuit parameters and firing patterns, the firing patterns into three classes according to the switching cycle ratio of two memristors are categorized. The circuit design rules of each category of firing patterns are deeply elucidated and universal regularities for tuning circuit parameters to implement the switch between different firing behaviors are presented. Finally, the potential applications of different firing behaviors in neuromorphic intelligence systems are discussed. This work provides theoretical guidance for engineering memristive H–H neuron circuits, assisting in building high-order neuromorphic systems based on firing patterns.},

However, existing systems have been limited to a single or a few sensors in parallel, so they are not comparable to the state-of-the-art electrical resistive and capacitive touchpads, which can detect rich tactile information, including touch location, pressure, area, and even multiple touches simultaneously. This work reports a soft micropneumatic touchpad. The touchpad consists of 32 pneumatic channels inside soft elastomer, with 16 channels aligned row-wise and 16 column-wise. The flow resistance of each channel is measured using a pressure divider. When the pad is touched, the cross-sectional area of the channels close to the contact location deforms, which changes the flow resistance of those channels. With 32 sensing channels, the location, depth, area of the contact, and even two simultaneous touches can be detected. Letters hand-written on the touchpad can be reconstructed from the measured data. With the assumption of sparsity, a tactile pressure map, with a value at each 16 × 16 grid point, can also be reconstructed. This work opens a path to replace electronic tactile sensors in soft devices with all-fluidic alternatives.},

  abstract     = {This article presents an extended Cartesian space robot control framework that features a virtual force tracking impedance control to enhance the end-effector trajectory tracking performance. Initially, the concept of a virtual surface is introduced, which is assumed to be at some constant distance from the desired end-effector trajectory. This virtual surface generates a virtual contact force when interacting with the torque-controlled robot end-effector. The interaction is then manipulated using an impedance control model to track a constant desired force. If the robot end-effector deviates from the desired trajectory, the constant force-tracking impedance control generates a compliance trajectory that regulates the end-effector movements, constraining it to the desired trajectory. For robust force tracking, impedance parameters are optimally tuned using a closed-loop dynamic model incorporating both robot and impedance dynamics. Additionally, super twisting sliding mode control (STSMC) is integrated to overcome uncertainties and the impact of robot dynamics on force-tracking performance. Experimental validation confirms the theoretical claims of the proposed approach. It demonstrates that force-tracking impedance control improves the end-effector trajectory tracking by quickly reacting to the dynamic trajectories compared to position control only and effectively maintains it on the desired trajectories.},

Two important process parameters are optimized to show the best characteristics; overlap height ( H ov ) and channel pillar height ( H ch ). An OCI-GSSP device that has an aspect ratio of 10 and the minimal overlap height shows the highest C on / C off over 5 in 40 nm wordline and BL pitch. It is the highest value and the smallest unit device size among the capacitive synapses that have been reported up to now.

By collaborating across multiple institutions, the study seeks to develop models that allow rapid online estimation of organ doses, eliminating the need for complex organ segmentation. Researchers delineate skin outlines from chest CT images obtained from two different institutions. Radiomics features are extracted from the chest CT data and skin contours. Organ doses are computed using Monte Carlo simulations as reference organ doses. Single- and cross-institutional support vector regression (SVR) models are trained with radiomics features to predict organ doses from chest CT scans. Model performance is assessed using metrics like maean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and R -squared ( R 2 ). For chest organs (lungs, heart, spinal cord, trachea, and esophagus), single-institutional SVR models achieve MAPE values ranging from 4.72% to 15.31% and R 2 values from 0.73 to 0.93. Cross-institutional models have MAPE values in the range of 2.16–7.49% and R 2 values from 0.84 to 0.99. SVR models trained with radiomics features from skin outlines can reliably estimate organ doses from chest CT scans.

They offer promising advantages, namely, a high dynamic range, low latency, and minimal motion blur. Modern computer vision algorithms often rely on artificial neural network approaches, which require image-like representations of the data and cannot fully exploit the characteristics of event data. Herein, approaches to action recognition based on the Fourier transform are proposed. The approaches are intended to recognize oscillating motion patterns commonly present in nature. In particular, the approaches are applied to a recent dataset of breeding penguins annotated for “ecstatic display,” a behavior where the observed penguins flap their wings at a certain frequency. It is found that the approaches are both simple and effective, producing slightly lower results than a deep neural network (DNN) while relying just on a tiny fraction of the parameters compared to the DNN (five orders of magnitude fewer parameters). They work well despite the uncontrolled, diverse data present in the dataset. It is hoped that this work opens a new perspective on event-based processing and action recognition.},

Linearized confidence-weighted (LCW) learning is the first online learning algorithm introducing the concept of weight confidence into the prediction model through distributions over weights. It provides the flexibility for weights to update their values at different scales. The kernel trick in machine learning can be applied to LCW for a better prediction performance. However, the kernel-based LCW algorithm is subject to the curse of kernelization which makes it vulnerable to the unlimited growth of the prediction model in runtime and memory consumption. In this study, we present the budgeted LCW (BLCW) algorithm which puts a limit on the growth by a predefined budget with optimization. Consequently, BLCW performs the LCW update and then reduces the information loss by projection. Based on the resource perspective that reinterprets LCW in terms of resources and utilization degrees, we demonstrated that BLCW approximates the kernel-based LCW algorithm. We evaluate four budget maintenance strategies and suggest that the mean removal is the most stable. By various numerical experiments on real datasets, we demonstrate that BLCW performs competitively and effectively when compared to leading budgeted online algorithms.},

To investigate if artificial muscles can mimic (i.e. biomimetic) the complete mechanical state spectrum of biological muscles, this study uses a novel method to characterize twisted coiled polymer actuators (TCPAs) mechanically. Thus, comprehensive and reproducible test procedures are established to verify artificial muscle biomimetics regarding stress, strain, and strain rate combinations intrinsic to biological muscle. A rheometer performs novel high-precision mechanical characterization methods to comprehensively verify biomimetic performance. Sample twist level, torque, length, force, and temperature are controlled and measured during twist-induced coiling, heatsetting/annealing, and mechanical testing. TCPAs are formed from linear low-density polyethylene monofilament. Linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) TCPAs generate larger stresses than biological muscle through the entire spectrum of strains—contracting more than 40%, exerting more than 0.3 MPa at rest length, and withstanding tension of 8 MPa without damage. Thus, the LLDPE TCPAs attain biological muscle performance statically, but additional tests are required to assess this dynamically. The mechanical performance of LLDPE TCPAs enables biomimetic actuation with an intelligent control and measurement system. Their high-throughput textile manufacturability positions them for advanced biomechatronic applications—including prosthetics and exoskeletons.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a biomechanics-based, user-adaptive variable impedance controller designed to enhance the performance of coupled human–robot systems during motion. The controller integrates the biomechanical characteristics of human limbs and dynamically adjusts the robotic impedance parameters—specifically damping, stiffness, and equilibrium trajectory—based on real-time estimations of the user&#39;s intent and direction of motion. The primary goal is to minimize the energy expenditure of the coupled human–robot system while maintaining system passivity. To address uncertainties in human behavior and noisy observations, the controller employs Bayesian optimization combined with a Gaussian process. To validate the proposed approach, human experiments are conducted using a standard robotic arm manipulator. The results demonstrate that the controller eliminates the need for manual parameter tuning, a process that is typically time-consuming. A comparative analysis against two variable impedance controllers without user-adaptive parameter adjustments reveal significant benefits, with the controller improving combined performance metrics—such as accuracy, speed, user effort, and smoothness—by over 13%. Notably, all participants in the study preferred the optimized controller over the alternatives. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the biomechanics-based, user-adaptive variable impedance control approach and its potential to enhance physical human–robot interaction in various applications that involve repetitive or continuous motion.},

Carnivorous plants feed by trapping insects, sunflowers grow by following the sun, and pine cones control the dispersal of their seeds under optimal conditions. This comprehensive review first analyses the mechanisms responsible for these adaptive movements highlighting the need for a gradient in one of the physico-chemical properties to enable morphing. Next, the main synthetic shape-changing soft systems are presented in terms of their mechanism of action. A gradient in water-swelling, magneto-rheological properties, residual deformation, or extensibility gives hygromorphs, magnetomorphs, mechanomorphs, and baromorphs, respectively. The various morphing triggers, namely light, heat, pH, tensile stress, pressure, electric, and magnetic fields, are described. The opportunities and challenges of each system are put into perspective. This report aims to provide the reader with a toolbox for designing shape-changing materials considering the targeted trigger, as well as providing a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms paving the way for future discoveries.},

However, most existing research in this area focuses on shape control for a provided explicit goal and does not consider physical constraints, which limits its applicability in many real-world scenarios. In this study, a self-supervised planning and control approach are proposed to address the challenge of rearranging deformable linear objects for implicit goals. Specifically, the context of making both ends of the object reachable (inside the robotic access range) and graspable (outside potential collision regions) by dual-arm robots is considered. Firstly, the object is described with sequential keypoints and the correspondence-based action is parameterized. Secondly, a generator capable of producing multiple explicit targets is developed, which adhere to implicit conditions. Thirdly, value models are learnt to assign the most promising explicit target as guidance and determine the goal-conditioned action. All models within the policy are trained in a self-supervised manner based on data collected from simulations. Importantly, the learned policy can be directly applied to real-world settings since we do not rely on accurate dynamic models. The performance of the new method is validated with simulations and real-world experiments.},

The magnetic elastomer is produced by combining NdFeB powders with a diameter of 5 μm into silicone, following a weight ratio of 50%, and then magnetized using 2D Halbach-array magnets. Simulation results reveal the capability to adjust magnetic field strength and distribution by altering the magnet&#39;s orientation. The sensor&#39;s efficacy in 3-axis sensing is validated through calibration with a linear model, achieving a good root-mean-square error below 0.7 N in force measurement. The H-PME sensor, with a thickness of merely 4.5 mm, can detect forces up to 50 N. It&#39;s simple 3-layer design allows the thickness to be reduced to as low as 2 mm, while also offering ease of replacement. Crucially, crosstalk evaluation experiments show that the proposed H-PME sensor can dramatically mitigate crosstalk interference.},

A microheater is fabricated using an array of laser-scribed micro-wires and an autonomous robotic module, allowing for rapid and uniform heat transfer in less than 3 s. The integrated robotic microheater successfully (100%) eradicates household ants at 60 °C within 30 s. Such results significantly advance insect control, reducing treatment time from hours to seconds while attenuating chemical insecticides’ critical safety and health risks.

One critical problem that restricts their industrial application is the lack of scalable fabrication techniques due to the limitation of conventional machine tools. This study proposes a scalable surface texturing technique using a portable small (30 × 19 × 22 mm) three-leg robot that walks and works on the workpiece surface. Due to the elliptical tool vibration, microgrooves can be created on the workpiece surface periodically; meanwhile, the machining force drives the robot to walk forward. Surface texturing experiments are conducted on aluminum and copper workpieces to explore the machining performance of the small robot. The robot can reach a maximum moving velocity of 6.3 mm s −1 and can produce microstructures with a spacing of 4–14 μm on workpiece surfaces. Owing to its unique working principle, the small robot can maintain a constant depth of cut, demonstrating its capacity to adapt to the surface waviness of the workpiece. Finally, the motion straightness of the robot is greatly improved by combining it with the auxiliary track, and multiline microstructures are obtained. In short, the developed small robot presents a promising solution to the challenge of scalable surface texturing.},

In this paper, with the goal of establishing the validity and acceptability of modern high-tech medical devices that generate functional data, we focus on the problem of assessing agreement of multiple functional data that are measured on the same subjects by different methods/technologies/raters. Specifically, we introduce a series of unscaled indices, total deviation index (TDI) and coverage probability (CP), that themselves are functions of time and can delineate the trends of intramethod, intermethod, and total (intra+inter) agreement of functional data across time in terms of the original measurement scale. We also develop scalar-valued TDI and CP indices that summarize the degree of agreement over the entire domain based on the weighted average idea. We advocate an experimental design under which each of the two methods generates replicated functional data measurements for each subject, and express each index using a mean function and variance components of a bivariate multilevel functional linear mixed effects model. Such a formulation allows us to smoothly estimate the indices based on our bivariate multilevel functional principal component analysis approach that only requires eigenanalyses of univariate covariance functions for better efficiency and scalability. Comprehensive simulation studies are conducted to examine the finite-sample properties of the estimators. The proposed method is applied to assess the reliability and reproducibility of renogram curves generated by diuresis renography, a high-tech medical imaging device widely used to detect kidney obstruction.},

One useful summary measure of the recurrent event process is the mean number of events. Methods for estimating the mean number of events exist and are readily implemented for situations in which the recurrent event is the only possible outcome. However, estimation gets more challenging in the competing risk setting, in which methods are so far limited to nonparametric approaches. To this end, we propose a postestimation command for estimating the mean number of events in the presence of competing risks by jointly modeling the intensity function of the recurrent event and the survival function for the competing events. The proposed method is implemented in the R-package JointFPM which is available on CRAN. Simulations demonstrate low bias and good coverage in scenarios where the intensity of the recurrent event does not depend on the number of previous events. We illustrate our method using data on readmissions after colorectal cancer surgery included in the frailtypack package for R. Estimates of the mean number of events can be used to augment time-to-event analyses when both recurrent and competing events exist. The proposed parametric approach offers estimation of a smooth function across time as well as easy estimation of different contrasts which is not available using a nonparametric approach.},

The availability of individual participant data (IPD) makes it possible to evaluate treatment effect moderation and to draw inferences about treatment effects by taking the full utilization of individual covariates from multiple clinical trials. In IPD-NMA, restricted mean survival time (RMST) models have gained popularity when analyzing time-to-event outcomes because RMST models offer more straightforward interpretations of treatment effects with fewer assumptions than hazard ratios commonly estimated from Cox models. Existing approaches estimate RMST within each study and then combine by using aggregate-level NMA methods. However, these methods cannot incorporate individual covariates to evaluate the effect moderation. In this paper, we propose advanced RMST NMA models when IPD are available. Our models allow us to study treatment effect moderation and provide a comprehensive understanding about comparative effectiveness of treatments and subgroup effects. The methods are evaluated by an extensive simulation study and illustrated using a real NMA example about treatments for patients with atrial fibrillation.},

  abstract     = {Variable selection is an important step in the analysis of high-dimensional data, yet there are limited options for survival outcomes in the presence of competing risks. Commonly employed penalized Cox regression considers each event type separately through cause-specific models, neglecting possibly shared information between them. We adapt the feature-weighted elastic net (fwelnet), an elastic net generalization, to survival outcomes and competing risks. For two causes, our proposed algorithm fits two alternating cause-specific models, where each model receives the coefficient vector of the complementary model as prior information. We dub this “cooperative penalized regression,” as it enables the modeling of competing risk data with cause-specific models while accounting for shared effects between causes. Coefficients that are shrunken toward zero in the model for the first cause will receive larger penalization weights in the model for the second cause and vice versa. Through multiple iterations, this process ensures stronger penalization of uninformative predictors in both models. We demonstrate our method&#39;s variable selection capabilities on simulated genomics data and apply it to bladder cancer microarray data. We evaluate selection performance using the positive predictive value for the correct selection of informative features and the false positive rate for the selection of uninformative variables. The benchmark compares results with cause-specific penalized Cox regression, random survival forests, and likelihood-boosted Cox regression. Results indicate that our approach is more effective at selecting informative features and removing uninformative features. In settings without shared effects, variable selection performance is similar to cause-specific penalized Cox regression.},

In recent years, there is increasing research interest in mediation analysis with survival data. The existing literature usually requires accurate measurements of the mediator and the confounders, which is infeasible in many biomedical and social science studies. Ignoring measurement errors may lead to misleading inference results. Furthermore, the current identification results of causal effects under the additive hazards model are limited to the scenario with no exposure–mediator interaction, which can be unappealing in mediation analysis. In this paper, we derive the identification results of direct and indirect effects under the additive hazards model in the presence of exposure–mediator interaction. Furthermore, we propose a corrected approach to adjust for the impact of measurement error in the mediator and the confounders and obtain consistent estimations of the direct and indirect effects.

  abstract     = {Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) approaches for meta-analysis have been developed to relax distributional assumptions and handle the heterogeneity of random effects distributions. These models account for possible clustering and multimodality of the random effects distribution. However, when we combine studies of varying quality, the resulting posterior is not only a combination of the results of interest but also factors threatening the integrity of the studies&#39; results. We refer to these factors as the studies&#39; internal validity biases (e.g., reporting bias, data quality, and patient selection bias). In this paper, we introduce a new meta-analysis model called the bias-corrected Bayesian nonparametric (BC-BNP) model, which aims to automatically correct for internal validity bias in meta-analysis by only using the reported effects and their standard errors. The BC-BNP model is based on a mixture of a parametric random effects distribution, which represents the model of interest, and a BNP model for the bias component. This model relaxes the parametric assumptions of the bias distribution of the model introduced by Verde. Using simulated data sets, we evaluate the BC-BNP model and illustrate its applications with two real case studies. Our results show several potential advantages of the BC-BNP model: (1) It can detect bias when present while producing results similar to a simple normal–normal random effects model when bias is absent. (2) Relaxing the parametric assumptions of the bias component does not affect the model of interest and yields consistent results with the model of Verde. (3) In some applications, a BNP model of bias offers a better understanding of the studies&#39; biases by clustering studies with similar biases. We implemented the BC-BNP model in the R package jarbes, facilitating its practical application.},

  abstract     = {Correct measurement results from in vitro diagnostic (IVD) medical devices (MD) are crucial for optimal patient care. The performance of IVD-MDs is often assessed through method comparison studies. Such studies can be compromised by the influence of various factors. The effect of these factors must be examined in every method comparison study, for example, nonselectivity differences between compared IVD-MDs are examined. Historically, selectivity or nonselectivity has been defined as a qualitative term. However, a quantification of nonselectivity differences between IVD-MDs is needed. This paper fills this need by introducing a novel measure for quantifying differences in nonselectivity (DINS) between a pair of IVD-MDs. Assuming one of the IVD-MDs involved in the comparison exhibits high selectivity for the analyte, it becomes feasible to quantify nonselectivity in the other IVD-MD by employing this DINS measure. Our approach leverages elements from univariate ordinary least squares regression and incorporates repeatability IVD-MD variances, resulting in a normalized measure. We also introduce a plug-in estimator for this measure, which is notably linked to the average relative increase in prediction interval widths attributable to DINS. This connection is exploited to establish a criterion for identifying excessive DINS utilizing a proof-of-hazard approach. Utilizing Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate how the estimator relates to population characteristics like DINS and heteroskedasticity. We find that DINS impacts the mean, variance, and 99th percentile of the estimator, while heteroskedasticity affects only the latter two, and to a considerably smaller extent compared to DINS. Importantly, the size of the study design modulates these effects. We also confirm, when using clinical data, that DINS between pairs of IVD-MDs influence the estimator correspondingly to those of simulated data. Thus, the proposed estimator serves as an effective metric for quantifying DINS between IVD-MDs and helping to determine the quality of a method comparison study.},

  abstract     = {Despite the extensive use of network autocorrelation models in social network analysis, network autocorrelation models for binary dependent variables have received surprisingly scant attention. In this paper, we develop four network autocorrelation models for a binary random variable defined by whether the peer effect (also termed social influence or contagion) acts on latent continuous outcomes leading to an indirect effect under a normal or a logistic distribution or on the probability of the observed outcome itself under a probit or a logit link function defining a direct effect to account for interdependence between outcomes. For all models, we use a Bayesian approach for model estimation under a uniform prior on a transformed peer effect parameter ( ) designed to enhance model computation and compare results to those under the uniform prior for . We use simulation to assess the performance of Bayesian point and interval estimators for each of the four models when the model that generated the data is used for estimation (precision assessment) and when each of the other three models instead generated the data (robustness assessment). We construct a United States New England region patient-sharing hospital network and apply the four network autocorrelation models to study the adoption of robotic surgery, a new medical technology, among hospitals using a cohort of United States Medicare beneficiaries in 2016 and 2017. Finally, we develop a deviance information criterion for each of the four models to compare their fit to the observed data and use posterior predictive p -values to assess the models&#39; ability to recover specified features of the data. The results find that although the indirect peer effect of the propensity of peer hospital adoption on that of the focal hospital is positive under both latent response autocorrelation models, the direct peer effect of the peer hospital&#39;s probability of adopting robotic surgery on the probability of the focal hospital adopting robotic surgery decreases under both mean autocorrelation data models. However, neither of these associations is statistically significant.},

  abstract     = {We propose a novel method to adjust for unmeasured time-stable confounding when the time between consecutive treatment administrations is fixed. We achieve this by focusing on a new-user cohort. Furthermore, we envisage that all time-stable confounding goes through the potential time on treatment as dictated by the disease condition at the initiation of treatment. Following this logic, we may eliminate all unmeasured time-stable confounding by adjusting for the potential time on treatment. A challenge with this approach is that right censoring of the potential time on treatment occurs when treatment is terminated at the time of the event of interest, for example, if the event of interest is death. We show how this challenge may be solved by means of the expectation-maximization algorithm without imposing any further assumptions on the distribution of the potential time on treatment. The usefulness of the methodology is illustrated in a simulation study. We also apply the methodology to investigate the effect of depression/anxiety drugs on subsequent poisoning by other medications in the Danish population by means of national registries. We find a protective effect of treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors on the risk of poisoning by various medications (1- year risk difference of approximately ) and a standard Cox model analysis shows a harming effect (1-year risk difference of approximately ), which is consistent with what we would expect due to confounding by indication. Unmeasured time-stable confounding can be entirely adjusted for when the time between consecutive treatment administrations is fixed.},

This paper focuses on finding the required sample size to achieve a desired level of statistical power when treatments are continued to be tested even after a superior treatment has already been found. This may be of interest if there are treatments from different sponsors which are also superior to the current control or multiple doses being tested. The calculations to determine the expected sample size is given. A motivating trial is presented in which the sample size of different configurations is studied.

We generally evaluate it on baseline covariates, but rarely on longitudinal ones prior to a management decision. We could use pointwise standardized mean differences, standardized differences of slopes, or weights from the model for such purpose. Pointwise differences could be cumbersome for densely sampled longitudinal markers and/or measured at different points. Slopes are suitable for linear or transformable models but not for more complex curves. Weights do not identify the specific covariate(s) responsible for imbalances. This work presents the Fréchet distance as a viable alternative to assess balance of time-dependent covariates. A set of linear and nonlinear curves for which their standardized difference or differences in functional parameters were within 10% sought to identify the Fréchet distance equivalent to this threshold. This threshold is dependent on the level of noise present and thus within group heterogeneity and error variance are needed for its interpretation. Applied to a set of real curves representing the monthly trajectory of hemoglobin A1c from diabetic patients showed that the curves in the two groups were not balanced at the 10% mark. A Beta distribution represents the Fréchet distance distribution reasonably well in most scenarios. This assessment of covariate balance provides the following advantages: It can handle curves of different lengths, shapes, and arbitrary time points. Future work includes examining the utility of this measure under within-series missingness, within-group heterogeneity, its comparison with other approaches, and asymptotics.},

To combine them, we investigate deep learning techniques for obtaining a joint latent representation, to which the items of different measurement instruments are mapped. This corresponds to domain adaptation, an established concept in computer science for image data. Using the proposed approach as an example, we evaluate the potential of domain adaptation in a longitudinal cohort setting with a rather small number of time points, motivated by an application with different motor function measurement instruments in a registry of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) patients. There, we model trajectories in the latent representation by ordinary differential equations (ODEs), where person-specific ODE parameters are inferred from baseline characteristics. The goodness of fit and complexity of the ODE solutions then allow to judge the measurement instrument mappings. We subsequently explore how alignment can be improved by incorporating corresponding penalty terms into model fitting. To systematically investigate the effect of differences between measurement instruments, we consider several scenarios based on modified SMA data, including scenarios where a mapping should be feasible in principle and scenarios where no perfect mapping is available. While misalignment increases in more complex scenarios, some structure is still recovered, even if the availability of measurement instruments depends on patient state. A reasonable mapping is feasible also in the more complex real SMA data set. These results indicate that domain adaptation might be more generally useful in statistical modeling for longitudinal registry data.},

In this paper, we introduce goodness-of-fit procedures for a regression model when the response variable is doubly truncated. With this purpose, a marked empirical process based on weighted residuals is constructed and its weak convergence is established. Kolmogorov–Smirnov– and Cramér–von Mises–type tests are consequently derived from such core process, and a bootstrap approximation for their practical implementation is given.

In this paper, we propose a score test and a Wald test to examine the informativeness of the cluster sizes for a generalized linear model, a Cox model, and a proportional subdistribution hazards model. Statistical inference can be conducted through weighted estimating equations. The simulation results show that both tests control Type I error rates well, but the score test has higher power than the Wald test for right-censored data while the power of the Wald test is generally higher than the score test for the binary outcome.

  abstract     = {When planning an oncology clinical trial, the usual approach is to assume proportional hazards and even an exponential distribution for time-to-event endpoints. Often, besides the gold-standard endpoint overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) is considered as a second confirmatory endpoint. We use a survival multistate model to jointly model these two endpoints and find that neither exponential distribution nor proportional hazards will typically hold for both endpoints simultaneously. The multistate model provides a stochastic process approach to model the dependency of such endpoints neither requiring latent failure times nor explicit dependency modeling such as copulae. We use the multistate model framework to simulate clinical trials with endpoints OS and PFS and show how design planning questions can be answered using this approach. In particular, nonproportional hazards for at least one of the endpoints are a consequence of OS and PFS being dependent and are naturally modeled to improve planning. We then illustrate how clinical trial design can be based on simulations from a multistate model. Key applications are coprimary endpoints and group-sequential designs. Simulations for these applications show that the standard simplifying approach may very well lead to underpowered or overpowered clinical trials. Our approach is quite general and can be extended to more complex trial designs, further endpoints, and other therapeutic areas. An R package is available on CRAN.},

  abstract     = {Gene set analysis, a popular approach for analyzing high-throughput gene expression data, aims to identify sets of genes that show enriched expression patterns between two conditions. In addition to the multitude of methods available for this task, users are typically left with many options when creating the required input and specifying the internal parameters of the chosen method. This flexibility can lead to uncertainty about the “right” choice, further reinforced by a lack of evidence-based guidance. Especially when their statistical experience is scarce, this uncertainty might entice users to produce preferable results using a “trial-and-error” approach. While it may seem unproblematic at first glance, this practice can be viewed as a form of “cherry-picking” and cause an optimistic bias, rendering the results nonreplicable on independent data. After this problem has attracted a lot of attention in the context of classical hypothesis testing, we now aim to raise awareness of such overoptimism in the different and more complex context of gene set analyses. We mimic a hypothetical researcher who systematically selects the analysis variants yielding their preferred results, thereby considering three distinct goals they might pursue. Using a selection of popular gene set analysis methods, we tweak the results in this way for two frequently used benchmark gene expression data sets. Our study indicates that the potential for overoptimism is particularly high for a group of methods frequently used despite being commonly criticized. We conclude by providing practical recommendations to counter overoptimism in research findings in gene set analysis and beyond.},

  abstract     = {The selection of best variables is a challenging problem in supervised and unsupervised learning, especially in high-dimensional contexts where the number of variables is usually much larger than the number of observations. In this paper, we focus on two multivariate statistical methods: principal components analysis and partial least squares. Both approaches are popular linear dimension-reduction methods with numerous applications in several fields including in genomics, biology, environmental science, and engineering. In particular, these approaches build principal components, new variables that are combinations of all the original variables. A main drawback of principal components is the difficulty to interpret them when the number of variables is large. To define principal components from the most relevant variables, we propose to cast the best subset solution path method into principal component analysis and partial least square frameworks. We offer a new alternative by exploiting a continuous optimization algorithm for best subset solution path. Empirical studies show the efficacy of our approach for providing the best subset solution path. The usage of our algorithm is further exposed through the analysis of two real data sets. The first data set is analyzed using the principle component analysis while the analysis of the second data set is based on partial least square framework.},

We have collected 5856 chest x-ray images that are labeled as either “pneumonia” or “normal” from a public forum. Before applying the DeepPneuNet model, a necessary feature extraction and feature mapping have been done on the input images. Conv2D layers with a 1 × 1 kernel size are followed by ReLU activation functions to make up the model. These layers are in charge of recognizing important patterns and features in the images. A MaxPooling 2D procedure is applied to minimize the spatial size of the feature maps after every two Conv2D layers. The sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function trains the model, and the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 is used to optimize it. The DeepPneuNet provides 90.12% accuracy for diagnosis of the Pneumonia infection for a set of real-life test images. With 9,445,586 parameters, the DeepPneuNet model exhibits excellent parameter efficiency. DeepPneuNet is a more lightweight and computationally efficient alternative when compared to the other pre-trained models. We have compared accuracies for predicting Pneumonia diagnosis of our proposed DeepPneuNet model with some state-of-the-art deep learning models. The proposed DeepPneuNet model is more advantageous than the existing state-of-the-art learning models for Pneumonia diagnosis with respect to accuracy, precision, recall, F -score, training parameters, and training execution time.},

In this case, diverse imaging approaches are aided in the detection process of stones in the kidney. Moreover, the specialist acquires better diagnosis and interpretation of this image. Here, computer-aided techniques are considered the practical techniques, which it is used as the auxiliary tool for the process of diagnosis. Most urologists have failed to train the type of kidney stone identification effectively and it is operator-dependent. Concerning the surgical operation, there is a requirement for accurate as well as adequate detection of stone position in the kidney. Thus, it has made the detection process even more difficult. To overcome the challenging issues, an effective detection model for kidney stones using classifiers. Initially, the input images are collected from the standard resources. Further, the input images are subjected to the adaptive multi-convolutional neural network with attention mechanism (AMC-AM) feature fusion model, in which, the pertinent features are extracted from the three networks: Visual Geometry Group16 (VGG16), Residual Network (ResNet), and Inception net. Thus, the three distinct features are obtained for the feature fusion procedure. Finally, the resultant features are subjected as input to the final layer of CNN. In the proposed network, the model is integrated with the attention mechanism and also the parameter tuning is done by proposing the modified social distance of coronavirus mask protection algorithm (MSD-CMPA). Therefore, the performance is examined using different metrics and compared with other baseline models. Hence, the proposed model overwhelms the outstanding results in detecting the kidney stones that aid the individual in getting rid of kidney disorders.},

This paper presents a comprehensive approach to the classification of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) leveraging a dataset comprising 1140 single-cell images sourced from Herlev. In addition to that, in this work, a new ensemble model based on the transfer-learning (TL) technique is developed on various deep learning models, including DenseNet121, DenseNet169, InceptionResNet, XceptionNet, ResNet50, and ResNet101 to demonstrate their efficacy in classifying diverse cellular features. To evaluate our proposed approach&#39;s performance, the ensemble approach&#39;s results are compared with some transfer learning models such as DenseNet121, DenseNet169, InceptionResNet, XceptionNet, ResNet50, and ResNet101. The experimental results demonstrate that transfer learning-based deep neural networks combined with ensemble methods enhance the diagnostic accuracy of SCC classification systems, achieving 98% accuracy across various cell types. This further validates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. A comprehensive investigation yields a precise and efficient model for SCC classification, offering detailed insights into both normal and abnormal cell types.},

Traditional methods like radar and acoustic sensors face limitations in noisy environments, underscoring the necessity for advanced solutions such as deep learning-based detection and tracking. Hence, this article proposes a two-stage platform designed to address these challenges by detecting, classifying, and tracking various consumer-grade UAVs. The tracking efficacy of the proposed system is assessed using a combination of deep learning and Kalman filter techniques. Specifically, we evaluate models such as YOLOv3, YOLOv4, YOLOv5, and YOLOx to identify the most efficient detector for the initial detection stage. Moreover, we employ both the Kalman filter and the Extended Kalman filter for the tracking stage, enhancing the system&#39;s robustness and enabling real-time tracking capabilities. To train our detector, we construct a dataset comprising approximately 10,000 records that capture the diverse environmental and behavioural conditions experienced by UAVs during their flight. We then present both visual and analytical results to assess and compare the performance of our detector and tracker. Our proposed system effectively mitigates cumulative detection errors across consecutive video frames and enhances the accuracy of the target&#39;s bounding boxes.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the algorithm based on review text has been widely used in recommendation systems, which can help mitigate the effect of sparsity in rating data within recommender algorithms. Existing methods typically employ a uniform model for capturing user and item features, but they are limited to the shallow feature level, and the user&#39;s personalized preferences and deep features of the item have not been fully explored, which may affect the relationship between the two representations learned by the model. The deeper relationship between them will affect the prediction results. Consequently, we propose a personalized recommendation method based on the rating matrix and review text denoted PRM-RR, which is used to deeply mine user preferences and item characteristics. In the process of processing the comment text, we employ ALBERT to obtain vector representations for the words present in the review text firstly. Subsequently, taking into account that significant words and reviews bear relevance not solely to the review text but also to the user&#39;s individualized preferences, the proposed personalized attention module synergizes the user&#39;s personalized preference information with the review text vector, thereby engendering an enriched review-based user representation. The fusion of the user&#39;s review representation and rating representation is accomplished through the feature fusion module using cross-modal attention, yielding the final user representation. Lastly, we employ a factorization machine to predict the user&#39;s rating for the item, thereby facilitating the recommendation process. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms the baseline algorithm in all cases, demonstrating that our method effectively improves the performance of recommendations.

The previous literature has suggested quality-of-service (QoS) aware flow processing using manual strategies or heuristic algorithms, however, these schemes proposed with white-box approaches do not provide effective results as the network scales or dynamic changes are happening. This article proposes a novel QoS provision strategy using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to calculate the optimal routes autonomously for SD-IoT traffic. To satisfy the different demands of flows in the SD-IoT network the flows are divided into two types. Hence, based on their service demand the routes are generated for them as per service request. The scenario is explained with precision agriculture based on SD-IoT and results are compared with benchmark strategies. A real internet topology is used for the evaluation of results. The results indicated that the proposed method gives improvements for QoS such as delay, throughput, packet loss rate, and jitter compared with benchmark models.},

  abstract     = {Nail-biting (NB) or onychophagia is a compulsive disorder that affects millions of people in both children and adults. It has several health complications and negative social effects. Treatments include surgical interventions, pharmacological medications, or additionally, it can be treated using behavioral modification therapies that utilize positive reinforcement and periodical reminders. Although it is the least invasive, such therapies still depend on manual monitoring and tracking which limits their success. In this work, we propose a novel approach for automatic real-time NB detection and alert on a smartwatch that does not require surgical intervention, medications, or manual habit monitoring. It addresses two key challenges: First, NB actions generate subtle motion patterns at the wrist that lead to a high false-positives (FP) rate even when the hand is not on the face. Second, is the challenge to run power-intensive applications on a power-constrained edge device like a smartwatch. To overcome these challenges, our proposed approach implements a pipeline of three convolutional neural networks (CNN) models instead of a single model. The first two models are small and efficient, designed to detect face-touch (FT) actions and hand movement away (MA) from the face. The third model is a larger and deeper CNN model dedicated to classifying hand actions on the face and detecting NB actions. This separation of tasks addresses the key challenges: decreasing FPs by ensuring NB model is activated only when the hand on the face, and optimizing power usage by ensuring the larger NB model runs only for short periods while the efficient FT model runs most of the time. In addition, this separation of tasks gives more freedom to design, configure, and optimize the three models based on each model task. Lastly, for training the main NB model, this work presents further optimizations including developing NB dataset from start through a dedicated data collection application, applying data augmentation, and utilizing several CNN optimization techniques during training. Results show that the model pipeline approach minimizes FPs significantly compared with the single model for NB detection while improving the overall efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Depression, a prevalent mental disorder in modern society, significantly impacts people&#39;s daily lives. Recently, there have been advancements in developing automated diagnosis models for detecting depression. However, data scarcity, primarily due to privacy concerns, has posed a challenge. Traditional speech features have limitations in representing knowledge for depression diagnosis, and the complexity of deep learning algorithms necessitates substantial data support. Furthermore, existing multimodal methods based on neural networks overlook the heterogeneity gap between different modalities, potentially resulting in redundant information. To address these issues, we propose a multimodal depression detection model based on the Enhanced Cross-Attention (ECA) Mechanism. This model effectively explores text-speech interactions while considering modality heterogeneity. Data scarcity has been mitigated by fine-tuning pre-trained models. Additionally, we design a modal fusion module based on ECA, which emphasizes similarity responses and updates the weight of each modal feature based on the similarity information between modal features. Furthermore, for speech feature extraction, we have reduced the computational complexity of the model by integrating a multi-window self-attention mechanism with the Fourier transform. The proposed model is evaluated on the public dataset, DAIC-WOZ, achieving an accuracy of 80.0% and an average F 1 value improvement of 4.3% compared with relevant methods.},

  abstract     = {Brain tumors are prevalent forms of malignant neoplasms that, depending on their type, location, and grade, can significantly reduce life expectancy due to their invasive nature and potential for rapid progression. Accordingly, brain tumors classification is an essential step that allows doctors to perform appropriate treatment. Many studies have been done in the sector of medical image processing by employing computational methods to effectively segment and classify tumors. However, the larger amount of information collected by healthcare images prohibits the manual segmentation process in a reasonable time frame, reducing error measures in healthcare settings. Therefore, automated and efficient techniques for segmentation are crucial. In addition, various visual information, noisy images, occlusion, uneven image textures, confused objects, and other features may impact the process. Therefore, the implementation of deep learning provides remarkable results in medicinal image processing, particularly in the segmentation and classification process. However, conventional deep learning-assisted methods struggle with complex structures and dimensional issues. Thus, this paper develops an effective technique for diagnosing brain tumors. The main aspect of the proposed system is to classify the brain tumor types by segmenting the affected regions of the raw images. This novel approach can be applied for various applications like diagnostic centers, decision-making tools, clinical trials, medical research institutes, disease prognosis, and so on. Initially, the requisite images are collected from standard datasets and further, it is subjected to the segmentation period. In this stage, the Multi-scale and Dilated TransUNet++ (MDTUNet++) model is employed to segment the abnormalities. Further, the segmented images are given into an Adaptive Dilated Dense Residual Attention Network (ADDRAN) to classify the brain tumor types. Here, to optimize the ADDRAN technique&#39;s parameters, an Improved Hermit Crab Optimizer (IHCO) is supported, which increases the accuracy rates of the overall network. Finally, the numerical examination is conducted to guarantee the robustness and usefulness of the designed model by contrasting it with other related techniques. For Dataset 1, the accuracy value attains 93.71 for the proposed work compared to 87.86 for CNN, 90.18 for DenseNet, and 89.56 and 90.96 for RAN and DRAN, respectively. Thus, supremacy has been achieved for the recommended system while detecting the brain tumor types.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, crowdsourcing has developed into a business production paradigm and a distributed problem-solving platform. However, the conventional machine learning models failed to assist both requesters and workers in finding the proper jobs that affect better quality outputs. The traditional large-scale crowdsourcing systems typically involve a lot of microtasks, and it requires more time for a crowdworker to search a work on this platform. Thus, task suggestion methods are more useful. Yet, the traditional approaches do not consider the cold-start issue. To tackle these issues, in this paper, a new recommendation system for crowdsourcing data is implemented utilizing deep learning. Initially, from the standard online sources, the crowdsourced data are accumulated. The novelty of the model is to propose an adaptive residual long short-term memory (ARes-LSTM) that learns the task&#39;s latent factor via the task features rather than the task ID. Here, this network&#39;s parameters are optimized by the fitness-based drawer algorithm (F-DA) to improve the efficacy rates. Further, the suggested ARes-LSTM is adopted to detect the user&#39;s preference score based on the user&#39;s historical behaviors. According to the historical behavior records of the users and task features, the ARes-LSTM provides personalized task recommendations and rectifies the issue of cold-start. From the outcomes, the better accuracy rate of the implemented model is 91.42857. Consequently, the accuracy rate of the traditional techniques such as AOA, TSA, BBRO, and DA is attained as 84.07, 85.42, 87.07, and 90.07. Finally, the simulation of the implemented recommendation system is conducted with various traditional techniques with standard efficiency metrics to show the supremacy of the designed recommendation system. Thus, it is proved that the developed recommendation system for the crowdsourcing data model chooses intended tasks based on individual preferences that can help to enlarge the number of chances to engage in crowdsourcing efforts across a broad range of platforms.},

  abstract     = {Speech enhancement is crucial in many speech processing applications. Recently, researchers have been exploring ways to improve performance by effectively capturing the long-term contextual relationships within speech signals. Using multiple stages of learning, where several deep learning modules are activated one after the other, has been shown to be an effective approach. Recently, the attention mechanism has been explored for improving speech quality, showing significant improvements. The attention modules have been developed to improve CNNs backbone network performance. However, these attention modules often use fully connected (FC) and convolution layers, which increase the model&#39;s parameter count and computational requirements. The present study employs multi-stage learning within the framework of speech enhancement. The proposed study uses a multi-stage structure in which a sequence of Squeeze temporal convolutional modules (STCM) with twice dilation rates comes after a Triple attention block (TAB) at each stage. An estimate is generated at each phase and refined in the subsequent phase. To reintroduce the original information, a feature fusion module (FFM) is inserted at the beginning of each following phase. In the proposed model, the intermediate output can go through several phases of step-by-step improvement by continually unfolding STCMs, which eventually leads to the precise estimation of the spectrum. A TAB is crafted to enhance the model performance, allowing it to concurrently concentrate on areas of interest in the channel, spatial, and time-frequency dimensions. To be more specific, the CSA has two parallel regions combining channel with spatial attention, enabling both the channel dimension and the spatial dimension to be captured simultaneously. Next, the signal can be emphasized as a function of time and frequency by aggregating the feature maps along these dimensions. This improves its capability to model the temporal dependencies of speech signals. Using the VCTK and Librispeech datasets, the proposed speech enhancement system is assessed against state-of-the-art deep learning techniques and yielded better results in terms of PESQ, STOI, CSIG, CBAK, and COVL.},

  abstract     = {The sharing of patient information on an open network has drawn attention to the healthcare system. Security is the primary issue while sharing documents online. Thus, a dual watermarking technique has been developed to improve the security of shared data. The classical watermarking schemes are resilient to many attacks. Protecting the authenticity and copyrights of medical images is essential to prevent duplication, modification, or unauthorized distribution. This paper proposes a robust, novel dual watermarking system for securing healthcare data. Initially, watermarking is performed based on redundant lifting wavelet transform (LWT) and turbo code decomposition for COVID-19 patient images and patient text data. To achieve a high level of authenticity, watermarks in the form of encoded text data and decomposed watermark images are inserted together, and an inverse LWT is used to generate an initial watermarked image. Improve imperceptibility and robustness by incorporating the cover image into the watermarked image. Cross-guided bilateral filtering (CG_BF) improves cover image quality, while the integrated Walsh–Hadamard transform (IWHT) extracts features. The novel adaptive coati optimization (ACO) technique is used to identify the ideal location for the watermarked image in the cover image. To improve security, the watermarked image is dissected using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and encrypted with a chaotic extended logistic system. Finally, the encrypted watermarked image is implanted in the desired place using a novel deep-learning model based on the Hybrid Convolutional Cascaded Capsule Network (HC 3 Net). Thus, the secured watermarked image is obtained, and the watermark and text data are extracted using the decryption and inverse DWT procedure. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using accuracy, peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), NC, and other metrics. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of 99.26%, which is greater than the existing methods.},

These issues refer to ordinal classification under monotonicity constraints. Recently, some machine learning approaches have been designed to deal with these kinds of problems. Indeed, numerous experiments have shown that these algorithms are widely used in real-life applications because of their flexibility and efficiency in terms of interpretation and predictions. In this paper, we introduce novel approaches for measuring feature quality and information quantity, called Rényi-Tsallis Monotonic Tree (RTMT), which uses the advantages of Rényi and Tsallis entropies while incorporating monotonicity constraints through an optimisation framework. Moreover, we introduce Mono-CART, a variant of the CART approach adapted for monotonic classification. New decision tree algorithms are designed on the basis of aforementioned entropies while considering the monotonicity constraints within an optimisation system. The experiments conducted using some benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approaches compared to existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) often involves evaluating or ranking alternatives on multiple attributes, a process that is far from trivial due to flexible preferences and uncertainty in the criteria importance. The recently proposed W eightless, I nterval- B ased A pproach (WIBA) tackles these issues by relying on an ordering of the criteria (according to their relevance) instead of explicit weights and using interval scores to evaluate alternatives. Although originally proposed for selecting solutions of interest in the context of multi-objective and many objective optimization problems, it can be adapted to rank such solutions. However, the robustness of WIBA rankings has not been studied, and sensitivity analysis approaches based on perturbations of the weights cannot be applied. Furthermore, there is no friendly environment for exploring WIBA properties. This paper addresses these gaps by (1) introducing a novel local sensitivity analysis technique to explore how small perturbations in the order of criteria affect rankings, and (2) presenting WIBApp, a freely available visual software tool that implements WIBA features, including the proposed sensitivity analysis. Using a case study on the selection of technical universities, the paper first illustrates WIBA&#39;s flexibility and utility in real-world decision scenarios, enabling decision makers to effectively deal with uncertainty and complexity, and second shows how WIBApp simplifies data management, enhances analysis and facilitates comparisons among rankings. By advancing the theoretical foundations of WIBA and providing a practical implementation, this work contributes to providing decision makers with a robust framework for handling multi-criteria problems, enhancing the reliability of rankings and supporting informed decisions.},

  abstract     = {Wind turbine blades (WTB) are critical components of wind energy systems. Operating in harsh environments WTBs face significant challenges, since damage to their leading edge caused by erosion or additive surface roughness can reduce performance, and increase maintenance costs and operational downtime. One approach to detect WTB damage is to use machine learning, but properly designing a predictive system is not trivial. Auto machine learning (AutoML) can be used to simplify the design and implementation of machine learning pipelines. This work presents the first comparison of state-of-the-art AutoML methods, Auto-Sklearn, H2O-DAI and TPOT, to detect erosion and additive roughness in WTBs. The Leading-Edge Erosion Study database is used, which provides measurements of the pressure coefficient along the airfoil under different conditions. This is the first work to combine the pressure coefficient and AutoML systems to detect these types of damage. Results show the viability of using AutoML in this task, with H2O-DAI producing the best results, achieving an accuracy above in many cases. However, statistical analysis shows that a standard classifier can achieve similar performance across all problems considered, based on the Friedman test and the Wilcoxon-Holm post hoc analysis with an significance level. However, AutoML systems perform better as the complexity and difficulty of the problem increases.},

However, existing meta-heuristic algorithms still suffer from several shortcomings, including a poor balance between global and local search, a tendency to converge toward the centre of the solution space, and susceptibility to getting trapped in local optima. To overcome these shortcomings, a novel meta-heuristic algorithm, called artificial orca optimiser (AOO), is proposed based on the unique behaviours of orcas in nature. Within the framework of AOO, the switching factor, guidance phase, and iterative formulas that do not converge toward the centre of the solution space, are designed to enhance the equilibrium between exploration and exploitation, ensure agents the ability to escape from the local optimum, and comprehensively explore the solution space without being limited to the centre of the solution space, thereby increasing the likelihood of finding the global optimal solution. Qualitative, quantitative, scalability, sensitivity, and practical application analyses of the experimental results demonstrate that AOO overcomes the issue of converging to the centre of the solution space, alleviates the problems of poor balance and susceptibility to the local optimum, and exhibits outstanding optimising performance, fast convergence, great scalability, high robustness, and excellent practicality.},

  abstract     = {Driven by the rise of the internet, recent years have witnessed the gradual manifestation of commercial values of online reviews. In movie industry, sentiment analysis serves as the foundation for mining user preferences among diverse and multi-layered audiences, providing insight into the market value of movies. As a representative task, aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to analyse and extract fine-grained sentiment elements and their relations in terms of discussed aspects. Relevant studies, particularly in the realm of deep learning research, face challenges due to insufficient annotated data. To alleviate this problem, we propose a guideline for fine-grained sentiment annotations that defines aspect categories, describes the method for annotating aspect sentiment triplets, either simple or complex and designs a scheme to represent hierarchical labels. Based on this, an ABSA dataset tailored for the movie domain is curated by annotating on 1100 Chinese short reviews acquired from Douban. Applicability of both the annotation guideline and curated data is evaluated through inter-annotator consistency and self-consistency checks, and domain adaptation assessment of e-commerce and healthcare cases. Predictive performance of machine learning models on this dataset shed light on possible applications in more fine-grained sentiment analysis in the movie domain, for example, figuring out the aspects from which to stimulate viewership and influence public opinions, thereby providing substantial support for the movie&#39;s box office performance. Finally, we extended our fine-grained sentiment annotation guideline to the e-commerce and healthcare. Through empirical experimentation, we demonstrated the universality of these guideline across diverse domains.},

  abstract     = {Due to the recent advancements in high-speed networks, underlying hardware computing resources and resource scheduling algorithms, Cloud computing has emerged as a popular computing paradigm globally providing end-user services such as infrastructure, hardware platforms and application tools. Subsequently, the researchers across various domains have integrated different services to facilitate the end users. However, the real issue faced by the cloud infrastructure is the network latency due to the physical dispersion between clients and cloud data centers. According to an estimate, billions of internet of things (IoT) devices are sharing approximately two exabytes of data daily. Such a huge amount of data can affect network performance if the underlying physical system does not expand up to the required levels, leading to performance degradation. To overcome these issues, a new computing paradigm called Fog Computing has emerged in recent years. In this paper, we discuss the recent developments in fog computing with the integration of real-time Healthcare 5.0 technology. Furthermore, we describe the proposed layered architecture and taxonomy of resource management (RM) techniques in fog computing, which consists of energy awareness, scheduling, reliability and scalability. Besides that, our survey covers the three-tier layered architecture, evaluation metrics, real-time application aspects of fog computing and tools providing the implementation of RM techniques in fog computing. Furthermore, the proposed layered architecture of the standard fog framework and different state-of-the-art techniques for utilising the computing resources of fog networks have been covered in this study. Moreover, we include various sensors to demonstrate the fog data offloading example in healthcare 5.0 applications. We also present a thorough discussion on various current and future real-time applications of fog computing. Finally, open challenges and promising future research directions have been identified and discussed in the area of fog-based real-time applications.},

  abstract     = {This study introduces an innovative optimization algorithm called Lionfish Search (LFS) technique, which is inspired by the visual predator Lionfish, in which it is specifically imitating their hunting tactics. The suggested algorithm considers several parameters that influence the hunting behaviour of lionfish, such as visual acuity, mobility, striking success, and prey swallowing potential. Furthermore, this study examines the influence of the physiological traits of the lionfish and their relationship with environmental factors. The novel search algorithm has shown enhanced performance and efficiency, particularly in scenarios where the integration of visual cues and intricate hunting strategies is vital. The suggested LFS method was evaluated using 20 well-known single-modal and multi-modal mathematical functions to analyse its different characteristics. The LFS method has shown remarkable efficacy in both exploration and exploitation, effectively reducing the likelihood of being trapped in local optima. Additionally, it has a rapid convergence capacity, particularly in the realm of large-scale global optimization. Comparisons were made between the LFS algorithm, and 10 other prominent algorithms mentioned in the literature. The proposed LFS metaheuristic algorithm outperformed the others on almost all of the examined functions, demonstrating a statistically significant advantage. Moreover, the positive results found in three practical optimization situations demonstrate the effectiveness of the LFS in accomplishing problem-solving tasks that have limited and unknown search areas.},

  abstract     = {Driven by rapid urbanisation, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region (BTH) has experienced a dramatic increase in resource consumption and environmental strain. Investigating the relationships among water, energy and carbon can help balance efficient resource utilisation, environmental conservation and economic growth, while promoting sustainable urban development. This study develops an analytical framework for the water-energy-carbon nexus within the urban eco-transformation. Specifically, this study first illustrates the conceptual model for the interaction among water use, energy consumption and carbon emissions theoretically, then examines the water-energy-carbon dynamics in urbanisation and ecological transition of the BTH region. Furthermore, an empirical analysis was conducted taking Beijing city as the case study area to explore the water-energy-carbon nexus and its decoupling with socio-economic development. Results show rapid urbanisation has significantly increased population and economic scale, exerting substantial pressure on water resources, energy supply and the environment. The study reveals a significant positive interaction between water consumption, electricity consumption and carbon emissions in Beijing, with an inverted U-shaped parabolic relationship between GDP and population. Beijing is expected to decouple economic growth from carbon emissions after 2030 and from water consumption after 2037, reducing resource consumption and carbon emissions while sustaining economic growth. To achieve sustainable development, it is recommended that the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region accelerate industrial transformation, enhance water resource efficiency, develop clean energy and improve power system efficiency. This paper provides a theoretical foundation and practical insights for decision-making and facilitates ecological urbanisation in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region.},

The adoption of deep learning and machine learning-based abnormal behaviour detection models enhances the influential detection and real-time security monitoring in crowds. The researchers have remotely evaluated the heart rate based on physiological information to detect abnormal activities in various years. Over the past few years, several progress have been made, and there are still some issues concerning processing time, accuracy, and computational complexity. The developed approaches detects the activities of anomalies like traffic rule violations, riots, fighting, and stampede, in addition, several anomalous entities such as abandoned luggage and weapons at the sensitive place automatically in time. However, the identification of video anomalies methods poses several challenges because of various environmental conditions, the ambiguous nature of the anomaly, lack of proper datasets, and the complex nature of human characteristics. In recent days, there have been only a few devoted surveys associated with deep learning related video anomaly identification as the research domain is in its initial stages. In this review work, the abnormal behaviour analysis models using deep learning are reviewed in depth in for security applications. Based on the traditionally used abnormal behaviour analysis models in crowded scenes, we widely categorised the methods into classification using object tracking, classification using handcrafted extracted features, classification using non-contact heart rate variability and blood pressure, analysing motion patterns from the visual frames, and classification using face images. We also discuss the comparative analysis of the previous methods with respect to datasets, computational infrastructure, and performance measures for both qualitative and quantitative analysis. In addition, the open and trending research challenges are analysed for future research.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a new data clustering technique aimed at enhancing the performance of the trainable path-cost algorithm and reducing the computational complexity of data clustering models. The proposed method facilitates the discovery of natural groupings and behaviours, which is crucial for effective coordination in complex environments. It identifies natural groupings within a set of features and detects the best clusters with similar behaviour in the data, overcoming the limitations of traditional state-of-the-art methods. The algorithm utilises a density peak clustering method to determine cluster centers and then extracts features from paths passing through these peak points (centers). These features are used to train the support vector machine (SVM) to predict the labels of other points. The proposed algorithm is enhanced using two key concepts: first, it employs Q-Generalised Extreme Value (Q-GEV) under power normalisation instead of traditional generalised extreme value distributions, thereby increasing modelling flexibility; second, it utilises the random vector functional link (RVFL) network rather than the SVM, which helps avoid overfitting and improves label prediction accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed clustering algorithm is evaluated through various experiments, including those on UCI benchmark datasets and real-world data, demonstrating significant improvements across multiple performance metrics, including F1 measure, Jaccard index, purity, and accuracy, highlighting its capability in accurately identifying paths between similar clusters. Its average F1 measure, Jaccard index, purity, and accuracy is measured 76.87%, 56.29%, 80.29%, and 79.64%, respectively.},

The synthesis of findings from publicly available NLP repositories in this review sheds light on the progression of SRL methodologies and their use across various linguistic contexts. The investigation examines the distinct hurdles presented by Indian languages, which are characterised by their morphological complexity and syntactic variability, juxtaposed with the more widely studied English language. Furthermore, we perform an analysis of the impact of sophisticated machine learning algorithms, particularly deep learning, on enhancing SRL efficacy across these languages. The review identifies key research gaps and proposes future research pathways to address the complex nature of SRL in multilingual environments.

  abstract     = {In this manuscript, we extend the quasi-static multi-phase-field method for composite materials to the dynamic case. In the dynamic multi-phase-field method, each phase of the composites has its individual phase field, and the degradation of each phase is governed by its respective phase field. The macroscopic response is then obtained by averaging and homogenization approaches through the reduced-order-homogenization (ROH) framework. Through the ROH and the Francfort-Marigo variational principle, we can obtain the equations that govern the motion of the composites and the evolution of each phase field. This method is capable of capturing the characteristics of dynamic fracture, such as crack branching, without the need for any additional bifurcation criterion. Moreover, it can capture dynamic fracture patterns in composite materials, including matrix cracking, fiber breakage, and delamination. The corresponding numerical algorithm that includes spatial and temporal discretization is developed. An implicit, staggered Newton-Raphson iterative scheme is implemented to solve the nonlinear coupled equations. Finally, this method is tested with several sets of dynamic fracture benchmarks, which demonstrates good agreement with the experiments and other numerical methods.},

A shell element is treated as a three-dimensional continuum whose midsurface, the generalized “boundary” of the continuum, is characterized with a quadrilateral spectral element. It is along the thickness direction ξ that the midsurface is scaled to represent the three-dimensional geometry and that the analytical displacement solution is sought. Neumann expansion is used to approximate the inverse of the Jacobian as a quadratic matrix polynomial of ξ while the assumed natural strain method is applied to alleviate the shear and membrane locking. The virtual work principle considering body forces is utilized to derive the scaled boundary finite element equation, which is directly solved via the differential quadrature method. Numerical examples show that the shell elements with five displacement sampling points along ξ can efficiently analyze thin to very thick general shells.},

In response, multiscale topology optimization, which finds the optimal design of microstructure for the macrostructure geometry and performance requirements, has become a hot topic in the field of structural optimization. While the basic optimization framework based on the homogenization theory spanning macro and microscales is available, it is computationally expensive and not easily applicable in practical scenarios such as high-resolution design for precision modeling and reliable design considering non-linearities. To address this issue, we focus on a homogenization analysis using a fast Fourier transform as an alternative approach to conventional finite element analysis and develop an optimization method with fast computing speed and low memory requirements. In this paper, we define a simple stiffness maximization problem with linear elastic materials and conduct two and three-dimensional optimization analyses to evaluate the validity and performance of the proposed method. We discuss the advantages of computational cost, the influence of the filtering process, and the appropriate setting of material contrast.},

  abstract     = {Reduced order modeling (ROM) is applied to the finite element thermo-mechanical simulation of metal additive manufacturing at part scale. This is a significant challenge because of the continuously evolving computational domain, on which a local reduced basis is required to apply the projection-based ROM. In this paper, ROM is applied to the mechanical resolution, which is much more time-consuming than the thermal one. Considering the modeling of DED processes (directed energy deposition), it is proposed to organize the training set of simulation snapshots according to an energy deposition length that represents the progress of the process. The full-order model consists of a transient thermomechanical model modified by use of the previously developed Inherent Strain Rate method.

The approach, in its present state, is limited to constructions with a constant transverse geometry and a constant set of process parameters.

  abstract     = {We construct a new polygonal C 1 $$ {C}^1 $$ spline finite element method based on the scaled boundary coordinates to address the plate bending problems in the Kirchhoff-love formulation. The Bernstein interpolations are utilized in both radial and circumferential directions in the scaled boundary coordinates. Firstly, the C 1 $$ {C}^1 $$ continuity conditions inside an S-domain and normal derivatives constraining conditions are imposed by a simple linear system on the S-net coefficients. Secondly, to satisfy the C 1 $$ {C}^1 $$ connection between different polygonal elements, we construct the Hermite interpolation by equivalently transforming part of the S-net coefficients to proper boundary degrees of freedom, namely, three degrees of freedom at each vertex and a normal derivative at the midpoint of each edge. Moreover, we discuss the convergence analysis of the proposed element over convex meshes by finding the necessary and sufficient geometric conditions, where the corresponding unisolvency theorem is proved by studying the dimension of the spline space . This proposed spline element base have explicit expressions, and the computation of the stiffness matrix can be greatly simplified by using the S-net coefficients. Some numerical tests verify the cubic polynomial completeness, the optimal 4th-order convergence rate, and the continuity of the derivatives. It also shows other good properties like superconvergence in the square mesh and insensitivity to the mesh distortion.},

The stability of the suggested NN model in the sense of Lyapunov, is proved. Also, it is shown that the proposed NN is globally convergent to an efficient solution of the main MLOP.

In the suggested algorithms we apply some filters to attain a uniform approximation of the Pareto front. Illustrative results are provided to clarify the validity and performance of the introduced model for different categories of MLOPs. Numerical results satisfy the presented theoretical aspects.

  abstract     = {Finding the critical time step for conditionally stable time integration methods has been a decades-long problem. The apparently obvious option of directly computing it from a generalized eigenvalue analysis, identifying the largest eigenfrequency of the discrete system, is usually impractical because of its numerical expense and because a stiffness matrix is often unavailable in the context of explicit analysis. There exist two popular approaches to efficiently estimate the critical time step: A characteristic element length can be estimated based on heuristic formulas. The resulting estimate, however, cannot be guaranteed to be conservative. Another approach is to reformulate and simplify the underlying eigenvalue problem on the element level and to use certain inequalities to derive an upper bound for the largest eigenvalue. This is conservative but may show poor performance by significantly under-predicting the actual critical time step. Moreover, the necessary simplifications are usually specific to the investigated element formulation. Many works that develop time step estimators demonstrate their performance only for particular element configurations, making it difficult to compare the estimators. In this paper, data-driven approaches for time step estimation for 2d-elements that address several of the aforementioned problems are proposed. First, the set of all possible quadrilateral element geometries and its discrete representation are described. A detailed comparison of nine existing time step estimators based on more than ten million element configurations is presented. Additionally, the concept of an optimal safety factor function is introduced. This concept allows us to generate the optimal and conservative version of an existing estimator and thus solves two problems at the same time: It can be used to make non-conservative estimators conservative and to improve the performance of estimators that are conservative by construction. Finally, we formulate time step estimation as a function approximation problem. It allows us to derive customizable time step estimators solely based on data. Through two examples, we demonstrate that this data-driven approach yields time step estimators that outperform state-of-the-art estimators in terms of accuracy while also being efficient to evaluate.},

In addition, localisation bands positioned along the elements&#39; boundaries depict the mechanical effects of material degradation. The position-based approach of FEM enables the accurate modelling of geometrically non-linear effects and its computational implementation is straightforward. In this approach, the equilibrium configuration has been evaluated in relation to the nodal positions instead of its displacements. Thus, one improvement proposed herein involves the coupling of the XLDM failure predictions within an exact geometrically non-linear framework. Besides, in this study, the XLDM has been further improved by incorporating the damage growth caused by compressive stresses. The non-linear formulation proposed herein enables the presence of reinforcements, which have been added by an embedded scheme and lead to another improvement in the XLDM context. Three applications demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed non-linear scheme, in which the numerical responses obtained by the proposed improved formulation have been compared to experimental results available in the literature.},

This enhances simulation fidelity by accurately considering the deformability of the contact surface and preventing fictitious gaps between bodies in contact. Additionally, the method utilises the Extended B-Splines (EBSs) domain approximation, providing two key advantages. First, EBSs robustly mitigate grid cell-crossing errors by offering continuous gradients of the basis functions on the interface between adjacent grid cells. Second, numerical integration errors are minimised, even with small physical domains in occupied grid cells. The proposed method&#39;s robustness and accuracy are evaluated through benchmarks, including comparisons with analytical solutions, other state-of-the-art MPM-based contact algorithms, and experimental observations from the literature. Notably, the method demonstrates effective mitigation of stress errors inherent in contact simulations.},

In this approach, the Krylov deferred correction (KDC) scheme is employed for the temporal discretization of dynamic problems, featuring a novel numerical implementation designed to ensure the precise satisfaction of boundary conditions. The localized radial basis function (LRBF) collocation method is modified and utilized to solve the resulting boundary value problems. A new radial basis function is developed and combined with an optimization strategy for the distribution of source points to enhance the performance of the LRBF scheme. This method synergizes the KDC technique, which supports large time step sizes, with the LRBF collocation method, characterized by its truly meshless nature, to address dynamic problems over long durations. Additionally, the coefficient matrix produced by the LRBF method is sparse and depends solely on the spatial distances between collocation points and source points, which is advantageous for long-term simulations. Numerical simulations spanning thousands of time steps demonstrate the accuracy, stability, and convergence of the hybrid approach. The developed numerical framework shows significant improvements over existing methods, particularly in handling dynamic problems with substantial temperature variations.},

The NURBS fitting method is used to fit the physical response function, generating a NURBS surface for describing the physical response function, that is, the explicitly described physical response function surface. An iso-surface cut the NURBS physical response surfaces to obtain the explicitly described structure topology. In addition, the standard IGS files of the NURBS physical response surface and iso-surface can be transferred to Computer-Aided-Design (CAD) software without post-processing. The multiscale structure can be easily assembled in CAD software using the proposed method.

We demonstrate that the main condition for the stability of the numerical solution is that the distribution of the pressure nodes has to be coarser than that of the velocity both globally and locally in the domain, and there is no need for any more complex assumptions similar to the Ladyzhenskaya-Babuška-Brezzi condition in the finite element method. Optimal stability is achieved when the relative local density of the velocity to pressure nodes is about 4:1. The convergence rates of the method correspond to the convergence rates of numerical differentiation for both low and higher order discretizations. The method works well on both mesh-based and irregular nodes, such as those generated by random or quasi-random numbers and on nodes with varying density. There is no need for special staggered arrangements, which suggests that node generation algorithms may produce just one node set and obtain the other by either refinement or coarsening. Numerical results for the benchmark Driven Cavity Problem confirm the robustness and high accuracy of the method, in particular resolving a cascade of multiple Moffatt Eddies at the tip of the wedge by using nodes obtained from the quasi-random Halton sequence.},

Consequently, the number of degrees of freedom in this approach is the same as that is required for an interface problem with homogeneous interface conditions. The chief merit is that the proposed method totally confors and does not use conventional techniques for the nonhomogeneous interface condition in the literature, such as the penalty method or the Lagrange multiplier.

  abstract     = {Sensitivity analysis plays a vital role in understanding the impact of control parameter variations on system output, particularly in cases where an objective functional evaluates the output&#39;s merit. The adjoint method has gained popularity due to its efficient computation, especially when dealing with a large number of control parameters and a few functionals. While the discrete form of the adjoint method is prevalent, exploring its continuous counterpart can offer valuable insights into the underlying mathematical problem, particularly in characterizing the boundary conditions. This paper presents an investigation into the continuous form of the adjoint method applied to time-dependent viscous flows, where the time dependence is either imposed by boundary conditions or arises from the system dynamics itself. The proposed approach enables the computation of sensitivities with respect to both geometric and operational control parameters using the same adjoint solution. For time-periodic flows, a special formulation is developed to mitigate the computational costs associated with time integration. Results demonstrate that the methodology proposed in a previous work can be successfully extended to time-dependent flows with fixed time spans. In such applications, time-accurate simulations of physics and adjoint fields are sufficient. However, periodic flows necessitate the application of the Leibniz Rule because the period might depend on the control parameters, which introduces additional terms to the adjoint-based sensitivity gradient. In that case, time integration can be limited to a minimum common multiple of all appearing periods in the flow. Although the accurate estimation of such multiple poses a challenge, the approach promises significant benefits for sensitivity analysis of fully established periodic flows. It leads to substantial cuts in computational costs and avoids transient data contamination.},

  abstract     = {Thermal analysis of fractured porous media is of interest in environmental and reservoir engineering. The dual-porosity method is a common and cost-efficient approach for modeling fractured domain. In the case of thermal analysis, this method encounters two challenges; the high dependence on the matrix to fracture transfer parameter, “shape factor,” and numerical oscillations produced in the conventional Galerkin finite element formulation for convection dominant problems. To overcome these issues a Petrov-Galerkin dual porosity (PGDP) algorithm is presented for the analysis of 2D transient heat flow in fractured porous media. In the computational algorithm, an appropriate unit cell is selected from the primary domain and the corresponding thermal shape factor is evaluated with a time-varying function. Unlike conventional constant shape factor models, this shape factor accounts for not only the geometry of the blocks, but also the thermal properties of the domain and existing boundary conditions. Several case studies are simulated to investigate the validity and sensitivity of the time-dependent thermal shape factor to different parameters for square and non-square blocks. Moreover, the Petrov-Galerkin formulation is applied to effectively achieve the accurate spatial results for highly convective heat flows. Numerical simulations are performed to study the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed PGDP algorithm for different range of convection and conduction regimes. This study illustrates that the PGDP algorithm efficiently enhances the accuracy of the simulation in modeling of fractured domains, particularly in transient stages. Moreover, the capability of the proposed computational algorithm is demonstrated in modeling square and non-square matrix formations.},

  abstract     = {This article is dedicated to the development of a model to simulate fast transient compressible flows on solid structures using immersed boundary method (IBM) and a lattice Boltzmann solver. Ultimately, the proposed model aims at providing an efficient algorithm to simulate strongly-coupled fluid-structure interactions (FSI). Within this goal, it is necessary to propose a precise and robust numerical framework and validate it on stationary solid cases first, which is the scope of the present study. Classical FSI methods, such as body-fitted approaches, are facing challenges with moving or complex geometries in realistic conditions, requiring computationally expensive re-meshing operations. IBM offers an alternative by treating the solid structure geometry independently from the fluid mesh. This study focuses on the extension of the IBM to compressible flows, and a particular attention is given to the enforcement of various thermal boundary conditions. A hybrid approach, combining diffuse forcing for Dirichlet-type boundary conditions and ghost-nodes forcing for Neumann-type boundary conditions is introduced. Finally, a simplified model, relying only on diffuse IBM forcing, is investigated to treat specific cases where the fluid solid interface is considered as adiabatic. The accuracy of the method is validated through various test cases of increasing complexity.},

  abstract     = {This article presents the first application of the direct parametrisation method for invariant manifolds to a fully coupled multiphysics problem involving the nonlinear vibrations of deformable structures subjected to an electrostatic field. The formulation proposed is intended for model order reduction of electrostatically actuated resonating Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS). The continuous problem is first rewritten in a manner that can be directly handled by the parametrisation method, which relies upon automated asymptotic expansions. A new mixed fully Lagrangian formulation is thus proposed, which contains only explicit polynomial nonlinearities, which is then discretised in the framework of finite element procedures. Validation is performed on the classical parallel plate configuration, where different formulations using either the general framework or an approximation of the electrostatic field due to the geometric configuration selected are compared. Reduced-order models along these formulations are also compared to full-order simulations operated with a time integration approach. Numerical results show a remarkable performance both in terms of accuracy and the wealth of nonlinear effects that can be accounted for. In particular, the transition from hardening to softening behaviour of the primary resonance while increasing the constant voltage component of the electric actuation is recovered. Secondary resonances leading to superharmonic and parametric resonances are also investigated with the reduced-order model.},

  abstract     = {For the solutions of first-order transient problems with optimal efficiency, conventional single-step implicit methodologies, unaided by additional post-processing techniques, encounter limitations in concurrently attaining identical second-order accuracy and controllable numerical dissipation. Addressing this challenge, the present study contributes not only a comprehensive analytical framework for formulating implicit integration algorithms but also leverages the auxiliary variable and the composite sub-step technique to propose two distinct types of implicit integration algorithms. Each type is characterized by self-initiation, unconditional stability, identical second-order accuracy, controllable numerical dissipation, and zero-order overshoots. Recognizing that single-step implicit methods can be conceptualized as composite single-sub-step ones, both algorithm types achieve identical effective stiffness matrices, thereby reducing the computational effort for solving linear problems. The utilization of auxiliary variables endows the proposed single-step method with numerical attributes akin to established counterparts, while achieving identical second-order accuracy. Conversely, the adoption of the composite sub-step technique in the proposed two-sub-step methods surpasses the published algorithms by significantly reducing the error constants. This superiority persists when enforcing the same sub-step sizes and sub-step dissipation levels. Numerical simulations affirm that the proposed methods consistently outperform existing alternatives without incurring additional computational expenses.},

However, there are still a lot of theoretical problems to be solved, especially with regard to composite materials and convergence proof. Based on a novel least-squares approximation and conservation property, we extend S-FEM to heterogeneous materials. Firstly, the orthogonality, Softening Effect, and energy function are checked. Secondly, the interpolation error in the maximum norm is estimated in any dimension. Consequently, we get a theoretical convergence rate which has been sought since the year 2010. When restricted to one-dimensional problems, we construct a special test function to prove the superconvergence: (1) S-FEM flux is exact in the meaning of element-wise integral; (2) numerical flux is exact at some point in each element; (3) physical flux can be quadratically approximated at the center of each element. At last, we present two numerical experiments: (1) conventional S-FEM fails in high-contrast composite materials while our new scheme performs well; (2) our flux converges quadratically.},

In this contribution, we show that the damped Eyre–Milton iteration is linearly convergent for a class of nonlinear composites with a regular set of pores, provided the damping factor is chosen between zero and unity. First, we show that an abstract fixed-point method with non-expansive fixed-point operator and non-trivial damping converges linearly, provided the associated residual mapping satisfies a monotonicity condition on a closed subspace. Then, we transfer this result to the framework of polarization schemes and conclude the linear convergence of the damped Eyre–Milton scheme for porous materials. We present general arguments which apply to a class of nonlinear composites and mixed stress-strain loadings, as well. We show that the best contraction estimate is reached for a damping factor of 1 / 2 $$ 1/2 $$ , that is, for the polarization scheme of Michel–Moulinec–Suquet, and derive the corresponding optimal reference material. Our results generalize the recent work of Sab and co-workers who showed that an adaptively damped Eyre–Milton scheme leads to linear convergence for a class of linear composites with pores. Finally, we report on computational experiments which support our findings.},

This constraint arises from the limitations imposed by the contact algorithm. In this study, the contact detection between smooth polyhedrons is simplified to that between dilated triangular elements, and a discrete element method for concave polyhedral particles with smooth surfaces is developed. Subsequently, an automatic mesh simplification algorithm is established to enhance the computational efficiency without compromising accuracy. In validating the smooth polyhedral model, the simulation results of a hexahedron colliding with a plane are found to agree favorably with the experimental results. Then, the elastic collisions between the convex and concave particles are analyzed, and the total kinetic energy before and after the particle collision remains unchanged. Furthermore, the influences of particle morphology on the packing fraction, flow fluctuation, flow rate, mixing rate, velocity distribution, and system energy in hoppers and rotating drums are analyzed, revealing the underlying flow characteristics of concave polyhedral granular materials with smooth surfaces.},

  abstract     = {The traditional approach to structural lightweight optimization design, which is based on the elastic limit rule, often results in a structure that exhibits either weight redundancy or strength redundancy to some extent. This study introduces a novel integration of shakedown analysis with structural topology optimization, departing from the conventional elastic limit rule. Shakedown analysis identifies a non-failure external load region beyond the elastic limit but below the plastic limit, independent of loading history. The proposed method, for the first time, accounts for the influence of self-equilibrium residual stress at the element level, redefining effective and ineffective elements in topology optimization. Shakedown total stress replaces elastic equivalent stress, offering a comprehensive measure. Utilizing Melan&#39;s lower bound theorem, a gradient-based topology optimization framework for shakedown analysis is developed, ensuring structures stay within the elastic–plastic range, preventing excessive plastic deformation. The approach, employing the moving asymptotes method after adjoint sensitivity analysis of shakedown total stress, is applied to a three-dimensional L-shaped bracket. Even with a remarkable 50% reduction in weight, the maximum total shakedown stress of the bracket reveals that it only increases by a modest 17.20% from its initial value. Moreover, compared to traditional topology optimization methods based on either elastic stress or stiffness, the proposed method based on total shakedown stress leads to a higher shakedown limit. Specifically, the configuration designed using the total shakedown stress exhibited increases of 2.01% and 9.82% in the shakedown limit compared to those obtained using stiffness and equivalent elastic stress, respectively. This suggests that the proposed method can effectively balance the trade-off between shakedown strength and structural stiffness, achieving a 2.01% rise in shakedown strength with only a 2.24% compromise in structural stiffness. These findings highlight the method&#39;s effectiveness and potential, emphasizing the benefit of redefining effective and ineffective elements using shakedown stress in topology optimization.},

To be scalable, these methods are equipped with an augmentation projector built from the local preconditioners nullspaces. The determination of these nullspaces is a complex task in the case of ill conditioned system, the use of block low rank compression makes this task even more complex as MUMPS&#39; automatic detection no longer works properly. Two alternatives based on incomplete factorization with a well-chosen Schur complement are proposed. Also, the first massively parallel implementation of the adaptive multipreconditioned BDD solver (AMPBDD) is introduced. The performance of the methods is assessed with two weak scalability studies on problems up to 24,576 cores and about 790 millions of unknowns, on the Sator and Topaze supercomputers. BLR preconditioning proves to be an interesting strategy both in terms of memory usage and time to solution for reasonably conditioned problems.},

The DC framework differs from traditional Bayesian approaches due to the incorporation of the push-forward of an initial density, which performs selective regularization in parameter directions not informed by the data in the resulting updated density. This extends a previous study that included the linear Gaussian theory within the DC framework and introduced the maximal updated density (MUD) estimate as an alternative to both least squares and maximum a posterior (MAP) estimates. In this work, we introduce algorithms for operational settings of MUD estimation in real- or near-real time where spatio-temporal datasets arrive in packets to provide updated estimates of parameters and identify potential parameter drift. Computational diagnostics within the DC framework prove critical for evaluating (1) the quality of the DC update and MUD estimate and (2) the detection of parameter value drift. The algorithms are applied to estimate (1) wind drag parameters in a high-fidelity storm surge model, (2) thermal diffusivity field for a heat conductivity problem, and (3) changing infection and incubation rates of an epidemiological model.},

The lowest order version of the proposed element reduces to the classical Bogner–Fox–Schmit (BFS) element for Kirchhoff plates. The GLL basis allows diagonalisation of the mass matrix using the nodal quadrature technique, which enhances the computational efficiency. The numerical properties of the proposed element are comprehensively evaluated, including the conditioning of the system matrices. Moreover, the effect of employing different numerical integration schemes and nodal sets is examined in both static and free vibration analyses. The effectiveness of the proposed element in wave propagation problems is evaluated by comparing its performance to the converged solutions achieved using the BFS element with a very fine mesh. Results demonstrate that the current element, without and even with mass matrix diagonalisation delivers exceptional accuracy while also exhibiting faster convergence and enhanced computational efficiency than the existing Kirchhoff plate elements.},

Then, sensitivities of 3 d -metal dimers-doped h-BN structures towards the NO and CO gases were investigated. It was found that the interaction energies of these 3 d -metal dimers embedded on defective h-BN are higher than those deposited on pristine h-BN structure, which indicates that the 3 d -metal dimers exhibit good stability on defective h-BN.

Besides, the present findings allow to explain the experimentally observed regioselectivity of carbonylation of aziridines reactions, where CO is added on the more substituted C of aziridine three-membered ring. In sum, our work should motivate the use of such ecofriendly catalysts for carbonylation reactions without using transition metal catalysts.},

We used five different MD systems, ranging in size from about 82,000 to 204 million atoms, and evaluated their performance using two different Message Passing Interface (MPI) libraries, Intel-MPI and Open-MPI. The largest system showed near-perfect strong scaling up to 512 nodes or 65,536 cores, maintaining a parallel efficiency above 0.9 even at the highest level of parallelization. Energy efficiency for a given number of nodes was generally equal to or slightly better than parallel efficiency. We achieved peak performances of 687 ns/d for the 82k atom system, 116 ns/d for the 53M atom system, and about 35 ns/d for the largest 204M atom system. These results demonstrate that highly optimized software running on a state-of-the-art HPC cluster provides sufficient computing power to simulate biomolecular systems at the mesoscale of viruses and organelles, and potentially small cells in the near future.},

Polarizability and long-range LJ interactions increase the membrane surface viscosity, which decreases the translational diffusion constants. Simulated diffusion constants for dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) extrapolated to infinite system size agree well with experiment for Drude2023, but overestimate experiment by 60% (on average) and a factor of 2.5 for C36/LJ-PME and C36, respectively. The relaxation time of lipid wobble is described about equally well by C36/LJ-PME and Drude2023, as consistent with the hexadecane viscosity for the FF, and both are more accurate than C36. Hence, physical improvements in the FF, which slowed down these dynamic processes led to better agreement with experiment. Lastly, bilayers containing 10 influenza fusion peptides and high fractions of lysolipids (which are known to accelerate pore formation) were simulated with C36 and Drude2023. Pore formation rates were comparable for the two FF for the bilayers with 80% and 90% lysolipid. However, while no pores formed in 24 μs (including a single 20 μs trajectory) in the 70% lysolipid with C36, 4 of 15 replicates formed pores in less than 1 μs with Drude. While the pathway to poration is qualitatively similar for the additive and polarizable FF for the systems studied, Drude2023 should be considered for quantitative studies of pore formation, and, in some cases, will accelerate the process.},

  abstract     = {Diphenylamine (DPA) derivatives, used as antioxidants in rubber-based products, inhibit autoxidation by donating hydrogen atoms to peroxyl radicals. Octanol–water partition coefficient (LogK ow ), an antioxidant index, helps predict their distribution in hydrophobic polymer matrices. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between the structure of DPA derivatives and their antioxidant activities, using machine learning with quantitative structure–activity relationships (QSAR) and quantum mechanics (QM). The structure of DPA derivatives was optimized using Density Functional Theory and analyzed for molecular properties. The QSAR models were trained using important descriptors identified through permutation importance. Among the models developed, the Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR) showed the best performance, with R 2 of 0.983 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.642 for the test set. SHAP analysis revealed that molecular weight and electronic properties significantly influenced LogK ow predictions. For instance, a higher molecular weight was associated with increased LogK ow , and a higher positive charge of C2 correlated with higher LogK ow predictions. Consequently, the two potent compounds (D1 and D2) were designed based on QSAR model guidance. The GBR model predicted LogK ow values of 9.789 and 7.102 for D1 and D2, respectively, which are higher than the training compounds in the model. To gain molecular insight, the quantum chemical calculations with M062X/6–311++G(d,p)//M062X/6-31G(d,p) were performed to investigate the bond dissociation enthalpy (BDE). The results showed that D1 (79.50 kcal/mol) and D2 (72.43 kcal/mol) exhibited lower BDEs than the reference compounds, suggesting that the designed compounds have the potential for enhanced antioxidant activity. In addition, the antioxidant reaction mechanism was studied by using M062X/6–311++G(d,p)//M062X/6-31G(d,p) which found that the hydrogen atom transfer is the key step, where D1 and D2 showed activation energy barriers of 10.38 and 6.29 kcal/mol, respectively, compared to reference compounds of R3 (10.39 kcal/mol), R1 (10.40 kcal/mol), and R2 (18.26 kcal/mol). Therefore, our findings demonstrate that integrating QSAR with quantum chemical calculations can effectively guide the design of DPA derivatives with improved antioxidant properties.},

The protonation of the guanidine-SBFs induces a hypsochromic shift of the absorption and the emission maxima with the Stokes shift of &gt; 100 nm in both cases. Isomerization through the ESIPT process is less probable than in amino-SBFs due to the unfavorable thermodynamics. Still, if it occurs, it leads to a strong red shift of the emission by &gt; 150 nm. Aromaticity indices point to strong antiaromatic character of the examined guanidino-SBFs in the FC region which decreases upon geometrical relaxation and ESIPT.

The protocol is applied to a model exciplex formed by oligo-p-phenylenes (OPPs) and triethylamine (TEA), which is of interest in the context of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 $$ {\mathrm{CO}}_2 $$ . AIMD facilitates efficient sampling of the conformational space of OPP3 and OPP4 exciplexes with TEA, offering a dynamic alternative to previously employed static methods. The AIMD-based protocol successfully reproduces experimental emission spectra for OPP-TEA exciplexes, agreeing with previous computational and experimental findings. The results show that AIMD simulations provide an efficient means of sampling the conformational space of these exciplexes, requiring less user input and, in some instances, fewer computational resources than multiple excited-state optimizations initiated from user-specified initial structures. The study also evaluates the yield of intersystem crossing (ISC) using AIMD and Landau-Zener probability. The results suggest that ISC is a minor decay channel for OPP3 and OPP4. This work provides new insights into the structural flexibility and emission characteristics of OPP-TEA photoredox catalyst systems, potentially contributing to improved design strategies for organic chromophores in CO 2 $$ {\mathrm{CO}}_2 $$ reduction applications.},

Significant differences of the electron positions maximizing Ψ 2 $$ {\left|\Psi \right|}^2 $$ are uncovered and explained by the presence of hydrogen atoms in acetylene and by electron arrangements resulting from calculations of the nitrogen and carbon atoms. Moreover, insights into the electron delocalization of both molecules are gained by investigating electron exchange paths.

The high spin t 2 g 3 $$ {}_{2g}^3 $$ ground state excludes the Jahn Teller deformation and the orbital ordering. The energy gain due to the rotation of the octahedra (from the cubic space group Pm 3 ¯ m $$ \overline{3}\mathrm{m} $$ , N. 221, to space group P 4 m bm $$ P\frac{4}{m} bm $$ , N.127, and to I 4 m cm $$ I\frac{4}{m} cm $$ , N. 140) in the oxide is about 70 times larger than in the fluoride (5.4 vs. 0.08 mE h $$ {}_h $$ ), due to the larger electrostatic forces (a factor four, as the formal charge doubles in going from F − to O 2− ) and the consequently reduced B-X distances. In KVF 3 $$ {}_3 $$ , the p states of fluorine are separated by 6.4 eV from the d states of vanadium, whose band is quite narrow (1 eV). In the oxide, on the contrary, the oxygen p states overlap to a large amount with the d states of chromium, whose band is more than 6 eV large. The FM and AFM energy differences, the spin density maps and profiles, and the Mulliken analysis data are also provided for documenting the differences between the oxide and the fluoride.},

  abstract     = {The innovation literature has been marked by contrarian views regarding the roles of firms&#39; knowledge accumulation with regards to outsourced core components. To reconcile these views, we draw on the behavioral theory of the firm and the technological evolution literature in hypothesizing firms&#39; local search as a mechanism by which firms&#39; accumulated knowledge affects their product performance. Firms&#39; in-house knowledge can expose them to an accumulated knowledge trap , as firms&#39; accumulated knowledge tends to escalate their local search for a solution to a new technological challenge, but the impact of the local search on performance is unlikely to be materialized. We maintain that firms&#39; accumulated knowledge can make them more prone to the accumulated knowledge trap before rather than after the dominant technology has emerged. We further hypothesize that prior exploratory experiences and suppliers&#39; outsourced component knowledge can reduce firms&#39; susceptibility to such a knowledge trap before the dominant technology emergence, but their moderating roles fade away after the dominant technology emergence. Data from the U.S. Hybrid Electric Vehicle drivetrain market support our hypotheses. Our findings enrich the current literatures on the behavioral theory of the firm and technological evolution while reconciling the contrarian views in the innovation literature.},

  abstract     = {Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, global supply chains have experienced sustained impacts from unprecedented complex disruptions in different combinations and at different times. From an efficiency perspective, do these complex supply chain disruptions call for more complex risk management strategies? To answer this, we built an empirically grounded discrete event simulation model, the results of which were analyzed using data envelopment analysis. Results show that with unprecedented complex disruption patterns, a multi-strategy portfolio approach is usually less efficient than a single-strategy or a do-nothing approach unless the strategy portfolio has certain characteristics. The most efficient strategy portfolios typically consist of a moderate number of diverse strategies. Too many strategies in a portfolio can be problematic, leading to increased costs that outpace improvement in revenue and service level. Results illustrate that even a strategy that generally performs poorly can be part of a very good strategy portfolio and vice versa. This study provides nuanced and novel findings that contribute to the resolution of the literature debate about the value of multi-strategy portfolios in addressing complex disruption patterns. Highlighting the value of a strategy portfolio view, these insights help firms better prepare for the next complex and sustained global supply chain disruptions.},

  abstract     = {Retailers face a challenging trade-off in maintaining versus restricting long-established lenient return policies. On the one hand, lenient return policies have become an important part of retailers&#39; value propositions and play a significant role in stimulating consumer purchases. On the other hand, lenient return policies increase the volume of product returns, which hurts profitability. Motivated by observing an increase in restrictive changes to long-established lenient return policies, we investigate consumer reactions to such changes and their managerial implications. Through a series of experiments with diverse consumer samples, we find that restrictive changes, such as shortening return time windows or introducing restocking fees, decrease consumer trust in retailers and lead to lowered purchase, positive word-of-mouth, and loyalty intentions. We also find that providing managerial transparency, in the form of communicating the rationale for restrictive changes, can attenuate the negative consumer reactions to such changes. Moreover, rationales that emphasize the cost of handling returns versus blaming opportunistic and abusive returners are similarly effective. Our findings contribute to the growing academic literature on consumer return policy design and provide actionable insights to retail managers.},

Prior research on supplier-enabled innovation has identified various capabilities that buyers need in order to collaborate with innovative suppliers. It recognizes that suppliers also require capabilities to access buyer knowledge. However, we still know little about the role of innovation intermediaries—actors who are neither buyers nor suppliers, but still influence innovation processes and outcomes in supply networks. Our case-based research shows that intermediaries create workspaces for R&amp;D and experimentation, help to refine definitions of requirements and de-risk novel solutions, support contracting, and facilitate solution implementation. We contribute to research on supplier innovation by developing a model of intermediaries&#39; activities and underlying capabilities, and their impact on innovation sourcing outcomes. We elaborate the indirect capabilities theoretical perspective by introducing additional types of indirect capabilities for collaborative innovation in supply chains, and showing how these capabilities interrelate. We furthermore extend the literature on innovation intermediaries by elucidating hitherto unexplored capabilities for intermediation and adding insights regarding the contribution of intermediaries to open innovation processes.},

  abstract     = {Research in healthcare suggests that repeated interaction between a provider and a patient can support better decision-making, resulting in improved efficiencies. To date, these repeated interactions enabling continuity of care have not been studied in hospital inpatient settings. During a hospital stay, decisions related to patient treatment are usually made by two key decision-makers: the attending physician (AP) and the operating physician (OP). Under the single decision-making approach (S-DMA), the AP and OP are the same; in contrast, under the dual decision-making approach (D-DMA), the AP and OP are different. In recent years, there has been an increasing trend toward the use of D-DMA over S-DMA across U.S. hospitals owing to scheduling conflicts. Although research outside healthcare operations management has argued for benefits from both approaches, their impacts on a patient&#39;s hospital stay are unclear. In this study, we address this gap by investigating the effects of S-DMA and D-DMA on patient care outcomes in terms of patient length of stay (LOS), treatment cost, and mortality. Data for our study come from the state of Florida and involve 520,554 cardiology patients treated by 9483 APs and 18,398 OPs at 241 hospitals between 2014 and 2016. We account for both patient and physician selection issues when choosing a particular decision-making strategy. Our results suggest that, on average, using S-DMA is associated with reduced patient LOS and treatment cost but has no effect on mortality. We also find that S-DMA is more beneficial for patients with low comorbidity and low process uncertainty, whereas D-DMA is more beneficial for patients with high comorbidity and high process uncertainty. Our results are robust to alternative explanations. We demonstrate that a single decision-maker offers benefits in the context of healthcare delivery, but dual decision-makers may yield benefits when caring for patients with high comorbidity and high process complexity. We discuss the implications of these findings for appropriately deploying S-DMA and D-DMA in inpatient services.},

First, we adopt the least squares method without taking the data features into account to estimate the common break point and to see how the data features affect the asymptotic behaviors of the estimator. Then, an iterative least squares estimator of the common break point which accounts for the common factors in the estimation procedure is examined. Our theoretical results reveal that: (1) There is a trade-off between the overall break magnitude of the panel data and the long-range dependence for both estimators. (2) The second estimation procedure can eliminate the effects of common factors from the asymptotic behaviors of the estimator successfully, but it cannot improve the rate of convergence of the estimator in most cases. Moreover, Monte Carlo simulations are given to illustrate the theoretical results on finite-sample performance.},

The coefficients depend on time, possibly on the length of the series n , hence the name tdVARMA ( n ) for the models, but not necessarily on the rescaled time t / n . As a consequence of the dependency on n of the model, we need to consider array processes instead of stochastic processes. Under appropriate assumptions, it is shown that a Gaussian quasi-maximum likelihood estimator is consistent in probability and asymptotically normal. The theoretical results are illustrated using three examples of bivariate processes, the first two with marginal heteroscedasticity. The first example is a tdVAR ( n ) (1) process while the second example is a tdVMA ( n ) (1) process. In these two cases, the finite-sample behavior is checked via a Monte Carlo simulation study. The results are compatible with the asymptotic properties even for small . A third example shows the application of the tdVARMA models for a real time series.},

The theoretical validity of the RT-SSA bootstrap when used to approximate the sampling properties of a general class of statistics is established under regularity conditions that encompass a very broad range of data generating processes. A smeared and a boosted version of the RT-SSA bootstrap are also presented.

  abstract     = {This article deals with unit root issues in time series analysis. It has been known for a long time that unit root tests may be flawed when a series although stationary has a root close to unity. That motivated recent papers dedicated to autoregressive processes where the bridge between stability and instability is expressed by means of time-varying coefficients. The process we consider has a companion matrix A n with spectral radius ρ ⁡ ( A n ) &lt; 1 satisfying ρ ⁡ ( A n ) → 1 , a situation described as ‘nearly-unstable’. The question we investigate is: given an observed path supposed to come from a nearly unstable process, is it possible to test for the ‘extent of instability’, i.e. to test how close we are to the unit root? In this regard, we develop a strategy to evaluate and to test for : ‘ ’ against : ‘ ’ when lies in an inner -neighborhood of the unity, for some . Empirical evidence is given about the advantages of the flexibility induced by such a procedure compared to the common unit root tests. We also build a symmetric procedure for the usually left out situation where the dominant root lies around .},

  abstract     = {Many data sets in biology, medicine, and other biostatistical areas deal with matrix-valued time series. The case of a single univariate time series is very well developed in the literature; and single multi-variate series (i.e., vector time series) though less well studied have also been developed. A class of matrix time series models is introduced for dealing with situations where there are multiple sets of multi-variate time series data. Explicit expressions for a matrix autoregressive model along with its cross-autocorrelation functions are derived. Stationarity conditions are also provided. Least squares estimators and maximum likelihood estimators of the model parameters and their asymptotic properties are derived. Results are illustrated through simulation studies and a real data application.},

This approach effectively transforms these complex stochastic equations into a system of nonlinear algebraic equations that can be solved using the Newton method. Balancing polynomials are chosen for their ability to enhance stability and convergence, providing a more reliable and manageable framework for tackling challenging stochastic problems. The paper also includes a convergence analysis and error estimation for the proposed method. Additionally, the effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through four numerical examples. The results obtained from this method are compared with the exact solution and those from other established techniques, including the block-pulse function method, the shifted Jacobi operational matrix (SJOM) method, and the shifted Jacobi spectral Galerkin (SJSG) method. These comparisons highlight the superior performance and accuracy of the proposed method. All numerical computations were performed using MATLAB.},

In addition, the changes in the pressure of the surrounding cerebrospinal fluid can cause changes to the pressure of the extracellular fluid which saturates the spinal cord. The finite element method can be used to solve the differential equations, which describe both how the cord deforms and changes in the pressure of the extracellular fluid but often this requires a large number of time-steps to obtain an accurate and stable numerical solution. We present an alternative approach that uses a Fourier series method that avoids the need for using a time-stepping scheme and that can model how a pressure pulse affects the spinal cord.},

This method produces several solitary wave solutions to the current problem by supposing a series-form solution. The generalized -expansion method, on the other hand, builds on the simple -expansion method by adding more parameters to the series-form solution. This makes finding more families of solitary wave solutions possible and better shows how the system changes over time. These techniques identify various traveling waves, such as periodic, kink, -shaped, bell-shaped, shock waves and others physical solutions. Some obtained solutions are graphically discussed to better visualize the wave phenomena connected to various symmetrical solitary wave solutions. The fractional Benney–Lin equation&#39;s dynamics and wave characteristics may be better understood through these graphical depictions, which makes it easier to analyze the model&#39;s behavior in detail.},

Compared with the traditional statistical methods, understanding dynamics of an infectious disease can better make people understand some global characteristics of epidemic and help in designing appropriate strategies to control diseases. Early studies of mumps mainly focused on deterministic models. However, environmental noises are inevitable during the spread of infectious diseases. This paper extends a mumps transmission model from a deterministic to a stochastic framework and explores the dynamical behaviors of the model by constructing suitable Lyapunov functions. Our model is a six-dimensional stochastic model. The construction of suitable Lyapunov functions is very challenging. Firstly, we show that this model has a unique global positive solution for any positive initial values. Secondly, we compute the basic reproduction numbers and present sufficient conditions for the existence of a unique ergodic stationary distribution and the extinction of the disease. Finally, we perform numerical simulations and sensitivity analysis for exploring the effect of some parameters and the white noises on the behavior of the model. The theoretical results can provide necessary guidelines to public health administrators for controlling and preventing diseases.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents an HIV model with latent reservoir and a constant production rate of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). The system incorporates two delays, intracellular delay τ 1 $$ {\tau}_1 $$ and immune response delay τ 2 $$ {\tau}_2 $$ , and considers two mechanisms of viral transmission in vivo: cell-to-cell and virus-to-cell. Based on the initial condition, a key threshold in the model, namely, the basic reproduction number R 0 $$ {R}_0 $$ is obtained. Our focus is to investigate the impact of saturated immune delay on viral infection when CTLs are introduced at a constant rate. By constructing Lyapunov functionals, the stability conditions of equilibrium and equilibrium are established. Theoretical analysis indicates that equilibrium no longer remains stable and generates a Hopf bifurcation as immune delay changes. Numerical simulations are conducted to validate the main theoretical results, and sensitivity analysis is used to evaluate the impact of the parameters on the threshold. Through these simulations, the general patterns of dynamic behavior of the model are revealed. In particular, when and , the dynamics of the endemic equilibrium exhibit complex behavior.},

  abstract     = {This paper develops a novel robust and predefined-time zeroing neural network (RPZNN) to solve the time-varying linear matrix equation (TVLME) in real time by developing an innovative activation function with a time parameter t f $$ {t}_f $$ . Different from the existing ZNN solvers with complex convergence time bounds, the RPZNN solver obtains the real-time solution of the TVLME within an arbitrarily predefined time t f $$ {t}_f $$ . Moreover, the RPZNN solver can freely adjust t f $$ {t}_f $$ to accommodate the requirements for various convergence rates, demonstrating its considerable flexibility. We conduct a theoretical analysis for the predefined-time convergence of the RPZNN solver and its robustness against additive noise interference. Furthermore, numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the RPZNN in accurately addressing the TVLME and demonstrate its superior performance in terms of convergence rate and robustness when compared to several traditional or state-of-the-art ZNN solvers. Additionally, the RPZNN solver also exhibits excellent capabilities in dynamic alternating current (DAC) computing and the 6-link planar robot manipulator (6PRM) path-tracking task, highlighting its potential for wide-ranging applications.},

Additionally, we incorporate a new spectral gradient-based adaptive restart scheme to ensure the global convergence of the family under weak Wolfe line search and obtain iteration complexity results under Armijo line search.

The existence and stability of positive equilibria and the bifurcation analyses are discussed. Our numerical outcomes entail that increased zooplankton growth due to additional food leads to the disappearance of phytoplankton species, while a significant drop in nutrient levels results in zooplankton extinction within the ecosystem. Notably, the refuge by phytoplankton has a tendency to terminate the persistent oscillations and stabilize the system. As seasonal stochasticity significantly influences the dynamics of planktonic system, so we introduce seasonality into environmental noise and certain model parameters. In this case, we analyze both the regularity and the dichotomy between persistence and extinction. The numerical evidences demonstrate periodic solutions, strong/weak persistence, and plankton extinctions resulting from stochasticity and/or seasonality. Furthermore, the seasonally forced noise, intriguingly, has the capacity to exert control over hyperchaos, yielding a distinctive pattern in plankton populations.},

In order to define a proper objective function for minimization by particle swarm optimization (PSO), the constrained problem is converted into an unconstrained one through the penalty method. Furthermore, the moving least square (MLS) technique is implemented to interpolate and approximate the derivatives appeared in the equation. The main problem for challenging this combined scheme is nonlinear transient convective–radiative heat transfer in existence of a magnetic field. To study the efficiency of the MLS, the results would be contrasted with those extracted by a finite difference method (FDM) based PSO approach. Through five distinctive examples, the evolutionary diagrams as well as temperature distributions found by different methods are displayed, and the effects of the constant parameters are investigated. Besides, the simulations of this research work clearly depict good agreements of the numerical results obtained by the suggested idea with those reported in literature.},

In addition, contact heterogeneity among individuals plays a significant role in cholera transmission. In this paper, we construct a multiscale coupled immuno-cholera model considering waning vaccine-induced immunity and hyperinfectious vibrios and utilize a nested approach to bridge within-host vibrio evolution and between-host cholera transmission on complex networks. The basic reproduction numbers and for the within- and between-host models are derived, respectively, and is validated to serve as a sharp threshold between extinction and persistence of cholera. Specifically, the global asymptotic stability of each feasible equilibrium for the between-host system is established by formulating appropriate Lyapunov functionals. Numerical simulations are performed to assess the influences of within-host vibrio dynamics and network topology on between-host cholera transmission dynamics. The results show that the equilibrium level of total infected individuals is a nonmonotonic function of vibrio growth rate, implying that hampering within-host vibrio growth by drug treatment during the outbreak could alter the long-term outcomes of cholera. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of network degree distributions increases the risk of cholera outbreaks, suggesting that isolation and supervision for infected individuals with high degrees are effective measures to prevent and control cholera transmission.},

  abstract     = {The aim of this paper is to derive many novel formulas involving the sum of powers of consecutive integers, the Bernoulli polynomials, the Stirling numbers and moments arise from conditional probability, moment generating functions and arithmetic functions by using the methods and techniques, which are used in discrete distributions in statistics such as uniform distribution, moment generating functions, and other probability distributions. Moreover, relations among the generalized Euler totient function, finite distributions containing special numbers and polynomials, discrete probability formula, and other special functions are given. By using the Riemann zeta function and the Liouville function, we derive a novel moment formula for probability distribution on the set positive integers. Finally, by using approximation formulas for certain family of finite sums, we derive formulas not only for the sum of powers of consecutive integers involving the Bernoulli polynomials, but also for the conditional probability involving the Laplace rule of succession.},

Thirdly, based on the proposed FDT stability and the stochastic analysis techniques, several sufficient conditions on FDT bipartite synchronization are derived by designing a novel QGIC strategy. Significantly, the designed controller is a unified form of periodic and aperiodic cases and is only activated in the work interval.

Therefore, in this paper, with the aid of the center manifold theory and the normal form method, for general partial functional differential equations with nonlinear diffusion, the third-order normal form is firstly derived. It is locally topologically equivalent to the primitive partial functional differential equations at the Turing–Turing bifurcation point. And then the explicit formulae for the coefficients in the normal form associated with three different spatial modes are presented. As an application, a predator–prey model with predator–taxis is considered. It is theoretically revealed that the system admits the coexistence of a pair of stable steady states with a single characteristic wavelength and the coexistence of four stable steady states with different single characteristic wavelengths. Further, the parameter regions in which these phenomena will arise are quantitatively given. It is illustrated that the self-diffusion of prey and predator–taxis complement each other to promote the formation for the spatially homogeneous distributions of populations.},

The work in the article is roughly divided into two parts. The first part, due to the change of conditions, we must consider the existence and uniqueness of the solution of the system. In the second part, we show that the original system driven by Lévy noise is reduced into an effective equation. To be more accurate, the fast component equation is averaged out, and there exists an effective process converging to the original stochastic parabolic equation. The main contribution is that the obtained results can extend the existing results from the Lipschitz condition to a weaker condition with a wider application scope, that is, the non-Lipschitz condition, and the driving process is Lévy noise, which seems new in the existing literature.},

  abstract     = {In this note, we consider the initial boundary value problem for a parabolic equation with logarithmic nonlinearity, which has been studied by Chen et al. and Han. We firstly estimate the upper bound function with doubly exponential property for the weak solutions and establish the doubly exponential decay and at most doubly exponential growth criteria for the weak solutions by the logarithmic Sobolev inequality, the derivative formula for the product, the Newton–Leibniz formula, and the logarithmic properties. We secondly establish a newly infinity blow-up criterion such that the lower bound function of weak solutions is at least doubly exponential growth by the nonconcavity method and the nonincreasing property for the energy functional. We finally establish a sufficient condition such that the upper bound function with doubly exponential growth is greater than or equal to the lower bound function with doubly exponential growth by the quotient comparison principle. In addition, we also find the threshold of the doubly exponential growth and the doubly exponential decay and obtain for any as These research results improve previous results from both decay and growth.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the bifurcation, chaos, and active control of a mixed Rayleigh-Liénard oscillator with mixed time delays. First, the effects of system parameters on the supercritical pitchfork bifurcations are discussed in detail by applying the fast-slow separation method. Second, it is rigorously proved by the Melnikov method that chaotic vibration exists when the parameters of the uncontrolled system are selected above the threshold of chaos occurrence. By fine-tuning the system parameters, a criterion for designing the control parameters to make the Melnikov function non-zero is derived. In addition, the routes to chaos in controlled system are explored by bifurcation diagrams, largest Lyapunov exponents, phase portraits, Poincaré maps, basins of attraction, frequency spectra, and displacement time series. The results indicate that by properly adjusting the displacement feedback coefficient and the amplitude of parameter excitation, the chaotic motion caused by increasing of the amplitude of external excitation and strength of distributed time delay can be effectively suppressed. This research result can provide theoretical support for exploring the potential chaotic motion of other types of oscillators.},

Here, we are interested in an inverse random source problem with biharmonic operator. The same as the existing studies of inverse random source problems, some theoretical results of the corresponding direct and inverse problems have been investigated in this paper. The difference is that the source term is driven by time-fractional Brownian motion, and the spatial function in the source term needs to be determined. It has been found that, for different problems, the properties of the integrand in the corresponding stochastic integrals are distinct, which has a significant impact on the entire theoretical analysis. For the problem considered here, the lack of monotonicity in the integrand of the stochastic integrals makes the analysis more challenging. Additionally, biharmonic operators will cause some difficulties in numerical calculations.},

The proposed method overcomes the singularity at the origin and handles both models with different-shaped factors. The convergence study of the proposed method for both models is also discussed in Banach space. Five models of interest are provided to test the validity and efficiency of the proposed method.

With the definition of a definite integral, the relation between the non-polynomial divided difference and non-polynomial B-spline functions is given in terms of integration. Also, we derive a general form of the Peano kernel theorem based on a generalized Taylor expansion with the integral remainder.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the mean square exponential stability of stochastic neural networks relying on memristor with leakage delay with different types of activation functions. To this aim, we introduce a new suitable stochastic Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (SLKF) and employ Filippov solutions to derive stability criteria using It o ^ $$ \hat{o} $$ &#39;s formula. We encounter with a nonlinear matrix inequality which should be converted to a linear matrix inequality (LMI) problem by using Schur complement lemma. The proposed problem is handled by using the CVX toolbox in MATLAB software. In the numerical examples section, we bring two examples related to two- and three-dimentional memristor-based neural networks whose coefficients satisfy in the Schur complement lemma. The figures show that the employed stochastic Lyapunov functions can capture the exponential stability conditions.},

  abstract     = {Hyperthermia, also called as thermal ablation, is used to treat some advanced cancers. Numerous clinical trials indicate that hyperthermia, when combined with therapies like radiation and chemotherapy, can reduce tumor size and potentially enhance their ability to eradicate cancerous cells. Hence, it is of utmost importance to study the behavior and transmission dynamics of in vivo malignant tumors subjected to hyperthermia. To this purpose, a mathematical model has been formulated, primarily based on the reaction–diffusion equation, imposed with suitable initial and boundary conditions. As the advanced tumors usually consist of five layers, the domain is discretized into five compartments. The model is then solved analytically using the eigenvalue expansion method to determine the tumor cell volume profiles, in the presence and absence of hyperthermia. The main foci of the developed model are the discretization of the domain, variable nature of various physiological parameters involved, and its analytical solution, thereby aiming at strengthening the novelties of the present work. The model outcome and simulations obtained are compared with the previously published/clinical results to prove the validity and feasibility of the proposed work. This work is expected to provide an optimum mathematical model utilizing best mathematical techniques that can greatly aid researchers and biologists in the field of oncology to streamline the process and reduce costs associated with cancer treatment.},

However, their reliance on a single modifiable parameter limits their adaptability. This paper aims to explore generalized logistic maps with arbitrary powers, which offer greater flexibility compared to the standard logistic map. By introducing additional parameters in the form of arbitrary powers, these maps exhibit increased degrees of freedom, thus expanding their applicability across a wider spectrum of scenarios. Consequently, the conventional logistic map emerges as a specific instance within the proposed framework. The inclusion of arbitrary powers enriches system dynamics, enabling a more nuanced exploration of system behavior in diverse contexts. Through a series of illustrations, this study investigates the influence of arbitrary powers and equation parameters on equilibrium points, their positions, stability conditions, basin of attraction, and bifurcation diagrams, including the emergence of chaotic behavior.},

Symbolic computation is utilized, and the double ( G ′ / G , 1 / G ) $$ \left({G}&amp;amp;amp;#x0005E;{\prime }/G,1/G\right) $$ -expansion technique is applied to investigate the mathematical characteristics of this equation.

These solutions have applications in engineering, nonlinear physics and fiber optics, providing insights into the physical nature of wave propagation in dispersive optics media. The results obtained form a basis for understanding complex physical phenomena in the described dynamical model. The computational approach employed is demonstrated to be straightforward, versatile, potent, and effective. Additionally, the presented solutions showcase various intriguing patterns, including kink-type periodic waves, combined bright-dark periodic waves, multipeak solitons, and breather-type waves. This diverse set of solutions contributes to the interpretation of the dynamical model, illustrating its complexity.

Moreover, the paper emphasizes the significance of fractional calculus in refining classical inequalities and demonstrates how the Caputo fractional operator provides a more generalized framework for addressing problems involving non-integer order differentiation.

A central aspect of the study is the behavior of rotating micropolar fluids within a Darcy-Forchheimer porous medium, enhanced by the inclusion of electromagnetic forces. The effects of embedding nanoparticles TiO 2 and CoFe 2 O 4 in a water-based fluid are explored to reveal their influence on fluid motion and heat transfer. The thermal dynamics are scrutinized, with particular emphasis on the roles of heat absorption and viscous dissipation. Moreover, this study incorporates both endothermic and exothermic reactions in radiative flows, alongside the impact of Soret and Dufour diffusion effects. The discharge of wastewater is a critical issue in environmental management and industrial applications, underscoring the need for rigorous regulation to prevent water pollution and ensure adherence to environmental standards. This research addresses the non-Newtonian flow resulting from wastewater discharge, incorporating Arrhenius activation energy in the analysis. Furthermore, the behavior of microorganisms within the flow is studied under velocity slip conditions and a range of convective boundary conditions. Through the application of similarity transformations, the governing differential equations are derived and solved numerically using MATLAB&#39;s bvp4c solver, with results depicted through detailed graphical analysis to illustrate the fluid&#39;s complex behavior. The heat transfer rate gets reduced by 1.96% with the enhancement in the Eckert number.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we introduce an innovative hybrid discrete-continuum model that provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the intricate interactions between tumor cells, immune cells, and the effects of immunotherapy. This study distinguishes itself by addressing the limitations of traditional diffusion models, which often fail to capture the irregular and nonlocal movements of cells within the complex tumor microenvironment. To overcome these challenges, we employ fractional time derivatives and the fractional Laplacian operator, offering a more accurate representation of anomalous diffusion processes that are critical in cancer dynamics. Our research begins with a rigorous mathematical analysis, where we establish the global existence of a unique mild solution, laying a solid theoretical foundation for the model. A key innovation of our study is the introduction of the “invasion threshold,” a critical parameter inspired by the next-generation operator used in epidemiological modeling. This threshold provides a powerful tool for determining the existence and stability of equilibrium points, offering deep insights into the conditions that either promote or inhibit tumor growth under immunotherapeutic interventions. By integrating a hybrid discrete-continuum approach, we capture the individual behavior of each cell, allowing for a more detailed exploration of the dynamic interplay within the tumor microenvironment. This model not only advances our understanding of tumor-immune interactions but also holds potential for informing more effective therapeutic strategies, making a significant contribution to the field of mathematical oncology.},

On the other hand, we use the bifurcation theory to qualitatively analyze the equation and find the model has periodic solutions, bell-shaped soliton solutions, and solitary wave solutions via phase diagrams. The topological stability of the solutions with respect to the parameters is explored in order to better understand the effect of parameters perturbations on the stability of the model&#39;s solutions.

To start with, achieving diverse solitary wave solutions to the generalized power-law model involves using wave transformation, which reduces the model to a nonlinear ordinary differential equation. A direct integration approach is adopted to construct solutions in the beginning. This brings the emergence of interesting solutions like non-topological solitons, trigonometric functions, exponential functions, elliptic functions, and Weierstrass functions in general structures. Besides, in a bid to secure more general exact solutions to the model, one adopts the extended Jacobi elliptic function expansion technique (for some specific cases of n $$ n $$ ). Thus, various cnoidal, snoidal, and dnoidal wave solutions to the understudied model are attained. The copolar trio explicated in a tabular form reveals that these solutions can be relapsed to various hyperbolic and trigonometric functions under certain criteria. Additionally, diverse graphical exhibitions of the dynamical attributes of the gained results are presented in a bid to have a sound understanding of the physical phenomena of the underlying model. Later, one gives the conserved vectors of the aforementioned equation by employing the standard multiplier approach.},

  abstract     = {The study focuses on the fractional complex order plant model, which has gained popularity in applied mathematics, physics, and control systems. A significant contribution of this research lies in discussing the physical phenomena associated with complex plant models and their impact on system stability and robustness. The main purpose of the method presented in this paper is to tune the controller parameters to ensure the stability and robustness of the system. There are methods presented in the literature for this purpose. One of these methods is to keep the phase curve in the system frequency response flat within a certain range. However, this process is based on equating the derivative of the phase value to zero at a certain frequency and adds great mathematical complexity to the calculations. In this study, reliable analytical formulas are presented for the same purpose using a graphical approach. Since the fractional complex order plant model represents the most general mathematical form, it enables easy creation of other plant models, including integer order and fractional order plant. The reason why this plant is chosen is that this structure can be named as the universal plant, which all other structures can be built by making little variations. For instance, a transfer function having integer, real and/or complex number coefficients and/or orders can be obtained by proper determination of the parameters of the universal plant. A time delay can also be added towards researcher&#39;s desire. The main inspiration comes from studying on an inclusive plant. The method in this paper intends to tune the well-known classical Proportional Integral Derivative controller. Thus, effectiveness of the integer order controller on various plants will be shown. This approach provides analytical calculation equations for the physical modifications of plants with integer, fractional, and/or complex coefficients and/or orders. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated visually with different examples that include these different possible situations. The results observed in the changes of the parameters in the transfer functions were also examined. Thus, pros and cons of the variations of integer, fractional, and complex numbers on system parameters have been shown.},

  abstract     = {In population biology, the interplay between prey and predators in the presence of infection can give rise to complex dynamics. On the flip side, implementing harvesting is an infection control measure. In the present work, we use the dynamical system theory to discuss the dynamics of the harvested prey–predator system in the presence of infection in prey species. Detailed mathematical and numerical evaluations have been presented to discuss the susceptible-free state, infection-free state, predator-free state, species coexistence, stability, and occurrence of various bifurcations (saddle-node, transcritical, and Hopf bifurcation). The study reveals the impact of harvesting parameters on the dynamics. Interestingly, we observe that an infection-free state could be achieved by varying the harvesting parameter under all three harvesting schemes (linear, quadratic, and nonlinear). Moreover, with the help of reproduction number, we claim that linear harvesting is more effective in controlling the infection than quadratic and nonlinear harvesting provided the half-saturation constant for nonlinear harvesting is greater than a threshold value ( = 1 ) $$ \left(&amp;amp;amp;#x0003D;1\right) $$ ; otherwise, nonlinear harvesting is more effective. Also, the system can support more susceptible prey in the presence of harvesting. The present theoretical study suggests different threshold values of implemented harvesting to control the disease.},

The threshold R 0 $$ {R}_0 $$ of model and the expressions of the disease-free equilibrium and the endemic equilibrium are calculated, proving the existence of backward bifurcation. Backward bifurcation is caused by the imperfect protection rate of susceptible population due to education. Using China&#39;s actual data for parameter fitting, it is found that new HIV infections are on an upward trend. In response to this phenomenon, publicity and education, condoms, screening, and treatment of infected populations are considered as control measures. It is concluded that publicity and education is the primary strategy. This measure can not only effectively reduce the number of infected populations but also effectively increase the awareness rate of HIV-infected populations. It is recommended to use condoms and have fewer sexual partners during sexual contact. Numerical simulation verifies that early stage publicity and education are much more important than post-infection screening and treatment measures.},

  abstract     = {The Boltzmann equation is a typical example of partially dissipative equations, where the linearized collision operator is positive definite with respect to the microscopic part and the dissipation of the hydrodynamic part is discovered from the coupling structure between the transport operator and the linearized collision operator. Guo and Wang (Comm. Partial Differential Equations, 37, 2012) developed a general energy method for proving the optimal time decay rates of the solution to such type of equations in the whole space; however, the decay rate of the highest order spatial derivatives of the solution is not optimal. In this paper, by incorporating the high-low frequency decomposition in the energy estimates, both linearly and nonlinearly, we prove the optimal decay rates of any high order spatial derivatives of the low frequency part of the solution to the Boltzmann equation and the almost exponential decay rate of the high frequency part, which imply in particular the optimal decay rate of the highest order spatial derivatives of the solution. Moreover, the velocity-weighted assumption of the initial data required in Guo and Wang (Comm. Partial Differential Equations, 37, 2012) is removed by capturing the time-weighted dissipation estimates via the time-weighted energy method. The method can be applied to the compressible Navier–Stokes equations and many partially dissipative equations in kinetic theory and fluid dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Quantum graphs model processes in complex systems represented as spatial networks in various fields of natural science and technology. An example is the oscillations of elastic string networks, the nodes of which, besides the continuity conditions, also obey the Kirchhoff conditions, expressing the balance of tensions. In this paper, we propose a new look at quantum graphs as temporal networks, which means that the variable parametrizing the edges of a graph is interpreted as time, while each internal vertex is a branching point giving several different scenarios for the further trajectory of a process. Then Kirchhoff-type conditions may also arise. Namely, they will be satisfied by such a trajectory of the process that is optimal with account of all the scenarios simultaneously. By employing the recent concept of global delay, we extend the problem of damping a first-order control system with aftereffect, considered earlier only on an interval, to an arbitrary tree graph. The first means that the delay, imposed starting from the initial moment of time, associated with the root of the tree, propagates through all internal vertices. Bringing the system into the equilibrium and minimizing the energy functional with account of the anticipated probability of each scenario, we come to a variational problem. Then, we establish its equivalence to a self-adjoint boundary value problem on the tree for some second-order equations involving both the global delay and the global advance. The unique solvability of both problems is proved. We also illustrate that the interval case when the coefficients of the equation are discrete stochastic processes in discrete time can be viewed as the extension to a tree.},

Applying the Floquet-Bloch transform to the scattering problem yields a family of quasi-periodic boundary value problems dependent on the Floquet-Bloch parameter. Consequently, the solution of the original scattering problem is written as the inverse Floquet-Bloch transform of the solutions to these boundary value problems. The key step in our method is the numerical approximation of this integral transform by a quadrature rule with a nonuniform choice of quadrature points adapted to the regularity of the family of quasi-periodic solutions. This achieved by a graded subdivision of the full interval for the Floquet-Bloch parameter and applying a Gauss-Legrendre quadrature rule on each subinterval. We prove that the numerical method converges exponentially with respect to both the number of subintervals and the number of Gaussian quadrature points. Some numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the results.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the chaotic analysis and attractive domain of a fractional-order Φ 6 -van der Pol with time delay velocity under harmonic excitation. Firstly, eight different types of bifurcation states of the system under different parameters are calculated by using the undisturbed system. Secondly, the Melnikov method is used to explore the effect of time delay velocity on the threshold of chaos in the Smale horseshoe sense under the double-well potential and three-well potential of the system. Finally, through numerical analysis of the phase diagram, bifurcation diagram, and maximum Lyapunov exponent, the influence of time delay velocity on system chaos is studied. The results indicate that an increase in the delay velocity coefficient will lead to the system transitioning from a chaotic state to a periodic state, while an increase in the delay velocity term will lead to the system transitioning from a periodic state to a chaotic state. In the study of system bifurcation, it is found that the position of the equilibrium points of the system changes during periodic motion. Therefore, cell mapping is used to draw the attractive domain of the system is studying the influence of initial conditions on the equilibrium point of the system and the results show that there is a close relationship between the attraction domain and the process of chaos occurrence.},

  abstract     = {As many countries are hit by the social economic impact of heroin addiction, there is an urgent need to have an effective awareness program that focuses on educating the population on the danger of heroin addiction and helping the heroin-users quit. This paper aims to study the effect of the awareness program on the spread of heroin dependence using a mathematical model with distributed delay. First, we show the existence threshold parameter R 0 $$ {\mathfrak{R}}_0 $$ , which we call the basic reproduction number of the spread of heroin use. We prove, via the Lyapunov direct method, that the drug-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable if R 0 &lt; 1 $$ {\mathfrak{R}}_0&amp;amp;lt;1 $$ . If R 0 &gt; 1 $$ {\mathfrak{R}}_0&amp;amp;gt;1 $$ , the drug dependence persists, and the drug equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. We give three possible scenarios to find the optimal awareness program strategy that puts the heroin epidemic under control. These scenarios take into consideration the reachability of the population, the immunity against heroin addiction, and the effectiveness of the program to contain the use of heroin in the population and bring R 0 $$ {\mathfrak{R}}_0 $$ below one.},

In this framework, this information is obtained from the immediate consequences operator and ensuring its continuity is fundamental for making sure the computation of this information in a countable number of iterations.

  abstract     = {In this article, the inverse problems for the wave equation in a medium in which multiple types of cavities and inclusion exist in a mixture are considered. From the point of view of the indicator function of the enclosure method, there are two types of heterogeneous parts: “minus group” and “plus group.” For example, cavities with the Dirichlet boundary condition belong to the minus group, while inclusions with smaller propagation velocity belong to the plus group. The heterogeneous part of the minus group gives a negative sign to the indicator function, and the heterogeneous part of the plus group gives a positive sign. In general, the presence of many types of heterogeneous parts causes cancelation of the sign of the indicator function. Such cases are referred to as “mixed cases.” Here, we consider the case that the shortest length obtained from the indicator function is attained only by heterogeneous parts of the same group. This case is called the “mixed but separated case,” and it is shown that the method of elliptic estimates developed by Ikehata works well. We also show that the case of a two-layered background medium with a flat layer can be considered in the same way as the case of a homogeneous background medium.},

In the inertial, linear, and non-degenerate case, the hyperbolic-parabolic coupled problem is posed through a dynamics operator on a chosen energy space, adapted from Stokes-Lamé coupled dynamics. A semigroup approach is utilized to circumvent issues associated to mismatched trace regularities at the interface. The generation of a strongly continuous semigroup for the dynamics operator is obtained via a non-standard maximality argument. The latter employs a mixed-variational formulation in order to invoke the Babuška-Brezzi theorem. The Lumer-Philips theorem then yields semigroup generation, and thereby, strong and generalized solutions are obtained. For the linear dynamics, density obtains the existence of weak solutions; we extend to the case where the Biot compressibility of constituents degenerates. Thus, for the inertial linear Biot-Stokes filtration system, we provide a clear elucidation of strong solutions and a construction of weak solutions, as well as their regularity through associated estimates.},

  abstract     = {Viral load (VL) in the respiratory tract is the leading proxy for assessing infectiousness potential. Understanding the dynamics of disease-related VL within the host is of great importance, as it helps to determine different policies and health recommendations. However, normally the VL is measured on individuals only once, in order to confirm infection, and furthermore, the infection date is unknown. It is therefore necessary to develop statistical approaches to estimate the typical VL trajectory. We show here that, under plausible parametric assumptions, two measures of VL on infected individuals can be used to accurately estimate the VL mean function. Specifically, we consider a discrete-time likelihood-based approach to modeling and estimating partial observed longitudinal samples. We study a multivariate normal model for a function of the VL that accounts for possible correlation between measurements within individuals. We derive an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm which treats the unknown time origins and the missing measurements as latent variables. Our main motivation is the reconstruction of the daily mean VL, given measurements on patients whose VLs were measured multiple times on different days. Such data should and can be obtained at the beginning of a pandemic with the specific goal of estimating the VL dynamics. For demonstration purposes, the method is applied to SARS-Cov-2 cycle-threshold-value data collected in Israel.},

Defined as the area under the survival function up to a time horizon τ &gt; 0 $$ \tau &gt;0 $$ , the RMST can be interpreted as the life expectancy within the time interval [ 0 , τ ] $$ \left[0,\tau \right] $$ . In addition to its straightforward interpretation, the RMST allows for the definition of valid estimands for the causal analysis of treatment contrasts in medical studies. In this work, we introduce a non-parametric approach to model the RMST conditional on a set of baseline variables (including, e.g., treatment variables and confounders). Our method is based on a direct modeling strategy for the RMST, using leave-one-out jackknife pseudo-values within a random forest regression framework. In this way, it can be employed to obtain precise estimates of both patient-specific RMST values and confounder-adjusted treatment contrasts. Since our method (termed “pseudo-value random forest”, PVRF) is model-free, RMST estimates are not affected by restrictive assumptions like the proportional hazards assumption. Particularly, PVRF offers a high flexibility in detecting relevant covariate effects from higher-dimensional data, thereby expanding the range of existing pseudo-value modeling techniques for RMST estimation. We investigate the properties of our method using simulations and illustrate its use by an application to data from the SUCCESS-A breast cancer trial. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that PVRF yields accurate estimates of both patient-specific RMST values and RMST-based treatment contrasts.},

  abstract     = {The accessibility of individual participant-level data (IPD) enhances the evaluation of moderation effects of patient covariates. It facilitates the provision of accurate estimation of intervention effects and confidence intervals by incorporating covariate correlations across multiple clinical trials. With a time-to-event outcome, Cox regression can be applied for network meta-analysis (NMA) using IPD. However, there lacks comprehensive reviews and comparisons of the specifications and assumptions of these Cox models and their impact on the interpretation of hazard ratios, effect moderation, and trial heterogeneity in IPD-NMA. In this paper, we examine various Cox models for IPD-NMA and compare different approaches to modeling trial, treatment, and covariate effects.

  abstract     = {Identifying and quantifying predictive biomarkers is a critical issue of personalized medicine approaches and patient-centric clinical development strategies. In early stages of the development process, significant challenges and numerous uncertainties arise. One of the challenges is the ability to assess the predictive value of a biomarker, i.e., the difference in primary outcomes between experimental and placebo arms above and below a certain threshold of the biomarker. Indeed, when the accumulated information is very limited and the sample size is small, preliminary conclusions about the predictive properties of the biomarker might be misleading. To date, the majority of investigations regarding the predictiveness of biomarkers were in the setting of moderate-to-large sample sizes. In this work, we propose a novel flexible approach inspired by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Distance in order to assess the predictiveness of a continuous biomarker in a clinical setting where the sample size is small. Via simulations we show that the proposed method allows to achieve a higher power to declare predictiveness compared to the existing methods under a range of scenarios, whilst still maintaining a control of the type I error at a pre-specified level.},

We present a framework for decision-making based on a three-endpoint win odds. We discuss properties of the win odds and suggest that it can be interpreted, for decision-making, as the reciprocal of an average hazard ratio for overall survival. We confirm the performance of the decision-making method using simulation studies and a clinical trial case study. As part of this work, we describe the simulation of correlated patient-level oncology endpoints using a multi-state model of disease. This model can provide clinically realistic data for testing the performance of analysis methods.

  abstract     = {In oncology clinical trials, tumor burden (TB) stands as a crucial longitudinal biomarker, reflecting the toll a tumor takes on a patient&#39;s prognosis. With certain treatments, the disease&#39;s natural progression shows the tumor burden initially receding before rising once more. Biologically, the point of change may be different between individuals and must have occurred between the baseline measurement and progression time of the patient, implying a random effects model obeying a bound constraint. However, in practice, patients may drop out of the study due to progression or death, presenting a non-ignorable missing data problem. In this paper, we introduce a novel joint model that combines time-to-event data and longitudinal data, where the latter is parameterized by a random change point augmented by random pre-slope and post-slope dynamics. Importantly, the model is equipped to incorporate covariates across the longitudinal and survival models, adding significant flexibility. Adopting a Bayesian approach, we propose an efficient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm for parameter inference. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to a longitudinal-only model via simulations and apply our method to a data set in oncology.

This study introduces a novel graph-theoretic approach to detect FOG from video data of PD patients. We construct a sequence of pose graphs that represent the spatial relations and temporal progression of a patient&#39;s posture over time. Each graph node corresponds to an estimated joint position, while the edges reflect the anatomical connections and their proximity. We propose a hypothesis testing procedure that deploys the Fréchet statistics to identify break points in time between regular gait and FOG episodes, where we model the central tendency and dispersion of the pose graphs in the presentation of graph Laplacian matrices by computing their Fréchet mean and variance. We implement binary segmentation and incremental computation in our algorithm for efficient calculation. The proposed framework is validated on two datasets, Kinect3D and AlphaPose, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting FOG from video data. The proposed approach that extracts matrix features is distinct from the prevailing pixel-based deep learning methods. It provides a new perspective on feature extraction for FOG detection and potentially contributes to improved diagnosis and treatment of PD.},

  abstract     = {While well-established methods for time-to-event data are available when the proportional hazards assumption holds, there is no consensus on the best inferential approach under non-proportional hazards (NPH). However, a wide range of parametric and non-parametric methods for testing and estimation in this scenario have been proposed. To provide recommendations on the statistical analysis of clinical trials where non-proportional hazards are expected, we conducted a simulation study under different scenarios of non-proportional hazards, including delayed onset of treatment effect, crossing hazard curves, subgroups with different treatment effects, and changing hazards after disease progression. We assessed type I error rate control, power, and confidence interval coverage, where applicable, for a wide range of methods, including weighted log-rank tests, the MaxCombo test, summary measures such as the restricted mean survival time (RMST), average hazard ratios, and milestone survival probabilities, as well as accelerated failure time regression models. We found a trade-off between interpretability and power when choosing an analysis strategy under NPH scenarios. While analysis methods based on weighted logrank tests typically were favorable in terms of power, they do not provide an easily interpretable treatment effect estimate. Also, depending on the weight function, they test a narrow null hypothesis of equal hazard functions, and rejection of this null hypothesis may not allow for a direct conclusion of treatment benefit in terms of the survival function. In contrast, non-parametric procedures based on well-interpretable measures like the RMST difference had lower power in most scenarios. Model-based methods based on specific survival distributions had larger power; however, often gave biased estimates and lower than nominal confidence interval coverage. The application of the studied methods is illustrated in a case study with reconstructed data from a phase III oncologic trial.},

In particular, type 2 hybrid studies support research that places equal importance on both outcomes rather than focusing on one and secondarily on the other (i.e., type 1 and type 3 studies). Hybrid 2 studies introduce the statistical issue of multiple testing, complicated by the fact that they are typically also cluster randomized trials. Standard statistical methods do not apply in this scenario. Here, we describe the design methodologies available for validly powering hybrid type 2 studies and producing reliable sample size calculations in a cluster-randomized design with a focus on binary outcomes. Through a literature search, 18 publications were identified that included methods relevant to the design of hybrid 2 studies. Five methods were identified, two of which did not account for clustering but are extended in this article to do so, namely the combined outcomes approach and the single 1-degree of freedom combined test. Procedures for powering hybrid 2 studies using these five methods are described and illustrated using input parameters inspired by a study from the Community Intervention to Reduce CardiovascuLar Disease in Chicago (CIRCL-Chicago) Implementation Research Center. In this illustrative example, the intervention effectiveness outcome was controlled blood pressure, and the implementation outcome was reach. The conjunctive test resulted in higher power than the popular p value adjustment methods, and the newly extended combined outcomes and single 1-DF test were found to be the most powerful among all of the tests.},

  abstract     = {The adoption of seamless Phase II/III designs has grown in popularity as a strategy to potentially accelerate the drug development. Making well-informed decisions regarding the drug&#39;s potential and addressing important clinical inquiries at the conclusion of the exploratory phase has become a critical step. In response to the increased emphasis on dose optimization, it becomes logical to integrate treatment arm/dose selections into Phase II and implement corresponding design adjustments. Within this framework, employing a fixed sample size presents challenges due to limited information availability before the trial planning and elevated development risks. Furthermore, practical and feasibility considerations have led to the increased utilization of surrogate endpoints for making interim decisions. In this study, we introduce a novel framework for a seamless Phase II/III design involving multiple treatment arms, leveraging Bayesian predictive probability of success (PPoS) for both treatment arm selection and interim sample size re-estimation (SSR) using surrogate endpoints. The proposed design demonstrates improved performance, including a higher likelihood of selecting favorable treatment arm, increased overall statistical power, and reduced average event sizes and trial durations compared to traditional separate Phase II and III designs, as well as other seamless Phase II/III designs without SSR or of which treatment arm selection is based on conditional power. We also showcase the implementation of the proposed design through a case study in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).},

  abstract     = {Dietary intake data are routinely drawn upon to explore diet-health relationships, and inform clinical practice and public health. However, these data are almost always subject to measurement error, distorting true diet-health relationships. Beyond measurement error, there are likely complex synergistic and sometimes antagonistic interactions between different dietary components, complicating the relationships between diet and health outcomes. Flexible models are required to capture the nuance that these complex interactions introduce. This complexity makes research on diet-health relationships an appealing candidate for the application of modern machine learning techniques, and in particular, neural networks. Neural networks are computational models that can capture highly complex, nonlinear relationships, so long as sufficient data are available. While these models have been applied in many domains, the impacts of measurement error on the performance of predictive modeling have not been widely investigated. In this work, we demonstrate the ways in which measurement error erodes the performance of neural networks and illustrate the care that is required for leveraging these models in the presence of error. We demonstrate the role that sample size and replicate measurements play in model performance, indicate a motivation for the investigation of transformations to additivity, and illustrate the caution required to prevent model overfitting. While the past performance of neural networks across various domains makes them an attractive candidate for examining diet-health relationships, our work demonstrates that substantial care and further methodological development are both required to observe increased predictive performance when applying these techniques compared to more traditional statistical procedures.},

  abstract     = {In oncology studies, the assumption of proportional hazards is often questionable due to factors such as the presence of cured patients, a delayed treatment benefit, and possible treatment switching. The restricted mean survival time (RMST) has emerged as a valuable alternative summary measure to the hazard ratio (HR) in this scenario as it provides a clinically meaningful interpretation of treatment benefit without additional assumptions. As a commonly used primary endpoint, progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of death or progression of disease (PD). However, PFS involves dual observation processes where, in practice, the exact death time is typically recorded, but PD is interval-censored. This feature is also present in other commonly used primary endpoints, including event-free survival, disease-free survival, and relapse-free survival. The conventional approach imputes the PD time with the right boundary of the time interval during which the PD occurs. This paper presents alternative estimation and inference approaches to estimate RMST with a mixture of right-censored and interval-censored data. Different approaches are explored by simulation under various plausible scenarios for oncology clinical trials with regard to the assessment frequency, randomness in the actual assessment times, and size of treatment effect. The choice of the restricted time point in RMST is also explored. The simulation results indicate that the RMST estimators that take account of the interval censoring inherent in the data are unbiased and more accurate than the conventional estimators, while the performance for two-group comparisons is comparable. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed estimators is contingent on the scheduled assessment plan and patients&#39; visit window.},

  abstract     = {Disparities in health or well-being experienced by minority groups can be difficult to study using the traditional exposure-outcome paradigm in causal inference, since potential outcomes in variables such as race or sexual minority status are challenging to interpret. Causal decomposition analysis addresses this gap by positing causal effects on disparities under interventions to other intervenable exposures that may play a mediating role in the disparity. While invoking weaker assumptions than causal mediation approaches, decomposition analyses are often conducted in observational settings and require uncheckable assumptions that eliminate unmeasured confounders. Leveraging the marginal sensitivity model, we develop a sensitivity analysis for weighted causal decomposition estimators and use the percentile bootstrap to construct valid confidence intervals for causal effects on disparities. We also propose a two-parameter reformulation that enhances interpretability and facilitates an intuitive understanding of the plausibility of unmeasured confounders and their effects. We illustrate our framework on a study examining the effect of parental support on disparities in suicidal ideation among sexual minority youth. We find that the effect is small and sensitive to unmeasured confounding, suggesting that further screening studies are needed to identify mitigating interventions in this vulnerable population.},

We had three objectives: first, to describe methods for using IPTW to estimate the effects of treatments in settings with competing risks; second, to illustrate the application of these methods using empirical analyses; and third, to conduct Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the relative performance of three methods for estimating time-specific risk differences and time-specific relative risks in settings with competing risks. In doing so, we provide guidance to applied biostatisticians and clinical investigators on the use of IPTW in settings with competing risks. We examined three estimators of time-specific risk differences and relative risks: the weighted Aalen–Johansen estimator, an estimator that combines IPTW with inverse probability of censoring weights (IPTW-IPCWs), and a double-robust augmented IPTW estimator combined with IPCW (AIPTW-IPCW). The design of our simulations reflected clinically realistic scenarios. Our simulations found that all three estimators tended to result in unbiased estimations of time-specific risk differences and time-specific relative risks. However, the weighted Aalen–Johansen estimator and the AIPTW-IPCW estimator tended to result in estimates with greater precision compared to the IPTW-IPCW estimator. In our empirical analyses, we illustrated the application of these methods by estimating the effect of statin prescribing on the risk of subsequent cardiovascular death in patients discharged from the hospital with a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction.},

In many cases, these changes involve simple substitutions.

The question about such dietary substitution strategies seeks to estimate the average counterfactual outcome under a hypothetical intervention that replaces a food an individual would have consumed in the absence of intervention with a healthier substitute. In this work, we will show the conditions under which the average causal effects of substitution strategies can be non-parametrically identified, and provide efficient estimators for our proposed dietary substitution strategies.

We demonstrate that SVM can be used to balance covariates and estimate average causal effects under the unconfoundedness assumption. Specifically, we adapt the SVM classifier as a kernel-based weighting procedure that minimizes the maximum mean discrepancy between the treatment and control groups while simultaneously maximizing effective sample size. We also show that SVM is a continuous relaxation of the quadratic integer program for computing the largest balanced subset, establishing its direct relation to the cardinality matching method. Another important feature of SVM is that the regularization parameter controls the trade-off between covariate balance and effective sample size. As a result, the existing SVM path algorithm can be used to compute the balance-sample size frontier. We characterize the bias of causal effect estimation arising from this trade-off, connecting the proposed SVM procedure to the existing kernel balancing methods. Finally, we conduct simulation and empirical studies to evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology and find that SVM is competitive with the state-of-the-art covariate balancing methods.},

With rich longitudinal measurements, it is of great interest to model certain subject-specific time-varying covariate effects. In this paper, we propose an individualized time-varying nonparametric model by leveraging the subgroup information from the population. The proposed method approximates the time-varying covariate effect using nonparametric B-splines and aggregates the estimated nonparametric coefficients that share common patterns. Moreover, the proposed method can effectively handle various missing data patterns that frequently arise in mobile health data. Specifically, our method achieves subgrouping by flexibly accommodating varying dimensions of B-spline coefficients due to missingness. This capability sets it apart from other fusion-type approaches for subgrouping. The subgroup information can also potentially provide meaningful insight into the characteristics of subjects and assist in recommending an effective treatment or intervention. An efficient ADMM algorithm is developed for implementation. Our numerical studies and application to mobile health data on monitoring pregnant women&#39;s deep sleep and physical activities demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better performance compared to other existing methods.},

Such data pose problems for variable selection and prediction, especially when the covariate-response relationship is complicated. To address these challenges, we propose to incorporate external information on the covariates into Bayesian additive regression trees (BART), a sum-of-trees prediction model that utilizes priors on the tree parameters to prevent overfitting. To incorporate external information, an empirical Bayes (EB) framework is developed that estimates, assisted by a model, prior covariate weights in the BART model. The proposed EB framework enables the estimation of the other prior parameters of BART as well, rendering an appealing and computationally efficient alternative to cross-validation. We show that the method finds relevant covariates and that it improves prediction compared to default BART in simulations. If the covariate-response relationship is non-linear, the method benefits from the flexibility of BART to outperform regression-based learners. Finally, the benefit of incorporating external information is shown in an application to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma prognosis based on clinical covariates, gene mutations, DNA translocations, and DNA copy number data.},

We propose a general framework for the assessment of complex heterogeneity in the strength of a surrogate marker, as well as corresponding parametric and semiparametric estimation procedures. Our framework defines the proportion of the treatment effect on the primary outcome that is explained by the treatment effect on the surrogate, as a function of multiple baseline covariates, W $$ \mathbf{W} $$ .

  abstract     = {A common concern in non-inferiority (NI) trials is that non-adherence due, for example, to poor study conduct can make treatment arms artificially similar. Because intention-to-treat analyses can be anti-conservative in this situation, per-protocol analyses are sometimes recommended. However, such advice does not consider the estimands framework, nor the risk of bias from per-protocol analyses. We therefore sought to update the above guidance using the estimands framework, and compare estimators to improve on the performance of per-protocol analyses. We argue the main threat to validity of NI trials is the occurrence of “trial-specific” intercurrent events (IEs), that is, IEs which occur in a trial setting, but would not occur in practice. To guard against erroneous conclusions of non-inferiority, we suggest an estimand using a hypothetical strategy for trial-specific IEs should be employed, with handling of other non-trial-specific IEs chosen based on clinical considerations. We provide an overview of estimators that could be used to estimate a hypothetical estimand, including inverse probability weighting (IPW), and two instrumental variable approaches (one using an informative Bayesian prior on the effect of standard treatment, and one using a treatment-by-covariate interaction as an instrument). We compare them, using simulation in the setting of all-or-nothing compliance in two active treatment arms, and conclude both IPW and the instrumental variable method using a Bayesian prior are potentially useful approaches, with the choice between them depending on which assumptions are most plausible for a given trial.},

  abstract     = {Stepped wedge cluster-randomized trial (CRTs) designs randomize clusters of individuals to intervention sequences, ensuring that every cluster eventually transitions from a control period to receive the intervention under study by the end of the study period. The analysis of stepped wedge CRTs is usually more complex than parallel-arm CRTs due to more complex intra-cluster correlation structures. A further challenge in the analysis of closed-cohort stepped wedge CRTs, which follow groups of individuals enrolled in each period longitudinally, is the occurrence of dropout. This is particularly problematic in studies of individuals at high risk for mortality, which causes nonignorable missing outcomes. If not appropriately addressed, missing outcomes from death will erode statistical power, at best, and bias treatment effect estimates, at worst. Joint longitudinal-survival models can accommodate informative dropout and missingness patterns in longitudinal studies. Specifically, within the joint longitudinal-survival modeling framework, one directly models the dropout process via a time-to-event submodel together with the longitudinal outcome of interest. The two submodels are then linked using a variety of possible association structures. This work extends linear mixed-effects models by jointly modeling the dropout process to accommodate informative missing outcome data in closed-cohort stepped wedge CRTs. We focus on constant intervention and general time-on-treatment effect parametrizations for the longitudinal submodel and study the performance of the proposed methodology using Monte Carlo simulation under several data-generating scenarios. We illustrate the joint modeling methodology in practice by reanalyzing data from the “Frail Older Adults: Care in Transition” (ACT) trial, a stepped wedge CRT of a multifaceted geriatric care model versus usual care in 35 primary care practices in the Netherlands.},

However, this hypothesis is quite restrictive and may yield misleading results. Our objective here is to easily check such a modeling assumption for any continuous fixed covariate. For this purpose, we examine the appropriateness of a nonparametric test criterion based on a penalty-modified version of the Akaike information criterion. An extensive numerical study is conducted to check the validity of the test within the joint modeling framework, while determining the extent to which the function embedding the continuous covariate deviates from linearity. Furthermore, once a deviation from linearity is detected, the improvement in the model&#39;s predictive performance is examined. The usefulness of the testing procedure is illustrated using a clinical trial with HIV-infected subjects.

A multitude of alternative methods have been developed which can reduce the risk of bias due to model misspecification. Investigators can now choose between many forms of matching, weighting, doubly robust, and machine learning methods. We review key concepts related to functional form assumptions and how those can contribute to bias from model misspecification. We then categorize the three frameworks for modeling treatment effects and the wide variety of estimation methods that can be applied to each framework. We consider why machine learning methods have been widely proposed for estimation and review the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches. We apply a range of these methods in re-analyzing a landmark case study. In the application, we examine how several widely used methods may be subject to bias from model misspecification.

By focusing only on imputing the dropout zeros, we developed a new imputation tool, scRecover. Our approach utilizes a zero-inflated negative binomial framework to model the gene expression of each gene in each cell, enabling the estimation of zero-dropout probability. Additionally, we employ a modified version of the Good and Toulmin model to identify true zeros for each gene. To achieve imputation, scRecover is combined with other imputation methods such as scImpute, SAVER and MAGIC. Down-sampling experiments show that it recovers dropout zeros with higher accuracy and avoids over-imputing true zero values.

  abstract     = {The high-throughput biomedical technology enables measurement of thousands of gene expression levels contemporaneously. A major task in analyzing these gene expression data is to identify both over-expressed and under-expressed genes. The popular two-group models select the non-null genes without further classifying them as overexpression or underexpression. Consequently, two-group decision rules are unable to constrain the numbers of falsely discovered over-expressed or under-expressed genes respectively. We propose a general three-group model that allows dependence between the test statistics and develop a decision rule that separately controls the two types of false discoveries. We show that the optimal decision rule in our three-group model has a special monotonic structure. By making use of this monotonic structure, we can linearize the two-directional false discovery rate constraints. We prove that our decision rule optimizes the expected number of true discoveries while controlling the proportions of falsely discovered over-expressed and under-expressed genes at desired levels simultaneously. The data-driven versions of the proposed procedures are suggested, and their consistency is established. Comparisons with state-of-the-art approaches and applications to genomic studies show that our procedures work well.},

  abstract     = {Summary-data Mendelian randomization (MR), a widely used approach in causal inference, has recently attracted attention for improving causal mediation analysis. Two existing methods corresponding to the difference method and product method of linear mediation analysis have been developed to perform MR-based mediation analysis using the inverse-variance weighted method (MR-IVW). Despite these developments, there is still a need for more rigorous, efficient, and precise MR-based mediation methodologies. In this study, we develop summary-data MR-based frameworks for causal mediation analysis. We improve the accuracy, statistical efficiency and robustness of the existing MR-based mediation analysis by implementing novel variance estimators for the mediation effects, deriving rigorous procedures for statistical inference, and accounting for widespread pleiotropic effects. Specifically, we propose Diff-IVW and Prod-IVW to improve upon the existing methods and provide the pleiotropy-robust methods (Diff-Egger, Diff-Median, Prod-Egger, and Prod-Median), adapted from MR-Egger and MR-Median, to enhance the robustness of the MR-based mediation analysis. We conduct comprehensive simulation studies to compare the existing and proposed methods. The results show that the proposed methods, Diff-IVW and Prod-IVW, improve statistical efficiency and type I error control over the existing approaches. Although all IVW-based methods suffer from directional pleiotropy biases, the median-based methods (Diff-Median and Prod-Median) can mitigate such biases. The differences among the methods can lead to discrepant statistical conclusions as demonstrated in real data applications. Based on our simulation results, we recommend the three proposed methods in practice: Diff-IVW, Prod-IVW, and Prod-Median, which are complementary under various scenarios.},

The feasibility of addressing binary outcome misclassification in regression models is often hindered by model identifiability issues. In this paper, we characterize the identifiability problems in this class of models as a specific case of “label-switching” and leverage a pattern in the resulting parameter estimates to solve the permutation invariance of the complete data log-likelihood. Our proposed algorithm in binary outcome misclassification models does not require gold standard labels and relies only on the assumption that the sum of the sensitivity and specificity exceeds 1. A label-switching correction is applied within estimation methods to recover unbiased effect estimates and to estimate misclassification rates. Open-source software is provided to implement the proposed methods. We give a detailed simulation study for our proposed methodology and apply these methods to data from the 2020 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS).},

This includes uncertainty in estimation for model-derived functionals such as exceedance probabilities. The latter are critical in a clinical diagnostic or decision-making setting. In this article, by placing a Dirichlet prior on the baseline distribution, we propose a Bayesian model-based approach for inference to address these important gaps. We establish consistency and asymptotic normality results for the implied canonical parameter. Simulation studies and an illustration with data from an aging research study confirm that the proposed method performs comparably or better in comparison with GLDRM.

  abstract     = {Stepped wedge cluster randomized trials (SWCRTs) often face challenges related to potential confounding by time. Traditional frequentist methods may not provide adequate coverage of an intervention&#39;s true effect using confidence intervals, whereas Bayesian approaches show potential for better coverage of intervention effects. However, Bayesian methods remain underexplored in the context of SWCRTs. To bridge this gap, we propose two innovative Bayesian hierarchical penalized spline models. Our first model accommodates large numbers of clusters and time periods, focusing on immediate intervention effects. To evaluate this approach, we compared this model to traditional frequentist methods. We then extend our approach to account for time-varying intervention effects, conducting a comprehensive comparison with an existing Bayesian monotone effect curve model and alternative frequentist methods. The proposed models were applied in the Primary Palliative Care for Emergency Medicine stepped wedge trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention. Through extensive simulations and real-world application, we demonstrate the robustness of our proposed Bayesian models. Notably, the Bayesian immediate effect model consistently achieves the nominal coverage probability, providing more reliable interval estimations while maintaining high estimation accuracy. Furthermore, our proposed Bayesian time-varying effect model represents a significant advancement over the existing Bayesian monotone effect curve model, offering improved accuracy and reliability in estimation while also achieving higher coverage probability than alternative frequentist methods. To the best of our knowledge, this marks the first development of Bayesian hierarchical spline modeling for SWCRTs. Our proposed models offer promising tools for researchers and practitioners, enabling more precise evaluation of intervention impacts.},

Many methods have been successfully developed. However, oftentimes, empirical performance is unsatisfactory because of a “lack of information.” In cancer research and clinical practice, a source of information that is broadly available and highly cost-effective comes from pathological images, which are routinely collected for definitive diagnosis and staging. In this article, we consider a Bayesian approach for selecting relevant genetic variables and modeling their relationships with a cancer outcome/phenotype. We propose borrowing information from (manually curated, low-dimensional) pathological imaging features via reinforcing the same selection results for the cancer outcome and imaging features. We further develop a weighting strategy to accommodate the scenario where information borrowing may not be equally effective for all subjects. Computation is carefully examined. Simulations demonstrate competitive performance of the proposed approach. We analyze TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) LUAD (lung adenocarcinoma) data, with overall survival and gene expressions being the outcome and genetic variables, respectively. Findings different from the alternatives and with sound properties are made.},

Application of the Bonferroni test for testing the intersection of the secondary hypotheses results in the Holm procedure while application of the Simes test results in the Hochberg procedure. The focus of the present paper is on developing normal theory analogs of the abovementioned p $$ p $$ -value based tests that take into account (i) the gatekeeping effect of the test on the primary endpoint and (ii) correlations between the endpoints. The normal theory boundaries are determined by finding the least favorable configuration of the correlations and so their knowledge is not needed to apply these procedures. The p $$ p $$ -value based procedures are easy to apply but they are less powerful than their normal theory analogs because they do not take into account the correlations between the endpoints and the gatekeeping effect referred to above. On the other hand, the normal theory procedures are restricted to two secondary endpoints and two stages mainly because of computational difficulties with more than two secondary endpoints and stages. Comparisons between the two types of procedures are given in terms of secondary powers. The sensitivity of the secondary type I error rate and power to unequal information times is studied. Numerical examples and a real case study illustrate the procedures.},

The methods described are applicable to restricted randomization designs that satisfy the following criteria: (1) two-arm equal allocation, (2) restriction of maximum tolerated imbalance, and (3) conditional allocation probability fully determined by the observed current treatment imbalance. Analytical results indicate that, for two-arm equal allocation trials, allocation predictability alternates by the odd/even sequence order of the treatment assignment. Additionally, the sequence average allocation predictability converges to its asymptotic value significantly more slowly than the allocation predictability for individual assignment does. Consequently, comparisons of allocation predictability between different randomization designs based on sequence averages are sensitive to sequence length. Using sequence average allocation predictability may underestimate the risk of selection bias for individual assignment. This discrepancy is particularly pronounced for short sequence lengths, where individual assignment predictability can be substantially higher than the sequence average.},

  abstract     = {Leveraging external data information to supplement randomized clinical trials has been a popular topic in recent years, especially for medical device and drug discovery. In rare diseases, it is very challenging to recruit patients and run a large-scale randomized trial. To take advantage of real-world data from historical trials on the same disease, we can run a small hybrid trial and borrow historical controls to increase the power. But the borrowing needs to be conducted in a statistically principled manner. Bayesian power prior methods and propensity score adjustments have been discussed in the literature. In this paper, we propose a matching-assisted power prior approach to better mitigate observed bias when incorporating external data. A subset of comparable external subjects is selected by groups through template matching, and different weights are assigned to these groups based on their similarity to the current study population. Power priors are then implemented to incorporate the information into Bayesian inference. Unlike conventional power prior methods, which discount all control patients similarly, matching pre-selects good controls, hence improved the quality of external data being borrowed. We compare its performance with the existing propensity score-integrated power prior approach through simulation studies and illustrate the implementation using data from a real acupuncture clinical trial.},

Exposures that tend to occur near end-of-life, for example, use of wheelchair, oxygen therapy and palliative care, may therefore be found associated with the incidence of the adverse outcomes. We propose a concept of reverse time-to-death (rTTD) and its use for the time-scale in time-to-event analysis based on partial likelihood to mitigate the time-varying confounding. We used data on community-based palliative care uptake (exposure) and emergency department visits (outcome) among patients with advanced cancer in Singapore to illustrate. We compare the results against that of the common practice of using time-on-study (TOS) as time-scale. Graphical analysis demonstrated that cancer patients receiving palliative care had higher rate of emergency department visits than non-recipients mainly because they were closer to end-of-life, and that rTTD analysis made comparison between patients at the same time-to-death. In analysis of a decedent cohort, emergency department visits in relation to palliative care using TOS time-scale showed significant increase in hazard ratio estimate when observed time-varying covariates were omitted from statistical adjustment (% change-in-estimate = 16.2%; 95% CI 6.4% to 25.6%). There was no such change in otherwise the same analysis using rTTD (% change-in-estimate = 3.1%; 95% CI -1.0% to 8.5%), demonstrating the ability of rTTD time-scale to mitigate confounding that intensifies in relation to time-to-death. A similar pattern was found in the full cohort. Simulations demonstrated that the proposed method had smaller relative bias and root mean square error than TOS-based analysis. In conclusion, use of rTTD as time-scale in time-to-event analysis provides a simple and robust approach to control time-varying confounding in studies of advanced illness, even if the confounders are unmeasured.},

In many trials, however, some patients&#39; covariates (e.g., a concomitant drug assigned by a clinician) might have an impact on the dose-toxicity relationship. In this work, motivated by a real trial, we evaluate an impact of taking into account (or omitting) some patients&#39; covariates on the individual target dose recommendations and patients&#39; safety in Phase I model-based dose-finding study. We investigate several variable penalisation criteria and found that, for continuous and binary covariates, omitting a prognostic covariate leads to a drastically low proportion of correct selections and an increase of overdosing. At the same time, including a covariate can lead to good operating characteristics in all scenarios but can sometimes slightly decrease the proportion of good selections and increase the overdosing. To tackle this, we propose to use a Bayesian Lasso Bayesian Logistic Regression Model (BLRM) and Spike-and-Slab BLRM. We have found that the BLRM coupled to the Bayesian LASSO and the BLRM with Spike-and-Slab are on average better appropriate to consider variable inclusion.},

We identified vulnerable subgroups of patients with poorer asthma outcomes but enhanced benefits from WAAP and characterized patient profiles.

  abstract     = {The semi-competing risks data model is a special type of disease-state model that focuses on studying the association between an intermediate event and a terminal event and proves to be a useful tool in modeling disease progression. The study of the semi-competing risk data model not only allows us to evaluate whether a disease episode is related to death but also provides a toolkit to predict death, given that the episode occurred at a certain time. However, the computation of the semi-competing risk models is a numerically challenging task. The Gamma-Frailty conditional Markov model has been shown to be an efficient computation model for studying semi-competing risks data. Building on recent advances in studying semi-competing risks data, this work proposes a non-parametric pseudo-likelihood method equipped with an EM-like algorithm to study semi-competing risks data with event misascertainment under the restricted Gamma-Frailty conditional Markov model. A thorough simulation study is conducted to demonstrate the inference validity of the proposed method and its numerical stability. The proposed method is applied to a large HIV cohort study, EA-IeDEA, that has a severe death under-reporting issue to assess the degree of adverse impact of the interruption of ART care on HIV mortality.},

Many approaches have been developed for G-E interaction analysis, yielding important findings. However, hierarchical multi-label classification, which provides insightful information on disease outcomes, remains unexplored in G-E analysis literature. Moreover, unlabeled data are commonly observed in practical settings but omitted by many existing methods of hierarchical multi-label classification. In this study, we consider a semi-supervised scenario and develop a novel approach for the two-layer hierarchical response with G-E interactions. A two-step penalized estimation is then proposed using an efficient expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Simulation shows that it has superior performance in classification and feature selection. The analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data on lung cancer demonstrates the practical utility of the proposed method. Overall, this study can fill the important knowledge gap in G-E interaction analysis by providing a widely applicable framework for hierarchical multi-label classification of complex disease outcomes.},

This is more problematic for SMARTs where strategy effects are based on sequences of treatments. Sample size adjustment offers flexibility through re-estimating sample size during the trial to ensure adequate power at the final analysis. While this adaptation is common for standard clinical trials, corresponding methods to perform sample size adjustment have not been adapted to SMARTs. In this paper, we propose a sample size adjustment procedure for SMARTs. Sample sizes are re-calculated at the interim analysis based on the conditional power derived from a bivariate non-central chi-square distribution. We demonstrate through simulation studies that even with an underpowered initial sample size due to miss-specified parameters at the design stage, the proposed method can maintain desirable power at the end of the study, and additional resources are only invested in trials that show promising conditional power at the interim analysis.},

For example, from hepatitis B infection to death, patients may experience intermediate events such as liver cirrhosis and liver cancer. The sequential events of hepatitis, cirrhosis, cancer, and death are susceptible to right censoring; moreover, the latter events may preclude the former events. Casting the natural course of human diseases in the framework of causal mediation modeling, we establish a model with intermediate and terminal events as the mediators and outcomes, respectively. We define the interventional analog of path-specific effects (iPSEs) as the effect of an exposure on a terminal event mediated (or not mediated) by any combination of intermediate events without parametric models. The expression of a counting process-based counterfactual hazard is derived under the sequential ignorability assumption. We employ composite nonparametric likelihood estimation to obtain maximum likelihood estimators for the counterfactual hazard and iPSEs. Our proposed estimators achieve asymptotic unbiasedness, uniform consistency, and weak convergence. Applying the proposed method, we show that hepatitis B induced mortality is mostly mediated through liver cancer and/or cirrhosis whereas hepatitis C induced mortality may be through extrahepatic diseases.},

It is often of interest to evaluate the correlation between two variables with clustered data. There are three commonly used Pearson correlation coefficients (total, between-, and within-cluster), which together provide an enriched perspective of the correlation. However, these Pearson correlation coefficients are sensitive to extreme values and skewed distributions. They also vary with data transformation, which is arbitrary and often difficult to choose, and they are not applicable to ordered categorical data. Current nonparametric correlation measures for clustered data are only for the total correlation. Here we define population parameters for the between- and within-cluster Spearman rank correlations. The definitions are natural extensions of the Pearson between- and within-cluster correlations to the rank scale. We show that the total Spearman rank correlation approximates a linear combination of the between- and within-cluster Spearman rank correlations, where the weights are functions of rank intraclass correlations of the two random variables. We also discuss the equivalence between the within-cluster Spearman rank correlation and the covariate-adjusted partial Spearman rank correlation. Furthermore, we describe estimation and inference for the three Spearman rank correlations, conduct simulations to evaluate the performance of our estimators, and illustrate their use with data from a longitudinal biomarker study and a clustered randomized trial.},

  abstract     = {More than half of the world&#39;s population is exposed to mosquito-borne diseases, leading to millions of cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths every year. Analyzing this type of data is complex and poses several interesting challenges, mainly due to the usually vast geographic area involved, the peculiar temporal behavior, and the potential correlation between infections. Motivation for this work stems from the analysis of tropical disease data, namely, the number of cases of dengue and chikungunya, for the 145 microregions in Southeast Brazil from 2018 to 2022. As a contribution to the literature on multivariate disease data, we develop a flexible Bayesian multivariate spatio-temporal model where temporal dependence is defined for areal clusters. The model features a prior distribution for the random partition of areal data that incorporates neighboring information. It also incorporates an autoregressive structure and terms related to seasonal patterns into temporal components that are disease- and cluster-specific. Furthermore, it considers a multivariate directed acyclic graph autoregressive structure to accommodate spatial and inter-disease dependence. We explore the properties of the model through simulation studies and show results that prove our proposal compares well to competing alternatives. Finally, we apply the model to the motivating dataset with a twofold goal: finding clusters of areas with similar temporal trends for some of the diseases and exploring the existence of correlation between two diseases transmitted by the same mosquito.},

  abstract     = {Multi-gene panel testing allows efficient detection of pathogenic variants in cancer susceptibility genes including moderate-risk genes such as ATM and PALB2. A growing number of studies examine the risk of breast cancer (BC) conferred by pathogenic variants of these genes. A meta-analysis combining the reported risk estimates can provide an overall estimate of age-specific risk of developing BC, that is, penetrance for a gene. However, estimates reported by case–control studies often suffer from ascertainment bias. Currently, there is no method available to adjust for such bias in this setting. We consider a Bayesian random effect meta-analysis method that can synthesize different types of risk measures and extend it to incorporate studies with ascertainment bias. This is achieved by introducing a bias term in the model and assigning appropriate priors. We validate the method through a simulation study and apply it to estimate BC penetrance for carriers of pathogenic variants in the ATM and PALB2 genes. Our simulations show that the proposed method results in more accurate and precise penetrance estimates compared to when no adjustment is made for ascertainment bias or when such biased studies are discarded from the analysis. The overall estimated BC risk for individuals with pathogenic variants are (1) 5.77% (3.22%–9.67%) by age 50 and 26.13% (20.31%–32.94%) by age 80 for ATM; (2) 12.99% (6.48%–22.23%) by age 50, and 44.69% (34.40%–55.80%) by age 80 for PALB2.

  abstract     = {Predicting cancer-associated clinical events is challenging in oncology. In Multiple Myeloma (MM), a cancer of plasma cells, disease progression is determined by changes in biomarkers, such as serum concentration of the paraprotein secreted by plasma cells (M-protein). Therefore, the time-dependent behavior of M-protein and the transition across lines of therapy (LoT), which may be a consequence of disease progression, should be accounted for in statistical models to predict relevant clinical outcomes. Furthermore, it is important to understand the contribution of the patterns of longitudinal biomarkers, upon each LoT initiation, to time-to-death or time-to-next-LoT. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a Bayesian joint model for trajectories of multiple longitudinal biomarkers, such as M-protein, and the competing risks of death and transition to the next LoT. Additionally, we explore two estimation approaches for our joint model: simultaneous estimation of all parameters (joint estimation) and sequential estimation of parameters using a corrected two-stage strategy aiming to reduce computational time. Our proposed model and estimation methods are applied to a retrospective cohort study from a real-world database of patients diagnosed with MM in the US from January 2015 to February 2022. We split the data into training and test sets in order to validate the joint model using both estimation approaches and make dynamic predictions of times until clinical events of interest, informed by longitudinally measured biomarkers and baseline variables available up to the time of prediction.},

Despite not estimating the entire sampling distribution, this approach prompts unbiased sample size recommendations.

In this article, we introduce and categorize existing methods for evaluating diagnostic tests without a gold standard, considering factors such as the type and number of tests, as well as the structure of the observed data. For each method, we provide a comprehensive introduction and analysis of its underlying assumptions, model architecture, identifiability, estimation techniques, and inference procedures. We use R to conduct simulations for widely applicable models, validating assumptions, comparing models, and assessing their reliability. Additionally, we present real-world examples along with the corresponding R code for these models, enabling readers to better understand how to apply them effectively. Beyond diagnostic medicine, we underscore that the issue of imperfect gold standards affects other fields, drawing parallels to the noisy label problem in machine learning. By highlighting similarities and differences across these domains, we open pathways for further research. The primary aim of this article is to consolidate existing methods for assessing test accuracy in the absence of a gold standard and to provide practical guidance for researchers seeking to apply these methods effectively.},

  abstract     = {Sample size re-estimation (SSR) is perhaps the most used adaptive procedure in both frequentist and Bayesian adaptive designs for clinical trials. The primary focus of all current frequentist and Bayesian SSR procedures is type I error control. We propose a hybrid frequentist-Bayesian SSR approach that focuses on optimizing operating characteristics (OC), which uses simulations to investigate the associated OC and adjusts accordingly. The hybrid approach incorporates the Bayesian predictive power into the frequentist framework of SSR. Simulations show that the hybrid approach can substantially outperform popular frequentist type error-focused SSR procedure. The hybrid approach can substantially improve the effectiveness of SSR using Bayesian predictive power.},

  abstract     = {Correlated clinical measurements are routinely interpreted via comparisons with univariate reference intervals examined side by side. Multivariate reference regions (MVRs), i.e., regions that characterize the distribution of multivariate results, have been proposed as a more adequate interpretation tool in such situations. However, MVR estimation methods have not yet been fully developed and are rarely used by physicians. The multivariate distribution of correlated measurements might change with certain patient characteristics (e.g., age or gender), and their effect on the shape of an MVR can be complex, involving interaction terms. For instance, the reference region shape for a given set of continuous covariates might vary across groups with respect to the value of a categorical variable. This paper examines the use of a bootstrap-based hypothesis test for examining the effect of covariates on bivariate reference regions, testing the effect of factor-by-region interactions. An estimation algorithm based on smoothing splines was used to construct the bivariate reference region for a pediatric anthropometric dataset, and the bootstrapping procedure was used to determine the effect of age and gender on the shape of the reference region. (Height, weight) bivariate distribution was shown to depend on the interaction between age and gender. The bootstrapping procedure confirmed that a bivariate growth chart is desirable over univariate age-gender body mass index (BMI) percentile curves. Whereas the well-known BMI criterion detects only two atypical situations (i.e., underweight, overweight), the bootstrap-tested bivariate reference region detected abnormally large or small body frames for different ages and genders.},

  abstract     = {The recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidance on complex innovative trial designs acknowledges the use of Bayesian strategies to incorporate historical information based on clinical expertise and data similarity. Also, data from multiple previous studies with similar settings often qualify for historical borrowing. Although several classes of informative priors can semi-automatically leverage historical information based on data compatibility, it is common that some exogenous factors, such as the year of patient enrollment, can also influence the relevance of each historical study to the current trial. Consequently, a natural a priori ordering among historical trials often arises, a constraint that many current informative priors fail to accommodate. Motivated by a pediatric lupus clinical study and an oncology trial, we introduce a variant of the power prior, named the ordered normalized power prior , which ensures a targeted order restriction on the power parameters and maintains data-adaptive borrowing. We further explore and compare two distinct normalization strategies and outline computational details with efficient sampling algorithms. The clinical datasets mentioned are analyzed, and extensive simulations are conducted for comparison. An efficient implementation is provided in our updated package NPP available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network.},

  abstract     = {The use of mixed-effect models to understand the evolution of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the progression of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) has been the cornerstone of longitudinal data analysis in recent years. However, data from HIV/AIDS clinical trials have several complexities. Some of the most common recurrences are related to the situation where the HIV viral load can be undetectable, and the measures of the patient can be registered irregularly due to some problems in the data collection. Although censored mixed-effects models assuming conditionally independent normal random errors are commonly used to analyze this data type, this model may need to be more appropriate for accommodating outlying observations and responses recorded at irregular intervals. Consequently, in this paper, we propose a Bayesian analysis of censored linear mixed-effects models that replace Gaussian assumptions with a flexible class of distributions, such as the scale mixture of normal family distributions, considering a damped exponential correlation structure that was employed to account for within-subject autocorrelation among irregularly observed measures. For this complex structure, Stan &#39;s default No-U-Turn sampler is utilized to obtain posterior simulations. The feasibility of the proposed methods was demonstrated through several simulation studies and their application to two AIDS case studies.},

  abstract     = {Advances in next-generation sequencing technology have enabled the high-throughput profiling of metagenomes and accelerated microbiome studies. Recently, there has been a rise in quantitative studies that aim to decipher the microbiome co-occurrence network and its underlying community structure based on metagenomic sequence data. Uncovering the complex microbiome community structure is essential to understanding the role of the microbiome in disease progression and susceptibility. Taxonomic abundance data generated from metagenomic sequencing technologies are high-dimensional and compositional, suffering from uneven sampling depth, over-dispersion, and zero-inflation. These characteristics often challenge the reliability of the current methods for microbiome community detection. To study the microbiome co-occurrence network and perform community detection, we propose a generalized Bayesian stochastic block model that is tailored for microbiome data analysis where the data are transformed using the recently developed modified centered-log ratio transformation. Our model also allows us to leverage taxonomic tree information using a Markov random field prior. The model parameters are jointly inferred by using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling techniques. Our simulation study showed that the proposed approach performs better than competing methods even when taxonomic tree information is non-informative. We applied our approach to a real urinary microbiome dataset from postmenopausal women. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the urinary microbiome co-occurrence network structure in postmenopausal women has been studied. In summary, this statistical methodology provides a new tool for facilitating advanced microbiome studies.},

  abstract     = {In estimating the average treatment effect in observational studies, the influence of confounders should be appropriately addressed. To this end, the propensity score is widely used. If the propensity scores are known for all the subjects, bias due to confounders can be adjusted by using the inverse probability weighting (IPW) by the propensity score. Since the propensity score is unknown in general, it is usually estimated by the parametric logistic regression model with unknown parameters estimated by solving the score equation under the strongly ignorable treatment assignment (SITA) assumption. Violation of the SITA assumption and/or misspecification of the propensity score model can cause serious bias in estimating the average treatment effect (ATE). To relax the SITA assumption, the IPW estimator based on the outcome-dependent propensity score has been successfully introduced. However, it still depends on the correctly specified parametric model and its identification. In this paper, we propose a simple sensitivity analysis method for unmeasured confounders. In the standard practice, the estimating equation is used to estimate the unknown parameters in the parametric propensity score model. Our idea is to make inferences on the (ATE) by removing restrictive parametric model assumptions while still utilizing the estimating equation. Using estimating equations as constraints, which the true propensity scores asymptotically satisfy, we construct the worst-case bounds for the ATE with linear programming. Differently from the existing sensitivity analysis methods, we construct the worst-case bounds with minimal assumptions. We illustrate our proposal by simulation studies and a real-world example.},

These absolute measures of survival are complementary to the more typically used relative measures of excess mortality and relative survival, and, together, they provide a fuller understanding of geographical disparities in survival outcomes for cancer patients. We propose using a spatially flexible parametric relative survival model in the Bayesian framework, which allows for the inclusion of spatial effects in hazard-level model components. The relative survival framework is the preferred approach to analyze cancer survival data because it does not require information on the cause of death, and the Bayesian spatial modeling approach allows complex and robust small-area estimation. The calculation of spatial estimates for LLE and C r C $$ C{r}_C $$ are demonstrated using publicly available simulated datasets. The associated computer program scripts are available to support the understanding and implementation of our methodology in other spatial cancer modelling applications.},

  abstract     = {Longitudinal studies are frequently used in medical research and involve collecting repeated measures on individuals over time. Observations from the same individual are invariably correlated and thus an analytic approach that accounts for this clustering by individual is required. While almost all research suffers from missing data, this can be particularly problematic in longitudinal studies as participation often becomes harder to maintain over time. Multiple imputation (MI) is widely used to handle missing data in such studies. When using MI, it is important that the imputation model is compatible with the proposed analysis model. In a longitudinal analysis, this implies that the clustering considered in the analysis model should be reflected in the imputation process. Several MI approaches have been proposed to impute incomplete longitudinal data, such as treating repeated measurements of the same variable as distinct variables or using generalized linear mixed imputation models. However, the uptake of these methods has been limited, as they require additional data manipulation and use of advanced imputation procedures. In this tutorial, we review the available MI approaches that can be used for handling incomplete longitudinal data, including where individuals are clustered within higher-level clusters. We illustrate implementation with replicable R and Stata code using a case study from the Childhood to Adolescence Transition Study.},

Text mining shares many topics, such as sentiment analysis and content understanding. Combining these two fields enables more efficient mining of text data and the extraction of valuable information. In particular, the GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) architecture has achieved success in image generation and has started to be used on text data. However, training GANs is fraught with difficulties due to the complexity of text data. Linguistic studies show important differences between languages. Language is characterized by fluidity, ambiguity, and context-sensitive interpretations, and text-generating GAN models can struggle to deal with these complexities. The interaction between data quality, language structure, and complex interpretation can lead to inconsistency and ambiguity in the text production of GAN models. These problems are particularly pronounced when complexities such as semantic subtleties, idiomatic expressions, and context-dependent usages come into play. Text generation is an area of GAN models used in NLP to generate language and enrich text-based applications. Work in this area can contribute to analyzing, classifying, and processing text data. Many methods and techniques have been proposed to improve the performance of text GANs. However, some problems may be encountered in the optimization of these methods. Therefore, it is essential to use optimized methods. In conclusion, GANs can be an important tool to improve text generation in NLP.

This systematic review examines the use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to automatically detect these conditions using electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Guided by Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA), we reviewed 74 carefully selected studies published between 2013 and August 2024 that used machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), or both of these two methods to detect neurological and mental health disorders automatically using EEG signals. The most common and most prevalent neurological and mental health disorder types were sourced from major databases, including Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore. Epilepsy, depression, and Alzheimer&#39;s disease are the most studied conditions that meet our evaluation criteria, 32, 12, and 10 studies were identified on these topics, respectively. Conversely, the number of studies meeting our criteria regarding stress, schizophrenia, Parkinson&#39;s disease, and autism spectrum disorders was relatively more average: 6, 4, 3, and 3, respectively. The diseases that least met our evaluation conditions were one study each of seizure, stroke, anxiety diseases, and one study examining Alzheimer&#39;s disease and epilepsy together. Support Vector Machines (SVM) were most widely used in ML methods, while Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) dominated DL approaches. DL methods generally outperformed traditional ML, as they yielded higher performance using huge EEG data. We observed that the complex decision process during feature extraction from EEG signals in ML-based models significantly impacted results, while DL-based models handled this more efficiently. AI-based EEG analysis shows promise for automated detection of neurological and mental health conditions. Future research should focus on multi-disease studies, standardizing datasets, improving model interpretability, and developing clinical decision support systems to assist in the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.},

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of existing theoretical foundations, interdisciplinary challenges, and emerging advancements in rumor detection research, with a focus on integrating theoretical and computational approaches. Drawing on insights from computer science, cognitive psychology, and sociology, we explore methodologies, such as multimodal fusion, graph-based models, and attention mechanisms, while highlighting gaps in real-world scalability, ethical transparency, and cross-platform adaptability. Using a systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis, we identify trends, methods, and gaps in current research. Our findings emphasize interdisciplinary collaboration to develop adaptable, efficient, and ethical rumor detection strategies. We also highlight the critical role of combining socio-psychological insights with advanced computational techniques to address the human factors in rumor spread. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of designing systems that remain effective across diverse cultural and linguistic contexts, enhancing their global applicability.

The goal of the current study is to conduct a scientometric analysis of scholarly literature published in the recent decade within the domain of ICT-assisted civil engineering. To achieve this, the study categorizes the civil engineering field into seven major subfields. It includes structural engineering, geotechnical engineering, transportation engineering, water resources engineering, environmental engineering, construction management, and urban planning and design. Employing CiteSpace as the analytical tool, the research offers insights into the intellectual foundations of the civil engineering. This is accomplished through reference co-citation analysis, cluster analysis, and burst reference analysis. The results demonstrate the adoption of advanced technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning (ML), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and artificial neural networks in resolving complex civil engineering challenges that reflect the dynamism and diversity of the field. Moreover, it addresses current research challenges within this knowledge domain and explores potential research prospects. The findings emphasize the importance of collaborative efforts among academia, industry stakeholders, and government entities.},

  abstract     = {Process mining (PM) comprises a variety of methods for discovering information about processes from their execution logs. Some of them, such as trace clustering, trace classification, and anomalous trace detection require a preliminary preprocessing step in which the raw data is encoded into a numerical feature space. To this end, encoding techniques are used to generate vectorial representations of process traces. Most of the PM literature provides trace encoding techniques that look at the control flow, that is, only encode the sequence of activities that characterize a process trace disregarding other process data that is fundamental for effectively describing the process behavior. To fill this gap, in this article we show 19 trace encoding methods that work in a multi-perspective manner, that is, by embedding events and trace attributes in addition to activity names into the vectorial representations of process traces. We also provide an extensive experimental study where these techniques are applied to real-life datasets and compared to each other.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, machine learning (ML) has witnessed a paradigm shift in kernel function selection, which is pivotal in optimizing various ML models. Despite multiple studies about its significance, a comprehensive understanding of kernel function selection, particularly about model performance, still needs to be explored. Challenges remain in selecting and optimizing kernel functions to improve model performance and efficiency. The study investigates how gamma parameter and cost parameter influence performance metrics in multi-class classification tasks using various kernel-based algorithms. Through sensitivity analysis, the impact of these parameters on classification performance and computational efficiency is assessed. The experimental setup involves deploying ML models using four kernel-based algorithms: Support Vector Machine, Radial Basis Function, Polynomial Kernel, and Sigmoid Kernel. Data preparation includes text processing, categorization, and feature extraction using TfidfVectorizer, followed by model training and validation. Results indicate that Support Vector Machine with default settings and Radial Basis Function kernel consistently outperforms polynomial and sigmoid kernels. Adjusting gamma improves model accuracy and precision, highlighting its role in capturing complex relationships. Regularization cost parameters, however, show minimal impact on performance. The study also reveals that configurations with moderate gamma values achieve better balance between performance and computational time compared to higher gamma values or no gamma adjustment. The findings underscore the delicate balance between model performance and computational efficiency by highlighting the trade-offs between model complexity and efficiency.},

CLV is a critical approach to managing and organizing a company&#39;s profitability. With the vast availability of consumer data, business analytics (BA) tools and approaches, alongside CLV models, have been applied to gain deeper insights into customer behaviors and decision-making processes. Despite the recognized importance of CLV, there is a noticeable gap in comprehensive analyses and reviews of BA techniques applied to CLV. This study aims to fill this gap by conducting a thorough survey of the state-of-the-art investigations on CLV models integrated with BA approaches, thereby contributing to a research agenda in this field. The review methodology consists of three main steps: identification of relevant studies, creating a coding plan, and ensuring coding reliability. First, relevant studies were identified using predefined keywords. Next, a coding plan—one of the study&#39;s significant contributions—was developed to evaluate these studies comprehensively. Finally, the coding plan&#39;s reliability was tested by three experts before being applied to the selected studies. Additionally, specific evaluation criteria in the coding plan were implemented to introduce new insights. This study presents exciting and valuable results from various perspectives, providing a crucial reference for academic researchers and marketing practitioners interested in the intersection of BA and CLV.},

  abstract     = {Dissolution refers to the process in which solvent molecules and solute molecules attract and combine with each other. The extensive solubility data generated from the dissolution of various compounds under different conditions, is distributed across structured or semi-structured formats in various media, such as text, web pages, tables, images, and databases. These data exhibit multi-source and unstructured features, aligning with the typical 5 V characteristics of big data. A solubility big data technology system has emerged under the fusion of solubility data and big data technologies. However, the acquisition, fusion, storage, representation, and utilization of solubility big data are encountering new challenges. Knowledge Graphs, known as extensive systems for representing and applying knowledge, can effectively describe entities, concepts, and relations across diverse domains. The construction of solubility big data knowledge graph holds substantial value in the retrieval, analysis, utilization, and visualization of solubility knowledge. Throwing out a brick to attract a jade, this paper focuses on the solubility big data knowledge graph and, firstly, summarizes the architecture of solubility knowledge graph construction. Secondly, the key technologies such as knowledge extraction, knowledge fusion, and knowledge reasoning of solubility big data are emphasized, along with summarizing the common machine learning methods in knowledge graph construction. Furthermore, this paper explores application scenarios, such as knowledge question answering and recommender systems for solubility big data. Finally, it presents a prospective view of the shortcomings, challenges, and future directions related to the construction of solubility big data knowledge graph. This article proposes the research direction of solubility big data knowledge graph, which can provide technical references for constructing a solubility knowledge graph. At the same time, it serves as a comprehensive medium for describing data, resources, and their applications across diverse fields such as chemistry, materials, biology, energy, medicine, and so on. It further aids in knowledge retrieval and mining, analysis and utilization, and visualization across various disciplines.},

However, the rapid growth in knowledge creation and the rising number of publications have made this task increasingly complex and challenging. Moreover, most systematic literature reviews are performed manually, which requires significant effort and creates potential bias. The risk of bias is particularly relevant in the data synthesis task, where researchers interpret each study&#39;s evidence and summarize the results. This study uses an experimental approach to explore using machine learning (ML) techniques in the SLR process. Specifically, this study replicates a study that manually performed sentiment analysis for the data synthesis step to determine the polarity (negative or positive) of evidence extracted from studies in the field of agile methodology. This study employs a lexicon-based approach to sentiment analysis and achieves an accuracy rate of approximately 86.5% in identifying study evidence polarity.},

In this study, we investigate several qDR techniques on a variety of datasets such as quantum Gaussian distribution adaptation (qGDA), quantum principal component analysis (qPCA), quantum linear discriminant analysis (qLDA), and quantum t-SNE (qt-SNE). The Olivetti Faces, Wine, Breast Cancer, Digits, and Iris are among the datasets used in this investigation. Through comparison evaluations against well-established classical approaches, such as classical PCA (cPCA), classical LDA (cLDA), and classical GDA (cGDA), and using well-established metrics like loss, fidelity, and processing time, the effectiveness of these techniques is assessed. The findings show that cPCA produced positive results with the lowest loss and highest fidelity when used on the Iris dataset. On the other hand, quantum uniform manifold approximation and projection (qUMAP) performs well and shows strong fidelity when tested against the Wine dataset, but ct-SNE shows mediocre performance against the Digits dataset. Isomap and locally linear embedding (LLE) function differently depending on the dataset. Notably, LLE showed the largest loss and lowest fidelity on the Olivetti Faces dataset. The hypothesis testing findings showed that the qDR strategies did not significantly outperform the classical techniques in terms of maintaining pertinent information from quantum datasets. More specifically, the outcomes of paired t -tests show that when it comes to the ability to capture complex patterns, there are no statistically significant differences between the cPCA and qPCA, the cLDA and qLDA, and the cGDA and qGDA. According to the findings of the assessments of mutual information (MI) and clustering accuracy, qPCA may be able to recognize patterns more clearly than standardized cPCA. Nevertheless, there is no discernible improvement between the qLDA and qGDA approaches and their classical counterparts.},

Some of the main shortcomings are the lack of interpretability and the lack of robustness against adversarial examples or out-of-distribution inputs. In this paper, we comprehensively review the possibilities and limits of adversarial attacks for explainable machine learning models. First, we extend the notion of adversarial examples to fit in explainable machine learning scenarios where a human assesses not only the input and the output classification, but also the explanation of the model&#39;s decision. Next, we propose a comprehensive framework to study whether (and how) adversarial examples can be generated for explainable models under human assessment. Based on this framework, we provide a structured review of the diverse attack paradigms existing in this domain, identify current gaps and future research directions, and illustrate the main attack paradigms discussed. Furthermore, our framework considers a wide range of relevant yet often ignored factors such as the type of problem, the user expertise or the objective of the explanations, in order to identify the attack strategies that should be adopted in each scenario to successfully deceive the model (and the human). The intention of these contributions is to serve as a basis for a more rigorous and realistic study of adversarial examples in the field of explainable machine learning.},
