  abstract     = {This paper introduces an innovative method for solving nonlinear stochastic Itô–Volterra integral equations using balancing polynomials and their associated operational matrices. This approach effectively transforms these complex stochastic equations into a system of nonlinear algebraic equations that can be solved using the Newton method. Balancing polynomials are chosen for their ability to enhance stability and convergence, providing a more reliable and manageable framework for tackling challenging stochastic problems. The paper also includes a convergence analysis and error estimation for the proposed method. Additionally, the effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through four numerical examples. The results obtained from this method are compared with the exact solution and those from other established techniques, including the block-pulse function method, the shifted Jacobi operational matrix (SJOM) method, and the shifted Jacobi spectral Galerkin (SJSG) method. These comparisons highlight the superior performance and accuracy of the proposed method. All numerical computations were performed using MATLAB.},

In addition, the changes in the pressure of the surrounding cerebrospinal fluid can cause changes to the pressure of the extracellular fluid which saturates the spinal cord. The finite element method can be used to solve the differential equations, which describe both how the cord deforms and changes in the pressure of the extracellular fluid but often this requires a large number of time-steps to obtain an accurate and stable numerical solution. We present an alternative approach that uses a Fourier series method that avoids the need for using a time-stepping scheme and that can model how a pressure pulse affects the spinal cord.},

This method produces several solitary wave solutions to the current problem by supposing a series-form solution. The generalized -expansion method, on the other hand, builds on the simple -expansion method by adding more parameters to the series-form solution. This makes finding more families of solitary wave solutions possible and better shows how the system changes over time. These techniques identify various traveling waves, such as periodic, kink, -shaped, bell-shaped, shock waves and others physical solutions. Some obtained solutions are graphically discussed to better visualize the wave phenomena connected to various symmetrical solitary wave solutions. The fractional Benney–Lin equation&#39;s dynamics and wave characteristics may be better understood through these graphical depictions, which makes it easier to analyze the model&#39;s behavior in detail.},

Compared with the traditional statistical methods, understanding dynamics of an infectious disease can better make people understand some global characteristics of epidemic and help in designing appropriate strategies to control diseases. Early studies of mumps mainly focused on deterministic models. However, environmental noises are inevitable during the spread of infectious diseases. This paper extends a mumps transmission model from a deterministic to a stochastic framework and explores the dynamical behaviors of the model by constructing suitable Lyapunov functions. Our model is a six-dimensional stochastic model. The construction of suitable Lyapunov functions is very challenging. Firstly, we show that this model has a unique global positive solution for any positive initial values. Secondly, we compute the basic reproduction numbers and present sufficient conditions for the existence of a unique ergodic stationary distribution and the extinction of the disease. Finally, we perform numerical simulations and sensitivity analysis for exploring the effect of some parameters and the white noises on the behavior of the model. The theoretical results can provide necessary guidelines to public health administrators for controlling and preventing diseases.},

Our focus is to investigate the impact of saturated immune delay on viral infection when CTLs are introduced at a constant rate. By constructing Lyapunov functionals, the stability conditions of equilibrium and equilibrium are established. Theoretical analysis indicates that equilibrium no longer remains stable and generates a Hopf bifurcation as immune delay changes. Numerical simulations are conducted to validate the main theoretical results, and sensitivity analysis is used to evaluate the impact of the parameters on the threshold. Through these simulations, the general patterns of dynamic behavior of the model are revealed. In particular, when and , the dynamics of the endemic equilibrium exhibit complex behavior.},

Furthermore, numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the RPZNN in accurately addressing the TVLME and demonstrate its superior performance in terms of convergence rate and robustness when compared to several traditional or state-of-the-art ZNN solvers. Additionally, the RPZNN solver also exhibits excellent capabilities in dynamic alternating current (DAC) computing and the 6-link planar robot manipulator (6PRM) path-tracking task, highlighting its potential for wide-ranging applications.},

First, we construct a new composite conjugate parameter with two parameters by employing a convex combination of classical conjugate parameters and their variants. Then, we use the spectral technique to guarantee that the search direction possesses the sufficient descent property independent of any line search. Additionally, we incorporate a new spectral gradient-based adaptive restart scheme to ensure the global convergence of the family under weak Wolfe line search and obtain iteration complexity results under Armijo line search. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments on unconstrained optimization problems and image restoration applications to demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed family.},

The existence and stability of positive equilibria and the bifurcation analyses are discussed. Our numerical outcomes entail that increased zooplankton growth due to additional food leads to the disappearance of phytoplankton species, while a significant drop in nutrient levels results in zooplankton extinction within the ecosystem. Notably, the refuge by phytoplankton has a tendency to terminate the persistent oscillations and stabilize the system. As seasonal stochasticity significantly influences the dynamics of planktonic system, so we introduce seasonality into environmental noise and certain model parameters. In this case, we analyze both the regularity and the dichotomy between persistence and extinction. The numerical evidences demonstrate periodic solutions, strong/weak persistence, and plankton extinctions resulting from stochasticity and/or seasonality. Furthermore, the seasonally forced noise, intriguingly, has the capacity to exert control over hyperchaos, yielding a distinctive pattern in plankton populations.},

In order to define a proper objective function for minimization by particle swarm optimization (PSO), the constrained problem is converted into an unconstrained one through the penalty method. Furthermore, the moving least square (MLS) technique is implemented to interpolate and approximate the derivatives appeared in the equation. The main problem for challenging this combined scheme is nonlinear transient convective–radiative heat transfer in existence of a magnetic field. To study the efficiency of the MLS, the results would be contrasted with those extracted by a finite difference method (FDM) based PSO approach. Through five distinctive examples, the evolutionary diagrams as well as temperature distributions found by different methods are displayed, and the effects of the constant parameters are investigated. Besides, the simulations of this research work clearly depict good agreements of the numerical results obtained by the suggested idea with those reported in literature.},

In addition, contact heterogeneity among individuals plays a significant role in cholera transmission. In this paper, we construct a multiscale coupled immuno-cholera model considering waning vaccine-induced immunity and hyperinfectious vibrios and utilize a nested approach to bridge within-host vibrio evolution and between-host cholera transmission on complex networks. The basic reproduction numbers and for the within- and between-host models are derived, respectively, and is validated to serve as a sharp threshold between extinction and persistence of cholera. Specifically, the global asymptotic stability of each feasible equilibrium for the between-host system is established by formulating appropriate Lyapunov functionals. Numerical simulations are performed to assess the influences of within-host vibrio dynamics and network topology on between-host cholera transmission dynamics. The results show that the equilibrium level of total infected individuals is a nonmonotonic function of vibrio growth rate, implying that hampering within-host vibrio growth by drug treatment during the outbreak could alter the long-term outcomes of cholera. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of network degree distributions increases the risk of cholera outbreaks, suggesting that isolation and supervision for infected individuals with high degrees are effective measures to prevent and control cholera transmission.},

Second, for the cases where the existing results are invalid to handle switched nonautonomous terms, a new conformable fractional-order Halanay inequality is obtained, which serves as a powerful tool in the analysis of quasi-synchronization of NCFCDNs. Then, by virtue of the obtained Halanay inequality, Lyapunov method, and periodically intermittent controller, sufficient conditions of exponential quasi-synchronization of NCFCDNs are derived. Our results allow nonautonomous terms to be switched during work time and rest time, which is more relaxing than the previous results.

Furthermore, the relationships between proposed convolutions and the OFrWD as well as OFrAF are also obtained. In addition, with the help of simulation, applications of OFrWD and OFrAF are established, such as designing multiplicative filters in the offset fractional Fourier transform (OFrFT) domain and detecting the parameters of single-component and multicomponent linear frequency-modulated (LFM) signals.},

Thirdly, based on the proposed FDT stability and the stochastic analysis techniques, several sufficient conditions on FDT bipartite synchronization are derived by designing a novel QGIC strategy. Significantly, the designed controller is a unified form of periodic and aperiodic cases and is only activated in the work interval. At last, two numerical simulations are offered to validate the superiority and effectiveness of the theoretical findings.},

Therefore, in this paper, with the aid of the center manifold theory and the normal form method, for general partial functional differential equations with nonlinear diffusion, the third-order normal form is firstly derived. It is locally topologically equivalent to the primitive partial functional differential equations at the Turing–Turing bifurcation point. And then the explicit formulae for the coefficients in the normal form associated with three different spatial modes are presented. As an application, a predator–prey model with predator–taxis is considered. It is theoretically revealed that the system admits the coexistence of a pair of stable steady states with a single characteristic wavelength and the coexistence of four stable steady states with different single characteristic wavelengths. Further, the parameter regions in which these phenomena will arise are quantitatively given. It is illustrated that the self-diffusion of prey and predator–taxis complement each other to promote the formation for the spatially homogeneous distributions of populations.},

The work in the article is roughly divided into two parts. The first part, due to the change of conditions, we must consider the existence and uniqueness of the solution of the system. In the second part, we show that the original system driven by Lévy noise is reduced into an effective equation. To be more accurate, the fast component equation is averaged out, and there exists an effective process converging to the original stochastic parabolic equation. The main contribution is that the obtained results can extend the existing results from the Lipschitz condition to a weaker condition with a wider application scope, that is, the non-Lipschitz condition, and the driving process is Lévy noise, which seems new in the existing literature.},

Additionally, the result shows that θ ∈ [ 0 , 1 2 ) $$ \theta \in \left[0,\frac{1}{2}\right) $$ also demonstrates the same stability under more stringent conditions on stepsize.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the bifurcation, chaos, and active control of a mixed Rayleigh-Liénard oscillator with mixed time delays. First, the effects of system parameters on the supercritical pitchfork bifurcations are discussed in detail by applying the fast-slow separation method. Second, it is rigorously proved by the Melnikov method that chaotic vibration exists when the parameters of the uncontrolled system are selected above the threshold of chaos occurrence. By fine-tuning the system parameters, a criterion for designing the control parameters to make the Melnikov function non-zero is derived. In addition, the routes to chaos in controlled system are explored by bifurcation diagrams, largest Lyapunov exponents, phase portraits, Poincaré maps, basins of attraction, frequency spectra, and displacement time series. The results indicate that by properly adjusting the displacement feedback coefficient and the amplitude of parameter excitation, the chaotic motion caused by increasing of the amplitude of external excitation and strength of distributed time delay can be effectively suppressed. This research result can provide theoretical support for exploring the potential chaotic motion of other types of oscillators.},

The pseudo-operational matrices are constructed utilizing bivariate Gegenbauer polynomials to approximate the solution of the mentioned equation. Then, using the collocation method and resultant matrices, the main equation is converted into a system of algebraic equations that can be solved by Newton&#39;s iteration method. Besides presenting a fast and accurate method, an error bound is determined in a Gegenbauer-weighted space for the residual function obtained from the proposed approach.

Here, we are interested in an inverse random source problem with biharmonic operator. The same as the existing studies of inverse random source problems, some theoretical results of the corresponding direct and inverse problems have been investigated in this paper. The difference is that the source term is driven by time-fractional Brownian motion, and the spatial function in the source term needs to be determined. It has been found that, for different problems, the properties of the integrand in the corresponding stochastic integrals are distinct, which has a significant impact on the entire theoretical analysis. For the problem considered here, the lack of monotonicity in the integrand of the stochastic integrals makes the analysis more challenging. Additionally, biharmonic operators will cause some difficulties in numerical calculations.},

The proposed method overcomes the singularity at the origin and handles both models with different-shaped factors. The convergence study of the proposed method for both models is also discussed in Banach space. Five models of interest are provided to test the validity and efficiency of the proposed method.

With the definition of a definite integral, the relation between the non-polynomial divided difference and non-polynomial B-spline functions is given in terms of integration. Also, we derive a general form of the Peano kernel theorem based on a generalized Taylor expansion with the integral remainder.

By separating the variables, the equation in two dimensions is reduced to the product of two time-dependent equations in one dimension that can be solved analytically.

  abstract     = {Hyperthermia, also called as thermal ablation, is used to treat some advanced cancers. Numerous clinical trials indicate that hyperthermia, when combined with therapies like radiation and chemotherapy, can reduce tumor size and potentially enhance their ability to eradicate cancerous cells. Hence, it is of utmost importance to study the behavior and transmission dynamics of in vivo malignant tumors subjected to hyperthermia. To this purpose, a mathematical model has been formulated, primarily based on the reaction–diffusion equation, imposed with suitable initial and boundary conditions. As the advanced tumors usually consist of five layers, the domain is discretized into five compartments. The model is then solved analytically using the eigenvalue expansion method to determine the tumor cell volume profiles, in the presence and absence of hyperthermia. The main foci of the developed model are the discretization of the domain, variable nature of various physiological parameters involved, and its analytical solution, thereby aiming at strengthening the novelties of the present work. The model outcome and simulations obtained are compared with the previously published/clinical results to prove the validity and feasibility of the proposed work. This work is expected to provide an optimum mathematical model utilizing best mathematical techniques that can greatly aid researchers and biologists in the field of oncology to streamline the process and reduce costs associated with cancer treatment.},

However, their reliance on a single modifiable parameter limits their adaptability. This paper aims to explore generalized logistic maps with arbitrary powers, which offer greater flexibility compared to the standard logistic map. By introducing additional parameters in the form of arbitrary powers, these maps exhibit increased degrees of freedom, thus expanding their applicability across a wider spectrum of scenarios. Consequently, the conventional logistic map emerges as a specific instance within the proposed framework. The inclusion of arbitrary powers enriches system dynamics, enabling a more nuanced exploration of system behavior in diverse contexts. Through a series of illustrations, this study investigates the influence of arbitrary powers and equation parameters on equilibrium points, their positions, stability conditions, basin of attraction, and bifurcation diagrams, including the emergence of chaotic behavior.},

Moreover, the paper emphasizes the significance of fractional calculus in refining classical inequalities and demonstrates how the Caputo fractional operator provides a more generalized framework for addressing problems involving non-integer order differentiation.

A central aspect of the study is the behavior of rotating micropolar fluids within a Darcy-Forchheimer porous medium, enhanced by the inclusion of electromagnetic forces. The effects of embedding nanoparticles TiO 2 and CoFe 2 O 4 in a water-based fluid are explored to reveal their influence on fluid motion and heat transfer. The thermal dynamics are scrutinized, with particular emphasis on the roles of heat absorption and viscous dissipation. Moreover, this study incorporates both endothermic and exothermic reactions in radiative flows, alongside the impact of Soret and Dufour diffusion effects. The discharge of wastewater is a critical issue in environmental management and industrial applications, underscoring the need for rigorous regulation to prevent water pollution and ensure adherence to environmental standards. This research addresses the non-Newtonian flow resulting from wastewater discharge, incorporating Arrhenius activation energy in the analysis. Furthermore, the behavior of microorganisms within the flow is studied under velocity slip conditions and a range of convective boundary conditions. Through the application of similarity transformations, the governing differential equations are derived and solved numerically using MATLAB&#39;s bvp4c solver, with results depicted through detailed graphical analysis to illustrate the fluid&#39;s complex behavior.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we introduce an innovative hybrid discrete-continuum model that provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the intricate interactions between tumor cells, immune cells, and the effects of immunotherapy. This study distinguishes itself by addressing the limitations of traditional diffusion models, which often fail to capture the irregular and nonlocal movements of cells within the complex tumor microenvironment. To overcome these challenges, we employ fractional time derivatives and the fractional Laplacian operator, offering a more accurate representation of anomalous diffusion processes that are critical in cancer dynamics. Our research begins with a rigorous mathematical analysis, where we establish the global existence of a unique mild solution, laying a solid theoretical foundation for the model. A key innovation of our study is the introduction of the “invasion threshold,” a critical parameter inspired by the next-generation operator used in epidemiological modeling. This threshold provides a powerful tool for determining the existence and stability of equilibrium points, offering deep insights into the conditions that either promote or inhibit tumor growth under immunotherapeutic interventions. By integrating a hybrid discrete-continuum approach, we capture the individual behavior of each cell, allowing for a more detailed exploration of the dynamic interplay within the tumor microenvironment. This model not only advances our understanding of tumor-immune interactions but also holds potential for informing more effective therapeutic strategies, making a significant contribution to the field of mathematical oncology.},

On the other hand, we use the bifurcation theory to qualitatively analyze the equation and find the model has periodic solutions, bell-shaped soliton solutions, and solitary wave solutions via phase diagrams. The topological stability of the solutions with respect to the parameters is explored in order to better understand the effect of parameters perturbations on the stability of the model&#39;s solutions.

  abstract     = {This article presents an analytical investigation performed on a generalized geophysical Korteweg–de Vries model with nonlinear power law in ocean science. To start with, achieving diverse solitary wave solutions to the generalized power-law model involves using wave transformation, which reduces the model to a nonlinear ordinary differential equation. A direct integration approach is adopted to construct solutions in the beginning. This brings the emergence of interesting solutions like non-topological solitons, trigonometric functions, exponential functions, elliptic functions, and Weierstrass functions in general structures. Besides, in a bid to secure more general exact solutions to the model, one adopts the extended Jacobi elliptic function expansion technique (for some specific cases of n $$ n $$ ). Thus, various cnoidal, snoidal, and dnoidal wave solutions to the understudied model are attained. The copolar trio explicated in a tabular form reveals that these solutions can be relapsed to various hyperbolic and trigonometric functions under certain criteria. Additionally, diverse graphical exhibitions of the dynamical attributes of the gained results are presented in a bid to have a sound understanding of the physical phenomena of the underlying model. Later, one gives the conserved vectors of the aforementioned equation by employing the standard multiplier approach.},

  abstract     = {The study focuses on the fractional complex order plant model, which has gained popularity in applied mathematics, physics, and control systems. A significant contribution of this research lies in discussing the physical phenomena associated with complex plant models and their impact on system stability and robustness. The main purpose of the method presented in this paper is to tune the controller parameters to ensure the stability and robustness of the system. There are methods presented in the literature for this purpose. One of these methods is to keep the phase curve in the system frequency response flat within a certain range. However, this process is based on equating the derivative of the phase value to zero at a certain frequency and adds great mathematical complexity to the calculations. In this study, reliable analytical formulas are presented for the same purpose using a graphical approach. Since the fractional complex order plant model represents the most general mathematical form, it enables easy creation of other plant models, including integer order and fractional order plant. The reason why this plant is chosen is that this structure can be named as the universal plant, which all other structures can be built by making little variations. For instance, a transfer function having integer, real and/or complex number coefficients and/or orders can be obtained by proper determination of the parameters of the universal plant. A time delay can also be added towards researcher&#39;s desire. The main inspiration comes from studying on an inclusive plant. The method in this paper intends to tune the well-known classical Proportional Integral Derivative controller. Thus, effectiveness of the integer order controller on various plants will be shown. This approach provides analytical calculation equations for the physical modifications of plants with integer, fractional, and/or complex coefficients and/or orders. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated visually with different examples that include these different possible situations. The results observed in the changes of the parameters in the transfer functions were also examined. Thus, pros and cons of the variations of integer, fractional, and complex numbers on system parameters have been shown.},

In the present work, we use the dynamical system theory to discuss the dynamics of the harvested prey–predator system in the presence of infection in prey species. Detailed mathematical and numerical evaluations have been presented to discuss the susceptible-free state, infection-free state, predator-free state, species coexistence, stability, and occurrence of various bifurcations (saddle-node, transcritical, and Hopf bifurcation). The study reveals the impact of harvesting parameters on the dynamics. Interestingly, we observe that an infection-free state could be achieved by varying the harvesting parameter under all three harvesting schemes (linear, quadratic, and nonlinear). Moreover, with the help of reproduction number, we claim that linear harvesting is more effective in controlling the infection than quadratic and nonlinear harvesting provided the half-saturation constant for nonlinear harvesting is greater than a threshold value ( = 1 ) $$ \left(&amp;amp;amp;#x0003D;1\right) $$ ; otherwise, nonlinear harvesting is more effective. Also, the system can support more susceptible prey in the presence of harvesting. The present theoretical study suggests different threshold values of implemented harvesting to control the disease.},

Both stability and error estimates of the new algorithm are deeply analyzed in the L ∞ $$ {L}&amp;amp;amp;#x0005E;{\infty } $$ -norm. The proposed method is explicit, unconditionally stable, temporal second-order accurate and fourth-order convergence in space. This result suggests that the constructed scheme is faster and more efficient than a broad range of numerical methods widely studied in the literature for the Black-Scholes models.

Special cases of such ratios in terms of certain continued fractions are exhibited. Moreover, examples are discussed for obtaining the orthogonality of quasi-type kernel polynomials of order 1.},

Backward bifurcation is caused by the imperfect protection rate of susceptible population due to education. Using China&#39;s actual data for parameter fitting, it is found that new HIV infections are on an upward trend. In response to this phenomenon, publicity and education, condoms, screening, and treatment of infected populations are considered as control measures. It is concluded that publicity and education is the primary strategy. This measure can not only effectively reduce the number of infected populations but also effectively increase the awareness rate of HIV-infected populations. It is recommended to use condoms and have fewer sexual partners during sexual contact. Numerical simulation verifies that early stage publicity and education are much more important than post-infection screening and treatment measures.},

  abstract     = {The Boltzmann equation is a typical example of partially dissipative equations, where the linearized collision operator is positive definite with respect to the microscopic part and the dissipation of the hydrodynamic part is discovered from the coupling structure between the transport operator and the linearized collision operator. Guo and Wang (Comm. Partial Differential Equations, 37, 2012) developed a general energy method for proving the optimal time decay rates of the solution to such type of equations in the whole space; however, the decay rate of the highest order spatial derivatives of the solution is not optimal. In this paper, by incorporating the high-low frequency decomposition in the energy estimates, both linearly and nonlinearly, we prove the optimal decay rates of any high order spatial derivatives of the low frequency part of the solution to the Boltzmann equation and the almost exponential decay rate of the high frequency part, which imply in particular the optimal decay rate of the highest order spatial derivatives of the solution. Moreover, the velocity-weighted assumption of the initial data required in Guo and Wang (Comm. Partial Differential Equations, 37, 2012) is removed by capturing the time-weighted dissipation estimates via the time-weighted energy method. The method can be applied to the compressible Navier–Stokes equations and many partially dissipative equations in kinetic theory and fluid dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Quantum graphs model processes in complex systems represented as spatial networks in various fields of natural science and technology. An example is the oscillations of elastic string networks, the nodes of which, besides the continuity conditions, also obey the Kirchhoff conditions, expressing the balance of tensions. In this paper, we propose a new look at quantum graphs as temporal networks, which means that the variable parametrizing the edges of a graph is interpreted as time, while each internal vertex is a branching point giving several different scenarios for the further trajectory of a process. Then Kirchhoff-type conditions may also arise. Namely, they will be satisfied by such a trajectory of the process that is optimal with account of all the scenarios simultaneously. By employing the recent concept of global delay, we extend the problem of damping a first-order control system with aftereffect, considered earlier only on an interval, to an arbitrary tree graph. The first means that the delay, imposed starting from the initial moment of time, associated with the root of the tree, propagates through all internal vertices. Bringing the system into the equilibrium and minimizing the energy functional with account of the anticipated probability of each scenario, we come to a variational problem. Then, we establish its equivalence to a self-adjoint boundary value problem on the tree for some second-order equations involving both the global delay and the global advance. The unique solvability of both problems is proved. We also illustrate that the interval case when the coefficients of the equation are discrete stochastic processes in discrete time can be viewed as the extension to a tree.},

Applying the Floquet-Bloch transform to the scattering problem yields a family of quasi-periodic boundary value problems dependent on the Floquet-Bloch parameter. Consequently, the solution of the original scattering problem is written as the inverse Floquet-Bloch transform of the solutions to these boundary value problems. The key step in our method is the numerical approximation of this integral transform by a quadrature rule with a nonuniform choice of quadrature points adapted to the regularity of the family of quasi-periodic solutions. This achieved by a graded subdivision of the full interval for the Floquet-Bloch parameter and applying a Gauss-Legrendre quadrature rule on each subinterval. We prove that the numerical method converges exponentially with respect to both the number of subintervals and the number of Gaussian quadrature points. Some numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the results.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the chaotic analysis and attractive domain of a fractional-order Φ 6 -van der Pol with time delay velocity under harmonic excitation. Firstly, eight different types of bifurcation states of the system under different parameters are calculated by using the undisturbed system. Secondly, the Melnikov method is used to explore the effect of time delay velocity on the threshold of chaos in the Smale horseshoe sense under the double-well potential and three-well potential of the system. Finally, through numerical analysis of the phase diagram, bifurcation diagram, and maximum Lyapunov exponent, the influence of time delay velocity on system chaos is studied. The results indicate that an increase in the delay velocity coefficient will lead to the system transitioning from a chaotic state to a periodic state, while an increase in the delay velocity term will lead to the system transitioning from a periodic state to a chaotic state. In the study of system bifurcation, it is found that the position of the equilibrium points of the system changes during periodic motion. Therefore, cell mapping is used to draw the attractive domain of the system is studying the influence of initial conditions on the equilibrium point of the system and the results show that there is a close relationship between the attraction domain and the process of chaos occurrence.},

  abstract     = {As many countries are hit by the social economic impact of heroin addiction, there is an urgent need to have an effective awareness program that focuses on educating the population on the danger of heroin addiction and helping the heroin-users quit. This paper aims to study the effect of the awareness program on the spread of heroin dependence using a mathematical model with distributed delay. First, we show the existence threshold parameter R 0 $$ {\mathfrak{R}}_0 $$ , which we call the basic reproduction number of the spread of heroin use. We prove, via the Lyapunov direct method, that the drug-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable if R 0 &lt; 1 $$ {\mathfrak{R}}_0&amp;amp;lt;1 $$ . If R 0 &gt; 1 $$ {\mathfrak{R}}_0&amp;amp;gt;1 $$ , the drug dependence persists, and the drug equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. We give three possible scenarios to find the optimal awareness program strategy that puts the heroin epidemic under control. These scenarios take into consideration the reachability of the population, the immunity against heroin addiction, and the effectiveness of the program to contain the use of heroin in the population and bring R 0 $$ {\mathfrak{R}}_0 $$ below one.},

  abstract     = {Usually, it is not direct to translate theoretical results to practice. One of the challenges is the real computation of solutions to proposed problems, when infinite numbers (such as real numbers or the unit interval) are considered. The same is true when consequences (information) from a data set modeled by logical rules need to be obtained. In this framework, this information is obtained from the immediate consequences operator and ensuring its continuity is fundamental for making sure the computation of this information in a countable number of iterations. Recently, a versatile operator using generalized quantifiers has been introduced. This note will advance in the knowledge introducing necessary and sufficient conditions to ensure the continuity of this new flexible operator.},

Our analysis is based on the existence of a Jacobi last multiplier and a time-dependent first integral. Suitable conditions on the model parameters allow for the reduction of the problem to a planar system of equations, and the time-dependent Hamiltonian flows are described. The geometry of the Hamiltonian flows is also investigated using the symplectic and cosymplectic methods.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the inverse problems for the wave equation in a medium in which multiple types of cavities and inclusion exist in a mixture are considered. From the point of view of the indicator function of the enclosure method, there are two types of heterogeneous parts: “minus group” and “plus group.” For example, cavities with the Dirichlet boundary condition belong to the minus group, while inclusions with smaller propagation velocity belong to the plus group. The heterogeneous part of the minus group gives a negative sign to the indicator function, and the heterogeneous part of the plus group gives a positive sign. In general, the presence of many types of heterogeneous parts causes cancelation of the sign of the indicator function. Such cases are referred to as “mixed cases.” Here, we consider the case that the shortest length obtained from the indicator function is attained only by heterogeneous parts of the same group. This case is called the “mixed but separated case,” and it is shown that the method of elliptic estimates developed by Ikehata works well. We also show that the case of a two-layered background medium with a flat layer can be considered in the same way as the case of a homogeneous background medium.},

  abstract     = {A filtration system comprising a Biot poroelastic solid coupled to an incompressible Stokes free-flow is considered in 3D. Across the flat 2D interface, the Beavers-Joseph-Saffman coupling conditions are taken. In the inertial, linear, and non-degenerate case, the hyperbolic-parabolic coupled problem is posed through a dynamics operator on a chosen energy space, adapted from Stokes-Lamé coupled dynamics. A semigroup approach is utilized to circumvent issues associated to mismatched trace regularities at the interface. The generation of a strongly continuous semigroup for the dynamics operator is obtained via a non-standard maximality argument. The latter employs a mixed-variational formulation in order to invoke the Babuška-Brezzi theorem. The Lumer-Philips theorem then yields semigroup generation, and thereby, strong and generalized solutions are obtained. For the linear dynamics, density obtains the existence of weak solutions; we extend to the case where the Biot compressibility of constituents degenerates. Thus, for the inertial linear Biot-Stokes filtration system, we provide a clear elucidation of strong solutions and a construction of weak solutions, as well as their regularity through associated estimates.},
