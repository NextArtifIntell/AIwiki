The soft actuator is realized by rolling a mat of two active layers, interleaved with two electrodes. The active layers are mats of P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE)-based nanofibers, embedded in an elastomeric matrix of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The electrodes are made of a mixture of carbon black and PDMS, bonded to the active layers by electrostatic adhesion force. The effects of the nanofibers in the soft actuators are investigated. Specimens of the soft actuator are realized that differ in the thickness of the nanofibrous mats used for the active layers, that is, 60 and 120 μm. An electromechanical characterization is performed to analyze and measure the axial force and axial displacements of the soft actuators when different electric fields are applied to the specimens in the transversal direction. The experimental results show that the presence of P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE)-based nanofibers enhances the force-to-weight ratio of the soft actuators by up to 43.5%, and the energy density by up to 12.9%, compared to a control specimen with the active layer made of PDMS only.},

  abstract     = {Printed electronics have traditionally used substrates and materials derived from fuel-based or less abundant and toxic resources, raising environmental concerns. Wood as a substrate reduces processing steps and enables the integration of intelligent functionalities in wooden furniture, offering biodegradability, nontoxicity, and derivation from renewable sources. In this work, sustainably printed transistors using zinc oxide nanoparticles as the active layer and honey electrolyte on wood substrates are demonstrated as a promising approach to reduce the environmental footprint of electronics. Despite the substrate&#39;s high roughness, the transistor exhibits excellent performance for screen-printed devices, with low on-voltage of 0.32 ± 0.12 V and high I on /I off of (2.4 ± 0.9) × 10 4 . Further analysis of hysteresis in transfer curves under varying scan rates and sweep ranges reveals the device&#39;s ability to adjust memory windows and on-current. Notably, these devices successfully emulate synapses, exhibiting neural facilitation and plasticity, indicating a shift toward sustainable computing. The device&#39;s dynamic response to single and successive presynaptic pulses demonstrates its ability to adjust synaptic weight, transition from transient to persistent memory, and pulse width-, frequency-, voltage-, and number-dependent excitatory postsynaptic currents. The successful emulation of the learning–forgetting–relearning–forgetting process underscores the device&#39;s potential for use in sustainable high-performance neuromorphic systems.},

  abstract     = {For energy- and time-efficient artificial intelligence (AI) computing, implementing hardware-based spiking neural networks (SNNs) has become a core technology. In SNNs, synaptic devices store weights in memory, and neurons process received weighted information and generate spike signals. Upon feeding spike signals into synaptic arrays, the synaptic weights multiply the signals, which subsequently sum up to perform vector-matrix multiplication (VMM). Simultaneous access to multiple synaptic devices, however, reduces the equivalent resistance of these synaptic arrays. This reduction alters the voltage division between the pre-synaptic array and the input resistance of the neuron circuit, distorting the read voltage across synaptic devices. This phenomenon is known as the fan-in problem, which leads to non-ideal VMM operations and degrades system accuracy. To address this issue, a novel compensated current mirror (CCM) neuron circuit is proposed, which incorporates a single additional transistor into a conventional current mirror. This CCM neuron achieves exceptional current linearity ( R 2 &gt; 0.999) and efficiently compensates for VMM error with low complexity and energy consumption (3.33 pJ spike −1 ). Furthermore, the CCM neuron demonstrates ≈7-%p higher inference accuracy than conventional ones when integrated with a 512 × 512 large-scale synaptic array, which is comparable to the accuracy of software-based SNNs.},

On the other hand, visually impaired users rely on tactile displays as one of the key communication devices to interact with the digital world. However, due to their working mechanism and the uneven surface of tactile displays, one of the key features of screens for sighted users is surprisingly challenging to implement: precision touch input. To overcome this, a hand gesture recognition system is developed using a frequency-modulated continuous wave millimeter-wave radar. A multifeature encoder method is used to obtain the range and velocity information from the radar to translate the data into spectrogram images. Gesture recognition is implemented for common input gestures: single/double-click, swipe-right/left, scroll-up/down, zoom-in/out, and rotate-anticlockwise/clockwise. The gesture recognition and classification are based on machine learning, support vector machines, deep learning, and convolutional neural network approaches. The chosen model You-Only-Look-Once (YOLOv8) shows a high accuracy of 97.1% by iterating only 30 epochs with only 500 collected data samples per gesture. This research paves the way toward using radar sensors not only for tactile displays but also for other digital devices in human–computer interaction.},

A linear actuator switches a compliant mechanism to cut off airflow through off-the-shelf tubing. The modular compliant logic devices can be configured as normally open or normally closed switches, as NOT, AND, and OR gates, and as nonvolatile memory elements. Their use is demonstrated in controlling a fluidic stepper motor, a worm-like robot, and a fluidic display. These fluidic switches are printable using inexpensive desktop 3D printers, can be reliably reproduced in large quantities, and offer a wide range of modifiable parameters, including scalability, adaptability in operating pressure, and the tunability of instability counts for computational and memory functions.},

In this work, a detailed characterization of a millimeter-scale (1–5 mm) adhesion modulation method is performed, demonstrating its effectiveness for switching adhesion on small, lightweight objects with smooth surfaces. This modulation phenomenon arises from the viscoelastic behavior when PDMS interacts with a rigid surface and is controlled via microvibration. A maximum apparent adhesion enhancement of 2400% and a reduction of 50% are achieved with a 1 mm-diameter PDMS hemisphere vibrating at a 30 μm amplitude and a 700 Hz frequency. The effects of different parameters, including size, actuation amplitude/frequency, surface roughness, and material properties, on adhesion performance are carefully measured and analyzed. A monotonic increase in maximum adhesion is observed with increased device size and surface smoothness, while nonlinear relationships of other factors are generalized with a numerical model. A long working lifespan and high endurance are also observed during the characterization. This work serves as a practical reference for the further design of small-scale soft grippers, highlighting its continuous, large modulation range, simple structure, and flexible control.},

Hodgkin–Huxley (H–H) neurons based on memristors feature great merits of high bio-plausibility and low hardware cost. However, a universal design rule of memristive H–H neurons is still lacking, hindering its development and applications. Herein, a universal H–H neuron circuit structure is proposed and its feasibility based on NbO x memristors is demonstrated. The constructed neuron achieves 23 types of firing behaviors observed in biological neurons, simplifying the communication between neurons. To better understand the correlation between circuit parameters and firing patterns, the firing patterns into three classes according to the switching cycle ratio of two memristors are categorized. The circuit design rules of each category of firing patterns are deeply elucidated and universal regularities for tuning circuit parameters to implement the switch between different firing behaviors are presented. Finally, the potential applications of different firing behaviors in neuromorphic intelligence systems are discussed. This work provides theoretical guidance for engineering memristive H–H neuron circuits, assisting in building high-order neuromorphic systems based on firing patterns.},

However, existing systems have been limited to a single or a few sensors in parallel, so they are not comparable to the state-of-the-art electrical resistive and capacitive touchpads, which can detect rich tactile information, including touch location, pressure, area, and even multiple touches simultaneously. This work reports a soft micropneumatic touchpad. The touchpad consists of 32 pneumatic channels inside soft elastomer, with 16 channels aligned row-wise and 16 column-wise. The flow resistance of each channel is measured using a pressure divider. When the pad is touched, the cross-sectional area of the channels close to the contact location deforms, which changes the flow resistance of those channels. With 32 sensing channels, the location, depth, area of the contact, and even two simultaneous touches can be detected. Letters hand-written on the touchpad can be reconstructed from the measured data. With the assumption of sparsity, a tactile pressure map, with a value at each 16 × 16 grid point, can also be reconstructed. This work opens a path to replace electronic tactile sensors in soft devices with all-fluidic alternatives.},

  abstract     = {This article presents an extended Cartesian space robot control framework that features a virtual force tracking impedance control to enhance the end-effector trajectory tracking performance. Initially, the concept of a virtual surface is introduced, which is assumed to be at some constant distance from the desired end-effector trajectory. This virtual surface generates a virtual contact force when interacting with the torque-controlled robot end-effector. The interaction is then manipulated using an impedance control model to track a constant desired force. If the robot end-effector deviates from the desired trajectory, the constant force-tracking impedance control generates a compliance trajectory that regulates the end-effector movements, constraining it to the desired trajectory. For robust force tracking, impedance parameters are optimally tuned using a closed-loop dynamic model incorporating both robot and impedance dynamics. Additionally, super twisting sliding mode control (STSMC) is integrated to overcome uncertainties and the impact of robot dynamics on force-tracking performance. Experimental validation confirms the theoretical claims of the proposed approach. It demonstrates that force-tracking impedance control improves the end-effector trajectory tracking by quickly reacting to the dynamic trajectories compared to position control only and effectively maintains it on the desired trajectories.},

  abstract     = {The newly suggested synapse capacitor (synaptor) in this work has a cross-point feature, enabling implementation at a feature size of 4F 2 . This synaptor has a gate surrounding semiconductor pillar (GSSP) structure with overturned charge injection (OCI) scheme to ensure high capacitive memory window. Sentaurus TCAD simulation tools are used to demonstrate the process feasibility and device characteristics. Two important process parameters are optimized to show the best characteristics; overlap height ( H ov ) and channel pillar height ( H ch ). An OCI-GSSP device that has an aspect ratio of 10 and the minimal overlap height shows the highest C on / C off over 5 in 40 nm wordline and BL pitch. It is the highest value and the smallest unit device size among the capacitive synapses that have been reported up to now. Advantages of scaled OCI-GSSP devices are appealed through subarray circuit simulation. The subarray composed of OCI-GSSP synaptor can calculate one vector-matrix multiplication operation with energy under 200 fJ and column delay of 3 ns, and result in sufficient signal margin of 275 mV.},

By collaborating across multiple institutions, the study seeks to develop models that allow rapid online estimation of organ doses, eliminating the need for complex organ segmentation. Researchers delineate skin outlines from chest CT images obtained from two different institutions. Radiomics features are extracted from the chest CT data and skin contours. Organ doses are computed using Monte Carlo simulations as reference organ doses. Single- and cross-institutional support vector regression (SVR) models are trained with radiomics features to predict organ doses from chest CT scans. Model performance is assessed using metrics like maean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and R -squared ( R 2 ). For chest organs (lungs, heart, spinal cord, trachea, and esophagus), single-institutional SVR models achieve MAPE values ranging from 4.72% to 15.31% and R 2 values from 0.73 to 0.93. Cross-institutional models have MAPE values in the range of 2.16–7.49% and R 2 values from 0.84 to 0.99. SVR models trained with radiomics features from skin outlines can reliably estimate organ doses from chest CT scans. The proposed method is applicable across different institutions, and cross-institutional models enhance predictive accuracy, generality, and robustness.},

They offer promising advantages, namely, a high dynamic range, low latency, and minimal motion blur. Modern computer vision algorithms often rely on artificial neural network approaches, which require image-like representations of the data and cannot fully exploit the characteristics of event data. Herein, approaches to action recognition based on the Fourier transform are proposed. The approaches are intended to recognize oscillating motion patterns commonly present in nature. In particular, the approaches are applied to a recent dataset of breeding penguins annotated for “ecstatic display,” a behavior where the observed penguins flap their wings at a certain frequency. It is found that the approaches are both simple and effective, producing slightly lower results than a deep neural network (DNN) while relying just on a tiny fraction of the parameters compared to the DNN (five orders of magnitude fewer parameters). They work well despite the uncontrolled, diverse data present in the dataset. It is hoped that this work opens a new perspective on event-based processing and action recognition.},

  abstract     = {Online learning aims to solve a sequence of consecutive prediction tasks by leveraging the knowledge gained from previous tasks. Linearized confidence-weighted (LCW) learning is the first online learning algorithm introducing the concept of weight confidence into the prediction model through distributions over weights. It provides the flexibility for weights to update their values at different scales. The kernel trick in machine learning can be applied to LCW for a better prediction performance. However, the kernel-based LCW algorithm is subject to the curse of kernelization which makes it vulnerable to the unlimited growth of the prediction model in runtime and memory consumption. In this study, we present the budgeted LCW (BLCW) algorithm which puts a limit on the growth by a predefined budget with optimization. Consequently, BLCW performs the LCW update and then reduces the information loss by projection. Based on the resource perspective that reinterprets LCW in terms of resources and utilization degrees, we demonstrated that BLCW approximates the kernel-based LCW algorithm. We evaluate four budget maintenance strategies and suggest that the mean removal is the most stable. By various numerical experiments on real datasets, we demonstrate that BLCW performs competitively and effectively when compared to leading budgeted online algorithms.},

Learning-based controllers for continuum soft manipulators offer a viable alternative to model-based approaches that may struggle to account for uncertainties and variability in soft materials, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Learning-based controllers can be trained through experience, exploiting various forward models that differ in physical assumptions, accuracy, and computational cost. In this article, the key features of popular forward models, including geometrical, pseudo-rigid, continuum mechanical, or learned, are first summarized. Then, a unique characterization of learning-based policies, emphasizing the impact of forward models on the control problem and how the state of the art evolves, is offered.

The motion controllability of HMNRs is realized by applying oscillating magnetic field and customized magnetic field. Experimentally, it is demonstrated that the HMNR swarms driven by the oscillating magnetic field exhibit a faster motion speed than the MNR swarms composed of magnetic particles. The HMNRs show precise controllability of the movement in the complex pipeline under the control of customized magnetic field.

  abstract     = {A biological muscle&#39;s force is nonlinearly constrained by its current state (force, length, and speed) and state history. To investigate if artificial muscles can mimic (i.e. biomimetic) the complete mechanical state spectrum of biological muscles, this study uses a novel method to characterize twisted coiled polymer actuators (TCPAs) mechanically. Thus, comprehensive and reproducible test procedures are established to verify artificial muscle biomimetics regarding stress, strain, and strain rate combinations intrinsic to biological muscle. A rheometer performs novel high-precision mechanical characterization methods to comprehensively verify biomimetic performance. Sample twist level, torque, length, force, and temperature are controlled and measured during twist-induced coiling, heatsetting/annealing, and mechanical testing. TCPAs are formed from linear low-density polyethylene monofilament. Linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) TCPAs generate larger stresses than biological muscle through the entire spectrum of strains—contracting more than 40%, exerting more than 0.3 MPa at rest length, and withstanding tension of 8 MPa without damage. Thus, the LLDPE TCPAs attain biological muscle performance statically, but additional tests are required to assess this dynamically. The mechanical performance of LLDPE TCPAs enables biomimetic actuation with an intelligent control and measurement system. Their high-throughput textile manufacturability positions them for advanced biomechatronic applications—including prosthetics and exoskeletons.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a biomechanics-based, user-adaptive variable impedance controller designed to enhance the performance of coupled human–robot systems during motion. The controller integrates the biomechanical characteristics of human limbs and dynamically adjusts the robotic impedance parameters—specifically damping, stiffness, and equilibrium trajectory—based on real-time estimations of the user&#39;s intent and direction of motion. The primary goal is to minimize the energy expenditure of the coupled human–robot system while maintaining system passivity. To address uncertainties in human behavior and noisy observations, the controller employs Bayesian optimization combined with a Gaussian process. To validate the proposed approach, human experiments are conducted using a standard robotic arm manipulator. The results demonstrate that the controller eliminates the need for manual parameter tuning, a process that is typically time-consuming. A comparative analysis against two variable impedance controllers without user-adaptive parameter adjustments reveal significant benefits, with the controller improving combined performance metrics—such as accuracy, speed, user effort, and smoothness—by over 13%. Notably, all participants in the study preferred the optimized controller over the alternatives. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the biomechanics-based, user-adaptive variable impedance control approach and its potential to enhance physical human–robot interaction in various applications that involve repetitive or continuous motion.},

Next, the main synthetic shape-changing soft systems are presented in terms of their mechanism of action. A gradient in water-swelling, magneto-rheological properties, residual deformation, or extensibility gives hygromorphs, magnetomorphs, mechanomorphs, and baromorphs, respectively. The various morphing triggers, namely light, heat, pH, tensile stress, pressure, electric, and magnetic fields, are described. The opportunities and challenges of each system are put into perspective.

However, most existing research in this area focuses on shape control for a provided explicit goal and does not consider physical constraints, which limits its applicability in many real-world scenarios. In this study, a self-supervised planning and control approach are proposed to address the challenge of rearranging deformable linear objects for implicit goals. Specifically, the context of making both ends of the object reachable (inside the robotic access range) and graspable (outside potential collision regions) by dual-arm robots is considered. Firstly, the object is described with sequential keypoints and the correspondence-based action is parameterized. Secondly, a generator capable of producing multiple explicit targets is developed, which adhere to implicit conditions. Thirdly, value models are learnt to assign the most promising explicit target as guidance and determine the goal-conditioned action. All models within the policy are trained in a self-supervised manner based on data collected from simulations. Importantly, the learned policy can be directly applied to real-world settings since we do not rely on accurate dynamic models. The performance of the new method is validated with simulations and real-world experiments.},

The magnetic elastomer is produced by combining NdFeB powders with a diameter of 5 μm into silicone, following a weight ratio of 50%, and then magnetized using 2D Halbach-array magnets. Simulation results reveal the capability to adjust magnetic field strength and distribution by altering the magnet&#39;s orientation. The sensor&#39;s efficacy in 3-axis sensing is validated through calibration with a linear model, achieving a good root-mean-square error below 0.7 N in force measurement. The H-PME sensor, with a thickness of merely 4.5 mm, can detect forces up to 50 N. It&#39;s simple 3-layer design allows the thickness to be reduced to as low as 2 mm, while also offering ease of replacement. Crucially, crosstalk evaluation experiments show that the proposed H-PME sensor can dramatically mitigate crosstalk interference.},

  abstract     = {Insects such as ants and termites have always been a common household hazard, closely correlated to various health risks causing allergies or infections. Present-day chemical insecticides pose carcinogenic threats to human health and the environment, according to the World Health Organisation. Herein, a novel autonomous robotic ultrathin laser-scribed microheater is presented as a safe, efficient, and cost-effective alternative for insect control. A microheater is fabricated using an array of laser-scribed micro-wires and an autonomous robotic module, allowing for rapid and uniform heat transfer in less than 3 s. The integrated robotic microheater successfully (100%) eradicates household ants at 60 °C within 30 s. Such results significantly advance insect control, reducing treatment time from hours to seconds while attenuating chemical insecticides’ critical safety and health risks. Ultimately, this innovative approach demonstrates the promise of autonomous robotic microheaters for broader agriculture, healthcare, and manufacturing applications, where insect control is crucial.},

  abstract     = {Surface functional microstructures exhibit extensive application requirements in an array of breakthrough areas. One critical problem that restricts their industrial application is the lack of scalable fabrication techniques due to the limitation of conventional machine tools. This study proposes a scalable surface texturing technique using a portable small (30 × 19 × 22 mm) three-leg robot that walks and works on the workpiece surface. Due to the elliptical tool vibration, microgrooves can be created on the workpiece surface periodically; meanwhile, the machining force drives the robot to walk forward. Surface texturing experiments are conducted on aluminum and copper workpieces to explore the machining performance of the small robot. The robot can reach a maximum moving velocity of 6.3 mm s −1 and can produce microstructures with a spacing of 4–14 μm on workpiece surfaces. Owing to its unique working principle, the small robot can maintain a constant depth of cut, demonstrating its capacity to adapt to the surface waviness of the workpiece. Finally, the motion straightness of the robot is greatly improved by combining it with the auxiliary track, and multiline microstructures are obtained. In short, the developed small robot presents a promising solution to the challenge of scalable surface texturing.},
