  abstract     = {In this work, we benchmark the accuracy of the density-functional tight-binding (DFTB) method, namely the long-range corrected second-order (LC-DFTB2) and third-order (DFTB3) models, for predicting energetics of imidazolium-based ionic liquid (IL) ion pairs. We compare the DFTB models against popular density functionals such as LC-ωPBE and B3LYP, using ab initio domain-based local pair-natural orbital coupled cluster (DLPNO-CC) energies as reference. Calculations were carried out in the gas phase, as well as in aqueous solution using implicit solvent methods. We find that the LC-DFTB2 model shows excellent performance in the gas phase and agrees well with reference energies in implicit solvent, often outperforming DFTB3 predictions for complexation energetics. Our study identifies a range of opportunities for use of the LC-DFTB method and quantifies its sensitivity to protonation states and the types of chemical interactions between ion pairs.},

Therefore, in this work, to explore emergent sensor materials, 3 d -metal dimers-doped hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) structures were investigated employing auxiliary density functional theory (ADFT) as novel CO and NO gas sensors. Firstly, the stabilities of Co 2 , Ni 2 , and Cu 2 dimers deposited on defective h-BN were determined. Then, sensitivities of 3 d -metal dimers-doped h-BN structures towards the NO and CO gases were investigated. It was found that the interaction energies of these 3 d -metal dimers embedded on defective h-BN are higher than those deposited on pristine h-BN structure, which indicates that the 3 d -metal dimers exhibit good stability on defective h-BN. Moreover, this work demonstrated that the CO and NO adsorption energies on 3 d -metal dimers-doped h-BN structures are higher than those computed in the literature for pristine h-BN structure. Consequently, the here considered 3 d -metal dimers-doped h-BN structures can be good candidates for toxic CO and NO gas detection.},

Multi-step mechanisms are proposed, where the activation energies of the rate-determining step are strongly lowered compared to gas phase reaction, exhibiting, however, a unique step. Also, these reactions are viewed to be favored thermodynamically in the presence of these catalysts and also in solvents, in particular in methanol. We suggest thus the use of NaBr and MgO nanoclusters for these reactions. Besides, the present findings allow to explain the experimentally observed regioselectivity of carbonylation of aziridines reactions, where CO is added on the more substituted C of aziridine three-membered ring. In sum, our work should motivate the use of such ecofriendly catalysts for carbonylation reactions without using transition metal catalysts.},

The largest system showed near-perfect strong scaling up to 512 nodes or 65,536 cores, maintaining a parallel efficiency above 0.9 even at the highest level of parallelization. Energy efficiency for a given number of nodes was generally equal to or slightly better than parallel efficiency. We achieved peak performances of 687 ns/d for the 82k atom system, 116 ns/d for the 53M atom system, and about 35 ns/d for the largest 204M atom system. These results demonstrate that highly optimized software running on a state-of-the-art HPC cluster provides sufficient computing power to simulate biomolecular systems at the mesoscale of viruses and organelles, and potentially small cells in the near future.},

Benchmark tests on various systems, including QM water in water, amino acids in water, and tripeptides validate the reliability of the new functionalities. Performance evaluations demonstrate that the updated implementation is efficient, with the primary computational burden attributed to the QM program rather than the QM/MM interface or the MD program itself. The improved QM/MM interface enables more advanced investigations into biomolecular reactivity, enzyme catalysis, and other phenomena requiring detailed quantum mechanical treatment within classical simulations.

Polarizability and long-range LJ interactions increase the membrane surface viscosity, which decreases the translational diffusion constants. Simulated diffusion constants for dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) extrapolated to infinite system size agree well with experiment for Drude2023, but overestimate experiment by 60% (on average) and a factor of 2.5 for C36/LJ-PME and C36, respectively. The relaxation time of lipid wobble is described about equally well by C36/LJ-PME and Drude2023, as consistent with the hexadecane viscosity for the FF, and both are more accurate than C36. Hence, physical improvements in the FF, which slowed down these dynamic processes led to better agreement with experiment. Lastly, bilayers containing 10 influenza fusion peptides and high fractions of lysolipids (which are known to accelerate pore formation) were simulated with C36 and Drude2023. Pore formation rates were comparable for the two FF for the bilayers with 80% and 90% lysolipid. However, while no pores formed in 24 μs (including a single 20 μs trajectory) in the 70% lysolipid with C36, 4 of 15 replicates formed pores in less than 1 μs with Drude. While the pathway to poration is qualitatively similar for the additive and polarizable FF for the systems studied, Drude2023 should be considered for quantitative studies of pore formation, and, in some cases, will accelerate the process.},

  abstract     = {Diphenylamine (DPA) derivatives, used as antioxidants in rubber-based products, inhibit autoxidation by donating hydrogen atoms to peroxyl radicals. Octanol–water partition coefficient (LogK ow ), an antioxidant index, helps predict their distribution in hydrophobic polymer matrices. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between the structure of DPA derivatives and their antioxidant activities, using machine learning with quantitative structure–activity relationships (QSAR) and quantum mechanics (QM). The structure of DPA derivatives was optimized using Density Functional Theory and analyzed for molecular properties. The QSAR models were trained using important descriptors identified through permutation importance. Among the models developed, the Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR) showed the best performance, with R 2 of 0.983 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.642 for the test set. SHAP analysis revealed that molecular weight and electronic properties significantly influenced LogK ow predictions. For instance, a higher molecular weight was associated with increased LogK ow , and a higher positive charge of C2 correlated with higher LogK ow predictions. Consequently, the two potent compounds (D1 and D2) were designed based on QSAR model guidance. The GBR model predicted LogK ow values of 9.789 and 7.102 for D1 and D2, respectively, which are higher than the training compounds in the model. To gain molecular insight, the quantum chemical calculations with M062X/6–311++G(d,p)//M062X/6-31G(d,p) were performed to investigate the bond dissociation enthalpy (BDE). The results showed that D1 (79.50 kcal/mol) and D2 (72.43 kcal/mol) exhibited lower BDEs than the reference compounds, suggesting that the designed compounds have the potential for enhanced antioxidant activity. In addition, the antioxidant reaction mechanism was studied by using M062X/6–311++G(d,p)//M062X/6-31G(d,p) which found that the hydrogen atom transfer is the key step, where D1 and D2 showed activation energy barriers of 10.38 and 6.29 kcal/mol, respectively, compared to reference compounds of R3 (10.39 kcal/mol), R1 (10.40 kcal/mol), and R2 (18.26 kcal/mol). Therefore, our findings demonstrate that integrating QSAR with quantum chemical calculations can effectively guide the design of DPA derivatives with improved antioxidant properties.},

The calculated Δ G p energies for amino SBFs in the S 1 state range from 985 to 1100 kJ mol −1 which are below the values for guanidines. The protonation of the guanidine-SBFs induces a hypsochromic shift of the absorption and the emission maxima with the Stokes shift of &gt; 100 nm in both cases. Isomerization through the ESIPT process is less probable than in amino-SBFs due to the unfavorable thermodynamics. Still, if it occurs, it leads to a strong red shift of the emission by &gt; 150 nm. Aromaticity indices point to strong antiaromatic character of the examined guanidino-SBFs in the FC region which decreases upon geometrical relaxation and ESIPT. The excited state proton transfer occurs in guanidine-SBF/phenol complexes in the S 1 state, stabilizing CT states and fluorescence quenching.},

  abstract     = {The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is a challenging target for theoretical approaches. Here we report a benchmark calculation of the spike protein droplet model by the fragment molecular orbital (FMO) at the second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation (MP2) level on the supercomputer Fugaku. One hundred structure samples from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used for both the closed and open forms of this protein (PDB IDs 6XLU and 6XM0 respectively). The number of total fragments is about 20,000, and the job time per structure was about 2 h on 8 racks of Fugaku.},

  abstract     = {This study introduces a computational protocol for modeling the emission spectra of exciplexes using excited-state ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. The protocol is applied to a model exciplex formed by oligo-p-phenylenes (OPPs) and triethylamine (TEA), which is of interest in the context of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 $$ {\mathrm{CO}}_2 $$ . AIMD facilitates efficient sampling of the conformational space of OPP3 and OPP4 exciplexes with TEA, offering a dynamic alternative to previously employed static methods. The AIMD-based protocol successfully reproduces experimental emission spectra for OPP-TEA exciplexes, agreeing with previous computational and experimental findings. The results show that AIMD simulations provide an efficient means of sampling the conformational space of these exciplexes, requiring less user input and, in some instances, fewer computational resources than multiple excited-state optimizations initiated from user-specified initial structures. The study also evaluates the yield of intersystem crossing (ISC) using AIMD and Landau-Zener probability. The results suggest that ISC is a minor decay channel for OPP3 and OPP4. This work provides new insights into the structural flexibility and emission characteristics of OPP-TEA photoredox catalyst systems, potentially contributing to improved design strategies for organic chromophores in CO 2 $$ {\mathrm{CO}}_2 $$ reduction applications.},

  abstract     = {In earlier publications, it was shown that the electron positions maximizing the probability density Ψ 2 $$ {\left|\Psi \right|}^2 $$ resemble the Lewis structures for most small molecules. While this holds for the triple bond in acetylene, this is not the case for the triple bond in dinitrogen. Because of recent advances in studying the topology of wave functions, this peculiar case is revisited. In this work, the dinitrogen wave function is analyzed and compared to that of acetylene. Significant differences of the electron positions maximizing Ψ 2 $$ {\left|\Psi \right|}^2 $$ are uncovered and explained by the presence of hydrogen atoms in acetylene and by electron arrangements resulting from calculations of the nitrogen and carbon atoms. Moreover, insights into the electron delocalization of both molecules are gained by investigating electron exchange paths. Considering the different chemical behaviors of dinitrogen and acetylene, these differences should be expected.},

The high spin t 2 g 3 $$ {}_{2g}^3 $$ ground state excludes the Jahn Teller deformation and the orbital ordering.

In KVF 3 $$ {}_3 $$ , the p states of fluorine are separated by 6.4 eV from the d states of vanadium, whose band is quite narrow (1 eV). In the oxide, on the contrary, the oxygen p states overlap to a large amount with the d states of chromium, whose band is more than 6 eV large. The FM and AFM energy differences, the spin density maps and profiles, and the Mulliken analysis data are also provided for documenting the differences between the oxide and the fluoride.},
