  abstract     = {The absence of the enhancement of fluorescence in carbon dots (CDs) through doping with transition metal atoms (TMAs) hinders the advancement of multi-modal bio-imaging CDs with high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Herein, Mn-atomically-doped R-CDs (R-Mn-CDs) with a high PLQY of 41.3% in water is presented, enabling efficient in vivo dual-mode fluorescence/magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. The comprehensive characterizations reveal that the incorporation of Mn atoms leads to a Mn-N 2 O 2 coordinating structure, resulting in five significant effects: an increase in sp 2 conjugation domains, a reduction in band gap, a decreased oxidation level, an increase in photo-excited electron numbers, and the suppression of non-radiative electron relaxation pathways. Collectively, these factors contribute to the remarkable PLQY of R-Mn-CDs. Additionally, the doping of Mn atoms also endows R-Mn-CDs with superior MR imaging capabilities due to, which highlights their promising prospect as a dual-modal bio-imaging platform for fluorescence/MR imaging. Furthermore, the findings indicate that the introduction of various TMAs, such as Mn, Zn, Ni, and Cu, can universally improve the PLQY of water-soluble CDs through the construction of TMAs─O bonds. This research provides valuable theoretical insights into the mechanisms underlying the fluorescence enhancement induced by TMAs doping and offers guidance for the future design of high PLQY CDs.},

  abstract     = {Mitochondrial dysfunction is a key factor in exacerbating pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy and is linked to increased morbidity and mortality. ECSIT, a crucial adaptor for inflammation and mitochondrial function, has been reported to express multiple transcripts in various species and tissues, leading to distinct protein isoforms with diverse subcellular localizations and functions. However, whether an unknown ECSIT isoform exists in cardiac cells and its potential role in regulating mitochondrial function and pathological cardiac hypertrophy has remained unclear. This study identified a 42-kDa ECSIT isoform encoded by the transcript variant Ecsit-X4, which is highly expressed in the mitochondria of adult cardiomyocytes but down-regulated in hypertrophic human heart samples and TAC-treated mouse hearts. AAV9-mediated Ecsit-X4 gene therapy, administered either before or after TAC surgery, significantly attenuated cardiac hypertrophy. Cardiomyocyte-specific Ecsit deficiency worsened TAC-induced cardiac hypertrophy, while Ecsit-X4 compensation independently rescued hypertrophic phenotypes in Ecsit cKO mice. Mechanistically, ECSIT-X4 localized to the mitochondria and interacted with STAT3, leading to increased STAT3 levels and enhanced serine 727 phosphorylation in cardiomyocyte mitochondria, thereby promoting strong mitochondrial bioenergetics. This study identified a novel transcript variant of ECSIT localized in the mitochondria of adult cardiomyocytes and highlights its potential as a therapeutic target for heart failure.},

  abstract     = {Regulation of the immune response is key to promoting bone regeneration by electroactive biomaterials. However, how electrical signals at the micro- and nanoscale regulate the immune response and subsequent angiogenesis during bone regeneration remains to be elucidated. Here, the distinctly different surface potential distributions on charged poly(vinylidene fluoridetrifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)) matrix surfaces are established by altering the dimensions of ferroelectric nanofillers from 0D BaTiO 3 nanoparticles (homogeneous surface potential distribution, HOPD) to 1D BaTiO 3 nanofibers (heterogeneous surface potential distribution, HEPD). Compared to HOPD, HEPD is significantly better at inducing the M2 polarization of macrophages and promoting neovascularization, which results in accelerated bone regeneration in vivo. The transcriptomic analysis reveals that macrophages modulated by HEPD display high expression levels of pro-angiogenic genes, which is corroborated by tube-formation assays, RT-qPCR, and western blot analyses in vitro. Mechanistic explorations elucidate activation of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, which in turn induces the polarization of macrophages toward a pro-angiogenic phenotype. This study elucidates the cascade of biological processes by which heterogeneous electrical signals at the micro- and nanoscale modulate macrophage functions to promote vascularization and bone regeneration. Hence, this study provides new insights into how the micro- and nanoscale distribution characteristics of electrical signals facilitate bone regeneration.},

The cryogels are prepared in an aqueous solution by crosslinking with glutaraldehyde at subzero temperatures. The final macroporous composites bearing ammonium chloride groups are obtained after freeze-drying. The cryogels CG1[Cl]–CG3[Cl] adsorb chlorine with capacities of 0.22–0.26 g Cl 2 /g cryogel as an average over three adsorption-desorption cycles. The adsorption process is based on the reversible and selective halogen bonding of chlorides (Cl − ) with chlorine (Cl 2 ) forming the corresponding trichloride ([Cl 3 ] − ) species, indicated by Raman spectroscopy. The reversibility of chlorine adsorption is shown by applying heat and vacuum to the loaded cryogel CG1[Cl 3 ] releasing 63% of the adsorbed chlorine within 3 h and 72% within 16 h. The unique ability to selectively adsorb chlorine in the presence of other gases is successfully employed for the selective adsorption of chlorine from a gas mixture, potentially enabling the recycling of chlorine from tail gas streams.},

However, the emission wavelengths of the current aqueous organic room-temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials are limited to green and red bands, while the blue part is rarely reported, thus limiting the development of a full-color RTP system. Theoretically, carboxylated benzene is expected to be blue phosphorescence-emissive, but only green phosphorescence is observed in solid, due to the strong intermolecular π–π stacking that decreases the energy gap. Herein, the use of water-dispersible layered double hydroxide (ZnAl-LDH) is proposed for isolating Ph-(COOH) n and the distance between the adjacent chromophores is confirmed to be larger (≈7.0 Å) than the threshold of π–π interaction. Deep-blue phosphorescence with a lifetime over 0.1 s, and a maximum luminescence quantum yield of 42%, is harvested in the aqueous phase. The long-lived deep-blue phosphorescence is successfully explored for high-temperature display and luminescent dyes.},

  abstract     = {Non-close-packed crystalline arrays of colloidal particles in an elastic matrix exhibit mechanochromism. However, small interparticle distances often limit the range of reversible color shifts and reduce reflectivity during a blueshift. A straightforward, reproducible strategy using matrix swelling to increase interparticle distance and improve mechanochromic performance is presented. Photonic composites are initially prepared with silica particle arrays embedded in an elastomer matrix at volume fractions of 0.35–0.5. To increase interparticle distance, the composites are immersed in an elastomer-forming monomer, causing the matrix to swell, followed by photopolymerization, thereby producing liquid-free composites. The degree of swelling is controllable up to 3.16, depending on monomer choice, matrix volume fraction, and crosslinking density. The process can be repeated to further increase swelling up to 10.36. This method can reduce the volume fraction of silica particles from 40% to 3.8%, while interparticle distance increases from 53 to 257 nm. The swollen photonic composites exhibit a full visible spectrum under compression, while minimizing reflectivity loss. This allows red-colored photonic composites to be transformed into vivid multicolor patterns when compressed with stamps featuring spatial height variations.},

  abstract     = {Unipolar barrier architecture is designed to enhance the photodetector&#39;s sensitivity by inducing highly asymmetrical barriers, a higher barrier for blocking majority carriers to depressing dark current, and a low minority carrier barrier without impeding the photocurrent flow through the channel. Depressed dark current without block photocurrent is highly desired for uncooled Long-wave infrared (LWIR) photodetection, which can enhance the sensitivity of the photodetector. Here, an excellent unipolar barrier photodetector based on multi-layer (ML) graphene (G) is developed, WSe 2 , and PtSe 2 (G-WSe 2 -PtSe 2 ) van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure, in which extremely low dark current of 1.61×10 −13 A, a record high light on/off ≈10 9 are demonstrated at 0 V. Notably, the device exhibits ultrafast response speed with rise time τ r = 699 ns and decay time τ d = 452 ns and high-power conversion efficiency ( η ) of 4.87%. The heterostructure demonstrates a broadband photoresponse from 365 nm to LWIR 10.6 µm at room temperature. Notably, the G-WSe 2 -PtSe 2 nBn device demonstrates high photoresponsivity ( R ) of 1.8 AW −1 with 10.6 µm laser at 1 V bias in ambient air. This unipolar barrier device architecture offers an alternative way for highly sensitive free space communication.},

Herein, this study presents an HCC-targeted nanoplatform that integrates bimetallic FeMoO 4 nanoparticles with CO-releasing molecules, and further camouflaged with SP94 peptide-modified macrophage membrane for enhanced ferroptosis-driven multi-modal therapy of HCC. Leveraging the multi-enzyme activities of the multivalent metallic elements, the nanoplatform not only decomposes H 2 O 2 to generate oxygen and alleviate tumor hypoxia but also depletes glutathione to inactivate glutathione peroxides 4, which amplify sonodynamic therapy and ferroptotic tumor death under ultrasound (US) irradiation. Meanwhile, the nanoplatform catalyzes the Fenton reaction to produce hydroxyl radicals for chemodynamic therapy. Elevated intracellular reactive oxygen species trigger the cascade release of CO, leading to lethal lipid peroxidation and further enhancing ferroptosis-mediated tumor therapy. This nanoplatform demonstrates robust anti-tumor efficacy under US irradiation with favorable biosafety in both subcutaneous and orthotopic HCC models, representing a promising therapeutic approach for HCC. Additionally, the findings offer new insights into tumor microenvironment modulation to optimize US-triggered multi-modal cancer therapy.},

  abstract     = {Potassium metal batteries are emerging as a promising high-energy density storage solution, valued for their cost-effectiveness and low electrochemical potential. However, understanding the role of potassiphilic sites in nucleation and growth remains challenging. This study introduces a single-atom iron, coordinated by nitrogen atoms in a 3D hierarchical porous carbon fiber (Fe─N-PCF), which enhances ion and electron transport, improves nucleation and diffusion kinetics, and reduces energy barriers for potassium deposition. Molten potassium infusion experiments confirm the Fe─N-PCF&#39;s strong potassiphilic properties, accelerating adsorption kinetics and improving potassium deposition performance. According to the Scharifker-Hills model, traditional carbon fiber substrates without potassiphilic sites cause 3D instantaneous nucleation, leading to dendritic growth. In contrast, the integration of single-atom and hierarchical porosity promotes uniform 3D progressive nucleation, leading to dense metal deposition, as confirmed by dimensionless i 2 /i max 2 versus t/t max plots and real-time in situ optical microscopy. Consequently, in situ X-ray diffraction demonstrated stable potassium cycling for over 1900 h, while the Fe─N-PCF@K||PTCDA full cell retained 69.7% of its capacity after 2000 cycles (72 mAh g −1 ), with a low voltage hysteresis of 0.876 V, confirming its strong potential for high energy density and extended cycle life, paving the way for future advancements in energy storage technology.},

  abstract     = {Chondrocyte senescence is an important pathogenic factor causing osteoarthritis (OA) progression through persistently producing pro-inflammatory factors. Mesenchymal stem cells-derived small extracellular vesicles (MSC-sEVs) have shown anti-inflammatory effects in OA models, while persistent existence of senescent chondrocytes still promotes cartilage destruction. Therefore, improving the targeted elimination ability on senescent chondrocytes is required to facilitate the translation of MSC-sEVs in OA treatment. In this study, versatile engineered MSC-sEVs are developed to targetedly clear senescent chondrocytes and maintain cartilage metabolic homeostasis. Specifically, MSC-sEVs are loaded with siRNA mouse double minute 2 homologue (siMDM2) and modified with cartilage-targeting peptide WYRGRL-PEG 2K -DSPE (WPD), named WPD-sEVs siMDM2 . The results demonstrate versatile modification improves the cellular uptake of MSC-sEVs in chondrocytes, and thus improves the antiaging effects. Importantly, multifunctional modification enhances cartilage penetration ability and extends joint retention time of MSC-sEVs. In both post-traumatic OA mice and naturally aged mice, WPD-sEVs siMDM2 more effectively eliminates senescent chondrocytes and maintained matrix metabolic homeostasis. By using the P53 phosphorylation inhibitor, the essential role MDM2-P53 pathway in the antiaging function of WPD-sEVs siMDM2 on chondrocytes is verified. In ex vivo cultured human OA cartilage explants, it is confirmed that WPD-sEVs siMDM2 alleviates senescent phenotype. Altogether, the findings suggest that WPD-sEVs siMDM2 have promising translational potential for OA treatment.},

Identifying key drivers and therapeutic targets holds significant clinical value. In this study, through comprehensive analysis of multiple PC databases, this work identifies TRIM21 as a promising driver mediator. This work further performs loss- and gain-of-function assays for TRIM21, revealing that TRIM21 knockout inhibits tumor proliferation and gemcitabine resistance both in vitro and vivo. Lipidomics reveal that silencing TRIM21 reduce the arachidonic acid production, and inhibit ferroptosis. Mechanically, through proteomics, ubiquitomics, and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, the key metabolic enzyme of arachidonic acid -EPHX1 is identified as a downstream substrate of TRIM21. TRIM21 interacts with EPHX1 through its SPRY domain and promotes ubiquitin-mediated degradation of EPHX1 via K33- and K48-linked ubiquitination at the K105 site. Given the targeting potential, this work screens Bezafibrate to block the interaction between TRIM21 and EPHX1 and validates its sensitizing effect. In summary, TRIM21 promotes tumour growth and gemcitabine resistance in PC by inhibiting EPHX1-mediated arachidonic acid metabolism.

However, the stoichiometric supply of NADH for artificial synthetic processes is uneconomical. Here, inspired by the process of cofactor NADPH regeneration in photosystem I (PSI), catalyst-modified photocathodes are constructed on the surface of polythiophene-based semiconductors ( PTTH ) via self-assembly for photoelectrochemical catalytic NADH regeneration. With the assistance of viologen ( vi 2+ ) electron transfer mediators (similar function as Ferredoxin in PSI) linked to the [Rh(Cp * )(bpy)] catalyst, the Rh-vi 2+ @PTTH photocathode exhibits higher photocurrent density (−665 µA cm −2 ) with a high apparent turnover frequency (TOF, 168.4 h −1 ) under a relatively positive potential (0.0 V vs RHE). In addition, through holistic functional mimics of the photosystem, a tandem photoelectrochemical cell is constructed by assembling a CoPi@BiVO 4 photoanode (artificial photosystem II, PSII) with the Rh-vi 2+ @PTTH photocathode. This system achieves a production rate of 42.5 µ m h −1 cm −2 and a TOF of 179.3 h −1 without an externally applied bias for NADH regeneration. The photo-generated NADH is directly employed to assist glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) in the catalytic conversion of α-ketoglutarate to L-glutamate. This study presents a novel strategic approach for constructing bias-free photoelectrochemical NADH regeneration systems.},

  abstract     = {Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S)-mediated protein S-sulfhydration has been shown to play critical roles in several diseases. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the predominant population of immune cells present within solid tumor tissues, and they function to restrict antitumor immunity. However, no previous study has investigated the role of protein S-sulfhydration in TAM reprogramming in breast cancer (BC). Therefore, the aim is to investigate whether protein S-sulfhydration can regulate TAM reprogramming and its underlying mechanism in BC. The results showed that in BC, the CTH-H 2 S axis is positively correlated with the presence of an anti-tumor phenotype in TAMs. NaHS, as an H 2 S donor, repolarized TAMs into M1 macrophages to block the tumor-promoting activities of TAMs both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, H 2 S-mediated S-sulfhydration of the protein chaperone glucose-regulated-protein 78 (GRP78) induced endoplasmic reticulum transmembrane protein kinase-1α (IRE-1α) dissociation from GRP78, which enhanced the phosphatase activity of IRE-1α itself in BC-TAMs, while the Cys420 site mutation of GRP78 interfered with these effects. Collectively, GRP78 S-sulfhydrylation mediated by H 2 S at the Cys420 residue decreased the tumor burden and inhibited lung metastasis of BC through reprograming TAMs via activating the IRE-1α pathway, indicating that targeting GRP78 S-sulfhydration represents a promising intervention for TAM-M1 repolarization in BC.},

Under X-ray irradiation, SNAP/MOL efficiently generates superoxide anion (O 2 −. ) and releases nitric oxide (NO) in a spatio-temporally synchronized fashion. The released NO rapidly reacts with O 2 −. to form long-lived and highly cytotoxic peroxynitrite which diffuses freely to the cell nucleus and efficiently causes DNA double-strand breaks. Meanwhile, the sustained release of NO from SNAP/MOL in the tumor microenvironment relieves tumor hypoxia to reduce radioresistance of tumor cells. Consequently, SNAP/MOL plus low-dose X-ray irradiation efficiently inhibits tumor growth and reduces metastasis in colorectal and triple-negative breast cancer models.},

Despite significant advancements in the past century, traditional 1 H MRI still faces sensitivity limitations that hinder its further development. To overcome this challenge, hyperpolarization methods have been introduced, disrupting the thermal equilibrium of nuclear spins and leading to an increased proportion of hyperpolarized spins, thereby enhancing sensitivity by hundreds to tens of thousands of times. Among these methods, hyperpolarized (HP) 129 Xe MRI, also known as ultrasensitive 129 Xe MRI, stands out for achieving the highest polarization enhancement and has recently received clinical approval. It effectively tackles the challenge of weak MRI signals from low proton density in the lungs. HP 129 Xe MRI is valuable for assessing structural and functional changes in lung physiology during pulmonary disease progression, tracking cells, and detecting target molecules at pico-molar concentrations. This review summarizes recent developments in HP 129 Xe MRI, including its physical principles, manufacturing methods, in vivo characteristics, and diverse applications in biomedical, chemical, and material sciences. In addition, it carefully discusses potential technical improvements and future prospects for enhancing its utility in these fields, further establishing HP 129 Xe MRI&#39;s importance in advancing medical imaging and research.},

However, their in vivo applications are severely limited due to cation toxicity. To address this problem, human heavy chain ferritin (HFn), possessing natural biocompatibility is utilized, to develop a novel supramolecular assembly drug delivery system. Specifically, tetra[4-(amino)piperidin-1-yl]-C 60 (TAPC) is selected as the representative aminated fullerene, and a layer-by-layer assembly strategy is designed to controllably assemble TAPC with the negatively charged HFn into a hierarchical coassembly (H@T@H) via electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds. In this ordered multilayer structure, the surface displayed HFn endows the inner TAPC with biocompatibility, tumor-targeting and blood-brain barrier crossing ability. Additionally, the electrostatic assembly mode enables the acid-responsive disassembly of H@T@H to release TAPC in lysosomes. In the orthotopic glioma mouse model, the HFn-assembled TAPC (H@T@H) shows higher brain accumulation and a stronger inhibitory effect on glioma than polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated TAPC. Moreover, in an experimental metastasis mouse model, H@T@H have significant preventive and therapeutic effects on tumor metastasis. Encouragingly, the ferritin-based supramolecular assembly strategy has been proven to have broad applicability for various aminated fullerene derivatives, showing promising potential for tackling the in vivo delivery challenges of cationic drugs.},

  abstract     = {DNA helicases play a pivotal role in maintaining genome integrity by unwinding the DNA double helix and are often considered promising targets for drug development. However, assessing specific DNA helicase activity in living cells remains challenging. Herein, the first anchor-embedded duplex (ATED) probe, 17GC , is constructed to uniquely monitor the unwinding activity of Werner syndrome helicase (WRN), a clinical anticancer target. This probe integrates biophysical screening and molecular simulation approaches. The 17GC probe consists of two components: the first one is a bubble structure as an anchor for recruiting WRN in cells, and the second one is GC-rich double helices on both ends of the bubble, which allow high sensitivity in detecting WRN activity. In vitro evaluations demonstrate that 17GC is highly sensitive and specific to WRN (LOD = 33.5 p m ) compared to a wide range of other enzymes, including helicases and nucleases. Cellular evaluation reveals that the ATED probe exhibits remarkable performance in monitoring WRN helicase activity and assessing the inhibitory efficiency of clinical WRN inhibitors in various cell types. This study introduces a novel approach for designing specific and sensitive probes for DNA helicases in cells, which holds promise for biological characterization and drug development.},

The angiogenic stimulant deferoxamine (DFO) is recognized for enhancing bone healing when administered into the fracture gap. This systematic review with meta-analysis investigates the effect of local DFO application on bone healing in rat and mouse models. EMBASE, MEDLINE (PubMed), and Web of Science are systematically searched in January 2024. The study is prospectively registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024492533), and the SYRCLE tool is used to assess study quality and risk of bias. Outcome values contain the primary endpoint bone volume fraction (BV/TV) as well as the secondary endpoints bone volume, tissue volume, bone mineral density, trabecular separation, trabecular thickness, vessel formation and the mechanical properties, assessed by µCT, angiography and mechanical strength tests. Out of 21 included studies, 18 qualify for meta-analysis, involving 539 animals. DFO-treated groups exhibit significantly higher BV/TV values ( p &lt; 0.0001) compared to controls, with similarly significant improvements in secondary outcomes. These findings highlight the substantial benefit of DFO in promoting bone healing, especially after radiotherapy. Rapid clinical implementation is recommended to help patients at high risk of fracture healing complications.},

Despite the flourishing studies on artificial intelligence-accelerated microfluidics, most research efforts have focused on the upstream design phase of microfluidic systems. Generating user-desired microfluidic droplets still remains laborious, inefficient, and time-consuming. To address the long-standing challenges associated with the accurate and efficient identification, sorting, and analysis of the morphology and generation rate of single and double emulsion droplets, a novel machine vision approach utilizing the deformable detection transformer (DETR) algorithm is proposed. This method enables rapid and precise detection (detection relative error &lt; 4% and precision &gt; 94%) across various scales and scenarios, including real-world and simulated environments. Microfluidic droplets identification and analysis (MDIA), a web-based tool powered by Deformable DETR, which supports transfer learning to enhance accuracy in specific user scenarios is developed. MDIA characterizes droplets by diameter, number, frequency, and other parameters. As more training data are added by other users, MDIA&#39;s capability and universality expand, contributing to a comprehensive database for droplet microfluidics. The work highlights the potential of artificial intelligence in advancing microfluidic droplet regulation, fabrication, label-free sorting, and analysis, accelerating biochemical sciences and materials synthesis engineering.},

An immunomodulatory role of heat shock proteins (HSPs) is implicated in autoimmune diseases. However, the molecular basis underlying the role of Hspa13 in regulating Bregs function and lupus pathogenesis remains unclear. In this study, Bregs display higher Hspa13 expression than IL-10 − B cells. Induction of IL-10 production is weakened in B cells with Hspa13 knockdown or knockout. Hspa13 binds to the IL-10 promoter via the TATA or CAAT box and activates IL-10 transcription in the nucleus. Furthermore, Hspa13 positive cells are enriched in marginal zone (MZ) B cells to regulate IL-10 production. Stimulated B220 + B or MZ B cells from CD19 cre Hspa13 fl/fl mice for Breg induction show an impaired capacity to promote CD4 + Foxp3 + regulatory T cells (Treg) differentiation. In lupus MRL/lpr mice, a decline in Treg differentiation is accompanied by decreased Hspa13 expression in both Bregs and MZ B cells. Moreover, adoptive transfusion of Bregs and MZ B cells from CD19 cre Hspa13 fl/fl mice fails to increase the frequency of Tregs, attenuate renal pathology, or decrease anti-dsDNA antibody levels. These results explain the unique role of Hspa13 in determining MZ regulatory function and affecting lupus pathogenesis.},

  abstract     = {Approximately 50% of the patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) are primarily nonresponsive to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy or lose their responsiveness over time. The gut microbiota plays an important role in the resistance of UC to anti-TNF therapy; however, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Here, it is found that the transplantation of gut fecal microbiota from patients with UC alters the diversity of the gut microbiota in dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis mice and may affect the therapeutic responsiveness of mice to infliximab. Furthermore, the abundances of Romboutsia and Fusobacterium increase in the tissues of patients with UC who do not respond to anti-TNF therapy. Differentially abundant metabolites are mainly enriched in nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism in NCM460 cells after Fusobacterium nucleatum infection. Mechanistically, F. nucleatum promotes the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ) salvage pathway by upregulating NAMPT expression, which subsequently leads to the activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and promotes the secretion of inflammatory factors, ultimately inhibiting the therapeutic response to anti-TNF drugs. These findings demonstrate that the gut microbiota can influence the response to anti-TNF therapy in patients with UC and highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting F. nucleatum and its associated pathways for preventing and treating drug resistance in UC.},

  abstract     = {Hole-transport layers (HTL) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with an n-i-p structure are commonly doped by bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (TFSI) salts to enhance hole conduction. While lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) dopant is a widely used and effective dopant, it has significant limitations, including the need for additional solvents and additives, environmental sensitivity, unintended oxidation, and dopant migration, which can lead to lower stability of PSCs. A novel ionic liquid, 1-(2-methoxyethyl)-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide (MMPyTFSI), is explored as an alternative dopant for 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD). MMPy ions act as a surface passivator, reducing defects on the perovskite surface, while TFSI ions facilitate p-type doping. MMPyTFSI functions as an efficient dopant, maintaining excellent performance even when tetrahydrofuran (THF) is utilized as a solvent in place of chlorobenzene (CB), while significantly reducing the environmental impact of the process. The optimized PSC achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.10% and demonstrates enhanced long-term stability in all aging tests for over 1000 h in a humid atmosphere, at high temperature, and under simulated sunlight illumination. These results demonstrate that MMPyTFSI is an effective and environmentally friendly dopant for producing stable and efficient PSCs.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mechanism is pivotal for improving the overall efficiency of water electrolysis. Despite methylammonium lead halide perovskites (MAPbX 3 ) have shown promising OER performance due to their soft-lattice nature that allows lattice-oxygen oxidation of active α-PbO 2 layer surface, the role of A-site MA or X-site elements in the electrochemical reconstruction and OER mechanisms has yet to be explored. Here, it is demonstrated that the OER mechanism of perovskite@zeolite composites is intrinsically dominated by the A-site group of lead-halide perovskites, while the type of X-site halogen is crucial for the reconstruction kinetics of the composites. Using CsPbBr x I 3- x @AlPO-5 ( x = 0, 1, 2, 3) as a model OER catalyst, it is found that the CsPbBr 3 @AlPO-5 behaves oxygen-intercalation pseudocapacitance during surface restructuring due to absence of halogen-ion migration and phase separation in the CsPbBr 3 , achieving a larger diffusion rate of OH − within the core-shell structure. Moreover, distinct from the single-metal-site mechanism of MAPbBr 3 @AlPO-5, experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that the soft lattice nature of CsPbBr 3 triggers the oxygen-vacancy-site mechanism via the CsPbBr 3 /α-PbO 2 interface, resulting in excellent OER performance. Owing to the variety and easy tailoring of lead-halide perovskite compositions, these findings pave a way for the development of novel perovskite@zeolite type catalysts for efficient oxygen electrocatalysis.},

However, current preparation approaches involve the combination of multiple intrinsically-different methodologies to achieve graphene-synthesis and architecture-engineering, complicating the entire procedure. Here, a novel approach to prepare GAs with engineered architectures based on the laser-upcycling of protein biowaste, hemoglobin, is introduced. Laser scanning achieves graphene-synthesis concurrently with architecture-engineering through the localized graphitization of hemoglobin along the laser-scan path, enabling the direct preparation of engineered GAs. The laser-upcycled GAs are uniquely decorated with fibrous graphitic structures, which significantly improves the surface area. Such structural formation is attributable to the inherent iron content of hemoglobin which leads to the formation of iron-based nanoparticles that catalyze the formation of nano-structured graphene. By leveraging the high electrical conductivity and unique structural morphology, the laser-upcycled GAs are applied as electrodes of symmetrical 3D supercapacitors. The fabricated supercapacitors exhibited a high specific capacitance (≈54.9 F g −1 ) and excellent cycle stability (≈94% retention), attributable to the laser-engineered architecture facilitating ion diffusion even for thick electrodes. Not only does this study provide a novel approach to prepare GAs with engineered architectures but showcases the potential of laser-upcycling in preparing advanced functional materials for future devices.},

Subsequently, GAO self-assembled micelles loading PAL-4 (GAO/PAL-4-SM) are fabricated without additional auxiliary materials. The permeation and subcutaneous retention of PAL-4 are significantly promoted with 10wt.% GAO-SM. Moreover, GAO ILs facilitated PAL-4 permeation by enhancing its miscibility and interaction with stratum corneum (SC), offering a pulling effect and micellar structures for PAL-4, as elucidated by computational simulations. In cellular and animal photoaging experiments, GAO/PAL-4-SM possessed remarkable capabilities in boosting collagen and hyaluronic acid regeneration, mitigating inflammation and apoptosis, accelerating macrophage M2 polarization, thereby lessening skin wrinkles and leveraging elasticity. Collectively, the research innovatively designed an ILs self-assembled nano-micellar transdermal delivery system to enhance the permeability and anti-photoaging effect of signal peptides.},

  abstract     = {Spinal cord injury (SCI) impairs the central nervous system and induces the myelin-sheath-deterioration because of reactive oxygen species (ROS), further hindering the recovery of function. Herein, the simultaneously emergency treatment and dynamic luminescence severity assessment (SETLSA) strategy is designed for SCI based on cerium (Ce)-doped upconversion antioxidant nanoenzymes (Ce@UCNP-BCH). Ce@UCNP-BCH can not only efficiently eliminate the SCI localized ROS, but dynamically monitor the oxidative state in the SCI repair process using a ratiometric luminescence signal. Moreover, the classic basso mouse scale score and immunofluorescence analysis together exhibit that Ce@UCNP-BCH effectively facilitates the regeneration of spinal cord including myelin sheath, and promotes the functional recovery of SCI mice. Particularly, the study combines snATAC-eq and snRNA-seq to reveal the heterogeneity of spinal cord tissue following Ce@UCNP-BCH treatment. The findings reveal a significant increase in myelinating oligodendrocytes, as well as higher expression of myelination-related genes, and the study also reveals the gene regulatory dynamics of remyelination after treatment. Besides, the ETLSA strategy synergistically boosts ROS consumption through the superoxide dismutase (SOD)-related pathways after SOD-siRNA treatment. In conclusion, this SETLSA strategy with simultaneously blocking and dynamic monitoring oxidative stress has enriched the toolkit for promoting SCI repair.},

Development of clothing textiles with prolonged passive temperature-adaptive thermoregulation without external energy consumption is much needed for protection from thermal stress and energy saving, but very challenging. Here, a temperature-adaptive thermoregulation filament (TATF) consisting of thermoresponsive vacuum cavities formed by the temperature-responsive volume change of the material confined in the cellular cores of the filament is proposed. Using a droplet-based microfluidic system, the cellular core/sheath filament using octadecane (OD) as a temperature-responsive volume-changing material to form droplet cellular cores within the thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) sheath is fabricated. It is found that the fabric made of TATF has a remarkable temperature adaptive thermal conductivity, which increases by 83% as the mean fabric temperature increases from 20 °C to 35 °C, due to the volume change of vacuum cavities in the cellular cores of the filament in response to temperature. TATF fabrics have no problem associated with undesirable appearance changes or leakage of encapsulated molten materials as some existing thermoregulatory textiles do, and can therefore have wide applications in functional clothing for prolonged passive personal thermal management.},

However, conventional coordination-based detection is mired in the fluorescence quenching induced by paramagnetic Cu(II)/Fe(III). Moreover, the strong chelating property of the probe will consume dissociative metal ions and inevitably interfere with the physiological microenvironment. Here, a new strategy is developed by employing this aberrant Cu(II)/Fe(III) to catalyze bond cleavage for fluorescent imaging of them. A short series of near-infrared fluorescent molecules ( NIRB1−NIRB6 ) is devised as substrates, wherein the specific C═C bonds can be effectively cleaved to activate red fluorophore by Cu(II)/Fe(III) catalyzing. Representatively, NIRB1 is applied for fluorescent imaging of Cu(II)/Fe(III) in living cells, zebrafish, and Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD)-afflicted mouse brains which is of significance to monitor metal safety. The successful cleavage of C═C bonds catalyzed by Cu(II)/Fe(III) enriches the application of abiotic bond cleavage reactions in metal detection, and may also inspire the development of fluorescent tools for the future diagnosis and therapy of diseases.},

The InP NW lasers can achieve repetitive switching between photoluminescence (PL) and lasing with an extinction ratio of 22-fold by applying a gate voltage of 3 V using ionic liquid (IL) as a dielectric layer. IL brings forth ultra-high capacitance due to the nanometer-wide electric double layer (EDL) between interfaces, mapping out gating efficiency of ≈100-fold compared to the conventional bottom gate configurations.

In this regard, triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have enabled a safe means for harvesting mechanical energy for conversion into electrical energy. However, most existing polymers used for TENGs are sourced from petroleum-based raw materials and are highly flammable, which can further accelerate the spread of fire and harm the ecological environment. In addition, the existing intrinsic flame-retardant TENGs are not elastic at room temperature, which may potentially damage the flexible equipment and harm firefighters. This study presents an intrinsic flame-retardant bio-based elastic phytic acid polyurethane (PUPA) synthesized using a simple and efficient one-pot polycondensation. The cross-linked structure and polar phosphorus-containing segments of PUPA are fabricated into PUPA-TENG, demonstrating a superior elasticity (elongation up to 660%), flame retardancy (UL94 V-0), impact resistance (34.71 MJ m −3 ), and dielectric constant ( D k = 9.57). Consequently, this study provides a simple strategy for tailoring TENGs toward environmentally friendly and secure power generators and electronics, which can effectively reduce fire hazards and potentially be applied to other fire-risk fields such as personal protection, firefighting, and new energy.},

The hyaluronic acid (HA) gel “shell” of HA-TR nanosystem can release drugs in response to the acidic tumor microenvironment and hyaluronidase, and the tumor targeting (TR) cationic micellar “core” can release drugs in response to glutathione. This multiresponsive drug release is beneficial for the exogenous inhibition of lipid uptake by CD36i and the endogenous inhibition of lipid synthesis by siSCD1. The established HA-TR nanosystem has good tumor targeting ability and tumor penetration ability, and that HA@CD36i-TR@siSCD1 has good synergistic effects, which can significantly restrain the growth, invasion, and metastasis of PCa. Moreover, under high-fat conditions, the tumors are more sensitive to HA@CD36i-TR@siSCD1 treatment, almost no accumulation of lipid droplets is observed in HA@CD36i-TR@siSCD1-treated tumors, with enhanced antitumor immunity.

It crystallizes in the monoclinic chiral space group C 2, and the layered structure is composed by the new ScP 2 S 11 functional motifs built by ScS 6 octahedra and P 2 S 7 dimers, and the structure-performance analysis reveals that the hyperpolarizability of ScP 2 S 11 is much greater than the assembled units (ScS 6 and PS 4 ), which makes the first NLO Sc chalcogenide CSPS exhibits strong NLO response (0.8 × AGS) and high laser-induced damage threshold (LIDT) (4.3 × AGS), and a wide bandgap of 3.10 eV. With the coordination number&#39;s reduction of rare-earth (RE) ion and the rearrangement of P 2 S 7 dimers, the centrosymmetric structure of CsREP 2 S 7 family can be broken via substitution with the smallest RE element Sc to form the noncentrosymmetric structure.

  abstract     = {Mitochondrial dysfunction is a crucial event in acute kidney injury (AKI), leading to a metabolic shift toward glycolysis and increased lactate production. Lactylation, a posttranslational modification derived from lactate, plays a significant role in various cellular processes, yet its implications in AKI remain underexplored. Here, a marked increase in lactate levels and pan-Kla levels are observed in kidney tissue from AKI patients and mice, with pronounced lactylation activity in injured proximal tubular cells identified by single-cell RNA sequencing. The lactylation of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) is identified at lysine 52 (K52la), revealing that ALDH2 lactylation exacerbates tubular injury and mitochondrial dysfunction. Conversely, the ALDH2 K52R mutation alleviates these injuries in HK-2 cells and adeno-associated virus-infected kidney tissues in mice. Furthermore, ALDH2 lactylation can be modulated by upregulating SIRT3 in vivo and in vitro, which reduces ALDH2 lactylation, mitigating tubular injury and mitochondrial dysfunction. Mechanistically, immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry analysis demonstrates an interaction between ALDH2 and prohibitin 2 (PHB2), a crucial mitophagy receptor. ALDH2 lactylation promotes the ubiquitination-proteasomal degradation of PHB2 to inhibit mitophagy and worsen mitochondrial dysfunction. These findings highlight the critical role of endogenous lactate in AKI and propose ALDH2 lactylation as a potential therapeutic target.},

  abstract     = {Hardware system customized toward the demands of graph neural network learning would promote efficiency and strong temporal processing for graph-structured data. However, most amorphous/polycrystalline oxides-based memristors commonly have unstable conductance regulation due to random growth of conductive filaments. And graph neural networks based on robust and epitaxial film memristors can especially improve energy efficiency due to their high endurance and ultra-low power consumption. Here, robust and epitaxial Gd: HfO2-based film memristors are reported and construct a weighted echo state graph neural network (WESGNN). Benefiting from the optimized epitaxial films, the high switching speed (20 ns), low energy consumption (2.07 fJ), multi-value storage (4 bits), and high endurance (10 9 ) outperform most memristors. Notably, thanks to the appropriately dispersed conductance distribution (standard deviation = 7.68 nS), the WESGNN finely regulates the relative weights of input nodes and recursive matrix to realize state-of-the-art performance using the MUTAG and COLLAB datasets for graph classification tasks. Overall, robust and epitaxial film memristors offer nanoscale scalability, high reliability, and low energy consumption, making them energy-efficient hardware solutions for graph learning applications.},

  abstract     = {The sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI) still represents one of the leading causes of death in critically ill patients, underscoring the need for novel therapies. Excessive activation of immune cells and damage of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are the main factors that exacerbate lung injury. Here, the multifaceted immunomodulatory nanocomplexes targeting the proinflammatory neutrophilic activation and ROS damage are established. The S100A8/9 inhibitor, ABR2575, is loaded in the nanocomplexes, which effectively blocks the neutrophils-S100A8/A9- toll-like receptors (TLRS)-Inflammasome signaling in ALI. Synergically, the SiH nanosheets are encapsulated together with ABR2575 into the core of poly(lactic- co -glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanosponges, to achieve sustainable hydrogen release for the alleviation of ROS-induced lung tissue injury, and also promote the M2 polarization of macrophages. This novel combination strategy is proven to significantly suppress the infiltration of neutrophils and pro-inflammatory macrophages into the lungs, decrease the activation of neutrophils and pro-inflammatory monocytes in the blood, facilitate the anti-inflammatory polarization of macrophages and monocytes, and reduce the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in both the lung and blood circulation, all of which alleviate the lung injuries in preclinical murine ALI models. The current investigations offer a novel nanomedicine for the treatment of ALI with great potential in clinical invention.},

  abstract     = {Liquid fertilizers, particularly when integrated with precision irrigation systems, offer a more efficient and sustainable alternative to traditional solid nitrogen fertilizers. The industrial production of ammonium nitrate (NH 4 NO 3 ) is environmentally detrimental due to its reliance on fossil fuels. This study introduces an innovative air-to-NOx-to-NH 4 NO 3 pathway for synthesizing liquid nitrogen fertilizer. The process employs an underwater multi-bubble plasma reactor powered by nanosecond pulse to generate aqueous NOx, which is then partially reduced to NH 4 NO 3 through electrocatalysis. Results show that the highest NOx production rate, 786.5 mol h −1 , is achieved when the N 2 /O 2 ratio closely resemble that of air, and short pulse rise/fall times significantly increase NOx yield. Further plasma diagnostic and global plasma chemistry modeling indicate that short rise/fall times facilitate simultaneous dielectric barrier discharge and spark discharge, synergistically enhancing nitrogen fixation efficiency. The partially electro-reduced liquid NH 4 NO 3 fertilizer significantly improves plant growth, with stem length and leaf length increasing by 91.26% and 54.72%, respectively. Cost estimation reveals that 44.22% of the production cost is attributed to electricity consumption, underscoring the potential for optimization with renewable energy integration. Overall, the study provides new insight for the sustainable production and in-place utilization of liquid nitrogen fertilizers which may advance sustainable agriculture.},

  abstract     = {The development of the mammalian neocortex is precisely regulated by temporal gene expression, yet the temporal regulatory mechanisms of cortical neurogenesis, particularly how radial glial cells (RGCs) sequentially generate deep to superficial neurons, remain unclear. Here, the hnRNP family member Syncrip (hnRNP Q) is identified as a key modulator of superficial neuronal differentiation in neocortical neurogenesis. Syncrip knockout in RGCs disrupts differentiation and abnormal neuronal localization, ultimately resulting in superficial cortical layer defects as well as learning and memory impairments in mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis demonstrated that the knockout of Syncrip disrupts the late-stage neurogenesis, stalling transcriptional progression in RGCs. Mechanistically, Syncrip maintains the transcription of temporal process-related transcription factors by recruiting stabilization complexes through phase separation, crucially regulating the Notch signaling pathway that determines the fate of RGCs. Furthermore, pathogenic human mutations in Syncrip weaken its phase-separation capability, failing to form stable complexes normally. Thus, Syncrip acts as a mediator of posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms, governing the fate progression of RGCs and the advancement of intrinsic temporal programs. This study establishes an intracellular mechanism for posttranscriptional regulation of progressive fate determination in cortical neurogenesis.},

  abstract     = {Intestinal fibrosis, a severe complication of Crohn&#39;s disease (CD), is linked to chronic inflammation, but the precise mechanism by which immune-driven intestinal inflammation leads to fibrosis development is not fully understood. This study investigates the role of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in intestinal fibrosis in CD patients and a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced mouse model. Elevated MDSCs are observed in inflamed intestinal tissues prior to fibrosis and their sustained presence in fibrotic tissues of both CD patients and murine models. Depletion of MDSCs significantly reduces fibrosis, highlighting their key role in the fibrotic process. Mechanistically, MDSC-derived mCCL6 activates fibroblasts via the CCR1-MAPK signaling, and interventions targeting this axis, including neutralizing antibodies, a CCR1 antagonist, or fibroblast-specific Ccr1 knockout mice reduce fibrosis. In CD patients with stenosis, human CCL15, analogous to mCCL6, is found to be elevated in MDSCs and activated fibroblasts. Additionally, CXCR2 and CCR2 ligands are identified as key mediators of MDSC recruitment in intestinal fibrosis. Blocking MDSC recruitment with CXCR2 and CCR2 antagonists alleviates intestinal fibrosis. These findings suggest that strategies targeting MDSC recruitment and mCCL6/hCCL15 signaling could offer therapeutic benefits for intestinal fibrosis.},

Here the control of the pore orientation is demonstrated with a dealloying analogy, reduction-induced decomposition, achieved in flow cells. Via forced convection, the self-organization is placed under the control of sufficiently rapid mass transport to suppress pore branching and align 100 nm-wide ligaments and pores along the direction of reaction propagation, boosting the permeability by an order of magnitude while retaining the large surface area. The pore orientation can be further manipulated with a flow field for an orientation pattern akin to the expected fluid pattern, enabling a nanoporous silver electrode to deliver a peak power of 0.3 W cm −2 in a redox-flow battery, outperforming commercial carbon electrodes.},

The contact condition between skin and the deformable FHTP has been considered in a new verified heat transfer model. Optimization of the parameters has resulted in excellent heat transfer performance.

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) initially demonstrated significant efficacy in treating PCa; however, most cases of PCa eventually progress to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which becomes increasingly challenging to manage. Notably, the loss or disruption of primary cilia in PCa cells may play a critical role in the progression of the disease, and there are no reports on the role of circular RNAs in ciliogenesis. Thus, this warrants further investigation.In this study, key circular RNAs linked to prostate cancer progression, and enzalutamide resistance is identified. Specifically, it is found that hsa_circ_0005185 interacts with OTUB1 and RAB8A, serving as a molecular scaffold. Hsa_circ_0005185 mediates the binding of the deubiquitinase OTUB1 to RAB8A, resulting in the deubiquitination of RAB8A. Consequently, the stable expression of RAB8A promotes the regeneration of primary cilia and enhances the production of GLI3R, an inhibitory factor in the Hedgehog signaling pathway, thereby suppressing AR activity and slowing the progression of CRPC.},

However, the integration of chirality within inorganic materials remains a critical challenge and developments of chirality-induced bionic bone implants are still in infancy. In this view, novel chiral hydroxyapatite (CHA) coated Ti alloys are successfully synthesized by a sophisticated chiral molecule-induced self-assembly method for the first time. The obtained samples are characterized by stereospecific L-/D-/Rac-chiral hierarchical morphology, nanotopography rough surfaces, improved hydrophilicity, and bioactivity. Following implantation into rat femoral condyle defects, the distinct stereospecific chiral hierarchical structures exhibit highly enantioselective bone-implants interactions, wherein the left-handed chirality of L-CHA strongly promotes osteoporotic osseointegration and vice versa for right-handed chirality of D-CHA. Consistently, in vitro assays further validate the superior enantiomer-dependent osteoporotic osseointegration ability of L-CHA, mainly by manipulating desired immunomodulation coupled with enhanced neurogenesis, angiogenesis, and osteogenesis. Moreover, as analyzed by transcriptomic RNA-seq, a new discovery of down-regulated IL-17 signaling pathway is considered predominately responsible for the desired immunomodulation ability of L-CHA. These results provide new insights into biological multifunctionality and mechanism underlying L-chirality&#39;s roles for bone healing, thus may inspiring developments of new generation of chiral biomaterials.},

The SpcRN++ variant exhibits a higher genome editing capacity and wider target range than the Sc++ variant in rice protoplasts and stable transgenic plants. Further evidence indicates that nSpcRN++-based A3A/Y130F and TadA8e exhibit enhanced cytosine and adenine editing efficiency in plants. Finally, herbicide-resistant rice germplasms are produced by targeting the OsACC gene using nSpcRN++-based adenine base editors.

Oral treatment of live B. intestinihominis (LBI) considerably ameliorates hyperglycemia and liver metabolic disorders in HFD/STZ-induced T2D models and db/db mice. LBI-derived acetate has similar protective effects against T2D.

One challenge of MSI heterogeneity analysis is performing an objective segmentation to differentiate the biological tissue into distinct regions with unique characteristics. However, current methods struggle due to the insufficient incorporation of biological context and high computational demand. To address these challenges, a novel deep learning-based approach is proposed, GraphMSI, which integrates metabolic profiles with spatial information to enhance MSI data analysis. Our comparative results demonstrate GraphMSI outperforms commonly used segmentation methods in both visual inspection and quantitative evaluation. Moreover, GraphMSI can incorporate partial or coarse biological contexts to improve segmentation results and enable more effective three-dimensional MSI segmentation with reduced computational requirements. These are facilitated by two optional enhanced modes: scribble-interactive and knowledge-transfer. Numerous results demonstrate the robustness of these two modes, ensuring that GraphMSI consistently retains its capability to identify biologically relevant sub-regions in complex practical applications.

  abstract     = {Precious metal-based single-atom catalysts (PM-SACs) hosted in N-doped carbon supports have shown new opportunities to revolutionize cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, stabilizing the high density of PM-N x sites remains a challenge, primarily due to the inherently high free energy of isolated metal atoms, predisposing them to facile atomic agglomeration. Herein, a molten salt-assisted synthesis strategy is proposed to prepare porous PM 1 /N-C Pores (PM = Ru, Pt, and Pd) electrocatalysts with densely accessible PM-N x sites. A hierarchically porous N-doped carbon substrate (N-C Pores ), synthesized via the NaCl-assisted pyrolysis of zeolitic imidazolate framework-8, effectively improves the utilization of PM-N x sites by increased reactants accessible surface area and reduced mass transfer resistance. In accordance with theoretical calculations, the as-prepared Ru 1 /N-C Pores , featuring superior intrinsic active Ru-N 4 sites, exhibit outstanding ORR turnover frequency of 6.19 e − site −1 s −1 , and outperforms the commercial Pt/C with a 5.3-fold of mass activity (5.83 ± 0.61 A mg −1 ) at 0.8 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. The commendable activity and stability of Ru 1 /N-C Pores in a real fuel cell device further affirm its practical applicability.},

  abstract     = {Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) is a prevalent technique in materials characterization. While the analysis of PXRD often requires extensive human manual intervention, and most automated method only achieved at coarse-grained level. The more difficult and important task of fine-grained crystal structure prediction from PXRD remains unaddressed. This study introduces XtalNet, the first equivariant deep generative model for end-to-end crystal structure prediction from PXRD. Unlike previous crystal structure prediction methods that rely solely on composition, XtalNet leverages PXRD as an additional condition, eliminating ambiguity and enabling the generation of complex organic structures with up to 400 atoms in the unit cell. XtalNet comprises two modules: a Contrastive PXRD-Crystal Pretraining (CPCP) module that aligns PXRD space with crystal structure space, and a Conditional Crystal Structure Generation (CCSG) module that generates candidate crystal structures conditioned on PXRD patterns. Evaluation on two MOF datasets (hMOF-100 and hMOF-400) demonstrates XtalNet&#39;s effectiveness. XtalNet achieves a top-10 Match Rate of 90.2% and 79% for hMOF-100 and hMOF-400 in conditional crystal structure prediction task, respectively. XtalNet enables the direct prediction of crystal structures from experimental measurements, eliminating the need for manual intervention and external databases. This opens up new possibilities for automated crystal structure determination and the accelerated discovery of novel materials.},

OMTHE rigorously exploits the space-time propagation characteristics of multifrequency time-harmonic waves to address current limitations of biomechanical imaging and elastography. Key solutions are presented for stimulation, wave decoding, and stiffness reconstruction of shear waves at multiple harmonic frequencies, all tuned to provide consistent stiffness values across resolutions from microns to millimeters. OMTHE&#39;s versatility is demonstrated by simulations, phantoms, Bacillus subtilis biofilms, zebrafish embryos and adult zebrafish, reflecting the diversity of biological systems from a mechanics perspective. By zooming in on stiffness details from coarse to finer scales, OMTHE has the potential to advance mechanobiology and offers a way to perform biomechanics-based tissue histology that consistently matches in vivo time-harmonic elastography in patients.},

  abstract     = {The developmental competence and epigenetic progression of oocytes gradually become dysregulated with increasing maternal age. However, the mechanisms underlying age-related epigenetic regulation in oocytes remain poorly understood. Zygote arrest proteins 1 and 2 (ZAR1/2) are two maternal factors with partially redundant roles in maintaining oocyte quality, mainly known by regulating mRNA stability. In addition to this known function, it is found that ZAR1/2 is required for oocyte epigenetic maturation and zygotic reprogramming. Zar1/2 -deleted oocytes exhibited reduced levels of multiple histone modifications and of the expression of corresponding histone modifiers, along with over-condensed chromatin, leading to compromised minor zygotic genome activation and deficient embryo development following fertilization. Cytoplasmic ZAR1/2 participated in intranuclear epigenetic maturation by binding the transcripts encoding histone modifiers and regulating their stability and translational activity. Moreover, oocytes from aged mice exhibited similar histone-modification deficiencies as the Zar1/2 -deleted oocytes. ZAR1/2 mRNA and protein levels are downregulated in oocytes from mice and women with advanced ages, suggesting ZAR1/2 as regulators of epigenetic changes with reproductive aging. This study presents a new nucleo-cytoplasmic interaction mechanism that is involved in preventing oocyte epigenetic aging. Further, ZAR1/2 represents potential gene targets for diagnosis and clinical interventions in age-associated deficiencies in oocyte and embryo development.},

However, they may suffer delamination and/or debonding due to their low interfacial toughness. In addition, they usually exhibit a small measurement range resulting from their limited stiffness variation range. In this paper, soft silicone-based capacitive sensors are developed by using a customized multimaterial 3D printer. By curing silicone materials simultaneously, the continuous conductive and dielectric layers achieve a substantial interfacial toughness of 1036 J·m −2 . The sensor with tilted thin-plate dielectrics exhibits interfacial toughness of 645 J·m −2 or 339 J·m −2 in the transverse or longitudinal direction, respectively. Additionally, the sensors demonstrate a broad measurement range from 0.85 Pa to 5000 kPa. This extended range is facilitated by the significant stiffness variation of the separated tilted thin-plate dielectrics, ranging from 0.56 kPa to 19.76 MPa. Two applications of these fully printed soft sensors, including an intelligent sensorized insole and a robotic hand combining both soft actuators and soft sensors are showcased. It is believed that the strategy, employing 3D printing for soft microstructured sensors, is a general approach not only applicable for improving the performance of soft sensors, but also conducive to designing powerful soft functional devices.},

  abstract     = {KHSRP (KH-type splicing regulatory protein) is a multifunctional nucleic acid-binding protein that regulates various cellular processes, with critical roles in controlling gene expression. G-quadruplexes (G4s) are noncanonical nucleic acid structures involved in essential cellular activities, including gene expression, and are recognized as potential therapeutic targets in cancer. The biological functions of G4s are mediated by proteins making their formation highly dynamic within cells. Therefore, the recognition of G4s by specific proteins is crucial for modulating physiological and pathological pathways. Given the growing interest in DNA G4s, a deeper understanding of the proteins that interact with them and their molecular recognition is imperative. This study demonstrates that KHSRP binds to these DNA structures. Biophysical analyses provide insights into the thermodynamics, kinetics, and structural aspects of these interactions, showing that G4 structural variability significantly influences KHSRP binding, in which the KH3 protein domain plays a key role. Validation of these interactions in cancer cells further highlights their biological relevance. Notably, the G4 ligand pyridostatin affects KHSRP/G4 interactions both in vitro and in cells, suggesting that small molecules can modulate this molecular recognition. These findings underscore KHSRP&#39;s potential role in regulating cellular mechanisms through binding to G4-forming DNA, positioning it as a possible therapeutic target in cancer.},

  abstract     = {Mild hyperthermia therapy has garnered interest as an adjunctive treatment for bone repair. However, its optimal timing, duration, and underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, how mild hyperthermia supports bone repair during the early stages is assesed. These findings reveal that mild hyperthermia accelerates bone regeneration by dynamically regulating inducible nitric oxide synthase/arginase 1 (iNOS/Arg1) balance. This process involves macrophage polarization to the M1 phenotype through iNOS activation, followed by a rapid transition to the M2 phenotype through Arg1 activation after 3 days of sustained mild hyperthermia. RNA-Seq reveals that a single day of mild hyperthermia induced immune alterations aligned with the early inflammatory phase of bone repair, characterized by osteoclast activation, cell recruitment, and neovascularization, thereby preparing for the transition to the repair phase. Experiments involving subcutaneous abscesses, subcutaneous embedding, and critical cranial bone defects further confirm that early mild hyperthermia treatment dynamically regulates macrophage phenotypes. This regulation enhances early antibacterial activity, promotes angiogenesis, and facilitates the transition from inflammation to repair, ultimately accelerating bone-defect repair. This study is the first to elucidate the dual temporal effects of early mild hyperthermia on immune regulation, offering insights into the optimal timing and duration of photothermal therapy following bone repair surgery.},

In this study, personalized dorsal and ventral forebrain organoids (DFOs/VFOs) are generated derived from brain astrocytes of patients with FCD type II (FCD II). The pathological features of dysmorphic neurons, balloon cells, and astrogliosis are successfully replicated in patient-derived DFOs, but not in VFOs. It is noteworthy that cardiomyocyte-like cells correlated with dysmorphic neurons are generated through the high activation of BMP and WNT signaling in some of the FCD-organoids and patient cortical tissues. Moreover, functional assessments demonstrated the occurrence of epileptiform burst firing and propagative self-assembling neuronal hyperactivity in both FCD-DFOs and VFOs. Additionally, the heterotopic cardiomyocyte-organoids demonstrated the capacity for cardiomyocyte contraction and rhythmic firing. The presence of these cardiomyocytes contributes to the hyperactivity of neural networks in cardioids-DFOs assembly. In conclusion, the personalized region-specific forebrain organoids derived from FCD patient astrocytes effectively recapitulate heterogeneous pathological features, offering a valuable platform for the development of precise therapeutic strategies.},

Unfortunately, these excipients are themselves unstable, oxidizing rapidly into 100s of distinct compounds, some of which cause severe adverse events in patients. Here, the highly stable, well-defined, and modular nature of amphiphilic polyacrylamide-derived excipients is leveraged to isolate the key mechanisms responsible for excipient-mediated protein stabilization. With a library of compositionally identical but structurally distinct amphiphilic excipients, a new property is quantified, compositional dispersity, that is key to excipient performance and utilized this property to rationally design new ultra-stable surfactant excipients that increase the stability of a notoriously unstable biopharmaceutical, monomeric insulin, by an order of magnitude. This comprehensive and generalizable understanding of excipient structure-function relationships represents a paradigm shift for the formulation of biopharmaceuticals, moving away from trial-and-error screening approaches toward rational design.},

These findings indicate combined filamentary RS and ferroelectric switching occurs in devices with designed electrodes, having an ON/OFF ratio of over 100 during about 10 5 cycles. Transport measurements of modified device stacks show no change in SOT when the ferroelectric YHO layer is replaced with an equivalent hafnia-based layer, Hf 0.5 Zr 0.5 O 2 (HZO). However, incomplete SOT is observed for variations in the top electrode thickness or material, as well as LSMO electrode thickness. This underscores the importance of employing oxygen-reactive electrodes and a bottom electrode with reduced conductivity to stabilize SOT.

However, controllably tuning nanochannel spaces with specific sizes and simultaneously achieving high mechanical strength remain the main challenges. In this work, the inter-sheet gallery d-spacing of graphene oxide (GO) membrane is successfully tailored with high mechanical strength via a general radical-induced polymerization strategy. The introduced amide groups from N-Vinylformamide significantly reinforce the 2D nanochannels within the freestanding membranes, resulting in an ultrahigh tensile strength of up to 105 MPa. The d-spacing of the membrane is controllably tuned within a range of 0.799–1.410 nm, resulting in a variable water permeance of up to 218 L m −2 h −1 bar −1 (1304% higher than that of the pristine GO membranes). In particular, the tailored membranes demonstrate excellent water permeance stability (140 L m −2 h −1 bar −1 ) in a 200-h long-term operation and high selectivity of solutes under harsh conditions, including a wide range of pH from 4.0 to 10.0, up to a loading pressure of 12 bar and an external temperature of 40 °C.

  abstract     = {A new aggregation-induced emission (AIE) luminogen is obtained by dimerizing acridin-9(10H)-one (Ac), an aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) effect monomer via an N─N bond and forming 9H,9′H-[10,10′-biacridine]-9,9′-dione (DiAc) with D 2d symmetry. The quenching of DiAc in solution is ascribed to the enhanced basicity promoting hydrogen bonding and then a hydrogen abstraction (HA) reaction and/or an unallowed transition in frontier orbitals with the same symmetry facilitating intersystem crossing. It is found that emissive Ac is one product of the non-emissive DiAc solution in the HA reaction activated by UV irradiation. By exploiting the AIE properties and the HA reaction of DiAc, photolithographic patterning is demonstrated with a paper wetted with DiAc solution.},

  abstract     = {Salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma (SACC) is an intractable malignant tumor originates in the secretory glands and frequently metastasizes to the lungs. Hybrid epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) cells within the tumors are correlated with augmented proliferative capacity and facilitation of lung metastasis. Single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomic sequencing are employed to reveal the hybrid EMT subsets within the vascular fibroblast microenvironment. These hybrid EMT cells exhibit a pro-tumorigenic impact in vitro. Notably, cadherin 11 (CDH11), a specific marker for hybrid EMT cells, may exert its regulatory role in cellular function by interfering with branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) metabolism by inhibiting branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase to activate the mammalian target of the rapamycin pathway, thus making it a potential therapeutic target for SACC. Furthermore, celecoxib and its derivatives are specific CDH11 inhibitors that regulate BCAA metabolism, increase reactive oxygen species production, and subsequently activate the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of the interferongene pathway (cGAS-STING). They also inhibit lung metastasis in NOD-SCID mice in vivo. Overall, these findings suggest a promising treatment strategy that targets hybrid EMT cells to mitigate lung metastasis in SACC. Celecoxib may serve as a promising clinical intervention for the treatment of lung metastases in patients with SACC.},

However, contemporary wearable sensors based on resistive and capacitive mechanisms demand an external power, impeding them from extensive and diverse deployment. Herein, a smart wearable system is developed encompassing five arch-structured self-powered triboelectric sensors, a five-channel data acquisition unit to collect finger bending signals, and an artificial intelligence (AI) methodology, specifically a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, to recognize signal patterns. A slider-crank mechanism that precisely controls the bending angle is designed to quantitively assess the sensor&#39;s performance. Thirty signal patterns of sign language of each letter are collected and analyzed after the environment noise and cross-talks among different channels are reduced and removed, respectively, by leveraging low pass filters. Two LSTM models are trained using different training sets, and four indexes are introduced to evaluate their performance, achieving a recognition accuracy of 96.15%. This work demonstrates a novel integration of triboelectric sensors with AI for sign language recognition, paving a new application avenue of triboelectric sensors in wearable electronics.},

These findings reveal that potassium salts enhance the films&#39; hygroscopicity or methanol-induced swellability. Interestingly, the anions effects do not mirror the empirical Hofmeister series, which describes the salting-in effects for such polymers in dilute aqueous solution, particularly evident in PSBP films with an approximately inverted order. PNIPMAM and PSBP- b -PNIPMAM exhibit pronounced deviations from such an inverted correlation and vary somewhat for water-rich and methanol-rich atmospheres. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations suggest that the observed orders of solvation result from the accessibility of the hydrated solvation shells close to the PSBP- b -PNIPMAM chains.},

However, the pre-vascularization of liver organoids without affecting liver parenchymal specification remains a long-lasting challenge, which is essential for their application in regenerative medicine. Here, the large-scale formation of pre-vascularized human hepatobiliary organoids (vhHBOs) is presented without affecting liver epithelial specification via a novel strategy, namely nonparenchymal cell grafting (NCG). Endothelial and mesenchymal cells are grafted to human hepatobiliary organoids (hHBOs) at the different liver epithelial differentiation stages without supplementing with nonparenchymal culture medium and growth factors. Endothelial grafting at the stage of hepatic maturation offers an optimal integration efficiency compared to the stage of hepatic specification. Additionally, grafting with mesenchymal proves crucial in endothelial invading and sprouting into the liver epithelial cells during the establishment of vhHBOs. Ectopic liver implants into mice further displayed integration of vhHBOs into mice vascular networks. Notably, transplanted vhHBOs self-organized into native liver tissue like hepatic zone and bile ducts, indicating their potential to regenerate damaged hepatic and bile duct tissues. It is believed that nonparenchymal cell grafting will offer a novel technical route to form a high-fidelity complex in vitro model for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.},

Current methodologies for deep wound monitoring are typically limited to indirect clinical symptoms or costly non-real-time imaging diagnosis.

With the 3 representative preclinical deep wound models, the study demonstrates the device&#39;s potential to monitor wound infection, inflammation, healing progress, and reduce inflammation when applied to deep skin injury, surgical implantation, and postoperative intestinal leakage. The device&#39;s capability to rapidly and accurately identify pathogenic bacteria is also demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo, potentially facilitating precise intervention in infected wounds. Coupled with the device&#39;s favorable biocompatibility and cost-effectiveness, this intelligent system emerges as a promising tool for safe and effective management of complicated deep wounds.},

  abstract     = {β-secretase (BACE1) is instrumental in amyloid-β (Aβ) production, with overexpression noted in Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD) neuropathology. The interaction of Aβ with the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) facilitates cerebral uptake of Aβ and exacerbates its neurotoxicity and neuroinflammation, further augmenting BACE1 expression. Given the limitations of previous BACE1 inhibition efforts, the study explores reducing BACE1 expression to mitigate AD pathology. The research reveals that the anticancer agent 6-thioguanosine (6-TG) markedly diminishes BACE1 expression without eliciting cytotoxicity while enhancing microglial phagocytic activity, and ameliorate cognitive impairments with reducing Aβ accumulation in AD mice. Leveraging advanced deep learning-based tool for target identification, and corroborating with surface plasmon resonance assays, it is elucidated that 6-TG directly interacts with RAGE, modulating BACE1 expression through the JAK2-STAT1 pathway and elevating soluble RAGE (sRAGE) levels in the brain. The findings illuminate the therapeutic potential of 6-TG in ameliorating AD manifestations and advocate for small molecule strategies to increase brain sRAGE levels, offering a strategic alternative to the challenges posed by the complexity of AD.},

Despite considerable research on the impact of codon usage on expression levels, the relationship between protein sequence and expression is often overlooked. In this study, a novel connection between protein expression and sequence is uncovered, leading to the development of SRAB (Strength of Relative Amino Acid Bias) based on AEI (Amino Acid Expression Index). The AEI served as an objective measure of this correlation, with higher AEI values enhancing soluble expression. Subsequently, the pre-trained protein model MP-TRANS (MindSpore Protein Transformer) is developed and fine-tuned using transfer learning techniques to create 88 prediction models (MPB-EXP) for predicting heterologous expression levels across 88 species. This approach achieved an average accuracy of 0.78, surpassing conventional machine learning methods. Additionally, a mutant generation model, MPB-MUT, is devised and utilized to enhance expression levels in specific hosts. Experimental validation demonstrated that the top 3 mutants of xylanase (previously not expressed in Escherichia coli ) successfully achieved high-level soluble expression in E. coli . These findings highlight the efficacy of the developed model in predicting and optimizing gene expression based on protein sequences.},

Despite the recent extensive theoretical research, experimental observations of exotic charge screening in DNLSMs remain elusive, which is partly attributed to the coexisting trivial bands near the Fermi energy. This study reports the first direct observation of highly anisotropic charge-screening behavior in the DNLSM SrAs 3 . Through atomically resolved conductance measurements, a highly anisotropic charge-screening pattern around charged impurities on a surface is demonstrated. Moreover, the combination of model studies and first-principles calculations reveals the unique nature of the screening anisotropy in DNLSMs. The results of this study are expected to pave the way for understanding the profound collective behavior of interacting low-energy fermions in topological materials.},

The degree of age, gender, virus infection seems to be weakly correlated with clinical symptoms. Human genetic variation plays a significant role in the sequelae of the COVID-19 infection. This study aims to analyze the genomic differences between individuals with different COVID-19 sequelae. In this study, the exomes of 97 patients with Omicron with 8 unique clinical manifestations are sequenced, and conducted a systematic analysis. Based on non-negative matrix factorization algorithms, the trinucleotide mutation spectrum of four long-term COVID-19 genomes is summarized and found that individuals with different clinical symptoms have unique DNA mutation patterns and indel patterns. By constructing a Genomic Fingerprinting Framework, the driver genes of variation in each symptomatic population are deciphered and analyzed. This study showed that population-specific mutational fingerprint differences are the main cause of heterogeneity in long-term COVID-19 sequelae.

  abstract     = {Denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) are the major microbial processes responsible for global nitrogen (N) loss. Yet, the relative contributions of denitrification and anammox to N loss across contrasting terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems worldwide remain unclear, hampering capacities to predict the human alterations in the global N cycle. Here, a global synthesis including 3240 observations from 199 published isotope pairing studies is conducted and finds that denitrification governs microbial N loss globally (79.8±0.4%). Significantly, anammox is more important in aquatic than terrestrial ecosystems worldwide and can contribute up to 43.2% of N loss in global seawater. Global maps for N loss associated with denitrification and anammox are further generated and show that the contribution of anammox to N loss decreases with latitude for soils and sediments but generally increases with substrate depth. This work highlights the importance of anammox as well as denitrification in driving ecosystem N losses, which is critical for improving the current global N cycle model and achieving sustainable N management.},

  abstract     = {Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) accounts for about 90% of esophageal cancer cases. The lack of effective therapeutic targets makes it difficult to improve the overall survival of patients with ESCC. Reticulon 4 Interacting Protein 1 (RTN4IP1) is a novel mitochondrial oxidoreductase. Here, a notable upregulation of RTN4IP1 is demonstrated, which is associated with poor survival in patients with ESCC. RTN4IP1 depletion impairs cell proliferation and induces apoptosis of ESCC cells. Furthermore, c-Myc regulates RTN4IP1 expression via iron regulatory protein 2 (IRP2) at the post-transcriptional level. Mechanistically, RTN4IP1 mRNA harbors functional iron-responsive elements (IREs) in the 3′ UTR, which can be targeted by IRP2, resulting in increased mRNA stability. Finally, RTN4IP1 depletion abrogates amino acid uptake and induces amino acid starvation via downregulation of the amino acid transporters SLC1A5, SLC3A2, and SLC7A5, indicating a possible pathway through which RTN4IP1 contributes to ESCC carcinogenesis and progression. In vivo studies using cell-derived xenograft and patient-derived xenograft mouse models as well as a 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide-induced ESCC model in esophageal-specific Rtn4ip1 knockout mice demonstrate the essential role of RTN4IP1 in ESCC development. Thus, RTN4IP1 emerges as a key cancer-promoting protein in ESCC, suggesting therapeutic RTN4IP1 suppression as a promising strategy for ESCC treatment.},

The key technological breakthrough enabling these innovations stems from advancements in novel material synthesis, with unparalleled possibilities such as conformability, miniature footprint, and elasticity. However, existing solutions still lack desirable properties like self-adhesivity, breathability, biodegradability, transparency, and fail to offer a streamlined and scalable fabrication process. By addressing these challenges, inkjet-patterned protein-based skin-like silk bioelectronics (Silk-BioE) are presented, that integrate all the desirable material features that have been individually present in existing devices but never combined into a single embodiment. The all-in-one solution possesses excellent self-adhesiveness (300 N m −1 ) without synthetic adhesives, high breathability (1263 g h −1 m −2 ) as well as swift biodegradability in soil within a mere 2 days. In addition, with an elastic modulus of ≈5 kPa and a stretchability surpassing 600%, the soft electronics seamlessly replicate the mechanics of epidermis and form a conformal skin/electrode interface even on hairy regions of the body under severe perspiration. Therefore, coupled with a flexible readout circuitry, Silk-BioE can non-invasively monitor biosignals (i.e., ECG, EEG, EOG) in real-time for up to 12 h with benchmarking results against Ag/AgCl electrodes.},

Recent developments in additive manufacturing (AM) techniques facilitate the manufacturing of lattice metamaterials with intricate microarchitectures and promote their applications in multi-physical scenarios. Previous reviews on lattice metamaterials have largely focused on a specific/single physical field, with limited discussion on their multi-physical properties, interaction mechanisms, and multifunctional applications. Accordingly, this article critically reviews the design principles, structure-mechanism-property relationships, interaction mechanisms, and multifunctional applications of multi-physical lattice metamaterials enabled by AM techniques. First, lattice metamaterials are categorized into homogeneous lattices, inhomogeneous lattices, and other forms, whose design principles and AM processes are critically discussed, including the benefits and drawbacks of different AM techniques for fabricating different types of lattices. Subsequently, the structure–mechanism–property relationships and interaction mechanisms of lattice metamaterials in a range of physical fields, including mechanical, acoustic, electromagnetic/optical, and thermal disciplines, are summarized to reveal critical design principles. Moreover, the multifunctional applications of lattice metamaterials, such as sound absorbers, insulators, and manipulators, sensors, actuators, and soft robots, thermal management, invisible cloaks, and biomedical implants, are enumerated. These design principles and structure-mechanism-property relationships provide effective design guidelines for lattice metamaterials in multifunctional applications.},

Timely diagnosis and intervention can significantly reduce the risk of new-onset stroke in patients with MMD. However, the current diagnostic methods are invasive and expensive, and non-invasive diagnosis using biomarkers of MMD is rarely reported. To address this issue, nanoparticle-enhanced laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI MS) was employed to record serum metabolic fingerprints (SMFs) with the aim of establishing a non-invasive diagnosis method for MMD. Subsequently, a diagnostic model was developed based on deep learning algorithms, which exhibited high accuracy in differentiating the MMD group from the HC group (AUC = 0.958, 95% CI of 0.911 to 1.000). Additionally, hierarchical clustering analysis revealed a significant association between SMFs across different groups and vascular cognitive impairment in MMD. This approach holds promise as a novel and intuitive diagnostic method for MMD. Furthermore, the study may have broader implications for the diagnosis of other neurological disorders.},

  abstract     = {Neuropathic pain, one of the most refractory pain diseases, remains a formidable medical challenge. There is still an unmet demand for effective and safe therapies to address this condition. Herein, a rat model of nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain is first established to explore its pathophysiological characteristics. Recognizing the role of neuroinflammation, an inflammation-resolving amphiphilic conjugate PPT is designed and synthesized by simultaneously conjugating polyethylene glycol, phenylboronic acid pinacol ester, and Tempol onto a cyclic scaffold. PPT can self-assemble into nanomicelles (termed PPTN). Following intravenous injection, PPTN preferentially accumulates in the injured nerve, ameliorates the neuroinflammatory milieu, and promotes nerve regeneration, thereby shortening neuropathic pain duration in rats. Moreover, the Ca 2+ channel α2δ1 subunit is identified as a therapeutic target by RNA-sequencing analysis of the injured nerve. Based on this target, a mimicking peptide (AD peptide) is screened as an analgesic. By packaging AD peptide into PPTN, a combination nano-analgesic APTN is developed. Besides potentiated anti-hyperalgesic effects due to site-specific delivery and on-demand release of AD peptide at target sites, APTN simultaneously inhibits neuroinflammation and promotes nerve regeneration by reprogramming macrophages via regulating MAPK/NF-kB signaling pathways and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, thus affording synergistic efficacies in treating nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain.},

In this work, the loading of various nucleic acids into small EVs via their spontaneous hybridization with preloaded non-lamellar liquid crystalline lipid nanoparticles (LCNPs), forming hybrid EVs (HEVs) is described. It is demonstrated that LCNPs undergo pH-dependent structural transitions from inverse hexagonal ( H II ) phases at pH 5 to more disordered non-lamellar phases, possibly inverse micellar ( L 2 ) or sponge ( L 3 ) phases, at pH 7.4, which are particularly suitable for inducing a controlled hybridization process with EVs. State-of-the-art single-particle analysis techniques reveal that LCNPs interact with various EV subpopulations at physiological conditions and that ≈40% of HEVs are loaded with the genetic cargo. Importantly, this study demonstrates that EV membrane proteins remain accessible on HEV surfaces, with their intrinsic enzymatic activity unaffected after the hybridization process. Finally, HEVs show in vitro improved transfection efficiencies compared to unhybridized LCNPs. In summary, this versatile platform holds potential for loading various nucleic acid molecules into native EVs and may help developing EV-based therapeutics.},

Bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) have been widely demonstrated in various types of solid tumors. LPS can promote the malignant progression of tumors, which mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, a type of MDSC-like tumor cells (MLTCs) is found in tumor tissues induced by low-dose and long-term LPS stimulation. MLTCs can simultaneously express tumor cell and MDSCs markers. Similar to MDSCs, MLTCs can produce arginine, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen species and inhibit the activity of NK and T cells to promote the formation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment. MLTCs can also promote tumor cell proliferation and vasculogenic mimicry formation. CRISPR-Cas9 activity screening studies identified RNA-binding Fox-1 homolog 3 (Rbfox3) as a critical protein for MLTCs formation after LPS treatment. Rbfox3 can transcriptionally regulate the expression of Ass1 in the form of phase-separated particles. Crocin can inhibit the generation of MLTCs by disrupting phase-separated particles of Rbfox3 and enhance the anti-tumor effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).},

Notably, matrix rigidity has emerged as a pivotal regulator of macrophage activation through mechanotransduction. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the interplay between mechanical and biochemical cues within the nuclear milieu remain elusive. Here We elucidate how the increased matrix rigidity drives macrophages to amplify alternatively-activated (M2 phenotype) signaling cooperatively with biochemical cues (e.g., IL4/13) through altered nuclear mechanics. We demonstrate that reconstructed podosome-like F-actins and contractility induce nucleus deformation, opening nuclear pores, which facilitates nuclear translocation of the key transcription factor STAT6. Furthermore, the altered nuclear mechanics increases chromatin accessibility induced by H3K9 methylation, particularly of M2-associated gene promoters. These cooperative events of the mechano-chemical signaling at the cytoskeletal-to-nuclear domains facilitate M2 transcriptional activation and cellular functions. We further evidence the rigidity-primed M2 macrophages are immunosuppressive and accumulated within stiffened tumors in patients. This study proposes a mechanism by which matrix mechanics crosstalks with biochemical signals to potentiate macrophage activation through nuclear mechanosensing and chromatin modifications, offering insights into macrophage mechanobiology and its therapeutic modulations.},

  abstract     = {Personalized neoantigen cancer mRNA vaccines are promising candidates for precision medicine. However, the difficulty of identifying neoantigens heavily hinders their broad applicability. This study developed a universal strategy of anti-tumor mRNA vaccine by harnessing “off-the-shelf” immunity to known antigens. First, the model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) is used for mRNA vaccine design. In vitro test indicated that this mRNA vaccine reprogrammed tumor cells that can be recognized and killed by OVA-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). In situ mRNA vaccine notably inhibited tumor growth across three subcutaneous solid tumor models in mice. Further single-cell sequencing analyses revealed that mRNA vaccination act to reshape the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) toward more proinflammatory characteristics. Strikingly, this framework of mRNA-based strategy can be applied to two clinical pathogen antigens, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (SRBD). Interestingly, the mRNA-based strategy largely recapitulated the scenario of spontaneous cancer regression following pathogen infection or vaccination.

  abstract     = {Liver metastasis is the main cause of cancer-related mortality. During the metastasis process, circulating carcinoma cells hardly pass through narrow capillaries, leading to nuclear deformation. However, the effects of nuclear deformation and its underlying mechanisms on metastasis need further study. Here, it is shown that mechanical force-induced nuclear deformation exacerbates liver metastasis by activating the cGAS-STING pathway, which promotes splenocyte infiltration in the liver. Mechanical force results in nuclear deformation and rupture of the nuclear envelope with inevitable DNA leakage. Cytoplasmic DNA triggers the activation of cGAS-STING pathway, enhancing the production of IL6, TNFα, and CCL2. Additionally, splenocyte recruitment by the proinflammatory cytokines support carcinoma cell survival and colonization in the liver. Importantly, both intervening activity of cGAS and blocking of splenocyte migration to the liver efficiently ameliorate liver metastasis. Overall, these findings reveal a mechanism by which mechanical force-induced nuclear deformation exacerbates liver metastasis by regulating splenocyte infiltration into the liver and support targeting cGAS and blocking splenocyte recruitment as candidate therapeutic approaches for liver metastasis.},

  abstract     = {Inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a promising approach to elicit enduring antitumor immune responses. Hence, extensive efforts are being made to develop ICD inducers. Herein, a cascaded dual-atom nanozyme with Fe and Cu sites (FeCu-DA) as an efficient ICD inducer is presented. The Fe and Cu dual-atom sites synergistically enhance peroxidase (POD) and catalase activities, effectively converting intratumoral hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) to hydroxyl radicals (·OH) and oxygen (O 2 ). Moreover, FeCu-DA exhibits superior glutathione-oxidase (GSH-OXD) activity, catalyzing GSH oxidation to generate H 2 O 2 , enabling cascaded catalysis for sustainable ∙OH generation and reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) resistance by consuming GSH. Steady–state kinetic analysis and density functional theory calculations indicate that FeCu-DA exhibits a higher catalytic rate and efficiency than Fe single-atom nanozymes (Fe-SA) because of its stronger interactions with H 2 O 2 . Its POD activity is 948.05 U mg −1 , which is 2.8-fold greater than that of Fe-SA. Furthermore, FeCu-DA exhibits impressive photothermal effects and photothermal-enhanced cascaded catalysis kinetics for ROS generation, thereby inducing potent ICD. Combined with anti-PD-L1 antibody (αPD-L1) blockade, FeCu-DA shows synergistic enhancement in treatment under near-infrared irradiation. This study provides insights for designing efficient dual-atom nanozymes and demonstrates their potential in ICD-induced cancer immunotherapy.},

  abstract     = {Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 4 (TRAF4), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is frequently overexpressed in tumors. Although its cytoplasmic role in tumor progression is well-documented, the precise mechanisms underlying its nuclear localization and functional contributions in tumor cells remain elusive. This study demonstrated a positive correlation between the expression of nuclear TRAF4 and both tumor grades and stemness signatures in human cancer tissues. Notably, reduced nuclear TRAF4 led to decreased stemness properties and metastatic dormancy of tumor cells. Conversely, restoring nuclear TRAF4 in TRAF4-knockout (TRAF4-KO) cells augmented these cellular capabilities. Within the nucleus, the TRAF domain of TRAF4 interacted with c-Jun, thereby stimulating its transcriptional activity. This interaction subsequently led to an enhancement of the promoter activity of interleukin-8 (IL-8), which is identified as a mediator of nuclear TRAF4-induced tumor dormancy. Additionally, activation of AKT signaling by nerve growth factor facilitated TRAF4 phosphorylation at Ser242, enhancing its interaction with 14-3-3θ and promoting its nuclear translocation. Importantly, pharmacological modulation of TRAF4 nuclear translocation is found to suppress tumor tumorigenicity and metastasis in tumor models. This study highlights the critical role of nuclear TRAF4 in regulating tumor stemness and dormancy, positioning it as a potential therapeutic target for metastatic and refractory cancers.},

  abstract     = {The filterless single-pixel imaging technology is anticipated to hold tremendous competitiveness in diverse imaging applications. Nevertheless, achieving single-pixel color imaging without a filter remains a formidable challenge. Here a lead-free perovskite hemispherical photodetector is reported for filterless single-pixel color imaging. Through passivating the active vacancy and antisite defects with functional chemical groups, the trap density of the perovskite film can be dramatically reduced to half of the pristine one, which results in a stable device with 0.69 nA standard deviation (SD) of the current fluctuations for over 10 000 s. The exceptional stability and remarkable low light response capability of passivated lead-free perovskite devices ensure reliable and repeated distinguishment to high-frequency color information of Fourier patterns. High-resolution color imaging with 256 × 256 pixels can be achieved by integrating the Bayer template with Fourier patterns and designing a corresponding color restoration algorithm. Notably, its imaging quality surpasses commercial silicon photomultiplier tubes (SiPMs) under low light intensities or high-temperature conditions as demonstrated by the larger signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This work presents a novel approach for applying perovskite photodetectors in single-pixel color imaging, propelling the advancement of filterless color imaging technology.},

  abstract     = {Periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory disease, is the leading cause of tooth loss in adults and is one of the most prevalent and complex oral conditions. Oxidative stress induced by the excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leads to periodontitis, which is closely associated with pathological processes, including mitochondrial dysfunction of periodontal cells and local immune dysregulation. However, current treatment modalities that target single pathological processes have limited long-term therapeutic effects. Herein, a multifunctional Yolk–Shell nanozyme, Au@CeO 2 -dimethyl fumarate (DMF), which comprehensively addresses the oxidative stress-induced pathophysiological processes of periodontitis through antioxidant activity, mitochondrial maintenance, and immune modulation mechanisms, is described. For material design logic, functionally complementary Au and CeO 2 formed an excellent photothermally regulated high-efficiency nanozyme, which also provided an ideal drug carrier for DMF. As for the therapeutic logic, Au@CeO 2 -DMF restores mitochondrial dysfunction and immune dysregulation, which also contributes to endogenous ROS elimination, thereby achieving long-term stable therapeutic effects. In a rat model, local Au@CeO 2 -DMF photothermal therapy effectively alleviated ROS-induced tissue damage and restored periodontal homeostasis. Altogether, this study presents a novel antioxidant nanozyme for managing alveolar bone loss under prolonged oxidative stress and demonstrates the importance of comprehensive intervention in key pathological processes in periodontitis treatment design.},

The strength of the growth-induced magnetic anisotropy of the (422)-oriented Co 2 FeSi layers can be artificially controlled by tuning the thicknesses of the inserted V and the grown Co 2 FeSi layers. As a result, a giant converse magnetoelectric effect (over 10 −5 s m −1 ) and a non-volatile binary state at zero electric field are simultaneously achieved in the (422)-oriented Co 2 FeSi/V/PMN-PT(011) multiferroic heterostructure.

  abstract     = {Liver and lung are the most common metastatic sites in colorectal cancer (CRC), where the tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a crucial role in the progression and metastasis of CRC. Understanding the interactions between various types of cells in the TME can suggest innovative therapeutic strategies. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) and clinical samples, fibroblast growth factor-19 (FGF19, rodent FGF15) is found to mediate a significant interaction between CRC cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), activating the hepatic stellate cells (HSCs)-to-CAFs differentiation. In various CRC metastatic mouse models, it is shown that FGF15 has a more pronounced effect on liver metastasis compared to pulmonary metastasis. More importantly, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are also identified from the RNA-Seq dataset upon the activation of HSCs by FGF19 and compared the DEGs in matched primary and metastatic mRNA samples from patients with CRC liver metastasis (CRCLM), it is found that the ANGPTL4 gene is significantly associated with HSCs activation. Different mouse models also demonstrated the impact of the FGF19/ANGPTL4 axis on the severity of CRCLM. Importantly, disruption of this axis significantly inhibits CRCLM in vivo. This study is among the first to demonstrate the impact of the FGF19/ANGPTL4 axis on CRCLM, offering a novel therapeutic strategy.},

  abstract     = {Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is the most lethal tumor arising from thyroid follicular epithelium. Lenvatinib is an off-label use option for ATC patients in many countries but an approved prescription in Japan. However, lenvatinib resistance is a substantial clinical challenge. Clinical ATC samples including lenvatinib-resistant tumors are used to build patient-derived cells and patient-derived xenografts. High-throughput drug screening and synergy analyses are performed to identify an effective combination partner for lenvatinib. Cellular functions are detected by cell senescence, apoptosis, cell cycle, cell viability and colony formation assays. CDK2 inhibition showed the significant synthetic lethality with lenvatinib via inhibiting G1/S transition and inducing cell senescence in ATC. High expression of CDK2 is associated with lenvatinib resistance and poor clinical outcomes of ATC patients. Lenvatinib increased protein expression of CDK2 in lenvatinib-resistant ATC cells. Mechanistically, lenvatinib inhibited protein degradation of CDK2 via reducing CDK2&#39;s interaction with the RACK1-FBW7 complex, which is involved in ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of CDK2. Combination of CDK2 inhibitors in clinical trials (Dinaciclib or PF-07104091) and lenvatinib markedly suppressed growth of xenograft tumors from the lenvatinib-resistant patient. The findings support the combination therapy strategy of lenvatinib and CDK2 inhibitor for lenvatinib-resistant ATC patients with high CDK2 expression.},

  abstract     = {Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD) is characterized by the deposition of misfolded α-synuclein (α-syn) in the brain. Converging evidence indicates that the intracellular transmission and subsequent templated amplification of α-syn are involved in the onset and progression of PD. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the cell-to-cell transmission of pathological α-syn remain poorly understood. Microglia is highly activated in the brains of PD patients. Here, it is shown that depletion of microglia slows the spread of pathological α-syn pathology in mice injected with α-syn fibrils. Microglia phagocytose α-syn fibrils and transform them into more toxic species. The phagocytosis of α-syn fibrils by microglia is partially mediated by triggering a receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), a transmembrane protein expressed on the surface of microglia. The endocytosed α-syn fibrils are then cleaved by the lysosomal proteinase asparagine endopeptidase (AEP) to generate truncated α-syn 1–103 fibrils with enhanced seeding activity. Knockout of TREM2 and AEP impedes the endocytosis and cleavage of α-syn fibrils, respectively. The results demonstrate that TREM2-mediated phagocytosis of α-syn fibrils by microglia and subsequent AEP-mediated cleavage of α-syn fibrils contribute to the spread of α-syn in the brain. Blocking either of these two steps attenuates the progression of α-syn pathology.},

However, thick electrodes face significant challenges, including poor ion transport, long diffusion paths, and mechanical instability, all of which degrade battery performance. To overcome these barriers, a novel micro-electric-field (μ-EF) process is introduced that enhances particle alignment during fabrication with reduced distance between anode and cathode. This process produces hyper-thick (≈700 µm) electrodes with low tortuosity and improved ion diffusion. The μ-EF electrodes achieve high areal capacities (≈8 mAh cm −2 ), while maintaining power density and long cycle life. The electrodes show stable performance under high C-rate cycling and retain structural integrity after 1000 cycles at 2 C. By offering a scalable solution to the challenges of thick electrode fabrication, the μ-EF process represents a significant advancement for high-capacity LIBs in electric vehicles and energy storage systems.},

Ace tylation Ta rgeting C himera (AceTAC), a novel technology is previously reported that hijacks lysine acetyltransferases p300/CBP to acetylate the p53Y220C mutant. However, p300/CBP are the only acetyltransferases harnessed for AceTAC development to date. In this study, it is demonstrated for the first time that the TAF1 acetyltransferase can be recruited to acetylate p53Y220C. A novel TAF1-recruiting AceTAC, MS172 is discovered, which effectively acetylates p53Y220C lysine 382 in a concentration-, time- and TAF1-dependent manner via inducing the ternary complex formation between p53Y220C and TAF1. Notably, MS172 suppresses the proliferation in multiple p53Y220C-harboring cancer cell lines more potently than the previously reported p300/CBP-recruiting p53Y220C AceTAC MS78 with little toxicity in p53 WT and normal cells. Additionally, MS172 is bioavailable in mice and suitable for in vivo efficacy studies. Lastly, novel upregulation of metallothionine proteins by MS172-induced p53Y220C acetylation is discovered using RNA-seq and RT-qPCR studies. This work demonstrates that TAF1 can be harnessed for AceTAC development and expands the very limited repertoire of the acetyltransferases that can be leveraged for developing AceTACs, thus advancing the targeted protein acetylation field.},

However, most of the reported type-I PSs have a contingency of molecular design, because electron transfer (ET) reaction is more difficult to achieve than energy transfer (EET) process. Therefore, it is urgent to understand molecular design mechanisms for type-I PSs. In this review, the two ways to achieve the type-I PSs, i.e., inhibiting EET process (type-II) or enhancing ET process (type-I), are detailly explained. In response, the current design strategies of type-I PSs are summarized from two perspectives: indirect strategy (inhibiting EET process: reducing the energy of the lowest triplet excited state (T 1 ) to lower than the energy required for the excitation energy transfer to produce singlet oxygen) and direct strategy (enhancing ET process: promoting the ET efficiency of PSs to generate superoxide radicals). The construction of direct strategy can be realized by forming an electron-rich microenvironment, providing an electron-deficient intermediate transmitter, and introducing an enhanced electron transfer capacity primitive.},

Herein, MOF-derived nitrogen-doped carbon/nickel-cobalt sulfides coupled vertically aligned Rhenium disulfide (ReS 2 ) on carbon cloth (NC-CoNi 2 S 4 @ReS 2 /CC) are constructed via hydrothermal and activation approaches. Experimental and theoretical analysis demonstrates that the strong interactions between multiple interfaces promote electron redistribution and facilitate water dissociation, thereby optimizing *H adsorption energy for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Meanwhile, the adsorption energies of oxygenated intermediates are balanced to reduce the thermodynamic barrier for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Consequently, NC-CoNi 2 S 4 @ReS 2 /CC shows smaller overpotentials of 87 and 253 mV for HER and OER at 10 mA cm −2 , with a lower Tafel slope and R ct than control samples. Superior catalytic stability is confirmed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) for 1000 cycles and CA test for 56 h. Furthermore, NC-CoNi 2 S 4 @ReS 2 /CC presents exceptional electrocatalytic activity in both alkaline water/seawater electrolytes. Stability assessments reveal that NC-CoNi 2 S 4 @ReS 2 /CC maintains a highly catalytic activity in both water and seawater, owing to the corrosion-resistant properties of the sulfur species at the interface. These findings highlight the importance of designing heterostructure electrocatalysts for clean hydrogen production.},

Although various micro-/nano-structured surfaces have been engineered toward higher surface wettability and wickability for enhanced boiling, the design and fabrication of surface structures for realizing both high critical heat flux (CHF) and high heat transfer coefficient (HTC) remain a key challenge. Here, a novel “electrode-transpose” all-electrochemical strategy is proposed to create superhydrophilic microporous surfaces with higher dendrites and larger pores by simply adding an electrochemical etching step prior to the multiple electrochemical deposition steps. Enabled by the high nucleation density and high wicking capability, a high boiling performance is shown on such “etching-then-deposition” surfaces with simultaneously high CHF of 2,641 ± 10 kW m −2 and high HTC of 214 ± 6 kW (m 2 K) −1 , which are more than 2.5 and 4.3-fold enhanced from those on smooth surfaces, respectively. A very stable morphology and boiling performance of such surfaces subject to consecutive tests are also shown. Using this strategy, such superhydrophilic microporous layers are fabricated on curved surfaces with larger areas, both on spheres and slender cylinders, and demonstrate excellent boiling performance in quenching tests. This facile, geometry-adaptive, durable, and scalable strategy is very promising for making high-performance boiling surfaces for large-scale industrial applications.},

  abstract     = {Promoting tumor cell senescence arrests the cell cycle of tumor cells and activates the immune system to eliminate these senescent cells, thereby suppressing tumor growth. Nevertheless, PD-L1 positive senescent tumor cells resist immune clearance and possess the ability to secret various cytokines and inflammatory factors that stimulate the growth of tumor cells. Consequently, drugs capable of both triggering senescence in tumor cells and concurrently diminishing the expression of PD-L1 to counteract immune evasion are urgently needed. Here, a berberine derivative B68 is developed, which specifically induces tumor cell senescence by targeting BMI1. B68 also involves the degradation of PD-L1 by targeting CSN5, thereby disrupting the immunosuppressive PD-1/PD-L1 interaction and enabling rapid clearance of senescent tumor cells. This approach simultaneously inhibits tumor progression and activates T cell immunity, as evidenced by the robust antitumor response following B68-induced immunization of senescent cancer cells. Moreover, the synergistic effect of B68 with anti-CTLA4 therapy further enhances antitumor immunity, and its ability to induce senescence in cancer cells triggers a strong protective response by dendritic and CD8 + T cells. These findings provide a scientific basis for developing a new tumor treatment strategy based on senescence induction and lay the foundation for further preclinical research.},

The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) plays a crucial role in preventing aneuploidy in oocytes, yet it is unclear if additional mechanisms exist to ensure oocyte adherence to this checkpoint. It is now revealed that the microtubule-associated protein NUSAP can prevent oocytes from evading the SAC and regulate the speed of the cell cycle. Mechanistically, the study identifies NUSAP as a novel stabilizer of the E3 ubiquitin ligase APC/C CDH1 , protecting CDH1 from SCF BTRC -mediated degradation. Depletion of NUSAP reduces CDH1 protein level, leading to abnormal spindle assembly and chromosome alignment, and disrupting the balance of cell cycle proteins. This misregulated balance causes oocytes to evade the SAC. Consequently, these abnormal oocytes not only fail to arrest at metaphase but also accelerate the cell process, ultimately resulting in the production of aneuploid eggs. Together, the findings not only clarify the existence of mechanisms that ensure oocytes compliance with the spindle assembly checkpoint but also expand the new functions of NUSAP beyond its role as a microtubule- associated protein.},

However, the involvement of the engineered interface in the cationic and anionic redox reactions associated with (de-)lithiation is often ignored, mostly due to the difficulty to separate these processes from chemical/catalytic reactions at the cathode/electrolyte interface. Here, a new electron energy band diagrams concept is developed that includes the examination of the electrochemical- and ionization- potentials evolution upon batteries cycling. The approach enables to forecast the intrinsic stability of the cathodes and discriminate the reaction pathways associated with interfacial electronic charge-transfer mechanisms. Specifically, light is shed on the evolution of cationic and anionic redox in high-energy density lithium-rich 0.33Li 2 MnO 3 ·0.67LiNi 0.4 Co 0.2 Mn 0.4 O 2 (HE-NCM) cathodes, particularly those that undergo surface modification through SO 2 and NH 3 double-gas treatment to suppress the structural degradation. The chemical composition and energy distribution of the occupied and unoccupied electronic states at the different charging/discharging states are quantitatively estimated by using advanced spectroscopy techniques, including operando Raman spectroscopy. The concept is successfully demonstrated in designing artificial interfaces for high-voltage olivine structure cathodes enabling stable battery operation up to 5.1 V versus Li + /Li.},

  abstract     = {Nonfullerene acceptors are critical in advancing the performance of organic solar cells. However, unfavorable morphology and low photon-to-electron conversion in the acceptor range continue to limit the photocurrent generation and overall device performance. Herein, benzoic anhydride, a low-cost polar molecule with excellent synergistic properties, is introduced in combination with the traditional additive 1-chloronaphthalene to optimize the aggregation of nonfullerene acceptors. This dual additive approach precisely modulates the morphology of various acceptors, significantly enhancing device performance. Notably, the method induces the formation of fine fibers with dense polymorph structures in BTP-base derivatives, achieving an optimal balance between exciton dissociation and charge collection in the active layers. As a result, the external quantum efficiency of the optimal devices is markedly improved in the wavelength range of 700–850 nm. Ultimately, power conversion efficiencies of 18.27% and 19.59% are achieved for devices comprising PM6:Y6 and PM6:L8-BO, respectively. The results reveal a convenient and effective method to control the morphology of nonfullerene acceptors and improve the photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells, paving the way for more efficient and practical organic photovoltaic technologies.},

  abstract     = {Burn injuries often cause prolonged oxidative stress and inflammatory pain due to an initial increase in inflammatory responses, consequently exacerbating depressive disorders and severely impairing patients’ quality of life. The primary function of traditional burn dressings is to prevent infection and facilitate tissue repair. However, these dressings are not intended for the inflammatory pain and depression that often occur during recovery. This study describes a self-healing hydrogel H@EFCP, which is designed to alleviate inflammatory pain and post-burn depression in burn injuries. This hydrogel is synthesized through the cross-linking of carboxymethyl chitosan with borate ester chelates formed from epigallocatechin gallate and 4-formylphenylboronic acid. The incorporated Prussian blue nanoparticles increase the ability of H@EFCP to regulate the inflammatory process. H@EFCP is effective in the treatment of skin burns by reducing oxidative stress and improving the microenvironment of peripheral inflammation in mice. This modulation consists of a reduction of central nervous system inflammation and the risk of post-burn depression. Behavioral assays indicate that the hydrogel significantly reduces feelings of despair and anxiety after burns. Consequently, H@EFCP provides a dual-effect solution for the care and recovery of burn patients, including both burn repair and the associated psychological effects.},

This study employs single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptome (ST) analysis on samples from the tumor core, adjacent non-tumorous tissue, and the leading-edge area of nine ICC patients. These findings indicate that tumor cells at the leading-edge area demonstrate enhanced proliferation and are tightly associated with the stroma, including endothelial cells and POSTN+ FAP+ fibroblasts. Notably, CD8+ T cells in this region exhibit a naive phenotype with low cytotoxicity and signs of exhaustion, likely due to compromised antigen presentation by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The predominant CD8+ T cell subset, mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, recruits SPP1+ macrophages within the stroma. This interaction, along with the presence of POSTN+ cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and endothelial cells, forms a unique “triad structure” that fosters tumor growth and ICC progression. The research highlights the intricate characteristics and interactions of ICC tumor cells in the leading-edge area, offering insights into potential therapeutic targets for intervention.},

This sensor allows real-time monitoring of VOC with a sensitivity down to the parts per trillion level. A quantitative VOC diffusion model in plants is proposed to describe this extreme sensitivity. The sensor plant is paired with a customized portable Raman device, demonstrating its ability to detect multiple VOCs on-field. The sensor demonstrated that plants collect VOCs emitted from neighboring plants and hazardous volatile chemicals in the air at a certain distance. As a feasibility study, this nanobionic VOC sensor plant successfully monitored the early stages of fungal infection in strawberry fruits.

However, simultaneous optimization of water transfer direction in a cost-effective and reliable ISSG to balance thermal localization, salt accumulation, and resistance to oilfouling represents a rare feat. Herein, inspired by seabird beaks for unidirectional water transfer, eco-friendly and cost-effective plant extracts, sodium alginate, and tannic acid, are selected for crafting an innovative Sodium Alginate-Tannic Acid Hemispheric Evaporator (STHE). The STHE aligned with centripetally tapered channels ensures one-directional water flow and effectively inhibits downward heat transfer, thereby boosting energy efficiency. Additionally, the integration of one-way water supply in tapered channels with interfacial evaporation of STHE, mimicking plant transpiration, collaboratively facilitates upward water transfer for a reliable solar-driven water evaporation rate of ≈2.26 kg m −2 h −1 under one sun irradiation. Even in a brine of 15.0 wt % solution, no salt crystals are observed on the surface of STHE. Hemispheric structure and superhydrophilicity are conducive to oil repellence. This work provides pivotal inspiration for constructing next-generation solar generators of high-efficiency, salt-tolerance, and anti-oil-fouling.},

However, current methods for loading drugs into exosomes are inefficient and cost-prohibitive for practical application. In this study, boron clusters are mixed with doxorubicin (DOX) and exosomes, enabling the efficient encapsulation of DOX into exosomes through a superchaotropic effect. Exosomes loaded with DOX and boron clusters (EDB) exhibit superior permeability and the ability to deliver higher concentrations of DOX into DOX-resistant breast cancer cells. Mechanistic analysis reveals that boron clusters form a supramolecular complex with DOX, which facilitates sustained drug release and effectively inhibits P-glycoprotein-mediated DOX efflux. As a result, EDB significantly enhance apoptosis in DOX-resistant breast cancer cells and suppress tumor growth in cases where DOX alone is ineffective, thereby extending the survival of nude mice. In summary, boron clusters effectively facilitate the incorporation of DOX into exosomes and inhibit DOX efflux, offering a novel strategy to overcome DOX resistance.},

Although the chain and coordination centers are identical on both substrates, the long-range spin–spin coupling due to a superexchange through the ligand on Ag is not experimentally observed on Pb(111).

Midbrain dopaminergic neurons generate both tonic and phasic action potential (AP) firing patterns in behavior mice. Besides AP numbers, whether and how different AP firing patterns per se modulate DA release remain largely unknown. Here by using in vivo and ex vivo models, it is shown that the AP frequency per se modulates DA release through the D2 receptor (D2R), which contributes up to 50% of total DA release. D2R has a voltage-sensing site at D131 and can be deactivated in a frequency-dependent manner by membrane depolarization. This voltage-dependent D2R inhibition of DA release is mediated via the facilitation of voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels (VGCCs). Collectively, this work establishes a novel mechanism that APs per se modulate DA overflow by disinhibiting the voltage-sensitive autoreceptor D2R and thus the facilitation of VGCCs, providing a pivotal pathway and insight into mammalian DA-dependent functions in vivo.},

Conventionally, signals are aggregated from many individual transducers in order to achieve sufficient statistics. However, by aggregating signals, transducer-to-transducer differences are lost and heterogeneities cannot be studied. Here, transducers with single-molecule resolution over long time spans are studied, enabling the collection of sufficient statistics from independent transducers. This allows comparisons between transducers that reveal fundamental heterogeneities in their molecular assemblies related to stochastic variations. The study is performed with biosensing by particle motion, a sensing methodology with thousands of particles that dynamically interact with a sensing surface. The signals of individual particles are studied for series of modulations of analyte concentration over 25 h. The results show large differences in individual concentration-dependent responses. Monte Carlo simulations clarify that heterogeneities can be attributed to stochastic fluctuations in the numbers of binder molecules, and that gradual changes of the response characteristics can be related to losses of molecules in the single-particle transducers. The results give insights into molecular and temporal heterogeneities of continuous transducers with single-molecule resolution and explain how sensors can be engineered to achieve robust, precise, and stable biomolecular monitoring.},

In this work, a versatile and robust drift correction technique is presented for single-molecule localization-based super-resolution microscopy. It is based on the displacement analysis of bright-field image features of the specimen with oblique illumination. By leveraging the monotonic relationship between the displacement of image features and axial positions, this method can precisely measure the drift of the imaging system in real-time with sub-nanometer precision in all three dimensions, over a broad axial range, and for various samples, including those with closely matched refractive indices. The performance of this method is validated against conventional marker-assisted techniques and demonstrates its high precision in super-resolution imaging across various biological samples.

The majority of these NR-RNAs are associated with plant-microbial interaction and exhibit high organ specificity. Roots display the highest abundance of NR-ncRNAs and the most dynamic crosstalk between NR-lncRNAs and NR-miRNAs in a GmNARK-dependent manner. This indicates that while each tissue responds uniquely, GmNARK serves as a primary regulator of the transcriptional control of nodulated-plants. Furthermore, this work proves that lnc-NNR6788 and lnc-NNR7059 promote nodulation by regulating their target genes. This work also shows that the nodulation- and GmNARK-regulated (NNR) lnc-NNR4481 negatively regulates nodulation through miR172c within a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network. The spatial organ-type transcriptomic atlas establishes a benchmark and provides a valuable resource for integrative analyses of the mechanism underlying of nodulation and plant growth balance.},

  abstract     = {Lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs) offer high energy density and environmental benefits hampered by the shuttle effect related to sluggish redox reactions of long-chain lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). However, the fashion modification of the d -band center in separators is still ineffective, wherein the mechanism understanding always relies on theoretical calculations. This study visibly probed the evolution of the Co 3 d -band center during charge and discharge using advanced inverse photoemission spectroscopy/ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (IPES/UPS), which offers reliable evidence and are consistent well with theoretical calculations. This, coupled with in situ Raman and X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electrochemical data, co-evidences a novel pre-activating S redox mechanism in LSBs: LiPSs desert/insert in C-N matrixes within a series of Co@NCNT-based separators. The insight of the S redox pre-activation is discovered that the Co 3 d -band center downshifts to hybridized with S 2 p orbitals in LiPSs, giving rise to a more pronounced S covalency and thus accelerating the conversion of LiPSs to S₈. Benefiting from these advantages, the optimized LSB possesses a minimal decay rate of 0.0058% after 200 cycles at a high discharge rate of 10 C. This study provides new insights into LSB mechanisms and supports conventional theoretical models of the d -band center&#39;s impact on LSB performance.},

  abstract     = {Osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of disability, often resulting from overuse or injury, but inactivity can also contribute to cartilage degeneration. Conventional in vivo models struggle to isolate and study the specific effects of mechanical stress on cartilage health. To address this limitation, a microphysiological system (MPS) is established to examine how varying levels of shear stress impact cartilage homeostasis. The system allows for the cultivation of 3D chondrogenic microconstructs (CMCs) derived from human mesenchymal stromal cells, simulating both physiological and pathophysiological shear stress. Inflammation is induced via TNF-α or activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells to model cartilage damage, enabling the evaluation of therapeutic interventions. The study demonstrates the development of an arthritis-like phenotype and successful restoration of cartilage conditions through a JAK inhibitor under physiological shear stress. Physiological shear stress is identified as a critical factor in maintaining cartilage integrity. This MPS offers a standardized method to study shear stress, replicate cytokine-induced cartilage damage, and simulate key features of arthritis, providing a valuable alternative to animal models.},

  abstract     = {Toxoplasma gondii is a ubiquitous protozoan parasite with a complex life cycle containing multiple developmental stages. The parasites have distinct gene expression patterns at different stages to enable stage specific life activities, but the underlying regulatory mechanisms are largely unknown. In this study, a nuclear complex is identified that controls the expression of developmentally regulated genes. This complex consists of the AP2 family transcription factor AP2XII-5, the epigenetic factors MORC and HDAC3, as well as a novel AP2XII-5 interacting protein 1 (AIP1) that stabilizes this complex. At the tachyzoite stage when the parasites proliferate rapidly by asexual endodyogeny, AP2XII-5 binds to the promoter regions of developmentally activated genes and recruits MORC and HDAC3 to suppress their expression. When sexual commitment and merozoite development are triggered, the abundance of AP2XII-5 decreases and its suppression on target genes is relieved. In contrast to MORC and HDAC3, which regulate Toxoplasma development but are also essential for tachyzoite growth, AP2XII-5 and AIP1 are dispensable for tachyzoite proliferation in vitro. These data suggest that while MORC and HDAC3 have broad regulatory activities, forming a complex with AP2XII-5 and AIP1 enables them to specifically regulate gene expression during development.},

  abstract     = {Overall water splitting (OWS) to produce hydrogen has attracted large attention in recent years due to its ecological-friendliness and sustainability. However, the efficiency of OWS has been forced by the sluggish kinetics of the four-electron oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The replacement of OER by alternative electrooxidation of small molecules with more thermodynamically favorable potentials may fundamentally break the limitation and achieve hydrogen production with low energy consumption, which may also be accompanied by the production of more value-added chemicals than oxygen or by electrochemical degradation of pollutants. This review critically assesses the latest discoveries in the coupled electrooxidation of various small molecules with OWS, including alcohols, aldehydes, amides, urea, hydrazine, etc. Emphasis is placed on the corresponding electrocatalyst design and related reaction mechanisms (e.g., dual hydrogenation and N–N bond breaking of hydrazine and C═N bond regulation in urea splitting to inhibit hazardous NCO − and NO − productions, etc.), along with emerging alternative electrooxidation reactions (electrooxidation of tetrazoles, furazans, iodide, quinolines, ascorbic acid, sterol, trimethylamine, etc.). Some new decoupled electrolysis and self-powered systems are also discussed in detail. Finally, the potential challenges and prospects of coupled water electrolysis systems are highlighted to aid future research directions.},

In this study, N- glycosylated proteins and N- glycosylation sites of differential expression between primary lesions and paired liver metastatic lesions are identified. Cathepsin D (CTSD) is further screened as a potentially pivotal N- glycosylated protein in CRC liver metastasis. Glycosyltransferases complex DDOST and STT3B can regulate N- glycosylation modification at residue 263 of CTSD (a protease), thereby affecting CTSD protease to lyse ACADM. ACADM can regulate ferroptosis-related proteins (ACSL4, SLC7A11, and GPX4) to further influence the invasion and metastasis of CRC cells.

Nanoparticles are versatile and effective tools for therapeutic delivery to specific organelles. Nanoparticles offer several advantageous characteristics, including a high surface area-to-volume ratio for efficient therapeutic loading and the ability to attach targeting moieties (tethers) that enhance delivery. The choice of nanoparticle shape, size, composition, surface properties, and targeting ligands depends on the desired target organelle and therapeutic effect. Various nanoparticle platforms have been explored for organelle targeting, such as liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, dendrimers, and inorganic nanoparticles. In this review, current and emerging approaches to nanoparticle design are examined in the context of various diseases linked to organelle dysfunction.

  abstract     = {Crystalline thermoelectric materials, especially SnSe crystals, have emerged as promising candidates for power generation and electronic cooling. In this study, significant enhancement in ZT is achieved through the combined effects of lattice distortions and band convergence in multiple electronic valence bands. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that cation vacancies together with Pb substitutional doping promote the band convergence and increase the density of states (DOS) near the Fermi surface of SnSe, leading to a notable increase in the Seebeck coefficient ( S ). The complex defects formed by Sn vacancies and Pb doping not only boost the Seebeck coefficient but also optimize carrier concentration ( n H ) and enhance electrical conductivity ( σ ), resulting in a higher power factor ( PF ). Furthermore, the localized lattice distortions induced by these defects increase phonon scattering, significantly reducing lattice thermal conductivity ( κ lat ) to as low as 0.29 W m −1 K −1 at 773 K in Sn 0.92 Pb 0.03 Se. Consequently, these synergistic effects on phonon and electron transport contribute to a high ZT of 1.8.

In addition, a detailed analysis is presented on the designed lenses and pixels, which are all fabricated by two-photon polymerization lithography. Though Fresnel lenses are susceptible to chromatic aberrations, the results show that they can be used for imaging pixels that produce a wide range of colors at low numerical aperture ( NA ≈0.2).

An RNA G-quadruplex (RG4) structure at the 5′ end of crRNA is introduced to modulate Cas12a activity accurately without the need for chemical modifications. The results indicate that the presence of RG4 does not significantly impact Cas12a&#39;s cleavage activity but can be controlled by RG4 stabilizers, enabling the suppression and subsequent restoration of Cas12a activity with potential for precise activity control. Moreover, the use of RG4 is expanded by incorporating it into split crRNA, introducing RG4 directly at the 5′ end of the direct repeat (DR) region, enabling tailored activity regulation for different targets by matching with various Spacer regions. Additionally, a light-controlled one-pot method for activating Cas12a is developed, thereby enhancing the accuracy and sensitivity of clinical samples.

Secreted Phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1) exerts crucial functions in bone matrix mineralization and calcium deposition. Here, a novel function of SPP1 is reported, namely that it can aggravate nucleus pulposus cells (NPs) degeneration by negatively regulating extracellular matrix homeostasis. The degenerated NPs have a higher mineralization potential, which is achieved by SPP1. Mechanistically, SPP1 can accelerate the degeneration of nucleus pulposus cells by activating integrin α5β1 (ITGα5/β1), aggravating mitochondrial damage and inhibiting mitophagy. SPP1-ITGα5/β1 axis inhibits mitophagy by PINK1/PARKIN pathway blockade. In conclusion, SPP1 activates ITGα5/β1 to inhibit mitophagy, accelerates NPs degeneration, and induces calcification, thereby leading to intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) and calcification, identifying the potentially unknown mechanism and relationship between IVDD and calcification. Important insights are provided into the role of SPP1 in nucleus pulposus calcification in IVDD by inducing nucleus pulposus cell senescence through inhibition of mitophagy and may help develop potential new strategies for IVDD treatment.},

  abstract     = {Karyotype diversity plays an important role in speciation and diversification. However, gymnosperms, particularly conifers, exhibit remarkable karyotype uniformity. To explore the evolutionary processes shaping karyotypes in gymnosperms, the karyotype evolutionary history is reconstructed through comparative genomic analyses. Synteny analysis confirms the absence of ancient polyploidy in conifers and its rarity across the gymnosperms as a whole. Further analysis reveals convergent patterns of reciprocal translocations between nonhomologous chromosomes in conifer genomes. Centromeric-centromeric reciprocal translocations (CRTs) have been identified as the primary mechanism of karyotype evolution in conifers, while telomeric-centromeric reciprocal translocations (TRTs) significantly contributed to descending dysploidy within Cupressales. A graph-based method is utilized to infer the detailed evolutionary pathways from the proto-gymnosperm karyotype ( n = 12) to modern conifer karyotypes ( n = 11–12). In conclusion, the scarcity of both polyploidy and dysploidy contributes to the karyotype uniformity of gymnosperms and potentially also to their lower species richness compared to angiosperms. However, the pervasive CRTs and occasional TRTs underlie this “apparent uniformity”, supporting the “karyotype orthoselection” hypothesis. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms maintaining karyotype uniformity in conifers and the role of karyotype evolution in their diversification.},

  abstract     = {Squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (HNSCC) originate in the upper aerodigestive tract, including the oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx. Current treatments of locally advanced HNSCC often lead to high treatment failure, and disease recurrence, resulting in poor survival rates. Advances in mRNA technologies and lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery systems led to several clinical trials involving LNP-CRISPR-Cas9 mRNA-based therapeutics. Despite these advances, achieving cell-type-specific extrahepatic mRNA delivery is still challenging. This study introduces a safe and effective intratumoral EGFR-targeted CRISPR-LNP delivery strategy for knocking out SOX2, which is a cancer-specific gene. To assess their therapeutic potential, it is shown that LNPs made from ionizable lipids with helper lipids co-encapsulating Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA targeting SOX2 (sgSOX2), lead to a ≈60% reduction in HNSCC cell viability in vitro. Next, using a xenograft HNSCC mouse model, targeted delivery of 𝜶EGFR- CRISPR-sgSOX2-LNPs to HNSCC cells resulted in a 90% inhibition of tumor growth and a 90% increase in survival for &gt; 84 days, with tumor disappearance observed in 50% of the mice. These findings emphasize the potential of targeted mRNA-Cas9-LNPs in clinically accessible solid tumors, specifically in reaching tumor cells and inducing persistent therapeutic responses in tumors with high-recurrence rates like HNSCC.},

  abstract     = {The prognosis for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) remains poor, and reliable prognostic markers have yet to be identified. Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) have been associated with favorable outcomes in certain cancers. However, the relationship between TLS and MIBC remains unclear. A multi-omics approach is utilized, leveraging single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, bulk RNA sequencing, and immunohistochemistry, to investigate the roles of B cells and TLS in MIBC. These findings indicate that elevated levels of B cells and TLS correlate with improved prognoses in patients with MIBC, aligning with the robust antitumor immune responses observed in the TLS region. From a mechanistic perspective, CXCL13 serves as a critical cytokine for TLS formation in MIBC, primarily secreted by clonally expanded CXCL13+ T cells. This cytokine interacts with the CXCR5 receptor on NR4A2+ B cells, promoting TLS development. Plasma cells arising within the TLS microenvironment predominantly produce the IGHG antibody, potentially enhancing the phagocytic capabilities of C1QC+ macrophages. From an application standpoint, a TLS-specific gene signature is developed that effectively predicts outcomes in MIBC and other cancers. This study highlights the prognostic potential of TLS in MIBC and reveals immune mechanisms, offering insights for personalized treatment strategies.},

  abstract     = {Simultaneous rheological, polarized light imaging, and small-angle X-ray scattering experiments (Rheo-PLI-SAXS) are developed, thereby providing unprecedented level of insight into the multiscale orientation of hierarchical systems in simple shear. Notably, it is observed that mesoscale alignment in the flow direction does not develop simultaneously across nano-micro lengthscales in sheared suspensions of rod-like chiral-nematic (meso) phase forming cellulose nanocrystals. Rather, with increasing shear rate, orientation is observed first at mesoscale and then extends to the nanoscale, with influencing factors being the aggregation state of the hierarchy and concentration. In biphasic systems, where an isotropic phase co-exists with self-assembled liquid crystalline mesophase domains, the onset of mesodomain alignment towards the flow direction can occur at shear rates nearing one decade before a progressive increase in preferential orientation at nanoscale is detected. If physical confinement prevents the full formation of a cholesteric phase, mesoscale orientation occurs in shear rate ranges that correspond to de-structuring at nanoscale. Interestingly, nano- and mesoscale orientations appear to converge only for biphasic suspensions with primary nanoparticles predominantly made up of individual crystallites and in a high-aspect ratio nematic-forming thin-wall nanotube system. The nano-micro orientation propagation is attributed to differences in the elongation and breakage of mesophase domains.},

  abstract     = {The electrochemical N 2 reduction reaction (NRR) currently represents a green and sustainable approach to ammonia production. However, the further progress of NRR is significantly hampered by poor catalytic activity and selectivity, necessitating the development of efficient and stable electrocatalysts. Herein, a nanoporous Fe–Mo bimetallic nitride (Fe 3 N-MoN) is synthesized using a molten-salt preparation method. This catalyst demonstrates notable NRR performance, achieving a high NH 3 yield rate of 45.1 µg h −1 mg −1 and a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 26.5% at −0.2 V (vs RHE) under ambient conditions. Detailed experimental studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the fabricated interface between Fe 3 N and MoN effectively modulates the surface electronic structure of the catalyst. The interface induces an increase in the degree of electron deficiency at the nitrogen-vacancy sites on the catalyst surface, allowing N 2 molecules to occupy the nitrogen vacancies more easily, thereby promoting N 2 adsorption/activation during the NRR process. Consequently, the Fe 3 N-MoN catalyst exhibits outstanding NRR activity. The insights gained from fabricating the Fe 3 N-MoN interface in this work pave the way for further development of interfacial engineering to prepare high-efficient electrocatalyst.},

By employing an innovative gate control mechanism, the transistors achieve an ultralow SS of only 0.15 mV dec −1 and maintain the average SS remained at 1.5 mV dec −1 over three decades of drain current. Additionally, our CG-NACTs deliver milliamper-level drain current at a low drain voltage of 0.7 V, with a maximum on/off ratio of 7.82×10 6 . Notably, CG-NACTs remain highly stable even at high temperatures of up to 150 °C and under irradiation.

However, the non-tumor-specific release of Cu ions can induce cuproptosis and cause irreversible damage to normal tissues. To maximize the therapeutic effects of tumor-specific cuproptosis, this work reports for the first time the regulation of degradation behaviors of Cu-based nanomaterials using graphene quantum dots (GQDs) as a protection layer. The deposition of GQDs not only avoids the degradation of Cu 2 O nanocubes under normal physiological conditions, but also sensitizes their sonodynamic activity due to the formation of Z-scheme heterojunctions. The tumor-specific released Cu ions achieve the cascade amplification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation through Cu + -mediated Fenton-like reaction and Cu 2+ -facilitated GSH depletion. More importantly, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) can be reversed by the greatly enhanced ROS levels and high-efficiency cuproptosis, ultimately inducing immunogenic cell death that promotes robust systemic immune responses for the eradication of primary tumors and suppression of distant tumors. This work provides a novel paradigm for the integration of SDT, CDT, cuproptosis, and immunotherapy in a controlled manner to achieve tumor-specific antitumor therapy by controlling the degradation behaviors of Cu-based nanomaterials.},

While immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting PD-1/PD-L1 have brought new hope, their efficacy is limited by low response rates and significant immune-mediated adverse events (irAEs). Through multi-omics data analysis, it is discovered that the spatial co-localization of CD73 and PD-L1 in melanoma correlates with improved progression-free survival (PFS), suggesting a synergistic potential of their inhibitors. Building on these insights, a novel therapeutic strategy using calcium phosphate (CaP) nanoparticles is developed for the co-delivery of aPD-L1 and APCP, a CD73 inhibitor. These nanoparticles, constructed via a biomineralization method, exhibit high drug-loading capacity and pH-responsive drug release. Compared to free aPD-L1, the CaP-delivered aPD-L1 effectively avoids systemic side effects while significantly enhancing anti-tumor efficacy, surpassing even a 20-fold dose of free aPD-L1. Furthermore, the co-delivery of aPD-L1 and APCP via CaP nanoparticles demonstrates a synergistic anti-tumor effect, with substantial immune activation and prevention of tumor recurrence through immune memory effects. These findings suggest that the co-delivery of aPD-L1 and APCP using CaP nanoparticles is a promising approach for improving melanoma immunotherapy, achieving enhanced efficacy and reduced toxicity.},

The unique structure and composition lead to a range of intriguing and tunable characteristics. Herein, the fabrication of high-entropy MXene TiVNbMoC 3 T x (T = surface terminations) with a layer of polydopamine is reported, followed by immobilization of a phthalocyanine-based fluorophore for imaging and the peptide sequence QRHKPREGGGSC for targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpressed in cancer cells. The resulting nanocomposite exhibits high biocompatibility and superior photothermal property. Upon laser irradiation at 808 nm, the light-to-heat conversion efficiency is up to 56.1%, which is significantly higher than that of conventional 2D materials. In vitro studies show that these nanosheets could be internalized selectively into EGFR-positive cancer cells and effectively eliminate these cells mainly through photothermal-induced apoptosis. Using 4T1 tumor-bearing mice as an animal model, the nanosheets could accumulate at the tumor and effectively eradicate the tumor upon laser irradiation without causing noticeable adverse effects to the mice.},

  abstract     = {Oxidative stress is believed to play critical pathophysiological roles in ischemic brain injury, and the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway is recognized as the most crucial endogenous antioxidant stress damage route. Some research have demonstrated that Nrf2 play critical roles in oxidative stress after ischemic stroke, but the underlying mechanism are not fully elucidated. This study reveals that Nrf2 is modified by SUMOylation and identifies Sentrin/SUMO-specific protease 6 (SENP6) as a negative regulator of Nrf2 SUMOylation. Notably, SENP6 binds to and mediates the deSUMOylation of Nrf2, which in turn inhibits antioxidant response by enhancing ubiquitination-dependent degradation of Nrf2, thereby reducing its transcriptional activity, inducing oxidative stress and aggravating neuronal apoptosis after ischemic stroke. Additionally, blocking the interaction between SENP6 and Nrf2 with a cell membrane-permeable peptide (Tat-Nrf2) preserves the SUMOylation of Nrf2, effectively attenuates oxidative stress, and rescues neurological functions in mice subjected to ischemic stroke. Furthermore, no toxicity is observed when high doses Tat-Nrf2 are injected into nonischemic mice. Collectively, this study uncovers a previously unidentified mechanism whereby SUMOylation of Nrf2 regulates oxidative stress and strongly indicates that interventions targeting SENP6 or its interaction with Nrf2 may provide therapeutic benefits for ischemic stroke.},

  abstract     = {Rapid thrombolysis is very important to reduce complications caused by vascular blockage. A promising approach for improving thrombolysis efficiency is utilizing the permanent magnetically actuated locomotion of nanorobots. However, the thrombolytic drug transportation efficiency is challenged by in-plane rotating locomotion and the insufficient drug penetration limits further improvement of thrombolysis. Inspired by ciliary movement for cargo transportation in human body, in this study, cilia-mimic locomotion of magnetic colloidal collectives is realized under torque-force vortex magnetic field (TFV-MF) by a designed rotating permanent magnet assembly. This cilia-mimic locomotion mode can generate more disturbances to the fluids to improve thrombolytic drug transportation and the increased height and area of colloidal collectives boosted the imaging capability. In addition, low-intensity ultrasound is applied to enhance colloids infiltration by producing the fiber breakage and inducing erythrocyte deformation. In vitro thrombolytic experiments demonstrate that the thrombolysis efficiency increased by 16.2 times compared with that of pure tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) treatments. Furthermore, in vivo rat models of femoral vein thrombosis confirmed that this approach can achieve blood flow recanalization more quickly. The proposed cilia-mimic locomotion of magnetic colloidal collectives combined with low-intensity ultrasound irradiation mode provides a new insight of therapeutic interventions for vascular thrombus by enhancing drug penetration.},

Here, a multidimensional proteomic landscape of BrMs and gliomas to infer tumor-specific molecular pathophysiology at both tissue and plasma levels is presented. Tissue sample analysis reveals both shared and distinct characteristics of brain tumors, highlighting significant disparities between BrMs and gliomas with differentially activated upstream pathways of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway that have been scarcely discussed previously. Novel proteins and phosphosites such as NSUN2, TM9SF3, and PRKCG_S330 are also detected, exhibiting a high correlation with reported clinical traits, which may serve as potential immunohistochemistry (IHC) biomarkers. Moreover, tumor-specific altered phosphosites and glycosites on FN1 are highlighted as potential therapeutic targets. Further validation of 110 potential noninvasive biomarkers yields three biomarker panels comprising a total of 19 biomarkers (including DES, VWF, and COL1A1) for accurate discrimination of two types of brain tumors and normal controls. In summary, this is a full-scale dataset of two typical human brain tumors, which serves as a valuable resource for advancing precision medicine in cancer patients through targeted therapy and immunotherapy.},

  abstract     = {Gouty arthritis is characterized by an acute inflammatory response triggered by monosodium urate (MSU) crystals deposited in the joints and periarticular tissues. Current treatments bring little effects owing to serious side effects, necessitating the exploration of new and safer therapeutic options. Macrophages play a critical role in the initiation, progression, and resolution of acute gout, with the cellular profiles closely linked to their activation and polarization. This suggests that metabolic regulation can be of significance in managing gouty inflammation. In this study, it is demonstrated that melatonin, a natural hormone, modulates the metabolic remodeling of inflammatory macrophages by shifting their metabolism from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation, further altering functions of the pathogenic macrophage. To improve melatonin delivery to the inflamed sites, macrophage membrane-coated melatonin-loaded liposomes (MLT-MLP) are developed. Benefiting from the inflammation-homing characteristic of macrophage membrane, such engineered liposomes effectively target the inflamed site and demonstrate potent anti-inflammatory effects, achieving an enhanced amelioration of acute gouty arthritis. In conclusion, this study proposes a novel strategy aimed at metabolic reprogramming of macrophages to attenuate the pathological injuries in acute gout, providing a potential therapeutic strategy of gout-associated diseases, especially gouty arthritis.},

In this study, ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations combined with experiments are used to investigate the structural evolution of rGO upon thermal annealing, with or without the presence of single-layer graphene (SLG). It is found that the SLG promotes the repair of the carbon honeycombed matrix and alleviates the release of carbon-containing groups during graphitization. Further electronic analysis reveals the crucial role of charge transfer from SLG to defective graphene in strengthening the C─C bonds. The result of Raman spectroscopy matches with the simulation, demonstrating an improved repairing degree of rGO upon contacting with SLG.

Despite new developments in nanotechnology in the treatment of PD, in-depth exploration of their biological effects, in particular, the specific mechanisms of inflammation inhibition are lacking. Herein, using the stable cascade catalysis channel formed by polydopamine (PDA), imidazole groups, and Cu ions, a microgel system comprising functional monomers [superoxide dismutase (SOD) with double bonds, PDA, 2-methacryloyloxy ethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC), and Cu ions] is proposed for managing PD. The microgel can be efficiently delivered to the brain aided by MPC, after which a multi-level regulatory strategy targeting neurons and microglia can be initiated. The catalytic activity cascade elicited by SOD and Cu ions can regulate the anti-inflammatory phenotypic transformation of microglia by relieving oxidative stress. Meanwhile, the dopamine (DA) released from PDA can facilitate DA storage and neurogenesis, inhibiting CX3CL1 release and the CX3CR1 receptor on microglia and further regulating the CX3CL1/CX3CR1-NF-κB-NLRP3 signaling pathway in microglia to inhibit neuroinflammation. Therefore, the proposed microgel delivery system with functional monomers represents a promising therapeutic strategy for managing neuroinflammation and promoting neurogenesis in PD by intervening chemokine axis-mediated communication between neurons and microglia.},

Here, leveraging the superior carrying capacity and innate immunity-stimulating property of living bacteria, a nanomedicine-engineered bacterium, LR-S-CD/CpG@LNP, with optical responsiveness, immune-stimulating activity, and the ability to regulate microbiota metabolome is developed. Immunoadjuvant (CpG) and carbon dot (CD) co-loaded plant lipid nanoparticles (CD/CpG@LNPs) are constructed and conjugated to the surface of Limosilactobacillus reuteri (LR) via reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive linkers. The inherent photothermal and photodynamic properties of oral CD/CpG@LNPs induce in situ cytotoxic ROS generation and immunogenic cell death of colorectal tumor cells. The generated neoantigens and the released CpG function as a potent in situ vaccine that stimulates the maturation of immature dendritic cells. The mature dendritic cells and metabolites secreted by LR subsequently facilitated the tumor infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eradicate colorectal tumors. The further in vivo results demonstrate that the photo-immunotherapy and intestinal microbial metabolite regulation of LR-S-CD/CpG@LNPs collectively suppressed the growth of orthotopic colorectal tumors and their liver metastases, presenting a promising avenue for synergistic treatment of CRC via the oral route.},

  abstract     = {Paclitaxel (PTX) is a first-line chemotherapeutic drug for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) but it can induce indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) activation, which severely lowers down its immuno-chemotherapeutic effect. To address this issue, a smart peptide hydrogelator Nap–Phe–Phe–Phe–Lys–Ser–Thr–Gly–Gly–Lys–Ala–Pro–Arg–OH ( Nap-T ), which co-assembles with PTX and an IDO inhibitor GDC0919 to form a hydrogel GP@Gel Nap-T, is rationally designed. Upon specific phosphorylation by pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), an overexpressed biomarker of NSCLC, Nap-T is gradually converted to Nap–Phe–Phe–Phe–Lys–Ser–Thr(H 2 PO 3 )–Gly–Gly–Lys–Ala–Pro–Arg–OH ( Nap-Tp ), leading to dehydrogelation and sustained release of PTX and GDC0919 within NSCLC tissues. The released PTX exerts chemotherapy on NSCLC cells as well as immunogenic cell death induction, while GDC0919 promotes the immuno-chemotherapeutic effect of PTX through IDO inhibition. We find that GP@Gel Nap-T enhances the infiltration of tumor-infiltrating immune cells and reduces the number of immunosuppressive cells in either tumor tissues or tumor-draining lymph nodes, thus enhancing the immuno-chemotherapy of PTX toward NSCLC. With this PKM2-responsive drug release strategy, the smart peptide hydrogel platform might be applied for NSCLC treatment in clinic in near future.},

Molecular dynamics simulations corroborate enhanced Li + diffusion with Br − introduction into Li 3 HoCl 6 .

Carbon-based substrates can release from microplastics and contribute to terrestrial carbon pools, but how these emerging organic compounds influence carbon mineralization and sequestration remains unknown. Here, microcosm experiments are conducted to determine the bioavailability of microplastic-derived dissolved organic matter (MP-DOM) in soils and its contribution to mineral-associated carbon pool. The underlying mechanisms are identified by estimating its spectroscopic and molecular signatures and comparing its sorption properties on model minerals with natural organic matter (NOM). The results show that MP-DOM leads to 21–576% higher CO 2 emissions and 34–83% lower mineral-associated organic carbon in soils than NOM, depending on the type of plastic polymer. DOM from biodegradable microplastics induces higher CO 2 emissions than conventional microplastics. It is found that MP-DOM is 7.96 times more labile than NOM, making it more accessible for microbial utilization. The lower degree of humification, fewer polar functional groups, and higher H/C ratios in MP-DOM also led to 3.96 times less sorption with mineral particles. The findings provide insights into the effects of microplastics on soil carbon storage and highlight their consequences for wider terrestrial carbon cycling and climate warming.},

  abstract     = {Radiodynamic therapy that employs X-rays to trigger localized reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation can tackle the tissue penetration issue of phototherapy. Although calcium tungstate (CaWO 4 ) shows great potential as a radiodynamic agent benefiting from its strong X-ray absorption and the ability to generate electron–hole (e − -h + ) pairs, slow charge carrier transfer and fast e − -h + recombination greatly limit its ROS-generating performance. Herein, via a one-pot wet-chemical method, oxygen vacancy-rich amorphous/crystalline heterophase CaWO 4 nanoparticles (Ov-a/c-CaWO 4 NPs) with enhanced radiodynamic effect are synthesized for radiodynamic-immunotherapy of cancer. The phase composition and oxygen vacancy content of CaWO 4 can be easily tuned by adjusting the solvothermal temperature. More intriguingly, the amorphous/crystalline interfaces and abundant oxygen vacancies accelerate charge carrier transfer and suppress e − -h + recombination, respectively, enabling synergistically improved ROS production from X-ray-irradiated Ov-a/c-CaWO 4 NPs. In addition to directly inducing oxidative damage of cancer cells, radiodynamic generation of ROS also boosts immunogenic cell death to provoke a systemic antitumor immune response, thereby allowing the inhibition of both primary and distant tumors as well as cancer metastasis. This study establishes a synergistic enhancement strategy involving the integration of phase and defect engineering to improve the ROS generation capacity of radiodynamic-immunotherapeutic anticancer nanoagents.},

  abstract     = {Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a leading cause of Periprosthetic  joint  infection (PJI), a severe complication after joint arthroplasty. Immunosuppression is a major factor contributing to the infection chronicity of S. aureus PJI, posing significant treatment challenges. This study investigates the relationship between the immunosuppressive biofilm milieu and S. aureus PJI outcomes in both discovery and validation cohorts. This scRNA-seq analysis of synovium from PJI patients reveals an expansion and heightened activity of monocyte-related myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs) and regulatory T cells (Treg). Importantly, CXCL16 is significantly upregulated in M-MDSCs, with its corresponding CXCR6 receptor also elevated on Treg. M-MDSCs recruit Treg and enhance its activity via CXCL16-CXCR6 interactions, while Treg secretes TGF-β, inducing M-MDSCs proliferation and immunosuppressive activity. Interfering with this cross-talk in vivo using Treg-specific CXCR6 knockout PJI mouse model reduces M-MDSCs/Treg-mediated immunosuppression and alleviates bacterial burden. Immunohistochemistry and recurrence analysis show that PJI patients with CXCR6 high synovium have poor prognosis. This findings highlight the critical role of CXCR6 in Treg in orchestrating an immunosuppressive microenvironment and biofilm persistence during PJI, offering potential targets for therapeutic intervention.},

  abstract     = {There is an urgent necessity to devise efficient tactics to tackle the inevitable development of resistance to osimertinib, which is a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor used in treating EGFR-mutant nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study demonstrates that combining itraconazole with osimertinib synergistically reduces the proliferation and migration, enhances the apoptosis of osimertinib-resistant cells, and effectively inhibits the growth of osimertinib-resistant tumors. Mechanistically, itraconazole combined with osimertinib promotes the proteasomal degradation of sonic hedgehog (SHH), resulting in inactivation of the SHH/Dual-specificity phosphatase 13B (DUSP13B)/p-STAT3 and Hedgehog pathways, suppressing Myc proto-oncogene protein (c-Myc). Additionally, DUSP13B interacts with signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and modulates its phosphorylation. Interestingly, it is observed that SHH overexpression partially rescues the synergistic effects of this combination treatment strategy through the SHH/DUSP13B/p-STAT3 signaling axis. Moreover, it is found that SHH, (GLI1), p-STAT3, and DUSP13B play significant predictive roles in osimertinib resistance. In lung adenocarcinoma, p-STAT3 is positively correlated with SHH but negatively correlated with DUSP13B. Together, these results highlight the crucial role of itraconazole in reversing the acquired resistance to osimertinib and provide a scientific rationale for the therapeutic strategy of combining osimertinib with itraconazole.},

Accordingly, this study identified a positive association between FAP levels and periodontitis susceptibility using Mendelian randomization analysis. Human and mouse periodontitis tissues show elevated FAP and reduced osteolectin (OLN), an endogenous FAP inhibitor, indicating a FAP/OLN imbalance. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed gingival fibroblasts (GFs) as the primary FAP and OLN source, with periodontitis-associated GFs showing increased reactive oxygen species, cellular senescence, and mTOR pathway activation. Rapamycin treatment restored the FAP/OLN balance in GFs. Recombinant FAP increased pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and osteoclast differentiation in macrophages, exacerbating periodontal damage, whereas FAP inhibition reduced macrophage inflammation, collagen degradation, and bone resorption in experimental periodontitis. Therefore, senescent fibroblasts drive the FAP/OLN imbalance through mTOR activation, contributing to periodontitis progression. Consequently, targeting FAP may offer a promising therapeutic strategy for periodontitis.},

The catalytic cores of telomerase involve a reverse transcriptase and the human telomerase RNA (hTR). However, current detection of telomerase is largely limited to its activity at the tissue and single-cell levels. To reveal the precise distribution of subcellular hTR and telomerase activity, here a modular engineered DNA nanodevice (DNA-ND) is designed capable of imaging hTR and telomerase activity in cytoplasm and nucleus, enabling colocalization analysis. DNA-ND is a modular DNA complex comprising hTR and telomerase activity detection modules, which respectively sense intercellular hTR and telomerase activity via target-sensitive allosteric transition of DNA switches, actuating orthogonal activation of fluorescence signals to achieve in situ co-imaging of hTR and telomerase activity. By integrating DNA-ND with specific localized signals, the DNA-ND based precise profiling of colocalization of hTR and telomerase activity in different cell lines as well as their dynamic changes during pharmacological interventions is demonstrated. Notably, the results suggest that the locations of hTR and telomerase activity are not exactly overlapped, indicating the influence of intracellular environment on the binding of hTR to telomerase.},

  abstract     = {The anti-tumor efficacy of current pharmacotherapy is severely hampered due to the adaptive evolution of tumors, urgently needing effective therapeutic strategies capable of breaking such adaptability. Metabolic reprogramming, as an adaptive survival mechanism, is closely related to therapy resistance of tumors. Colorectal cancer (CRC) cells exhibit a high energy dependency that is sustained by an adaptive metabolic conversion between glucose and glutamine, helping tumor cells to withstand nutrient-deficient microenvironments and various treatments. We discover that transition metal vanadium (V) effectively inhibits glucose metabolism in CRC and synergizes with glutaminase inhibitors (BPTES) to disrupt CRC&#39;s energy dependency. Thus, a dual energy metabolism suppression nanosystem (VSi-BP@HA) is engineered by loading BPTES into V-doped hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles. This nanosystem effectively dampens CRC energy metabolism, eradicating 33% of tumors in mice. Strikingly, the cell biological and preclinical model datasets provide compelling evidence showing that VSi-BP@HA not only reverses CRC cells chemo-resistance but also drastically potentiates anti-PD1 immunotherapy. Therefore, this nanosystem provides not only a promising approach to suppress CRC, but also a potential adjunct tool for enhancing chemotherapy and immunotherapy.},

Nonetheless, how to further improve the therapeutic effectiveness of SCOPAs remains a challenging research area. This review delves deeply into strategies to improve the performance of PDT or PTT by optimizing the structural design of SCOPAs. These strategies encompass augmenting reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, mitigating oxygen dependence, elevating light absorption capacity, broadening the absorption region, and enhancing the photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE). Additionally, this review also underscores the ideal strategies for developing SCOPAs with balanced PDT and PTT. Furthermore, the potential synergies are highlighted between PDT and PTT with other treatment modalities such as ferroptosis, gas therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy.

Super enhancers (SEs) are crucial for determining tumor cell survival under drug pressure. SE landscapes related to 5-FU-resistance are mapped to GC using chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-Seq). SiRNA transcription factors (TFs) screen determines master TF Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 3 Group C Member 1 (NR3C1) activated by SE. High NR3C1 expression driven by SE correlated with 5-FU resistance in patient-derived organoids (PDOs). Phase separation formed by NR3C1 is observed using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). NR3C1 protein and Mediator promoted SE-related gene transcription via phase separation. SEs and NR3C1 co-binding patterns are explored using Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation (CUT&amp;Tag) sequencing. 5-FU-related genes driven by NR3C1 are identified using epigenetic reader inhibitor JQ1 and NR3C1 specific inhibitor Cort108297. NR3C1 knockdown increases 5-FU sensitivity and alters the SE landscape through enhancer reprogramming, reducing downstream 5-FU-related target genes. JQ1 and Cort108297 both improve 5-FU efficacy in PDOs and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) by destroying SEs or inhibiting NR3C1. In conclusion, SE-driven NR3C1 promotes 5-FU resistance in GC. SE destruction and NR3C1 inhibition lead to enhancer reconstruction and reduce 5-FU-related gene transcription, providing alternative therapeutic strategies for improving 5-FU sensitivity.},

Its pathogenesis involves an imbalance between connective tissue repair and degradation. CD34 + cells comprise a heterogeneous population that exhibits stem cell and progenitor cell properties. However, the role of CD34 + cells in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) remains unclear. In this study, downregulated CD34 expression is observed in aneurysmal aortas from both patients and mouse models compared to that in non-dilated aortas. Furthermore, by combining Cd34 -CreER T2 ;Rosa26-tdTomato;( Apoe −/− ) lineage tracing, bone marrow transplantation, and single-cell sequencing, it is found that during AAA development, non-bone marrow CD34 + cells are activated to transdifferentiate into Periostin + myofibroblasts, thereby contributing to the formation of fibrotic collars. Dual recombinase-based lineage tracing confirms the presence and involvement of CD34 + /Periostin + myofibroblasts in fibrotic collar formation during AAA development. Functionally, selective depletion of systemic or non-bone marrow CD34 + cells, as well as CD34 + /Periostin + myofibroblasts, by diphtheria toxin significantly exacerbates AAA progression and increases disease mortality. Mechanistically, it is identified that the PDGF-PDGFRb-PI3K axis is indispensable for Periostin + myofibroblast generation from non-bone marrow CD34 + cells in AAA, offering a new therapeutic target for patients with AAA at a high risk of rupture.},

Thus far, the formation and roles of these chromatin structures in plants remain poorly understood. This study integrates Hi-C data from diverse plant species, demonstrating that nuclear DNA content influences large-scale chromosome conformation and affects the finer details of compartmental patterns. These contrasting compartmental patterns are distinguished by gene-to-gene loops and validated through cytological observations. Additionally, a novel chromatin domain type associated with tandem duplicate gene clusters is identified. These domains are independent of H3K27me3-mediated chromatin compartmentalization and exhibit evolutionary conservation across species. Gene pairs within TAD-like domains are younger and show higher levels of coexpression. These domains potentially promote the formation of tandem duplicates, a property appears unique to the Actinidia family. Overall, this study reveals functional chromatin domains in plants and provides evidence for the role of three-dimensional chromatin architecture in gene regulation and genome evolution.},

  abstract     = {Disulfidptosis is a newly discovered type of regulated cell death triggered by disulfide bond accumulation and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) depletion due to glucose deprivation. However, the regulatory mechanisms involving additional cellular circuits remain unclear. Excessive disulfide bond accumulation can impair endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis and activate the ER stress response. In this study, we found that SLC7A11-mediated disulfidptosis upon glucose deprivation is accompanied by ER stress induction. Pharmacological inhibition of SLC7A11-mediated cystine uptake or cystine withdrawal not only blocks disulfidptosis under glucose starvation but also suppresses the ER stress response, indicating a close link between these processes. Moreover, inhibitors targeting the ER stress response promote disulfidptosis, while ER stress inducers suppress glucose starvation-induced disulfidptosis in SLC7A11-high-expressing cells, suggesting a protective role for ER stress during disulfidptosis. Similar effects are observed in cells treated with glucose transporter inhibitors (GLUTi). Finally, combined treatment with ER stress inhibitors and GLUTi significantly suppresses tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo by inducing disulfide stress and subsequent disulfidptosis. In summary, these findings reveal a novel role for ER stress in regulating disulfidptosis and provide theoretical insights into the potential application of GLUTi and ER stress inhibitors in cancer therapy.},

  abstract     = {Isoniazid and rifampicin co-therapy are the main causes of anti-tuberculosis drug-induced liver injury (ATB-DILI) and acute liver failure, seriously threatening human health. However, its pathophysiology is not fully elucidated. Growing evidences have shown that fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) play a critical role in diverse aspects of liver pathophysiology. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of FGFs in the pathogenesis of isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RIF)-induced liver injury. Through systematic screening, this study finds that hepatic FGF1 expression is significantly downregulated in both mouse model and human patients challenged with INH and RIF. Hepatocyte-specific Fgf1 deficiency exacerbates INH and RIF-induced liver injury resulted from elevated bile acids (BAs) synthases and aberrant BAs accumulation. Conversely, pharmacological administration of the non-mitogenic FGF1 analog – FGF1 ΔHBS significantly alleviated INH and RIF-induced liver injury via restoring BAs homeostasis. Mechanically, FGF1 repressed hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 α ( Hnf4α ) transcription via activating FGF receptor 4 (FGFR4)-ERK1/2 signaling pathway, thus reducing BAs synthase. The findings demonstrate hepatic FGF1 functions as a negative regulator of BAs biosynthesis to protect against INH and RIF-induced liver injury via normalizing hepatic BAs homeostasis, providing novel mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of ATB-DILI and potential therapeutic strategies for treatment of ATB-DILI.},

  abstract     = {Nanostructured Pt-based catalysts have attracted considerable attention for fuel-cell applications. This study introduces a novel one-pot and low-temperature polyol approach for synthesizing support-free, connected nanoparticles with non-Pt metal cores and Pt shells. Unlike conventional heat treatment methods, the developed support-free and Fe-free connected Pd core @Pt shell (Pd@Pt) nanoparticle catalyst possesses a stable nanonetwork structure with a high surface area. This approach can precisely control the atomic-level structure of the Pt shell on the Pd core at a low deposition temperature. The optimized Pd@Pt catalyst with a Pt/Pd atomic ratio of 0.8 and a Pt shell thickness of 1.1 nm exhibits a threefold improvement in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) mass activity compared to that of commercial carbon-supported Pt nanoparticle catalyst (Pt/C). Durability evaluation demonstrated 100% retention of specific activity after 10,000 load cycles, owing to the stable nanonetwork and uniform coverage of the Pt shell. In addition, the support-free, connected core–shell nanoparticle catalyst overcomes the carbon corrosion issues commonly associated with conventional carbon-supported catalysts while simultaneously improving both ORR activity and load cycle durability. These findings highlight the potential of this innovative approach to develop support-free catalysts for polymer electrolyte fuel cells and other energy devices.},

In this study, genes of E3 ligases are screened based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. Through cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF), flow cytometry, and further experiments, Deltex E3 ubiquitin ligase 2 (DTX2) in HCC cells is identified to promote the infiltration and polarization of tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) with a protumor phenotype, thus attenuating the infiltration and cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells partially through C-X-C motif chemokine 2 (CXCL2) and C-X-C motif chemokine 6 (CXCL6). Mechanistically, DTX2 can interact with histone H2B and promote its monoubiquitination at lysine120 (H2BK120ub1), thereby increasing CXCL2 and CXCL6 transcription through histone epigenetic regulation. Different tumor models in vivo demonstrated that DTX2 inhibitor treatment inhibited tumor growth and sensitized HCC cells to the therapeutic effects of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibody. In summary, this study identifies DTX2 as a potential target for HCC immunotherapy.},

  abstract     = {Radiation therapy (RT) is one of the core therapies for current cancer management. However, the emergence of radioresistance has become a major cause of radiotherapy failure and disease progression. Therefore, overcoming radioresistance to achieve highly effective treatment for refractory tumors is significant yet challenging. Here, pH-responsive DSPE-PEoz modified hollow Bi 2 Se 3 -RSL3/diABZi (DP-HBN/RA) nanomedicine is designed as a radiation sensitizer for efficient treatment of triple-negative breast cancer by simultaneously amplifying ferroptosis and immune system activation. DP-HBN/RA can efficiently concentrate X-ray radiation energy inside the tumor, thereby promoting precise ionizing radiation exposure in tumor cells to produce large amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to lipid peroxidation-induced ferroptosis. Meanwhile, ferroptotic cell death is intensified through the inactivation of GPX4 by RSL3 released from DP-HBN/RA to acidic conditions in the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, DP-HBN/RA enhances RT efficacy to exacerbate unrepairable DNA damage and release DNA fragments that activate the cGAS-STING signal pathway, evoking a systematic immune response. Ingeniously, the released diABZi reinforces cGAS-STING activation to boost the immunology antitumor effect. This work links the induction of ferroptosis and the initiation of systematic immune response to achieve highly effective tumor suppression, which opens up new avenues for future treatments of refractory tumors.},

  abstract     = {Silicosis is a fatal occupational pulmonary disease that is characterized by irreversible replacement of lung parenchyma by aberrant Exracellular matrix (ECM). Metabolic reprogramming is a crucial mechanism for fibrosis. However, how the metabolic rewiring shifts the ECM homeostasis toward overaccumulation remains unclear. Herein, a phenotype with reduction in fatty acid oxidation (FAO) but enhanced glycolysis in myofibroblasts is shown. Perturbation of the glycolytic and FAO pathways, respectively, reveals distinct roles in the metabolic distribution of ECM deposition and degradation. Suppressed glycolysis leads to a decrease in insoluble ECM, primarily due to the inhibition of ECM-modifying enzyme activity and a decrease in glycine synthesis. Notably, promoted FAO facilitates the intracellular degradation pathway of ECM. In addition, the findings revealed that hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) serves as a crucial metabolic regulator in the transition from FAO to glycolysis, thereby playing a significant role in ECM deposition in silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Further, the promotion of FAO, inhibition of glycolysis and HIF-1α reduce ECM production and promote ECM degradation, ultimately impeding the progression of fibrosis and providing therapeutic relief for established pulmonary fibrosis in vivo. These findings unveil the metabolic rewire underpinning the deposition of ECM in silica-induced lung fibrosis and identify novel targets for promoting regression of pulmonary fibrosis.},

  abstract     = {Circulating lactate is a critical biomarker for sepsis-induced acute lung injury (S-ALI) and is strongly associated with poor prognosis. However, whether elevated lactate directly promotes S-ALI and the specific mechanism involved remain unclear. Here, this work shows that lactate causes pulmonary endothelial glycocalyx degradation and worsens ALI during sepsis. Mechanistically, lactate increases the lactylation of K18 of histone H3, which is enriched at the promoter of EGR1 and promotes its transcription, leading to upregulation of heparanase in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells. In addition, multiple lactylation sites are identified in EGR1, and lactylation is confirmed to occur mainly at K364. K364 lactylation of EGR1 facilitates its interaction with importin-α, in turn promoting its nuclear localization. Importantly, this work identifies KAT2B as a novel lactyltransferase whose GNAT domain directly mediates the lactylation of EGR1 during S-ALI. In vivo, suppression of lactate production or genetic knockout of EGR1 mitigated glycocalyx degradation and ALI and improved survival outcomes in mice with polymicrobial sepsis. Therefore, this study reveals that the crosstalk between metabolic reprogramming in endothelial cells and epigenetic modifications plays a critical role in the pathological processes of S-ALI.},

However, traditional dPCR detection methods, such as those involving flow cytometry and fluorescence imaging, may face challenges due to high costs, complexity, limited accuracy, and slow processing speeds. In this study, SAM-dPCR is introduced, a training-free open-source bioanalysis paradigm that offers swift and precise absolute quantification of biological samples. SAM-dPCR leverages the robustness of the zero-shot Segment Anything Model (SAM) to achieve rapid processing times (&lt;4 seconds) with an accuracy exceeding 97.10%. This method has been extensively validated across diverse samples and reactor morphologies, demonstrating its broad applicability. Utilizing standard laboratory fluorescence microscopes, SAM-dPCR can measure nucleic acid template concentrations ranging from 0.154 copies µL −1 to 1.295 × 10 3 copies µL −1 for droplet dPCR and 0.160 × 10 3 to 3.629 × 10 3 copies µL −1 for microwell dPCR. Experimental validation shows a strong linear relationship (r 2 &gt; 0.96) between expected and determined sample concentrations. SAM-dPCR offers high accuracy, accessibility, and the ability to address bioanalytical needs in resource-limited settings, as it does not rely on hand-crafted “ground truth” data.},

Recent studies emphasize the importance of E3 ligases in regulating the degradation of α-Syn. However, the molecular mechanisms by which deubiquitinases regulate α-Syn degradation are scarcely studied. In this study, it is found that the protein levels of α-Syn are negatively regulated by ovarian tumor protease deubiquitinase 5 (OTUD5) which protects dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the PD model. Mechanistically, OTUD5 promotes K63-linked polyubiquitination of α-Syn independent of its deubiquitinating enzyme activity and mediates its endolysosomal degradation by recruiting the E3 ligase neural precursor cell expressed developmentally downregulated 4 (NEDD4). Furthermore, OTUD5 conditional knockout in DA neurons results in more severe α-Syn related pathology and dyskinesia after injection of α-Syn preformed fibrils (PFF). Overall, the data unveil a novel mechanism to regulate the degradation of α-Syn and provide a new therapeutic strategy to alleviate DA neurodegeneration.},

Laser tissue soldering has potential in overcoming these issues, offering atraumatic seamless tissue fusion. To ensure the precision and safety of laser tissue soldering, the study introduces feedback-controlled fluorescent nanothermometry-guided laser tissue soldering using nanoparticle-protein solders within endoscopic and robotic contexts. Temperature-sensitive fluorescent nanoparticles embedded in the solder provide surgeons with immediate feedback on tissue temperatures during laser application, all while within the confines of minimally invasive (robotic) surgical setups.

  abstract     = {The resistance of tumors to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) may be intricately linked to cellular senescence, although definitive clinical validation remains elusive. In this study, comprehensive pan-cancer scRNA-seq analyses identify fibroblasts as exhibiting the most pronounced levels of cellular senescence among tumor-associated cell populations. To elucidate this phenomenon, a fibroblast senescence-associated transcriptomic signature (FSS), which correlated strongly with protumorigenic signaling pathways and immune dysregulation that fosters tumor progression, is developed. Leveraging the FSS, the machine learning (ML) framework demonstrates exceptional accuracy in predicting ICI response and survival outcomes, achieving superior area under curve (AUC) values across validation, testing, and in-house cohorts. Strikingly, FSS consistently outperforms established signatures in predictive robustness across diverse cancer subtypes. From an integrative analysis of 17 CRISPR/Cas9 libraries, CDC6 emerges as a pivotal biomarker for pan-cancer ICI response and prognostic stratification. Mechanistically, experimental evidence reveals that CDC6 in tumor cells orchestrates fibroblast senescence via TGF-β1 secretion and oxidative stress, subsequently reprogramming the tumor microenvironment and modulating ICI response. These findings underscore the translational potential of targeting fibroblast senescence as a novel therapeutic strategy to mitigate immune resistance and enhance antitumor efficacy.},

Here, a bioinspired delivery system equipped with combination therapy and paracellular transport is shown to enhance the efficacy against bacterial infections by improving oral delivery. A screening platform is established using an in vitro-induced high polymyxin-resistant strain to acquire plumbagin, which enhances the efficacy of polymyxin. Functionalized milk extracellular vesicles (FMEVs) coloaded with polymyxin and plumbagin cleared 99% of the bacteria within 4 h. Mechanistic studies revealed that the drug combination damaged the membrane, disrupted energy metabolism, and accelerated bacterial death. Finally, FMEVs are efficiently transported transcellularly through the citric acid-mediated reversible opening of the tight junctions and showed high efficacy against an MDR Escherichia coli -associated peritonitis–sepsis model in mice. These findings provide a potential therapeutic strategy to improve the efficacy of combination therapy by enhancing oral delivery using a biomimetic delivery platform.},

  abstract     = {Therapeutic proteins, the fastest growing class of pharmaceuticals, are subject to rapid proteolytic degradation in vivo, rendering them inactive. Sophisticated drug delivery systems that maintain protein stability, prolong therapeutic effects, and reduce administration frequency are urgently required. Herein, a mechanoresponsive hydrogel is developed contained within a soft robotic drug delivery (SRDD) device. In a step-change from previously reported systems, pneumatic actuation of this system releases the cationic therapeutic protein Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) in a bioactive form which is required for therapeutic angiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessels, in numerous clinical conditions. The ability of the SRDD device to release bioactive VEGF in a spatiotemporal manner from the hydrogel is tested in diabetic rats – a model in which angiogenesis is difficult to stimulate. Daily actuation of the SRDD device in the diabetic rat model significantly increased cluster of differentiation 31+ (CD31+) blood vessel number (p = 0.0335) and the diameter of alpha-smooth muscle actin+ (α-SMA+) blood vessels (p = 0.0025) compared to passive release of VEGF from non-actuated devices. The SRDD device combined with the mechanoresponsive hydrogel offers the potential to deliver an array of bioactive therapeutics in a spatiotemporal manner to mimic their natural release in vivo.},

  abstract     = {Developing novel cold-adapted nanozymes and elucidating their mechanisms of action remains a great challenge. Inspired by natural oxidases that utilize high-spin and high-valent metal-oxygen intermediates to achieve high efficiency at low temperatures, in this study, a series of MnO x nanomaterials with varied valence and spin states are synthesized. The activity assay revealed that the oxygen vacancy-engineered ε -MnO 2 nanozyme displayed excellent cold-adapted oxidase-like properties, and no observable activity loss is observed in the temperature range of −20 to 45 °C. The superior performance is attributed to the high-spin Mn(III)–O species coupled with its induced Jahn–Teller effect, which facilitates the dissociation and activation of oxygen at low temperatures. As a proof of concept, an excellent cold-adapted δ -MnO 2 nanozyme can be obtained using Mn 3 O 4 as the precursor by regulating the spin state of Mn(III). Moreover, a novel and effective degradation strategy for corn stalk at low temperature is built based on the robust cold-adapted oxidase-like activity of ε -MnO 2 . These results not only provide new insights for the rational design of cold-adapted nanozymes but also broaden the application of nanozymes in low-temperature industrial processes.},

  abstract     = {The important role of PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) in tumors has garnered increasing attention. However, research on their role in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains limited. Elevated levels of piRNA-137463 have been linked to poor prognosis in LUAD patients. Inhibition of piRNA-137463 curbed the proliferation, migration, and invasion of LUAD cells, enhanced T cell cytotoxicity through increased IFN-γ secretion, disrupted cholesterol metabolism, and reduced intracellular cholesterol, lipid raft content, and PD-L1 expression in LUAD cells. Bioinformatic prediction identified a potential interaction between piRNA-137463 and lncRNA LOC100128494. Inhibiting piRNA-137463 increased the stability and expression of LOC100128494, which further modulated insulin-induced gene 1 protein (INSIG1) levels via a competitive endogenous RNA network involving LOC100128494 and miR-24-3p. Notably, the effect of piRNA-137463 in LUAD cells is dependent on the expression of LOC100128494 and INSIG1. Inhibiting the expression of piRNA-137463 with AntagopiRNA-137463 suppressed tumor growth and metastasis via LOC100128494 in nude mice and enhanced the response of LUAD to anti-PD-1 therapy in immune-competent mice. In summary, this study elucidates the role of piRNA-137463 in the reprogramming of cholesterol metabolism, which drives the progression of LUAD, thereby identifying a new target for the comprehensive clinical management of LUAD.},

  abstract     = {The functional and pharmacological significance of dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) in psychiatric and neurological disorders is well elucidated. However, the roles of DRD4 in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain unclear. This study observes a significant upregulation of DRD4 expression in clinical samples, which is negatively correlated with patient prognosis. In vitro, overexpression of DRD4 causes a constitutive activation of β-Arrestin2/PP2A/AKT independent of dopamine. Interestingly, this classical signaling pathway is not associated with the phenotype of DRD4-promoted migration and invasion in CRC cells. Instead, DRD4 interacts with transforming growth factor beta receptors (TGFBR1 and TGFBR2) to activate Smad2 phosphorylation and promote Smad2/Smad4 complex nucleus translocation. Then, SNAI1 and JAG1 are transcriptionally activated to induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition and enhance the metastatic potential of CRC. Notably, the COOH-terminal domain is identified as the key intracellular region for the pro-metastatic roles of DRD4. Furthermore, treatment with a TGFBR1 inhibitor combined with a BMP inhibitor effectively counteracts the pro-metastatic effects induced by DRD4 both in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, these findings uncover an unconventional role for DRD4 beyond its classic function as a neurotransmitter receptor. The intracellular signaling of DRD4 interacting with TGFBR1 can be targeted pharmacologically for CRC therapy.},

  abstract     = {Harvesting sustainable clean energy from natural water evaporation holds great promise to provide continuous power for portable and wearable electronics. However, poor portability and complex fabrication processes hinder the low-cost and large-scale integration of flexible evaporation-driven electricity generators (FEEGs). Herein, a fully-printed flexible evaporation-driven generator (PFEEG) is developed. Utilizing custom-formulated functional inks, the asymmetric structures, current collectors, and hygroscopic water storage units can be manufactured by a patternable, scalable, and layer-by-layer deposition technique of screen printing. Thus, a PFEEG unit (0.5 cm × 1 cm × 38 µm) can generate a voltage of ≈0.8 V over a wide relative humidity (RH) range from 20% to 90%, and a maximum power density of 1.55 µW cm −2 at 70% RH. An array of 200 PFEEGs connected in series or parallel can produce voltages up to 152.41 V or a current up to 1.02 mA. Furthermore, the scalable PFEEG array can not only be seamlessly connected with the printed flexible circuit but can also be integrated with a humidity sensor and display arrays to form a self-powered printed flexible sensing system. This work presents a practical strategy for continuous power supply of portable and wearable electronics.},

Here, a new regulatory mechanism is found that a GWAS intergenic SNP (rs4683184) functions as an enhancer to influence the binding affinity of transcription factor RUNX2, whose phase separation can mediate the long-range chromatin interaction between enhancer and target gene XCR1 (a member of the GPCR family), leading to changes of XCR1 expression and osteoblast differentiation. Bone-targeting AAV of Xcr1 can improve bone formation in osteoporosis mice, suggesting that XCR1 can be a new susceptibility gene for osteoporosis. This study is the first to link non-coding SNP with phase separation, providing a new insight into long-range chromatin regulation mechanisms with susceptibility to complex diseases, and finding a potential target for the development of osteoporosis drugs and corresponding translational research.},

  abstract     = {Cyclohexanone oxime, a critical precursor for nylon-6 production, is traditionally synthesized via the hydroxylamine method under industrial harsh conditions. Here is present a one-step electrochemical integrated approach for the efficient production of cyclohexanone oxime under ambient conditions. This approach employed the coupling of in situ electro-synthesized H 2 O 2 over a cobalt (Co)-based electrocatalyst with the titanium silicate-1 (TS-1) heterogeneous catalyst to achieve the cyclohexanone ammoximation process. The cathode electrocatalyst is consisted of atomically dispersed Co sites and small Co nanoparticles co-anchored on carboxylic multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CoSAs/SNPs-OCNTs), which delivered superior electrocatalytic activity toward the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e − ORR) with high-efficient H 2 O 2 production in 0.1 m sodium phosphate (NaPi). Theoretical calculations revealed that the introduction of Co nanoparticles effectively optimized the binding strength of * OOH species on Co atomic sites, thus facilitating the 2e − ORR. The subsequent tandem catalytic system achieved a high cyclohexanone conversion of 71.7% ± 1.1% with a cyclohexanone oxime selectivity of 70.3% ± 0.6%. In this system, the TS-1 catalyst effectively captured the * OOH intermediate and activated the in situ generated H 2 O 2 to form Ti-OOH species, which promoted the formation of hydroxylamine and thereby enhanced the oxime production performance.},

  abstract     = {Despite considerable advancements in the treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC), the overall survival rate for patients with advanced CRC remains below 50%, primarily due to challenges posed by drug resistance and metastasis. Here, a novel “Three-in-One” Cu-based metal-organic framework nanozyme with peroxidase-like (POD-like) activity has been successfully developed, aiming to promote CRC cell death by dual targeting of oxidative stress and copper ion homeostasis, which could promote CRC cell death via apoptosis and cuproptosis, and facilitate hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) degradation, leading to the reversal of chemoresistance in tumor therapy. These nanozymes, composed of copper and 2-propylimidazole (Cu-PrIm), feature a distorted Cu-N4 catalytic active center that mimics natural enzyme structures consisting of copper and histidine residues, endowing them with enzyme-like activities. The antitumor efficacy of Cu-PrIm nanozymes is validated in various in vivo models of CRC. Especially Cu-PrIm nanozymes exhibit excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability, and a tolerable toxicity profile in mouse models, making them a strong candidate for clinical translation. Taken together, the study introduces a novel therapeutic paradigm in CRC treatment by targeting these vulnerabilities and leveraging the potential using “Three-in-One” Cu-PrIm nanozymes to address multiple pathways simultaneously.},

Herein, Fe doping is used in VO x (Fe-VO x ) nanozymes with multienzyme activities for ORNJ treatment via RONS scavenging. Fe doping can induce structure reconstruction of nanozymes with abundant defect production, including Fe substitution and oxygen vacancies (OVs), which markedly increased multiple enzyme-mimicking activity. Catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) enzyme-like performance of Fe-VO x can effectively reprogram jawbone microenvironment to restore mitochondrial dysfunction and enhance mitophagy. Moreover, the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect of Fe-VO x made it a good photothermal nanoagents for inhibiting jaw infection.

  abstract     = {Collagen fiber skeleton from animal skin is an ideal substrate for electronic skin (e-skin). However, the interface mismatch between conductive materials and skeleton and the monotonicity of conductive network still hinder its creation. Herein, a novel collagen fiber-based e-skin with dual-mode conduction of NaCl and conductive spheres (IECS) is accomplished by loading organohydrogel into the skeleton via “permeation and self-assembly”. The resulting interpenetrating network produces a 3D continuous, conductive pathway and strong interface interaction with high-density hydrogen bonding, thus exhibiting excellent strength (24.5 MPa), conductivity (14.82 S m −1 ), sensing performance (sensitivity of 16.64), and environmental stability. The physical structure (3D skeleton, interpenetrating network) and chemical interaction (interface interaction, salting-out) achieve energy dissipation. Meanwhile, the sensitivity is enhanced by dual-mode conduction, conductive sphere array, and deformation amplification induced by collagen fibers. Additionally, the strong bonding ability between glycerin and collagen fibers with water molecules provides anti-freezing and moisture-retention characteristics. Thus, the strategic synergy of compositional and structural design makes IECS a promising force-sensing part of piezoresistive sensor for human movement, pulse frequency, cipher transmission, and pressure distribution. In short, IECS presents a multifunctional platform for the invention of high-performance e-skin with on-demand property, which offers great application potential in wearable electronics.},

Herein, an innovative N-doped carbon nanocage-in-microcage structure with tunable carbon-coated Ni (NC/Ni(HS)) is reported via a reliable Ni-catalyzed and Ni-templated method. The hierarchically hollow structure of nanocage-in-microcage composites can optimize the impedance matching and respond to multiple reflections and scattering of incident microwaves and infrared waves. Moreover, the magnetic Ni nanoparticles improve the synergistic interactions between confined heterointerfaces and promote interfacial polarization. Such an ingenious structure endows NC/Ni(HS) with outstanding MA performance and infrared stealth properties. Specifically, NC/Ni(HS)-10 with an optimal dielectric property, exhibits excellent MA performance. At an ultralow fill loading of 4 wt.%, a wide absorption bandwidth of 6.16 GHz is achieved at a thickness of 2.63 mm, and a strong reflection loss of −63.67 dB is obtained at a thickness of 2.00 mm. In addition, NC/Ni(HS)-10 shows a low infrared emissivity in the range of 3‒14 µm, which is the key to compatibility with infrared stealth.

  abstract     = {Photoelectric conversion in ferroelectric crystals can support many important applications in modern on-chip technology, but suffering from two problems, low responsive current and narrow responsive range. Especially, wide-gap ferroelectric oxides are only active at short-wavelength ultraviolet region with weak photocurrent at nanoampere levels. Here, a bifunctional design strategy of ferroelectric-order and electronic-band to improve the photocurrent and extend the responsive range simultaneously, is proposed. In a Cu-doped KTa 1− x Nb x O 3 (KTN) perovskite crystal, a conductive channel is constructed by “head-to-head” ferroelectric domains, associated with the emergence of micrometer-scale supercells. In addition, the introduction of Cu + ion can induce defect levels, thus extending the responsive range beyond the inherent absorption of pure KTN. Through rational device optimization, a record self-powered responsivity of 5.23 mA W −1 is realized in Cu:KTN photodetector, which is two orders of magnitude higher than undoped KTN crystal. The temperature-dependent light diffraction and photocurrent show that the ferroelectric-order is dominated in this photoresponse behavior. Moreover, Cu:KTN detector is active in the broadband range from 390 to 1030 nm, covering ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared regions. This work provides an effective method for the design of next-generation self-powered photodetectors with ultrahigh responsivity and ultrawide responsive range.},

  abstract     = {Superlattice materials have emerged as promising candidates for water electrocatalysis due to their tunable crystal structures, electronic properties, and potential for interface engineering. However, the catalytic activity of transition metal-based superlattice materials for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is often constrained by their intrinsic electronic band structures, which can limit charge carrier mobility and active site availability. Herein, a highly efficient electrocatalyst based on a VS 2 -VS heterodimensional (2D-1D) superlattice with sulfur vacancies is designed addressing the limitations posed by the intrinsic electronic structure. The enhanced catalytic performance of the VS 2 -VS superlattice is primarily attributed to the engineered heterojunction, where the work function difference between the VS 2 layer and VS chain induces a charge separation field that promotes efficient electron-hole separation. Introducing sulfur vacancies further amplifies this effect by inducing quantum localization of the separated electrons, thereby significantly boosting HER activity. Both theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the superlattice achieves a ΔG H* of −0.06 eV and an impressively low overpotential of 46 mV at 10 mA·cm −2 in acidic media, surpassing the performance of commercial Pt/C while maintaining exceptional stability over 15 000 cycles.

Liquid drugs are stored within the interstices of the deformable microstructural units, allowing for continuous drug release through diffusion upon contact with the ocular surface. Finite element analysis is utilized to study the intraocular drug transport dynamics of glaucoma and optimize the overall layout of the device. Microstructural units undergo deformation under loading, altering the interstitial spaces and modulating the drug release rate. This device can adaptively adjust its drug release rate based on changes in intraocular pressure (IOP) and can be proactively regulated in response to cyclic eye loads, accommodating elevated IOP caused by varying body postures and activities.

Here, patient-derived organoid screening models of colorectal cancer are established to identify tumors that are sensitive to ferroptosis-inducing therapy. This study discovers that patient-derived tumors characterized by mitophagy deficiency are hypersensitive to ferroptosis-inducing therapies. Mechanistically, a novel negative feedback regulatory pathway of lipid peroxidation is identified, which is one of the important intrinsic anti-ferroptosis mechanisms of cancer cells. Lipid peroxidation-mediated endoplasmic reticulum stress transcriptionally upregulates Parkin to promote mitophagy through ATF4. Mitophagy limits the generation of lipid peroxidation products and subsequently inhibits ferroptosis by inhibiting the accumulation of mitochondrial ROS. Mitophagy-deficient tumors lack this anti-ferroptotic mechanism, unleashing the generation of lipid peroxidation and potent ferroptotic cell death induced by erastin, RSL3, cysteine deprivation, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy. More importantly, ferroptosis-inducing therapy selectively inhibits the growth and distant metastasis of mitophagy-deficient tumors in vivo. In summary, patient-derived organoids of colorectal cancer patients for screening ferroptosis-sensitive tumors are established, providing a paradigm for identifying that patient-derived tumors are sensitive to ferroptosis-inducing therapies. This study concludes that mitophagy-deficient tumors are vulnerable to ferroptosis induction, which may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for tumors deficient in mitophagy.},

  abstract     = {Antifungal resistance, particularly the rise of multidrug-resistance strains, poses a significant public health threat. In this study, the study identifies a novel multidrug-resistance gene, msp-8 , encoding a helicase, through experimental evolution with Neurospora crassa as a model. Deletion of msp-8 conferred multidrug resistance in N. crassa , Aspergillus fumigatus , and Fusarium verticillioides . However, the transcript levels of genes encoding known drug targets or efflux pumps remain unaltered with msp-8 deletion. Interestingly, MSP-8 interacted with ribosomal proteins, and this mutant displays compromised ribosomal function, causing translational disturbance. Notably, inhibition of protein translation enhances resistance to azoles, amphotericin B, and polyoxin B. Furthermore, MSP-8 deficiency or inhibition of translation reduces intracellular ketoconazole accumulation and membrane-bound amphotericin B content, directly causing antifungal resistance. Additionaly, MSP-8 deficiency induces cell wall remodeling, and decreases intracellular ROS levels, further contributing to resistance. The findings reveal a novel multidrug resistance mechanism independent of changes in drug target or efflux pump, while MSP-8 deficiency suppresses protein translation, thereby facilitating the development of resistance with fitness cost. This study provides the first evidence that MSP-8 participates in protein translation and that translation suppression can cause multidrug resistance in fungi, offering new insights into resistance mechanisms in clinical and environmental fungal strains.},

  abstract     = {The prevailing research emphasis has been on reducing the critical switching current density ( J c ) by enhancing the damping-like efficiency ( β DL ). However, recent studies have shown that the field-like efficiency ( β FL ) can also play a major role in reducing J c . In this study, the central inversion asymmetry of Pt-Co is significantly enhanced through interface engineering at the sub-atomic layer of Ta, thereby inducing substantial alterations in the β FL associated with the interface. The β FL has shown a 123% increase, from −1.66 Oe/(MA cm − 2 ) to -3.8 Oe/(MA cm − 2 ). As a result, the multilayered Ta/Pt/Ta (0.3 nm insertion)/Co/Ta structure leads to a notable decrease in J c , exceeding a remarkable 90% compared to the simpler Ta/Pt/Co/Ta structure, ultimately achieving a significantly low value of 2.7 MA cm − 2 . These findings pave the way for the development of highly efficient and energy-saving spin-orbit torque (SOT)-based spintronic devices, where further optimizations in interface engineering can unlock even greater potential in terms of reduced power consumption and enhanced performance.},

Investigations into the surface curvature on SACs are still ongoing, and the impact of the concave surface is often overlooked. In this work, theoretical calculations indicate that curved surfaces, particularly those with concavity, can optimize the electronic structures of single Fe sites and facilitate the reductive release of *OH. A carbon sphere featuring uniformly oriented channels and a chiral multi-shelled carbon hollow nanosphere are selected as carbon matrices due to their accessible concave and/or convex surfaces. After loading Fe species, the resulting catalysts with Fe SA in curved surfaces exhibit excellent oxygen reduction reaction activity ( E 1/2 = ≈0.89 V), strong methanol tolerance, and favorable long-term stability. Impressively, a solid-state flexible Zn–air battery based on this catalyst exhibits a remarkable durability over 40 h with a high peak power density of 122.1 mW cm −2 and excellent charge–discharge performance at different bending angles.

Developing a precisely theranostic nanoplatform presents a promising shortcut to reverse PF.

The activation of molecular imaging probe (pCY-pairs) by consumption of endogenous caspase-3 initiates fluorescence resonance energy transfer-guided theranostic pattern, aiming to restore mitochondrial dysfunction-induced oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in alveolar epithelial cells II (AECs II). This process sequentially resists the expression of interleukin-1β and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor through combined with nintedanib, further suppressing abnormal injury of AECs II and persistent migration and proliferation of inflammatory cells. Especially, the homeostasis of injured AECs II diminishes excessive accumulation of transforming growth factor-β to restrain myofibroblasts proliferation and collagen deposition, thereby amplifying the possibility of reversing PF. This theranostic nanoplatform is proposed to provide a prompt and exact approach to enhance diagnostic authenticity and treating efficiency through harnessing endogenous indicator for PF reversal.},

  abstract     = {Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a prevalent clinical syndrome with high morbidity and mortality. Accumulating studies suggest mitochondrial dysfunction as the typical characteristics and key process of AKI, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. The YME1-like 1 (YME1L1) ATPase, an inner mitochondrial membrane protein, is screened and identified to be downregulated in renal tubular epithelial cells of various mouse models and patients of AKI. Dramatically, restoration of YME1L1 expression significantly alleviates cisplatin-induced AKI and subsequent chronic kidney disease (CKD) through attenuating mitochondrial dysfunction via maintaining optic atrophy 1 (OPA1)-mediated mitochondrial energy metabolism homeostasis. Mechanistically, the upregulated expression of sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1c (SREBP1c) is demonstrated to be responsible for cisplatin-mediated transcriptional inhibition of YME1L1 via directly binding to its promoter region. Moreover, cisplatin-induced methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3)-mediated m6A modification enhances SREBP1c mRNA stability, thereby upregulating its expression. Notably, both depletion of SREBP1c and renal tubule-specific overexpression of YME1L1 markedly ameliorate cisplatin-induced AKI and its transition to CKD. Taken together, these findings suggest that METTL3-mediated SREBP1c upregulation contributes to AKI and its progression to CKD through disrupting mitochondrial energy metabolism via transcriptionally suppressing YME1L1. Targeting the SREBP1c/YME1L1 signaling may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy against AKI.},

This work demonstrates that a series of Mn, Zr co-doped CaCO 3 nanomaterials with the 3D ordered macroporous (3DOM) skeletons are successfully prepared by a novel strategy of templated metal salt co-precipitation. The characterization results indicate that a majority of Zr and Mn are atomically dispersed into the highly-crystallized CaCO 3 framework, whereas a minor amount of Mn is present in the form of CaMnO 3 nanoparticles (NPs). The optimal 3DOM material made by templating with PS microspheres with a diameter of ≈350 nm, 3DOM-Ca80Mn10Zr10, shows a solar light absorptance of ≈74.1% and an initial energy storage density of 1706.4 kJ kg −1 . Importantly, it gives an impressive energy storage density loss of &lt; 6.0% and maintains above 1600 kJ kg −1 after 125 cycles. The density functional theory calculations reveal that the co-doping of Mn and Zr into the CaO crystal lattice offers a strong affinity to [Ca 4 O 4 ] clusters, as a result, the anti-sintering of CaO NPs is significantly enhanced under high temperature.},

However, its precise role in tumor cells and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the expression patterns, prognostic values, and functional role of SAMHD1 in HCC progression. We constructed liver tissue microarrays using tumor and paired paratumor tissue specimens from 187 patients with primary HCC. Our findings indicate that nuclear SAMHD1 protein levels are increased in tumors compared to paratumor tissues. Moreover, nuclear SAMHD1 levels decline in advanced tumor stages, with higher SAMHD1 nuclear staining correlating with favorable prognostic outcomes. Hepatocyte-specific SAMHD1 knockout mice, generated by crossing SAMHD1 fl/fl mice with Alb-cre mice, showed accelerated tumor progression in a diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced HCC model. In hepatoma cell lines, nuclear overexpression of SAMHD1 inhibited cell proliferation by stalling mitosis, independent of its deoxynucleotide triphosphohydrolase (dNTPase) function. Mechanistically, SAMHD1 interacts with the cohesin complex in nucleus, enhancing sister chromatid cohesion during cell division, which delays metaphase progression. Our findings suggest that nuclear SAMHD1 plays a critical role in slowing HCC progression by regulating mitosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target by manipulating cohesin dynamics.},

Herein, a novel electrocatalyst is reported, featuring nitrogen-doped carbon-supported ultra-small copper oxide nanoparticles with the broken-symmetry C 4v coordination filed sites, achieved by a mild γ-ray radiation-induced method. The as-synthesized catalyst exhibits an excellent ORR activity with a half-wave potential of 0.873 V and shows no obvious decay over 50 h durability in alkaline solution. This superior catalytic activity is further corroborated by the high-performance in both primary and rechargeable Zn–air batteries with an ultrahigh-peak-power density (255.4 mW cm −2 ) and robust cycling stability. The experimental characterizations and density functional theory calculations show that the surface Cu atoms are configured in a compressed octahedron coordination. This geometric arrangement interacts with the key intermediate OH * , facilitating localized charge transfer and thereby weakening the Cu─O bond, which promotes the efficient transformation of OH * to OH − and the subsequent desorption, and markedly accelerates kinetics of the rate-determining step in the reaction.

  abstract     = {Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) therapy application to attenuate myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MI/R) injury in clinical practice remains challenging. The secretome, derived from hypoxia-preconditioned cardiomyocytes (SHPC), potentially mimics the IPC microenvironment and facilitates IPC clinical translation. This study aims to determine whether SHPC can be a feasible alternative to IPC for attenuating MI/R injury, and to identify the functional factor of SHPC. The ultrafiltration technique is applied to generate an SHPC formulation that is intramyocardially injected before reperfusion in a murine MI/R model. The effects of SHPC on cardiomyocyte apoptosis, pyroptosis, and neutrophil polarization are evaluated. Secretomics, neutralizing antibodies, and recombinant proteins are employed to identify the functional factor in SHPC. Co-immunoprecipitation assays, RNA sequencing, and site-directed mutagenesis are conducted to investigate the underlying mechanism. Additionally, a recombinant functional factor-encapsulated hydrogel is developed for intrapericardial injections (iPC). An intramyocardial SHPC injection in MI/R-injured mice strikingly reduces infarct size and the expression of cardiac injury biomarker while improving cardiac function. SHPC eliminated mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and triggered neutrophil polarization to reduce cardiomyocyte apoptosis/pyroptosis upon hypoxia/reoxygenation injury. Stanniocalcin 1 (Stc1) is identified as the functional factor in SHPC, mediating hypoxic microenvironment. Mechanistically, hypoxia-preconditioned cardiomyocytes secrete Stc1 into the microenvironment and activate calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) that increases Stat3 phosphorylation at Ser727 via nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2)-mediated S-nitrosylation, thereby decreasing cardiomyocyte apoptosis/pyroptosis in an autocrine mechanism. Simultaneously, Stc1 facilitates cardiomyocyte-neutrophil crosstalk, thereby triggering neutrophil polarization to reduce inflammatory damage via the CaSR/NOS2/Stat3 axis in a paracrine mechanism. Pericardial delivery of a recombinant rStc1-encapsulated hydrogel has extended the therapeutic time window of rStc1, improving long-term cardiac function. The hypoxia microenvironment preconditioning, which mimicked by SHPC, attenuated MI/R injury via Stc1-mediated cardiomyocyte self-protection and neutrophil polarization. This study suggests that SHPC, with hypoxia preconditioning factor Stc1, represents a clinically feasible alternative to IPC for attenuating MI/R injury.},

As a typical example, the activation and preservation of the entropy stabilized effect of a typical niobosilicate glass system at different temperatures are studied. The relation between the micro-configurations and the entropic property is analyzed. Via the entropy engineering strategy, the crystallization of the niobosilicate glass can be manipulated.

This strategy forms a quasi-localized high-concentration solvation structure, thereby restricting the reduction of TFEP and its impact on the graphite anode. The LiNi 0.8 Mn 0.1 Co 0.1 O 2 (NCM811) | Graphite (Gr) pouch cell with optimized electrolyte exhibits a capacity retention rate of 80.1% after 370 cycles at 0.5C, which is much more stable than the electrolyte with TFEP-involved solvation structure (capacity retention rate: 47.1% after 300 cycles). The corresponding pouch cell with cut-off voltage to 4.5 V exhibits a capacity retention rate of 82.8% after 125 cycles, significantly outperforming cells employing commercial carbonate electrolytes (capacity retention rate: 56.9% after 125 cycles). Thus, the developed quasi-localized high-concentration solvation structure can effectively stabilize the electrode interface, greatly enhancing the cycling performance of phosphate-based flame-retardant electrolytes.},

  abstract     = {Understanding and manipulating magnetic damping, particularly in magnetic heterostructures, is crucial for fundamental research, versatile engineering, and optimization. Although magnetic damping can be enhanced by the band hybridization between ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic materials at the interface, the contribution of individual subbands on the hybridized bands to magnetic damping is fully unexplored. Here, it is found that magnetic damping α eff is modified by the Fermi level in Fe/GeTe heterostructures via Bi doping. By combining angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, the enhancement of damping originated from the strongly hybridized band structures between Fe and the surface Rashba bands of GeTe are unveiled. More interestingly, the Fermi level modulates the density of states (DOS) ratio between the subbands of GeTe and the total DOS of hybridized states, which is directly proportional to the magnetic damping. This work gives an insightful physical understanding of the magnetic damping influenced by the hybridized band structures and opens a novel avenue to manipulate magnetic damping by band engineering.},

A semiconducting polymer nanomessenger (TCa/SPN/a) consisting of two second messengers, calcium ion (Ca 2+ ) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP) for metastatic breast cancer therapy, is reported here. Such a TCa/SPN/a is constructed to exhibit X-ray response for the activatable delivery of mitochondria-targeting Ca compound and cGAMP as stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist. With X-ray irradiation, TCa/SPN/a could generate singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) via radiodynamic effect for ablating solid tumors and improving the tumor immunogenicity by inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD). Furthermore, the released mitochondria-targeting Ca compounds show a high binging effect on mitochondria and cause reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and mitochondria damage via calcium overload, while cGAMP boosts immunological effect through activating STING pathway. In this way, TCa/SPN/a enables a radiodynamic-activated calcium overload and immunotherapy to obviously inhibit the growths of bilateral tumors and also abolish tumor metastasis in metastatic breast cancer mouse models. This article should demonstrate the first smart dual-functional nanotherapeutic containing two second messengers for precise and specific cancer therapy.},

The investigation identifies five volatile organic compounds (VOCs)—acetone, styrene, ethanol, 2-pentanone, and n-butano—as promising markers indicative of BoNT poisoning. Specifically, a handheld breath analyzer, featuring a yttrium stabilized zirconia (YSZ)-based gas sensor array, alongside a wearable temperature sensor integrated with a bio-compatible methacrylated gelatin (GelMA) sensing film, are developed to simultaneously monitor breath signal variations and body temperature fluctuations. Preliminary animal testing validates the effectiveness of the integrated approach, achieving an accuracy exceeding 91.2% in early detection of physical discomfort associated with BoNT poisoning.

  abstract     = {The high transmissibility and mutation ability of coronaviruses enable them to easily escape existing immune protection and also pose a challenge to existing antiviral drugs. Moreover, drugs only targeting viruses cannot always attenuate the “cytokine storm”. Herein, a synthetic heparan sulfate (HS) mimetic, HMSA-06 is reported, that exhibited antiviral activities against both the SARS-CoV-2 prototype and Omicron strains by targeting viral entry and replication. Of particular note, HMSA-06 demonstrated more potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects than PG545 and Roneparstat. SARS-CoV-2 is reported to hijack autophagy to facilitate its replication, therefore boosting autophagy can attenuate SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is revealed that HMSA-06, but not a similar HS mimetic that failed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2, can upregulate cellular autophagy flux. In addition, HMSA-06 was found to robustly block the NLRP3-mediated inflammatory reaction in SARS-CoV-2 infected THP-1 derived macrophages as evidenced by a reduction in inflammasome formation and the subsequent decreased secretion of mature caspase-1 and IL-1β. The HMSA-06&#39;s inflammation inhibitory function is further confirmed using a LPS/ATP-stimulated THP-1 macrophage model. Altogether, this study has identified a promising HS mimetic to combat SARS-CoV-2-associated diseases by inhibiting viral infection and attenuating viral-induced inflammatory reaction, providing insights into the development of novel anti-coronavirus drugs in the future.},

The transfer of young Treg cells can improve the pregnancy outcomes of reproductive-aged mice by reducing the level of IFN-γ, a proinflammatory cytokine secreted by Treg cells in aged mice. Transferring α-PD-1 mAb-treated aged Treg cells increases the level of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine secreted by Treg cells in reproductive-aged mice.

  abstract     = {Rechargeable Li–SO 2 batteries offer low-cost, high-energy density benefits and can leverage manufacturing processes for the existing primary version at a commercial scale. However, they have so far only been demonstrated in an “open-system” with continuous gas supply, preventing practical application. Here, the utilization and reversibility of SO 2 along with the lithium stability are addressed, all essential for long-life, high-energy batteries. The study discovers that high SO 2 utilization is achievable only from SO 2 dissolved in electrolytes between the lithium anode and carbon cathode. This results from a unique osmosis phenomenon where SO 2 consumption increases salt concentration, driving the influx of organic solvents rather than SO 2 from outside the current path. This insight leads to configure a bobbin-cell with all electrolytes between the electrodes, realizing nearly 70% of SO 2 utilization, &gt; 12x greater than in conventional coin cells. To improve reaction rate and SO 2 reversibility, triphenylamine is employed to the electrolyte, creating an electron-rich environment that alleviates the disproportionation of discharge products. Incorporating this additive into a bobbin-cell with a lithium protective layer yields a cell with a projected energy density exceeding 183.2 Wh kg −1 . The work highlights the potential of Li–SO 2 batteries as affordable, sustainable energy storage options.},

Diabetic wounds, in particular, pose a significant clinical challenge due to increased oxidative stress and dysfunctional healing processes. In this study, a novel therapeutic strategy is developed using 3D copper-magnesium bimetallic antioxidant nano-enzymes (Cu/Mg-MOF) to mitigate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and restore redox balance through electron transfer. To optimize delivery, a thermo-sensitive hydrogel composed of chitosan (CS) and ε -polylysine (PL) is designed, serving as an efficient carrier for the nano-enzymes. This Cu/Mg-MOF@CS/PL hydrogel exhibits excellent physical properties, including injectability, softness, and biocompatibility, making it ideal for application in diabetic wounds. In a diabetic wound model, treatment with Cu/Mg-MOF@CS/PL hydrogel significantly accelerated wound healing, with a closure rate of 90.6% by day 14, compared to just 55.4% in the untreated group. The hydrogel effectively promoted key aspects of wound healing, such as collagen deposition, re-epithelialization, angiogenesis, and immunomodulation. These findings underscore the potential of the Cu/Mg-MOF@CS/PL hydrogel as a promising therapeutic system for enhancing the healing of diabetic wounds.},

This research indicates that Osimertinib-resistant cells exhibit a strong dependence on glutamine metabolism. However, targeting GLS1 shows limited anticancer effects, probably because it cannot fully block the glutamine metabolic pathway. The investigation reveals that a more effective strategy involves simultaneously inhibiting both ASCT2 and GLS1. After confirming the efficacy of this dual-targeting approach against Osimertinib-resistant cells in preclinical models, the potential of utilizing a broad-spectrum glutamine metabolism antagonist is further explored to achieve superior antitumor efficacy. DON, broad-spectrum glutamine antagonist, presents toxicity issues. Herein, the high NQO1 expression in Osimertinib-resistant NSCLC cells is leveraged to design an NQO1-responsive DON prodrug, 10e (LBJ-10e). This prodrug demonstrates superior safety compared to natural DON and greater antitumor activity against resistant tumors compared to the clinical phase II drug DRP104. These findings may address the clinical limitations of GLS1 allosteric inhibitors and underscore prodrug strategies in effectively treating Osimertinib-resistant lung cancer, providing a foundation for future clinical trials.},

This study proposes a quantized collision model accessible through ionic irradiation technology to explore the flexoelectricity and precisely modulate the strain gradient. The lattice strain is introduced in SrTiO 3 (STO) single crystals and tuned broadly by irradiation with ions of He + , C + , and P + at dose of 1 × 10 14 and 2 × 10 15 ion cm −2 , respectively. Under C + ion irradiation at a dose of 2 × 10 15 ion cm −2 , thin-film X-ray diffraction reveals a strain gradient up to ≈0.65% nm −1 . The resulted polarization is found to orient out-of-plane, as observed through X-ray reciprocal space mapping and high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy. Piezoresponse force microscopy characterization reveals that the electric-induced out-of-plane polarization reversal emerges at room temperature, corresponding to a stain gradient ≈0.05% nm −1 in STO&#39;s flexoelectric response.

However, a limited choice of constituent molecules restricts their property space and potential applications. To overcome this challenge, an innovative approach coupling molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and a novel graph variational autoencoder (VAE) model for inverse design of vitrimer chemistries with desired glass transition temperature ( T g ) is presented. The first diverse vitrimer dataset of one million chemistries is curated and T g for 8,424 of them is calculated by high-throughput MD simulations calibrated by a Gaussian process model. The proposed VAE employs dual graph encoders and a latent dimension overlapping scheme which allows for individual representation of multi-component vitrimers. High accuracy and efficiency of the framework are demonstrated by discovering novel vitrimers with desirable T g beyond the training regime. To validate the effectiveness of the framework in experiments, vitrimer chemistries are generated with a target T g = 323 K. By incorporating chemical intuition, a novel vitrimer with T g of 311–317 K is synthesized, experimentally demonstrating healability and flowability.

  abstract     = {Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is the leading cause of hepatic graft dysfunction, resulting from hepatocyte damage. Nevertheless, given the few specialized therapeutics available in hepatic IRI, additional mechanistic insights into hepatocyte damage are required. Here, the protein solute carrier family 39 member 14 (SLC39A14) is identified as a pro-ferroptosis target in hepatocytes of human liver allografts through single-cell RNA sequencing analysis. SLC39A14 knockdown significantly mitigated hepatic IRI by preventing hepatocyte ferroptosis in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, the inhibition of SLC39A14 suppressed non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI) uptake by hepatocytes, thereby reducing iron overload and cell ferroptosis. Moreover, human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) are found to exhibit a notable therapeutic effect on hepatic IRI by downregulating SLC39A14 expression. Exosomes derived from hBMSCs delivered abundant miR-16-5p into hepatocytes, which post-transcriptionally suppressed the expression of SLC39A14 and reduced cell ferroptosis induced by hepatic IRI. In conclusion, SLC39A14 triggers hepatic IRI by mediating NTBI uptake into hepatocytes and inducing hepatocyte ferroptosis. Moreover, hBMSC-based therapy is promising to reverse this progression of hepatic IRI.},

  abstract     = {Photoelectrochemical (PEC) CO 2 reduction using a photocathode is an attractive method for making valuable chemical products due to its simplicity and lower overpotential requirements. However, previous PEC processes have often been diffusion-limited leading to low production rates of the CO 2 reduction reaction, due to inefficient gas diffusion through the liquid electrolyte to the catalyst surface, particularly at high current densities. In this study, a gas-permeable photocathode in a continuous flow PEC reactor is incorporated, which facilitates the direct supply of CO 2 gas to the photocathode-electrolyte interface, unlike dark reaction-based flow reactors. This concept is demonstrated using Ag-TiO 2 on carbon paper, illuminated through a quartz window and flowing liquid electrolyte. CO 2 supply is managed via pressure and flow control on the non-illuminated side of the carbon paper. The photocurrent density is significantly influenced by the flow rates and pressure of CO 2 gas, and the electrolyte flow rates. Compared to the traditional H-cell, the continuous PEC flow reactor achieves ≈10-fold increase in CO faradaic efficiency, 30-fold increase in production rate and 16-fold increase in stability without catalyst modifications. This work provides essential insights into the design and application of continuous gas-liquid flow PEC reactor systems, highlighting their potential for other PEC reactions.},

  abstract     = {The unique layer-stacking in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals materials facilitates the formation of nearly degenerate phases of matter and opens novel routes for the design of low-power, reconfigurable functional materials. Electrochemical ion intercalation between stacked layers offers a promising approach to stabilize bulk metastable phases and to explore the effects of extreme carrier doping and strain. However, in situ characterization methods to study the structural evolution and dynamical functional properties of these intercalated materials remains limited. Here a novel experimental platform is presented capable of simultaneously performing electrochemical lithium-ion intercalation and multimodal ultrafast characterization of the lattice using both electron diffraction and nonlinear optical techniques. Using the layered semimetal WTe 2 as a model system, the interlayer shear phonon mode that modulates stacking between 2Dlayers is probed, showing that small amounts of lithiation enhance the amplitude and lifetime of the phonon, contrary to expectations. This results from the dynamically fluctuating and anharmonic structure between nearly degenerate phases at room temperature, which can be stabilized by electronic carriers accompanying the inserted lithium ions. At high lithiation, the T d ’ structure emerges and quenches the phonon response. This work defines new approaches for using electrochemistry to engineer the dynamic structure of 2D materials.},

  abstract     = {Bacterial infections resistant to antimicrobial treatments, particularly those caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( P. aeruginosa ), frequently lead to elevated mortality rates. Tackling this resistance using therapeutic combinations with varied mechanisms has shown considerable promise. In this study, a bioinspired nanocarrier is successfully designed and engineered for targeted antibiotic delivery and toxin/bacteria clearance. This is achieved by encapsulating antibiotic-loaded framework nucleic acids with hybrid cell membranes acquired from neutrophils and platelets. By coating the hybrid membrane outside the shell, nanocarriers are endowed with the function of neutrophil-like chemotaxis and platelet-like bacteria adhesion to achieve the first stage of inflammation targeting. Based on the specific binding of bacteria toxin to the hybrid membrane, the release of antibiotic-loaded framework nucleic acids is triggered by toxin-mediated membrane lysis to fulfill the second stage of toxin neutralization and bacteria killing. Meanwhile, the immunomodulation potential of framework nucleic acids enables nanocarriers to accomplish the third stage of reversing the immunosuppressive microenvironment. In mouse models of acute and chronic P. aeruginosa pneumonia, the nanocarriers can reduce bacterial burden at a low dosage and decrease mortality with negligible toxicity. In sum, these findings have illustrated the remarkable capability of nanocarriers in treating recalcitrant bacterial infections.},

The kidney&#39;s complex intricate physiological architecture and the heterogeneous intracellular environment pose significant challenges for effective sequential and high-resolution drug delivery—an urgent issue that remains unresolved. To address this, a hierarchical-targeting antioxidant nanodrug has been developed with a folic acid moiety (HAND) designed for high-resolution drug delivery in AKI treatment. For the first time, HAND enables sequential targeting from the kidney to the most severely damaged proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs), ultimately concentrating in the DNA-rich mitochondria and nucleus. As a result, HAND effectively scavenges ROS in situ, protecting both mitochondria and nuclei along with their vital genetic material. This action restores mitochondrial function, mitigates DNA oxidation and fragmentation, reduces apoptosis, and inhibits cGAS/STING-mediated sterile inflammation. Consequently, HAND demonstrates remarkable efficacy in safeguarding injured kidneys during AKI. Overall, this work pioneers a hierarchical, high-resolution antioxidant strategy, providing innovative guidance for the development of AKI therapies.},

  abstract     = {Embryonic muscle fiber formation determines post-birth muscle fiber totals. The previous research shows SYISL knockout significantly increases muscle fiber numbers and mass in mice, but the mechanism remains unclear. This study confirms that the SYISL gene, maternal gut microbiota, and their interaction significantly affect the number of muscle fibers in mouse embryos through distinct mechanisms, as SYISL knockout alters maternal gut microbiota composition and boosts butyrate levels in embryonic serum. Both fecal microbiota transplantation and butyrate feeding significantly increase muscle fiber numbers in offspring, with butyrate inhibiting histone deacetylases and increasing histone acetylation in embryonic muscle. Combined analysis of RNA-seq between wild-type and SYISL knockout mice with ChIP-seq for H3K9ac and H3K27ac reveals that SYISL and maternal microbiota interaction regulates myogenesis via the butyrate-HDAC-H3K9ac/H3K27ac pathway. Furthermore, scRNA-seq analysis shows that SYISL knockout alone significantly increases the number and proportion of myogenic cells and their dynamics, independently of regulating histone acetylation levels. Cell communication analysis suggests that this may be due to the downregulation of signaling pathways such as MSTN and TGFβ. Overall, multiple pathways are highlighted through which SYISL influences embryonic muscle development, offering valuable insights for treating muscle diseases and improving livestock production.},

  abstract     = {Precious metal electrical contact materials are pivotal in microelectronic devices due to their excellent chemical stability and electrical properties. Their practical application is hindered by the strength, contact resistance, and high cost. Multi-principal elements alloys (MPEAs) provide the possibility to develop cost-effective materials with enhanced mechanical properties. To address this, a novel precious metal MPEA, PdAgCuAuPtZn alloy, is designed, which exhibits significant solid solution strengthening and aging strengthening effects. The ultimate tensile strength increases from 747 MPa in the solution state to 1126 MPa in the aged state, while resistivity remains low. This study presents the first systematic investigation into the strengthening mechanisms of precious metal MPEAs using nanoindentation technology. These findings indicate that the aging strengthening of the alloy is attributed to spinodal decomposition (SD) and chemical short-range order (CSRO) in the matrix. Furthermore, the precipitation structure with Cu-rich and Ag-rich phases gradually replaces the matrix, primarily accounting for aging softening. Additionally, it is discovered that precipitation structure can be strengthened by CSRO formed in the Cu-rich phase, thus providing an innovative strengthening in PdAgCuAuPtZn alloy. These results will be beneficial to both deeply understanding the aging behaviors of PdAgCuAuPtZn alloys and designing high-performance precious metal MPEAs.},

  abstract     = {Leveraging functional materials to develop advanced personal protective equipment is of significant importance for cutting off the propagation of infectious diseases, yet faces ongoing challenges owing to the unsatisfied antimicrobial efficiency. Herein a hierarchically porous cerium metal–organic framework (Ce-MOF) boosting the antimicrobial performance by intensifying catalytic reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and bacterial entrapment simultaneously is reported. This Ce-MOF presents dendritic surface topography and hierarchical pore channels where the Lewis acid Ce sites are dispersedly anchored. Attributing to this sophisticated nanoarchitecture rendering the catalytic Ce sites highly accessible, it shows a ca. 1800-fold activity enhancement for the catalytic conversion of atmospheric oxygen to highly toxic ROS compared to traditional CeO 2 . Additionally, the dendritic and negative-charged surface engineered in this Ce-MOF substantially enhances the binding affinity toward positive-charged bacteria, enabling the spatial proximity between the bacteria and the short-lived ROS and therefore maximizing the utilization of highly toxic ROS to inactivate bacteria. It is demonstrated that this Ce-MOF-integrated face mask displays almost 100% antimicrobial efficacy even in insufficient light and dark scenarios. This work provides important insights into the design of antibacterial MOF materials by a pore- and surface-engineering strategy and sheds new light on the development of advanced self-antimicrobial devices.},

Photocatalytic synthesis of H 2 O 2 via oxygen reduction and water oxidation reactions (ORR and WOR) is considered as a promising and desirable solution for on-site applications. However, the efficiency of such a process is low due to the poor solubility of molecular oxygen and the rapid reverse reaction of hydroxyl radicals ( • OH) with hydrogen atoms (H). Here, a strategy is proposed to boost the H 2 O 2 evolution via oxidation of water by employing a H acceptor ( A , nitrocyclohexane), an • OH mediator ( M , dioxane), and a photocatalyst (CdS nanosheets). While • OH radicals are stabilized by dioxane to produce ketyl radicals prior to the formation of H 2 O 2 , H atoms are effectively utilized in the generation of cyclohexanone oxime, an important intermediate in the production of Nylon 6. The system displays a rapid kinetic accumulation of H 2 O 2 (0.13 min −1 ) to a high concentration (6.6 m M ). At optimum reaction conditions, a high quantum efficiency (16.6%) and light-to-chemical conversion efficiency (4.9%) can be achieved under 410 nm irradiation.},

In this study, the double E strategy (exsolution and electrodeposition strategies) is successfully devised for synthesizing perovskite-based bifunctional electrocatalysts, enabling simultaneous OER and HER applications with exceptional catalytic performance. The synthesized R-LCTFe/Ni catalyst exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic activity, delivering low overpotentials of 349 and 309 mV at 10 mA cm −2 for OER and HER, respectively, indicating substantial improvements in the inherent electrocatalytic activity. Moreover, the impressive stability of R-LCTFe/Ni under alkaline conditions underscores its potential for practical water electrolysis applications. The superior bifunctional electrocatalytic performance can be attributed to the reduced charge transfer resistance and the synergistic cooperation between exsolved Fe nanoparticles and electrodeposited Ni compounds. The successful development of the R-LCTFe/Co catalyst further confirms the transferability of the double E strategy. Compared to R-LCTFe/Ni, the overpotential of R-LCTFe/Co is 58 mV higher for OER, yet 48 mV lower for HER at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 .

However, the specific mechanisms by which senescence contributes to OA progression are not fully understood. Here, it is attested that Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) is significantly upregulated in osteoarthritic chondrocytes in both humans and mice. DPP4 promotes oxidative stress and cellular senescence in chondrocytes through excessive mitochondrial fission in an enzyme-independent manner. Intra-articular injection of adeno-associated virus 2 to upregulate DPP4 in chondrocytes promotes post-traumatic and aging-induced OA in mice in an enzyme-independent manner. Mechanistically, DPP4 competitively binds to Myosin heavy chain 9 (MYH9), interfering with its E3 ubiquitin ligase Carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP), and thereby upregulates MYH9 expression. Finally, a small molecule, 4,5-Dicaffeoylquinic acid is identified, which disrupts the interaction between DPP4 and MYH9, thereby ameliorating post-traumatic and aging-induced OA in mice caused by DPP4 upregulation. The study indicates that the non-enzymatic activity of DPP4 is a promising target for OA treatment.},

  abstract     = {Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) continues to stand as a primary option for treating unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the increased tumor hypoxia and acidification will lead to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) featuring exhausted T cells, limiting the effectiveness of subsequent therapies following TACE. Herein, a stable water-in-oil lipiodol Pickering emulsion by employing calcium phosphate nanoparticles (CaP NPs) as stabilizers is developed and used to encapsulate L-arginine (L-Arg), which is known for its ability to modulate T-cell metabolism. The obtained L-Arg-loaded CaP-stabilized lipiodol Pickering emulsion (L-Arg@CaPL) with great emulsion stability can not only neutralize the tumor acidity via reaction of CaP NPs with protons but also enable the release of L-Arg, thereby synergistically promoting the reinvigoration of exhausted CD8 + T cells and effectively reversing tumor immunosuppression. As a result, TACE therapy with L-Arg@CaPL shows greatly improved therapeutic responses as demonstrated in an orthotopic liver tumor model in rats. This study highlights an effective yet simple nanoparticle-stabilized Pickering emulsion strategy to promote TACE therapy via modulation of the immunosuppressive TME, presenting great potential for clinical translation.},

  abstract     = {Vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) is a potential biomarker of major depressive disorder (MDD). This study demonstrates for the first time that VDBP is highly expressed in core emotion-related brain regions of mice susceptible to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). Specifically, the overexpression of microglia (MG)-derived VDBP in the prelimbic leads to depression-like behavior and aggravates CUMS-induced depressive phenotypes in mice, whereas conditional knockout of MG-derived VDBP can reverse both neuronal damage and depression-like behaviors. Mechanistically, the binding of MG-derived VDBP with the neuronal receptor megalin mediates the downstream SRC signaling pathway, leading to neuronal and synaptic damage and depression-like behaviors. These events may be caused by biased activation of inhibitory neurons and excitatory–inhibitory imbalance. Importantly, this study has effectively identified MG-derived VDBP as a pivotal mediator in the interplay between microglia and neurons via its interaction with the neuronal receptor megalin and intricate downstream impacts on neuronal functions, thus offering a promising therapeutic target for MDD.},

Different from these studies, this study focus on the behavior of individual soft robots from a material perspective. Here, a kind of soft fibers, which consist of hot melt adhesive particles, magnetizable microparticles, and ferroferric oxide microparticles embedded in a thermoplastic polyurethane matrix are proposed. The soft fibers can achieve wireless self-healing and reversible bonding of the fibers by eddy current heating and can be actuated by magnetic fields. Moreover, the soft fibers are recyclable and printable. Building on this material foundation, an integrated material-structure-actuation printing strategy using soft fibers for the design and fabrication of soft robots are reported. The robots printed by this strategy can achieve their untethered motions and wireless self-healing. Soft gripper, soft crawling robot, and soft multi-legged robot, are then fabricated which demonstrates the self-healing, self-reconfigurable, self-amputating, and sustainable performances of soft robots so as to adapt to different environments and tasks. This integrated material-structure-actuation printing strategy using soft fibers is universal, easy to implement, and mass-manufactured, opening a door for sustainable, eco-friendly, untethered, self-reconfigurable, self-amputating soft robots.},

While PTEN&#39;s role in neuronal growth is recognized, its long-term activation changes post-TBI and its effects on sensory-motor circuits are not well understood. Here, it is demonstrated that the neuronal knockout of PTEN (PTEN-nKO) significantly enhances both structural and functional recovery over the long term after TBI. Importantly, in vivo, DTI-MRI revealed that PTEN-nKO promotes white matter repair post-TBI. Additionally, calcium imaging and electromyographic recordings indicated that PTEN-nKO facilitates cortical remapping and restores sensory-motor pathways. Mechanistically, PTEN negatively regulates the Akt/mTOR pathway by inhibiting Akt, thereby suppressing mTOR. Raptor is a key component of mTORC1 and its suppression impedes axonal regeneration. The restoration of white matter integrity and the improvements in neural function observed in PTEN-nKO TBI-treated mice are reversed by a PTEN/Raptor double knockout (PTEN/Raptor D-nKO), suggesting that mTORC1 acts as a key mediator. These findings highlight persistent alterations in the PTEN/Akt/mTORC1 axis are critical for neural circuit remodeling and cortical remapping post-TBI, offering new insights into TBI pathophysiology and potential therapeutic targets.},

Recent studies have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) to psoriasis because of their immunomodulation functions. Yet, the outcome of MSC-EVs alone is still unsatisfactory and the underlying mechanisms are also unclear. Here, it is uncovered that arginase1 (Arg1)/polyamine is overexpressed in psoriasis patients and murine, inducing the in-situ accumulation of self-antigens. Engineered nor@MSC-EVs are fabricated by loading Arg1 inhibitor nor-NOHA into MSC-EVs for studying the therapeutic effect and mechanism of psoriasis. The nor@MSC-EVs exhibited profound suppression of the NF-κB signaling pathway by targeting Arg1/polyamine-mediated DCs/Th17 axis through scavenging self-antigens, resulting in superior mitigation of skin lesions and modulation of local and systemic metabolic and immunological disorders compared to the MSC-EVs and clinically used anti-IL17A both in vitro and in vivo.

Identifying diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets is a focal challenge in the PHH prevention and control. Here, this study applies multi-omics analyses to characterize the biochemical, proteomic, and metabolomic profiles of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in clinical human cohorts to investigate disease development and recovery processes occurring due to PHH. Integrative multiomics analysis suggests that the over-representation of ferroptosis, calcium, calcium ion binding, and cell adhesion signaling pathways is associated with PHH. Bioinformatic analysis indicates that chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4) is discovered as a CSF biomarker and positively correlated with the ventricular size and the rate of periventricular leukomalacia. Next, it is further demonstrated that these signaling pathways are dysregulated in the choroid plexus (ChP) in PHH by using in vitro cellular experiments and rat models of PHH, whereas CSPG4 silencing can suppress ferroptosis, cell adhesion function, and the intracellular flow of Ca 2+ . These findings broaden the understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of PHH and suggest that CSPG4 may be an effective therapeutic target for PHH.},

Indeed, the infection and inflammatory response in the early stages as well as blood vessel formation and tissue regeneration in the later stages fundamentally impact the outcomes of urethral wound healing. Innovatively, an integrated whole-process repair hydrogel (APF/C/L@dECM) is designed. After rigorous testing, it is found that hydrogels formed by hydrophobic association and double cross-linking of amide bonds can procedurally regulate wound healing in all phases to match the repair process. In rabbit models of urethral wound, APF/C/L@dECM hydrogel can achieve scarless reconstruction with significantly better results than other hydrogels. Noteworthily, multi-stage mechanistic explorations reveal the expression profiles of inflammation, vascularization, and extracellular matrix secretion-related genes in wound tissue at different times.

  abstract     = {Elevated uptake of saturated fatty acid palmitic acid (PA) is associated with tumor metastasis; however, the precise mechanisms remain partially understood, hindering the development of therapy for PA-driven tumor metastasis. The Hippo–Yes-associated protein (Hippo/YAP) pathway is implicated in cancer progression. Here it is shown that a high-palm oil diet potentiates tumor metastasis in murine xenografts in part through YAP. It is found that the palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC15 is a YAP-regulated gene that forms a feedback loop with YAP. Notably, PA drives the ZDHHC15-YAP feedback loop, thus enforces YAP signaling, and hence promotes tumor metastasis in murine xenografts. In addition, it is shown that ZDHHC15 associates with Kidney and brain protein (KIBRA, also known as WW- and C2 domain-containing protein 1, WWC1), an upstream component of Hippo signaling, and mediates its palmitoylation. KIBRA palmitoylation leads to its degradation and regulates its subcellular localization and activity toward the Hippo/YAP pathway. Moreover, PA enhances KIBRA palmitoylation and degradation. It is further shown that combinatorial targeting of YAP and fatty acid synthesis exhibits augmented effects against metastasis formation in mice fed with a Palm diet. Collectively, these findings uncover a ZDHHC15-YAP feedback loop as a previously unrecognized mechanism underlying PA-promoted tumor metastasis and support targeting YAP and fatty acid synthesis as potential therapeutic targets in PA-driven tumor metastasis.},

The damaged composite coating contains core–shell nanofibers that can be completely healed within only 30 min, indicating an outstanding healing efficiency. The corrosion current density ( I corr ) of the composite coatings containing core–shell nanofibers (abbreviated as composite coatings) is lower than the coatings without any fibers (abbreviated as pure resin coatings) during the test of repeated damage and healing cycles, showing superior resistance to corrosion and repeated self-healing property. The composite coating has even better mechanical properties such as tensile strength, bending strength, and impact strength than the pure resin coating, which are explained by simulating the deformation process. These excellent properties greatly improve the practicability of self-healing coatings in the application of anti-corrosion, especially in some special fields.},

Heterotypic cell clusters form between CTCs and white blood cells (WBCs) and recent studies report that a majority of these WBCs are neutrophils in patient and mouse models. The lab discovered that CTCs produce tubulin-based protrusions, microtentacles (McTNs), which promote reattachment, retention in distant sites during metastasis and formation of tumor cell clusters. Neutrophil-CTC clusters help CTCs survive the harsh vascular environment to promote successful metastasis, however, the specific mechanism of this interaction is not fully understood. Utilizing TetherChip technology, it is found that primary and differentiated neutrophils produce McTNs composed of detyrosinated and acetylated α-tubulin and vimentin. Neutrophil McTNs aid in cluster formation, migration, and reattachment, which are suppressed with the tubulin-depolymerizing agent, Vinorelbine. Co-culturing differentiated neutrophils and tumor cells formed heterotypic clusters that enhanced migration. CTC-neutrophil clusters have higher metastatic efficiency, and by demonstrating that neutrophils form McTNs, a new possible mechanism for how neutrophils interact with tumor cells is revealed. These findings further support the idea that developing cluster-disrupting therapies can provide a new targeted strategy to reduce the metastatic potential of cancer cells.},

  abstract     = {Atherosclerosis and its associated cardio-cerebrovascular complications remain the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Current lipid-lowering therapies reduce only approximately one-third of the cardiovascular risk. Furthermore, vascular restenosis and thrombotic events following surgical interventions for severe vascular stenosis significantly contribute to treatment failure. This highlights the urgent need for novel therapeutic targets to manage atherosclerosis and prevent restenosis and thrombosis after vascular injury. This study identifies TTK protein kinase (TTK) as a key regulator of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) phenotypic switching in the context of postinjury neointimal formation and atherosclerosis. Mechanistically, TTK upregulation in VSMCs phosphorylates p120-catenin, leading to β-catenin nuclear accumulation and dissociation of the myocardin (MYOCD)/serum response factor (SRF) complex. Deletion of TTK specifically in VSMCs reduces postinjury neointimal formation in vascular injury models and attenuates atherosclerotic lesions in ApoE −/− mice. Notably, oral administration of the TTK inhibitor CFI-402257 mitigated neointimal formation without impairing reendothelialization and reduced atherosclerotic lesions in ApoE −/− mice without altering lipid levels. These findings suggest that targeting TTK, through inhibitors or alternative strategies, represents a promising approach to simultaneously prevent postinjury restenosis and treat atherosclerosis.},

  abstract     = {Disturbances in the brain fluid balance can lead to life-threatening elevation in intracranial pressure (ICP), which represents a vast clinical challenge. Targeted and efficient pharmaceutical therapy of elevated ICP is not currently available, as the molecular mechanisms governing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) secretion are largely unresolved. To resolve the quantitative contribution of key choroid plexus transport proteins, this study employs mice with genetic knockout and/or viral choroid plexus-specific knockdown of aquaporin 1 (AQP1) and the Na + , K + , 2Cl − cotransporter 1 (NKCC1) for in vivo determinations of CSF dynamics, ex vivo choroid plexus for transporter-mediated clearance of a CSF K + load, and patient CSF for [K + ] quantification. CSF secretion and ICP management occur independently of choroid plexus AQP1 expression, whereas both parameters are reduced by 40% upon choroid plexus NKCC1 knockdown. Elevation of [K + ] CSF increases the choroid plexus Na + /K + -ATPase activity, and favors inwardly-directed net NKCC1 transport, which, together, promote CSF K + clearance, while maintaining undisturbed CSF secretion rates. CSF from patients with post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus does not display elevated [K + ] CSF , suggesting that NKCC1 maintains net outward transport direction during post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus formation. Direct or indirect therapeutic modulation of choroid plexus NKCC1 can thus be a potential promising pharmacological approach against brain pathologies associated with elevated ICP.},

  abstract     = {Although left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are an alternative to heart transplantation, their artificial surfaces often lead to serious thrombotic complications requiring high-risk device replacement. Coating blood-contacting surfaces with antithrombogenic endothelial cells is considered an effective strategy for preventing thrombus formation. However, this concept has not yet been successfully implemented in LVADs, as severe cell loss is to be expected, especially on the impeller surface with high prothrombogenic supraphysiological shear stress. This study presents a strategy that exploits the magnetic attraction of the impeller on ECs loaded with iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) to minimize shear stress-induced cell detachment from the rotating magnetic impeller while ensuring antithrombogenic EC adhesion, especially as a bridge until they formed their adhesion-promoting matrix. In contrast to polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-coated IONPs, more efficient and safer cell loading is achieved with sodium citrate (Cit)-stabilized IONPs, where incubation with 6.6 µg iron mL-1 Cit-IONPs for 24 h resulting in an average internalization of 23 pg iron per cell. Internalization of Cit-IONP significantly improved cell attraction to the highly magnetic impeller surface without affecting cell viability or antithrombogenic function. This protocol is key for the development of a biohybrid LVAD impeller that can prevent life-threatening thrombosis and hemorrhage in a future clinical application.},

  abstract     = {Totipotent cells can differentiate into three lineages: the epiblast, primitive endoderm, and trophectoderm. Naturally, only early fertilized embryos possess totipotency, and they lose this ability as they develop. The expansion of stem cell differentiation potential has been a hot topic in developmental biology for years, particularly with respect to the generation totipotent-like stem cells. Here, the study describes the establishment of totipotency in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) via the deletion of a single gene, Pdzk1 . Pdzk1 -knockout (KO) ESCs substantially contribute to the fetus, placenta, and yolk sac in chimera assays but can also self-organize to form standard blastocyst-like structures containing the three lineages efficiently; thus, they exhibit full developmental potential as early blastomeres. Single-cell transcriptome and bulk RNA-seq comprehensive analyses revealed that Pdzk1 -KO activates several lineage inducers ( C1qa , C1qb , Fgf5 , and Cdx2 ) to break down barriers between embryonic and extraembryonic tissues, making these lineages switch smoothly and resulting in a totipotent-like state. This versatile and scalable system provides a robust experimental model for differentiation potency and cell fate studies.},

  abstract     = {The evaporation of drops on solid surfaces is a ubiquitous natural phenomenon, and their dynamics play a pivotal role in many biological, environmental, and industrial processes. However, the complexity of the underlying mechanisms has largely confined previous studies to liquid drop evaporation under atmospheric conditions. In this study, the first comprehensive investigation of the evaporation dynamics of conducting polymer-containing drops under controlled vacuum environments is presented. Utilizing high-speed imaging of a drop within a vacuum chamber, it is observed that the evaporation of a sessile drop under vacuum conditions unfolds through four distinct stages: Constant Contact Radius (CCR), Constant Contact Angle (CCA), Increasing Contact Angle (ICA), and Stick and Slip (S&amp;S) modes. The detailed analysis of the force balance reveals that the depinning dynamics of the contact line, significantly driven by vacuum-induced forces, are the primary factor distinguishing these evaporation modes. A modified diffusion-limited model specifically tailored for vacuum conditions is further developed, which closely aligns with the experimental data on volume reduction over time. Importantly, the study demonstrates that by carefully adjusting the vacuum level, it is possible to precisely manipulate the final film morphology, with uniform deposition achieved at an optimal pressure of 20 kPa. This research introduces a novel approach for controlling drop evaporation dynamics in vacuum, with potential applications in advanced manufacturing processes.},

In addition, realization of mono-, di-, tri-, or polyfluoroalkyation usually requires distinct types of fluoroalkylating reagents under different or even harsh reaction conditions, and a universal method to accomplish different hydrofluoroalkylation of alkenes is lacking. Herein, the use of quaternary fluoroalkyl alcohols is reported as the universal fluoroalkylating reagents to readily facilitate mono-, di-, tri-, or polyfluoroalkylation of a wide range of alkene substrates in high yields. Moreover, a cascade reaction of hydrofluoroalkylation followed by intramolecular fluoroalkylation facilitates the construction of a variety of high-value complex heterocycles bearing diverse fluoroalkyl functionalities from alkenes. Mechanistic studies suggest that a proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) process may be involved through a radical-generating pathway. The utility of this method is showcased by the late-stage fluoroalkylation of various high-value complex molecules derived from either natural products or drug-like compounds. Of note is that a continuous-flow system is amenable to this homogeneous photoredox conditions, thereby opening up a possibility of using this protocol to realize large-scale manufacturing of fluoroalkyl products with industrial interests.},

To achieve this target, and allow for a large and scalable number of channels, flexible electronics can be used as a multiplexing interface. This work introduces an active analog front-end fabricated with amorphous Indium-Gallium-Zinx-Oxide (a-IGZO) Thin-Film Transistors (TFTs) on foil capable of active matrix multiplexing. The circuit achieves only 70nV per sqrt(Hz) input referred noise, consuming 46µW, or 3.5mW cm −2 . It demonstrates for the first time in literature a flexible front-end with a noise efficiency factor comparable with Silicon solutions (NEF = 9.8), which is more than 10X lower compared to previously reported flexible front-ends. These results have been achieved using a modified bootstrap-load amplifier. The front end is tested by playing through it recordings obtained from a conventional BCI system. A gesture classification based on the flexible front-end outputs achieves 94% accuracy. Using a flexible active front end can improve the state-of-the-art in high channel count BCI systems by lowering the multiplexer noise and enabling larger areas of the brain to be monitored while reducing power density. Therefore, this work enables a new generation of high channel-count active BCI electrode grids.},

This technique achieves significant improvements in thermal conductivity by effectively aligning hBN nanosheets. This research shows that hBN nanosheets, when aligned, can drastically enhance thermal conductivity in PDMS composites. Specifically, 10 wt.% vertically aligned hBN nanosheets in a rotating magnetic field achieve a thermal conductivity of 3.58 W mK −1 , an impressive 1950% increase over pure PDMS. Additionally, the study explores the effects of orientation on dielectric properties, finding that the orientation of hBN nanosheets also improves electrical insulation and increases the dielectric constant while maintaining extremely low dielectric losses. For a vertically oriented sample, the dielectric constant reaches ≈14, and dielectric losses are as low as 0.0049 at 100 Hz, highlighting their potential for energy storage capacitors.

This study explores an non-antibiotic approach that extends beyond conventional porphyrin-based phototherapy by using blue light (BL) in conjunction with ferric ions (Fe(III)) to disrupt and eradicate biofilms. The dual not only degraded biofilm extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in mono-species and polymicrobial biofilms by specifically targeting carboxyl-containing polysaccharides within the matrix but also exhibited broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity by affecting key components of the outer membrane and cell wall. Bacteria, such as K. pneumoniae , with compromised EPS after photolysis, demonstrated increased susceptibility to macrophage phagocytosis. Disruption of the polymicrobial biofilm structure also enhanced the bacterial susceptibility to bactericidal drugs. Treating wounds infected by mixed-species biofilm in diabetic mice demonstrated a substantial reduction in bacterial colonization and improved tissue repair. The BL-Fe(III) modality offers a safe, efficient alternative for managing chronic wound infections, making it ideal for repeated, non-invasive use at home, especially in resource-limited areas.},

  abstract     = {Terahertz (THz) polarization detection facilitates the capture of multidimensional data, including intensity, phase, and polarization state, with broad applicability in high-resolution imaging, communication, and remote sensing. However, conventional semiconductor materials are limited by energy band limitations, rendering them unsuitable for THz detection. Overcoming this challenge, the realization of high-stability, room-temperature polarization-sensitive THz photodetectors (PDs) leveraging the thermoelectric effect of Cs 0.05 (FA 0.85 MA 0.15 ) 0.95 Pb(I 0.85 Br 0.15 ) 3 (CsFAMA)/metasurfaces is presented. Two different structures of (T-shaped and I-shaped) THz PDs are constructed. The incorporation of perovskite/metasurfaces forms enhanced local field thermoelectric effect and polarization response. Owning to THz surface plasmon polariton (SPP) resonance effect and more boundary effect, the I-shaped PDs exhibit superior performance, achieving a response of up to 94 V/W, with a response time of 138 µs, a low noise-equivalent power of 5.03 pW/Hz 1/2 and an anisotropy ratio of 1.38 under 0.1THz laser irradiation. Furthermore, the PD&#39;s stability is verified with the anisotropy ratio decreased by only 2% and polarization imaging results after 240 days of storage in air condition. This research introduces a method for achieving high-performance, stable THz polarization detection technology, with significant potential for advancements in materials science, communication technology, and medical imaging.},

  abstract     = {Currently, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are at the forefront of energy storage technologies. Silicon-based anodes, with their high capacity and low cost, present a promising alternative to traditional graphite anodes in LIBs, offering the potential for substantial improvements in energy density. However, the significant volumetric changes that silicon-based anodes undergo during charge and discharge cycles can lead to structural degradation. Furthermore, the formation of excessive solid-electrolyte interphases (SEIs) during cycling impedes the efficient migration of ions and electrons. This comprehensive review focuses on the structural design and optimization of micron-scale silicon-based anodes from both materials and systems perspectives. Significant progress is made in the development of advanced electrolytes, binders, and conductive additives that complement micron-scale silicon-based anodes in both half and full-cells. Moreover, advancements in system-level technologies, such as pre-lithiation techniques to mitigate irreversible Li + loss, have enhanced the energy density and lifespan of micron-scale silicon-based full cells. This review concludes with a detailed classification of the underlying mechanisms, providing a comprehensive summary to guide the development of high-energy-density devices. It also offers strategic insights to address the challenges associated with the large-scale deployment of silicon-based LIBs.},

  abstract     = {The vascular response following injury is pivotal for successful bone-defect repair but constitutes a major hurdle in the field of regenerative medicine. Throughout this process, vessel stabilization is crucial to provide an adequate nutrient supply and facilitate efficient waste removal. Therefore, this study investigated whether promoting vascular stabilization improves bone defect repair outcomes. The findings show that insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP) 7 exhibits a novel biological function in attenuating vascular permeability and enhancing vascular wall integrity. The potential underlying mechanism involves the up-regulation of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) expression by IGFBP7 on endothelial cell membrane, followed by activation of the downstream PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and upregulated expression of the tight junction protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). IGFBP7 delayed administration in mice with cranial defects significantly improved bone defect healing by increasing ZO-1 and CD31 co-localization within vessel walls and optimizing the perfusion function of the final vascular network. Furthermore, the application of the typical tight junction regulator AT1001 effectively promoted ZO-1-dependent vascular stabilization and facilitated bone defect repair. This study presents a new approach to enhance bone defect healing via vascular stabilization-targeted interventions and significantly advances the understanding of the complex interplay between osteogenesis and angiogenesis in bone defect healing.},

To enable studying the cellular dynamics of linkage-specific ubiquitination, light-activatable polyubiquitin chain formation is reported here. By incorporating a photocaged lysine at specific sites within ubiquitin through amber codon suppression, light-dependent activation of ubiquitin chain extension is enabled for the monitoring of linkage-specific polyubiquitination. The studies reveal rapid, minute-scale ubiquitination kinetics for K11, K48, and K63 linkages. The role of individual components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in K48-initiated chain synthesis is further studied by small molecule inhibition. The approach expands current perturbation strategies with the ability to control linkage-specific ubiquitination with high temporal resolution and should find broad application for studying ubiquitinome dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Ischemia-free liver transplantation (IFLT) is developed as a novel clinical approach to avoid ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). This study aims to identify the most distinguished programmed cell death pathway in grafts undergoing IFLT versus conventional liver transplantation (CLT) and to explore the underlying mechanism. Ferroptosis is the most distinct programmed cell death form between IFLT and CLT grafts. Among various cell death inhibitors, the ferroptosis inhibitor (Ferrostain-1) is the most effective one to prevent hepatocytes from damage induced by oxygen deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R). Hepatocyte ferroptosis is significantly alleviated in IFLT versus CLT grafts in both human beings and pigs. Ubiquitination enzyme screening identifies augmented amounts of ubiquitin-specific protease 19 (USP19) in IFLT versus CLT grafts. The upregulation of USP19 in the grafts is correlated with reduced pathological Suzuki&#39;s score, lower post-transplant peak liver enzyme level, and less early allograft dysfunction in liver transplant recipients. USP19 overexpression mitigates post-transplant liver injury in mice. Mechanistically, USP19 inhibits the degradation of solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) by removing its K63-linked ubiquitin chains. Notably, USP19 overexpression reduces ferroptosis and IRI in a SLC7A11-dependent manner in mice. Collectively, USP19-mediated suppression of hepatocyte ferroptosis via deubiquitinating SLC7A11 is a key mechanism by which IFLT abrogates graft IRI.},

Sperm navigate by modulating the symmetry of their flagellar beating, but how they swim forward with asymmetrical beats remains unclear. Current methods lack the ability to robustly detect the flagellar symmetry state in free-swimming spermatozoa, despite its importance in understanding sperm motility. This study uses numerical simulations to investigate the fluid mechanics of sperm swimming with asymmetrical flagellar beats. Results show that sperm rotation regularizes the swimming motion, allowing persistently progressive swimming even with asymmetrical flagellar beats. Crucially, 3D sperm head orientation, rather than the swimming path, provides critical insight into the flagellar symmetry state. Sperm rotations during swimming closely resemble spinning-top dynamics, with sperm head precession driven by the helical beating of the flagellum. These results may prove essential in future studies on the role of symmetry in microorganisms and artificial swimmers, as body orientation detection has been largely overlooked in favor of swimming path analysis. Altogether, this rotational mechanism provides a reliable solution for forward propulsion and navigation in nature, which would otherwise be challenging for flagella with broken symmetry.},

The microcapsules are comprised of aqueous cores that facilitate hiPSC-hep aggregating into spheroids, and hybrid hydrogel shells of sodium alginate and hyaluronic acid methacryloyl (HAMA). By selectively degrading the alginate, the microcapsules are imparted with porous HAMA shells, which not only allowed human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to attach and form vascularized networks, but also facilitated communication between HUVECs and hiPSC-heps.

The altered host response and respiratory microbiome following LRTIs have the potential to differentiate LRTIs from noninfectious respiratory diseases (non-LRTIs). Patients suspected of having LRTIs are retrospectively enrolled and a clinical metatranscriptome test is performed on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Transcriptomic and metagenomic analysis profiled the host response and respiratory microbiome in patients with confirmed LRTI ( n = 126) or non-LRTIs ( n = 75). Patients with evidenced LRTIs exhibited enhanced pathways on chemokine and cytokine response, neutrophile recruitment and activation, along with specific gene modules linked to LRTIs status and key blood markers. Moreover, LRTIs patients exhibited reduced diversity and evenness in the lower respiratory microbiome, likely driven by an increased abundance of bacterial pathogens. Host marker genes are selected, and classifiers are developed to distinguish patients with LRTIs, non-LRTIs, and indeterminate status, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80 to 0.86 and validated in a subsequently enrolled cohort.

  abstract     = {The development of primary liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC] and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma [ICC]) is linked to its physical microenvironment, particularly extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness. Potential anticancer strategies targeting ECM stiffness include prevention/reversal of the stiffening process and disruption of the response of cancer cells to mechanical signals from ECM. However, each strategy has limitations. Therefore, the authors propose integrating them to maximize their strengths. Compared with HCC, ICC has a stiffer ECM and a worse prognosis. Therefore, ICC is selected to investigate mechanisms underlying the influence of ECM stiffness on cancer progression and application of the integrated anticancer strategy targeting ECM stiffness. In summary, immunofluorescence results for 181 primary liver cancer tissue chips (ICC, n = 91; HCC, n = 90) and analysis of TCGA mRNA-sequencing demonstrate that ECM stiffness can affect phenotypes of primary liver cancers. The YAP1/ABHD11-AS1/STAU2/ZYX/p-YAP1 pathway is a useful entry point for exploration of specific mechanisms of mechanical signal conduction from the ECM in ICC cells and their impact on cancer progression.

  abstract     = {Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune disease characterized by extensive skin and internal organ fibrosis. However, the mechanism underlying fibrosis remains unclear, and effective treatments for halting or reversing fibrosis are lacking. In this study, single-cell RNA sequencing is used to obtain a comprehensive overview of skin cells from patients with SSc and healthy controls. A subset of basal cells with high chitinase 3-like 1 (Chi3L1) expression, which potentially plays an important role in fibroblast activation, is identified in SSc. Subsequently, patients with SSc are present with increased expression of Chi3L1 in the skin and serum, and elevated serum levels are associated with skin induration and pulmonary function. Furthermore, Chi3L1 promoted the differentiation of SSc dermal fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, and Chi3L1-deficient (Chi3L1-/-) mice showed amelioration of fibrosis in a bleomycin-induced SSc (BLM-SSc) model. Mechanistically, Chi3L1 mediates fibroblast activation primarily by interacting with interleukin-17 receptor A (IL-17RA), thereby initiating downstream nuclear factor kappa B and mitogen-activated protein kinases signaling pathways. Moreover, the anti-fibrotic effect of IL-17RA antagonists in BLM-SSc mice is demonstrated. In conclusion, Chi3L1 is a potential biomarker for the degree of fibrosis in SSc. Chi3L1 and its receptor, IL-17RA, are promising therapeutic targets for patients with SSc.},

However, the intrinsically inferior thermodynamic stability and laborious crystallization kinetics control under humidity interference limit the fabrication of blue perovskite emitters in ambient air. Here, air-processed pure-bromide quasi-2D blue perovskite films are achieved with stabilized lattice and tunable emission by interstitial doping of trivalent metallic cations. This strategy improves the formation energy of the perovskite lattice, promotes energy transfer between different n phases, and suppresses intrinsic electron-phonon coupling in the perovskite films. The emission-controllable blue PeLEDs are fabricated in ambient air for the first time. The champion deep blue PeLED shows maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 2.05% and luminance of 246.56 cd m −2 , which are comparable to the state-of-the-art of similar devices fabricated in glovebox. The work pioneers a simple method of electronic structure engineering to tune the emission of air-processed blue perovskite, breaking the limitations of thermodynamic stability and crystallization kinetics control of perovskite in ambient air.},

  abstract     = {Membrane processes are promising for energy-saving industrial applications. However, efficient separation for some valuable gas mixtures with similar characteristics, such as CH 4 /N 2 and O 2 /N 2 , remains extremely challenging. Metal–organic framework (MOF) membranes have been attracting intensive attention for gas sieving, but it is difficult to manufacture MOF membranes in scalability and precisely tune their transport property. In this study, Gel-thermal processing of linker-mixed MOF crystal-glass composite membranes is reported directly, with the mechanism of adjusting metal-linker bond strengths and angles to disrupt long-range periodicity of MOFs and promote glass phase formation, for sharply sorption-preferential gas separation. This strategy can be realized by using a simple, solvent/precursor-less, and cost-effective gel-thermal approach with two steps of gel coating and thermal conversion, thereby constructing crystal-glass composite membranes in a controllable, processable, versatile, and environmentally friendly route. Moreover, the mixed linkers enable preferential gas affinities and the ultramicroporous glasses can eliminate any membrane defects. The membranes exhibit outstanding gas separation performance for the challenging systems of CH 4 /N 2 and O 2 /N 2 , with mixture selectivities up to 9.3 and 9.6, respectively, far exceeding those of polymer, MOF, and mixed-matrix membranes. The study provides an available route for architecting high-performance membranes for gas separations.},

The study reveals that transcription regulator cyclin-dependent kinase7 (CDK7) is a promising target to circumvent TNBC&#39;s inherent resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors. Combining CDK4/6 and CDK7 inhibitors significantly enhances therapeutic effectiveness, leading to a marked decrease in cholesterol biosynthesis within cells. This effect is achieved through reduced activity of the transcription factor forkhead box M1 (FOXM1), which normally increases cholesterol production by inducing SREBF1 expression. Furthermore, this dual inhibition strategy attenuates the recruitment of sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (SREBP1) and p300 to genes essential for cholesterol synthesis, thus hindering tumor growth. This research is corroborated by an in-house cohort showing lower survival rates in TNBC patients with higher cholesterol production gene activity. This suggests a new treatment approach for TNBC by simultaneously targeting CDK4/6 and CDK7, warranting additional clinical trials.},

Here, it is demonstrated that PBRM1 knockdown induced M1 macrophage polarization and infiltration, which enhanced the efficacy of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in RCC. Meanwhile, CDC20 catalyzes K27 ubiquitination of PBRM1 and promotes its degradation via p62-mediated selective autophagy. A bicyclic peptide (PB1-p62) is designed and constructed to target PBRM1 and p62, thereby promoting the degradation of PBRM1. As a result, the efficacy of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy is enhanced, leading to improved overall survival rates in syngeneic mouse tumor models.

  abstract     = {High serum level of palmitic acid(PA) is implicated in pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. PA serves as the substrate for protein palmitoylation. However, it is still unknown whether palmitoylation is involved in PA-induced cardiovascular dysfunction. Here, in clinical cohort studies of 1040 patients with coronary heart disease, high level of PA is associated with risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and death. In ApoE −/− mice, 10 mg/kg −1 PA treatment induces blood pressure elevation, cardiac contractile dysfunction, endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerotic plaqueformation. In endothelial cells, inhibition of palmitoylation bypalmitoyl-transferase inhibitor 2-BP eliminates PA-induced endothelial injury, whereas promotion of palmitoylation by depalmitoylase inhibitor ML349 exacerbates the harmful effect of PA. Palmitoyl-proteomics analysis identifies pyruvate kinase isozyme type M2 (PKM2) as the palmitoylated protein responsible for PA-induced endothelial injury, and Cys31 as the predominant palmitoylated site. PKM2-C31S mutants (cysteine replaced by serine) prevents PA-induced endothelial injury. Endothelial-specific AAV-C31S PKM2 endo ameliorates cardiovascular dysfunction caused by PA in ApoE −/− mice. Mechanistically, PKM2-C31 palmitoylation impairs PKM2 tetramerization to inhibit its pyruvate kinase activity and endothelial glycolysis. Finally, zDHHC13 is identified as the palmitoyl acyltransferase of PKM2. In conclusion, these findings suggest that PKM2-C31 palmitoylation contributes to PA-induced endothelial injury and cardiovascular dysfunction.},

  abstract     = {Glucose electrocatalytic-conversion reaction (GCR) is a promising anode reaction to replace the slow oxygen evolution reaction (OER), thus promoting the development of hydrogen production by electrochemical water splitting. Herein, NiFe-based metal-organic framework (MOF) is used as a precursor to prepare W-doped nickel-iron phosphide (W-NiFeP) nanosheet arrays by ion exchange and phosphorylation, which exhibit a high electrocatalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), featuring an overpotential of only −179 mV to achieve the current density of 100 mA cm −2 in alkaline media. Notably, electrochemical activation of W-NiFeP facilitates the in situ formation of phosphate groups producing W,P-NiFeOOH, which, in conjunction with the W co-doped amorphous layers, leads to a high electrocatalytic performance toward GCR, due to enhanced proton transfer and adsorption of reaction intermediates, as confirmed in experimental and theoretical studies. Thus, the two-electrode electrolyzer of the W-NiFeP/NF||W,P-NiFeOOH/NF for HER||GCR needs only a low cell voltage of 1.56 V to deliver 100 mA cm −2 at a remarkable hydrogen production efficiency of 1.86 mmol h −1 , with a high glucose conversion (98.0%) and formic acid yields (85.2%).

  abstract     = {Membranes with switchable wettability, solvent resistance, and toughness have emerged as promising materials for separation applications. However, challenges like limited mechanical strength, poor chemical stability, and structural defects during membrane fabrication hinder their widespread adoption. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), crystalline materials constructed from organic molecules connected by covalent bonds, offer a promising solution due to their high porosity, stability, and customizable properties. The ordered structures and customizable functionality provide COFs with a lightweight framework, large surface area, and tunable pore sizes, which have attracted increasing attention for their applications in membrane separations. Recent research has extensively explored the preparation strategies of COF membranes and their applications in various separation processes. This review uniquely delves into the influence of various COF membrane fabrication techniques, including interfacial polymerization, layer-by-layer assembly, and in situ growth, on membrane thickness and performance. It comprehensively explores the design strategies and potential applications of these methods, with a particular focus on gas separation, oil/water separation, and organic solvent nanofiltration. Furthermore, future opportunities, challenges within this field, and potential directions for future development are proposed.},

  abstract     = {Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are an ideal candidate for next-generation photovoltaic applications but face many challenges for their wider application, including uncontrolled fast crystallization, trap-assisted nonradiative recombination, and inefficient charge transport. Herein, a multistage regulation (MSR) strategy for addressing these challenges is proposed via the introduction of fluorine-rich small molecules with multiple active points (i.e., 1-[Bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)methyl]- 2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzene (TFSP)) into the precursor solution of the perovskite film. The addition of TFSP effectively delays and regulates the crystallization and growth process of the perovskite film for larger grains and fewer defects, and it effectively improves the coverage of self-assembled molecules for efficient charge transport. The multiple active points of TFSP induce a strong binding affinity with uncoordinated defects in the perovskite film. Moreover, the high fluorine content of TFSP induces strong electronegativity to establish a high binding strength between the perovskite film and electron transport layer. Finally, PSCs prepared by the MSR strategy demonstrated an optimal power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.46% and maintained 91.16% of the initial PCE under nonpackaged air conditions and at a relative humidity of 45% after 3000 h.},

In particular, high relative humidity (RH) commonly causes severe MHP degradation, which poses a major obstacle to long-term device operation. Herein, high RH-induced growth of anisotropic MHP structures on glass surfaces is reported under 25 °C and atmospheric conditions on a basis of glass corrosion by moisture. Nanowires (NWs) with tunable length and composition are obtained under 85% RH air, and water molecule-induced facet engineering of perovskite is established for anisotropic growth. Importantly, single-mode photonic lasing in these MHP NWs with thickness at sub-100-nm scale (down to 75 nm ∼ 1/7 lasing wavelength) is achieved via both one-photon and multiphoton pumping. These nanowire lasers exhibited high quality factor (&gt;3000), high degree of polarization (≈0.9), and excellent stability under laser irradiation. The work not only presents a distinctive technique for the growth of MHPs but also endows MHP NWs with new opportunities for nonlinear optics, strong light-matter interactions, and active photonic integrated devices.},

A methodology based on strain-governed, bistable soft shells that process digital information by interchanging their internal/external surfaces is proposed. This bistable behavior, explained via model-based design, safeguards robustness by working only once for each input pulse. Thus, these shells are leveraged to create a buffer and a NOT gate that lead to six fundamental gates (AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR). All these functions are integrated into a unique programmable device, making mechanically integrated circuits more adaptable with rule-changeable logic operations. This design ensures continuous processes and general applicability to multiple types of signals (a pressurized fluid can replace mechanical driving signals is shown).

Advanced compliant electrodes have been developed because of their biomechanical compatibility.

Here, a peripheral nerve electrode is developed that simultaneously fulfills the criteria of body temperature softening and tissue-like modulus (less than 0.8 MPa at 37 °C) after implantation. The central core is altered from the tri-arm crosslinker to the star-branched monomer to kill two birds (close the translation temperature to 37 °C and decrease the modulus after implantation) with one stone. Furthermore, the decreased interfacial impedance (325.1 ± 46.9 Ω at 1 kHz) and increased charge storage capacity (111.2 ± 5.8 mC cm −2 ) are achieved by an in situ electrografted conductive polymer on the strain-insensitive conductive network of Au nanotubes. The electrodes are readily wrapped around nerves and applied for long-term stimulation in vivo with minimal inflammation. Neuromodulation experiments demonstrate their potential clinical utility, including vagus nerve stimulation in rats to suppress seizures and alleviation of cardiac remodeling in a canine model of myocardial infarction.},

  abstract     = {Radioactive iodine-125 ( 125 I) seed implantation, a brachytherapy technique, effectively kills tumor cells via X-rays and gamma rays, serving as an alternative therapeutic option following the failure of frontline treatments for various solid tumors. However, tumor radioresistance limits its efficacy. Hydrogen gas has anticancer properties and can enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy. However, its role in radiotherapy sensitization has rarely been reported. Many current hydrogen delivery methods involve hydrogen-generating nanomaterials, such as magnesium-based nanomaterials. This study introduces an AZ31 magnesium alloy 125 I seed strand (termed AMASS) with pH-dependent slow-release hydrogen characteristics and excellent mechanical properties. AMASS can be implanted into tumors via minimally invasive surgery, releasing hydrogen around the 125 I seeds. In vitro experiments showed that hydrogen from AMASS degradation significantly inhibited tumor proliferation, increased apoptosis, disrupted redox homeostasis and mitochondrial membrane potential, reduced adenosine triphosphate levels, and induced DNA damage due to 125 I radiation. In mouse xenograft and rabbit liver tumor models, hydrogen from AMASS showed superior therapeutic effects compared with 125 I seeds alone, with no noticeable side effects. In addition, AMASS has a uniform radiation dose distribution and simple implantation. Therefore, hydrogen from AMASS enhanced 125 I seed efficacy, supporting the further promotion and application of 125 I seed implantation in cancer therapy.},

Recent developments in genetic engineering, including efficient gene manipulation and transformation methods, gene editing and synthetic biology, coupled with the understanding of microbial pathogenicity and plant immunity, both at molecular and genomic levels, have enhanced the capabilities to develop disease resistance in plants. This review comprehensively explains the fundamental mechanisms underlying the tug-of-war between pathogens and hosts, and provides a detailed overview of different strategies for developing disease resistance in plants. Additionally, it provides a summary of the potential genes that can be employed in resistance breeding for key crops to combat a wide range of potential pathogens and pests, including fungi, oomycetes, bacteria, viruses, nematodes, and insects. Furthermore, this review addresses the limitations associated with these strategies and their possible solutions.

WD repeat domain 36 (WDR36) is known to play a critical role in mouse early embryonic development, but its regulatory function in human embryogenesis is still elusive due to limited access to human embryos. The human pluripotent stem cell-derived blastocyst-like structure, termed a blastoid, offers an alternative means to study human development in a dish. In this study, after verifying that WDR36 inhibition disrupted polarization in mouse early embryos, it is further demonstrated that WDR36 interference can block human blastoid formation, dominantly hindering the trophectoderm lineage commitment. Both transcriptomics and targeted metabolomics analyses revealed that WDR36 interference downregulated glucose metabolism. WDR36 can interact with glycolytic metabolic protein lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), thereby positively regulating glycolysis during the late stage of human blastoid formation. Taken together, the study has established a mechanistic connection between WDR36, glucose metabolism, and cell fate determination during early embryonic lineage commitment, which may provide potential insights into novel therapeutic targets for early adverse pregnancy interventions.},

In contrast, loss of TRAF2 facilitated CD47 autophagic degradation and inhibited tumor immune escape.

The study focuses on one specific class of problem, the detection of single amino acid variants involving proline, and reports a Pro-selective electrochemiluminescence (ECL) method. To develop this method, the A1-/A2- variants of milk&#39;s β-casein protein are investigated because it is a well-established example and abundant samples are readily available. Specifically, β-casein has 209 amino acids with 34 (or 35) proline residues: the A1-variant has a Pro-to-His substitution at position 67 (relative to the A2 variant). The study shows that proline&#39;s strong luminescence allows the generic discrimination of: Pro from other amino acids; an A2-oligopeptide from an A1-oligopeptide; the A2-β-casein variant from the A1-variant; and commercially-available A2 milks from A1-containing regular milks. The evidence indicates that luminescence depends on proline content and accessibility, as well as signal quenching. Compared to conventional immunoassays, the ECL method is simple, rapid, and inexpensive. Further, the ECL-method is Pro-selective (vs molecularly-selective like typical immunoassays) which should make it broadly useful for studying the role of proline in biology and especially useful for tracking the digestion of proline-rich proteins in the diet.},

One way to accomplish this is with an electric field, a phenomenon termed electroadhesion (EA). Here, it is shown that cationic gels can be adhered by EA to tissues across all of biology . This includes tissues from animals, including humans and other mammals; birds; fish; reptiles (e.g., lizards); amphibians (e.g., frogs), and invertebrates (e.g., shrimp, worms). Gels can also be adhered to soft tissues from plants, including fruit (e.g., plums) and vegetables (e.g; carrot). In all cases, EA is induced by a low electric field (DC, 10 V) applied for a short time (20 s). After the field is removed, the adhesion persists. The adhesion can also be reversed by applying the field with opposite polarity. In mammals, EA is strong for many tissues (e.g., arteries, muscles, and cornea), but not others (e.g., adipose, brain). Tissues with anisotropic structure show anisotropic adhesion strength by EA. The higher the concentration of anionic polymers in a tissue, the stronger its adhesion to cationic gels. This underscores that EA is mediated by the electrophoresis of chain segments across the gel-tissue interface.},

As a proof-of-concept, the photosensitizers of carbon nanodots (CDs)-loaded chlorin e6 (CDs-Ce6) are designed and integrated with the peroxalate molecules, and the as-prepare polymer carbon nanodots ( p -CDs) exhibit novel tumor microenvironment (TME)-responsive long-persistent near-infrared CL and photochemical reactions, evoking the in vivo imaging and synergistic dynamic therapy in tumor tissue. Mechanistically, the excess reactive oxygen species in TME can trigger the chemically initiated singlet/triplet electron exchange between the hydrophobic CDs-Ce6 and peroxalate-derived 1,2-dioxetanes and thus the excess excited singlet/triplet electron of the CDs-Ce6 can ensure the long-persistent near-infrared CL, type I/II photochemical production of hydroxyl radicals, superoxide radical and singlet oxygen, and type III photochemical damage of maladjusted biomacromolecules, enabling the long-persistent near-infrared biological imaging and enhanced cancer therapy. These results shed a new sight into the energy transfer mechanism in chemiluminescence and pave a new sight into the architecture of multifunctional theragnostic nanoplatforms.},

  abstract     = {While animals across species typically experience suppressed consciousness and an increased arousal threshold during sleep, the responsiveness to specific sensory inputs persists. Previous studies have demonstrated that rhythmic and continuous vibration can enhance sleep in both animals and humans. However, the neural circuits underlying vibration-induced sleep (VIS) and its potential therapeutic benefits on neuropathological processes in disease models remain unclear. Here, it is shown that intermittent vibration, such as cycles of 30 s on followed by 30 s off, is more effective in inducing sleep compared to continuous vibration. A clear evidence is further provided that allatostatin A (AstA)-GABA signaling mediates short-term intermittent vibration-induced sleep (iVIS) by inhibiting octopaminergic arousal neurons through activating GABA A receptors. The existence of iVIS in mice is corroborated, implicating the GABAergic system in this process. Finally, intermittent vibration not only enhances sleep but also reduces amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition and reverses memory defects in Alzheimer&#39;s disease models. In conclusion, the study defines a central neural circuit involved in mediating short-term iVIS and the potential implications of vibration in treating sleep-related brain disorders.},

  abstract     = {There is an emerging requirement of advanced functional materials for simultaneous thermal protection and electromagnetic wave-transparent transmission applications. A novel polyimide (PI) aerogel-based sandwich-structural composite is developed to meet such a requirement in this study. This composite is based on a unidirectional fluorinated PI (FPI) aerogel as a lower layer, a nondirectional conventional PI aerogel as a middle layer, and a nondirectional FPI aerogel/paraffin phase-change composite as an upper layer. The lower layer exhibits a unique unidirectional porous microstructure and an ultralow dielectric constant of 1.04. The upper layer possesses a dynamical temperature regulation capability thanks to its loaded paraffin having a high latent heat capacity of 242.7 J g −1 . The presence of the nondirectional PI aerogel middle layer can effectively prevent against the leakage of paraffin from the upper layer to the surface of the composite. Through a rational integration of three functional layers, the developed sandwich-structured composite not only can provide gradient thermal protection for hot objects over a long period but also exhibits an excellent wave-transparent capability to establish communication between two electromagnetically shielded electronic devices. With such prominent thermal insulation and wave-transparent functions, the sandwich-structured composite exhibits great potential for specific applications in aircraft, spacecraft, radar systems, and satellite communication.},

Unlike the previous studies focus on the tPSA and fPSA/tPSA ratio (f/t PSA%), this work introduces a multiple PSA-mediated Prostate Health Index (PHI) assay with significantly increased the predictive accuracy and specificity of PCa, especially the patients with a tPSA level in the “diagnostic gray zone”. Practical analysis of clinical samples demonstrated the SERS immunoassay is capable of identifying the PCa subjects from healthy candidates ( N = 13), and monitoring PCa patients before and after surgery ( N = 5), as well as screening suspicious ones who are in the “gray zone” ( N = 10). Overall, benefiting from the PSA-responsive satellite immuno-nanoassemble strategy, dual-SERS magnification effect, and multiple PSA-based PHI assessment, this proposes bioassay held enormous potential for the early diagnosis, screening, monitoring, and prognosis of PCa.},

The rattler-phonon avoided crossings contribute to the low κ L in a β -Zn 4 Sb 3 single crystal, enhancing the thermoelectric figure-of-merit ( zT ). TEM characterizations of the β -Zn 4 Sb 3 single crystal with intrinsic and ultralow κ L reveal a grain-boundary-free structure with uniformly dispersed rotation moiré fringes that contribute to low lattice thermal conductivity while maintaining a uniform elemental distribution. Additionally, the significant impact of crystallinity control coupled with dilute doping on boosting thermoelectric performance, with single-crystalline single leg outperforming their polycrystalline counterparts is demonstrated.

  abstract     = {Circularly polarized light (CPL) is inherently chiral and is regarded as one possible source for the origin of homochirality. Coincidentally, chiral metal nanoparticles have great prospects in asymmetric photochemical reactions since they can enhance the chiral light-matter interactions. Nonetheless, little is known about how the spin angular momentum of light competes with the chiral electromagnetic field in the vicinity of a chiral nanoparticle during the chiral induction and amplification process. Here, an asymmetric photo-polymerization system is presented where the chiral bias can be selectively regulated by the combination of chiral fields CPL and Ag nanoparticles, either constructively or destructively. Synergistic chiral amplification effect is observed when the handedness of both are matched, while the opposite-handed CPL can overrule the polymer helicity during the chain propagation process when the chiral near-field is weak. There is a bifurcation point in the chiral bias for the orthogonal control of the polymer helicity during the asymmetric photo-polymerization process, favoring for programmable chiroptical micropatterns and multi-channel independent information encoding. This work not only highlights opportunities for selectively regulating the asymmetric photopolymerization but also is highly valuable for fundamental understanding of the symmetry breaking in photochemical reactions.},

  abstract     = {Narrow-bandgap (NBG) Sn–Pb mixed perovskite solar cells (PSCs) represent a promising solution for surpassing the radiative efficiency of single-junction solar cells. The unique bandgap tunability of halide perovskites enables optimal tandem configurations of wide-bandgap (WBG) and NBG subcells. However, these devices are limited by the susceptibility of Sn 2+ in the NBG bottom cell to being oxidized to Sn 4+ , creating detrimental Sn vacancies. Herein, a novel approach that replaces Sn particles with Ni particles is introduced as the reducing agent for Sn–Pb mixed perovskite precursor solutions. The ferromagnetic properties of Ni enable simple magnetic filtration, eliminating the filtration issues associated with Sn particles. Ni particles can be reused up to five times without significantly affecting the PSC&#39;s performance. Additionally, Ni effectively mitigates the oxidation of Sn 2+ due to its low reduction potential (−0.23 V), thereby enhancing device performance. Single-junction Sn–Pb mixed PSCs prepared using Ni achieve a power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.29%, retaining over 90% of their initial efficiency after 1250 h. Furthermore, Ni-based all-perovskite tandem solar cells combining 1.77 eV WBG top cells with 1.25 eV NBG bottom cells achieve a remarkable PCE of 28.13%. Thus, the proposed strategy can facilitate the commercialization of all-perovskite tandem devices.},

  abstract     = {Most wearable biosensors aimed at capturing psychological state target stress biomarkers in the form of physical symptoms that can correlate with dysfunction in the central nervous system (CNS). However, such markers lack the specificity needed for diagnostic or preventative applications. Wearable biochemical sensors (WBSs) have the potential to fill this gap, however, the technology is still in its infancy. Most WBSs proposed thus far target cortisol. Although cortisol detection is demonstrated as a viable method for approximating the extent and severity of psychological stress, the hormone also lacks specificity. Multiplex WBSs that simultaneously target cortisol alongside other viable stress-related biochemical markers (SBMs) can prove to be indispensable for understanding how psychological stress contributes to the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric illnesses (NPIs) and, thus, lead to the discovery of new biomarkers and more objective clinical tools. However, none target more than one SBM implicated in NPIs. Till this review, cortisol&#39;s connection to dysfunctions in the CNS, to other SBMs, and their implication in various NPIs has not been discussed in the context of developing WBS technology. As such, this review is meant to inform the biosensing and neuropsychiatric communities of viable future directions and possible challenges for WBS technology for neuropsychiatric applications.},

While indocyanine green (ICG)-based near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence (FL) surgical navigation enhances the visual identification of tumor margins, its accuracy remains subjective, underscoring the need for quantitative approaches. In this study, a high spatiotemporal fluorescence lifetime (FLT) imaging technology is developed in the second near-infrared window (NIR-II, 1000–1700 nm) for quantitative tumor margin detection, utilizing folate receptor-targeted ICG nanoprobes (FPH-ICG). FPH-ICG exhibits a significantly prolonged NIR-II FLT (750 ± 7 ps vs 260 ± 3 ps) and increased NIR-II FL brightness (FPH-ICG/ICG = 3.8). In vitro and in vivo studies confirm that FPH-ICG specifically targets folate receptor-α (FRα) on SK-OV-3 ovarian cancer cells, achieving high-contrast NIR-II FL imaging with a signal-to-background ratio of 10.8. Notably, NIR-II FLT imaging demonstrates superior accuracy (90%) and consistency in defining tumor margins compared to NIR-II FL imaging (58%) in both SK-OV-3 tumor-bearing mice and clinical tumor samples. These findings underscore the potential of NIR-II FLT imaging as a quantitative tool for guiding surgical tumor margin detection.},

However, reports on ionogels remain limited owing to the contradiction between the flexibility required for stretching and the rigidity necessary for RTP and load-bearing within the same ionogels. Here, a facile strategy is reported to enhance the toughness and extend the RTP of ionogels by salting-out-induced microphase separation, which results in the formation of an IL-rich phase (soft) for stretching and ionic conduction and a polymer-rich phase (stiff) for energy dissipation and clustering-triggered phosphorescence. The obtained ionogels exhibit high stretchability (≈400% strain), toughness (≈∼20 MJ m −3 ), ionic conductivity (8.4 mS cm −1 ), and ultralong afterglow lifetime (112.4 ms). This strategy is applicable to chromophores with color-tunable phosphorescence. By leveraging observable full-color RTP and real-time electrical signals in response to diverse stimuli (i.e., stretching and pressing), an intelligent grasping strategy is developed for robust hand pose reconstruction. In addition, a tactile-visual fusion recognition keyboard is created with dual functionality of information encryption and signal transmission. The ease of fabrication, wide tunability, and multifunctionality will help expand the scope of ionogels for smart devices.},

Extra intracellular Cu induces cuproptosis and chemodynamic therapy (CDT), which further cascades immunogenic cell death (ICD) and activates antitumor immune responses. However, the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment (TIM) attenuates the efficiency of the immune response. Herein, a biomimic nanodrug (ECNM) is fabricated, of which ES, Cu 2+ and NLG919 (an IDO1 inhibitor) are integrated via a self-assembly process and subsequently coated with 4T1 cell membrane. ECNM can overcome the typical drawbacks of ES, ameliorating the stability and half-life of ES by membrane-coating and enhancing its tumor accumulation and internalization via homotypic targeting. It is worth mentioning that, the addition of NLG919 is also beneficial to the system circulation stability of ES and reduces the non-specific ES release. After internalization, ECNM dissociates via the glutathione-responsive process and exhibits comprehensive antitumor capabilities, including cuproptosis, CDT and TIM reversing, thereby eliciting ICD and optimizing the antitumor immune response. Furthermore, ECNM not only accelerates tumor regression but also gains a strong abscopal effect and displays the potential of tumor vaccination.

  abstract     = {The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that by 2050, nearly 2.5 billion people are expected to have some degree of hearing loss (HL) and at least 700 million will need hearing rehabilitation. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop treatment strategies for HL. At present, the main treatment strategies for HL are hearing aids and cochlear implants (CIs), which cannot achieve a radical cure for HL. Relevant studies have shown that the most fundamental treatment strategy for sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is to regenerate hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) through stem cells to repair the structure and function of cochlea. In addition, physical stimulation strategies, such as electricity, light, and magnetism have also been used to promote SGN regeneration. This review systematically introduces the classification, principle and latest progress of the existing hearing treatment strategies and summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of each strategy. The research progress of physical regulation mechanism is discussed in detail. Finally, the problems in HL repair strategies are summarized and the future development direction is prospected, which could provide new ideas and technologies for the optimization of hearing treatment strategies and the research of SGN repair and regeneration through physical regulation.},

However, the low stability of the lipiodol emulsion and poor efficacy of chemotherapeutic drug seriously undermine the efficiency of TACE. Herein, a novel lobaplatin-loaded lipiodol emulsion (denoted as ICN-LPE) is developed by constructing a lipiodol Pickering emulsion (LPE) stabilized with iron-doped carbon nanozymes (ICN) to mitigate the issue of lipiodol-water separation. This novel emulsion not only solves the instability of conventional lipiodol emulsions, but also facilitates the sustained release of lobaplatin. More importantly, upon entry into tumor cells, ICN catalyze the generation of reactive oxygen species via the Fenton-like reaction while simultaneously consuming intracellular glutathione, thereby inducing tumor cell death via chemodynamic therapy. By integrating chemotherapy and chemodynamic therapy, ICN-LPE demonstrates a synergistic antitumor effect and effectively inhibits tumor growth in a rabbit liver tumor model. Therefore, our ICN-LPE shows an appealing clinical application prospect for TACE.},

  abstract     = {Small colony variant (SCV) is strongly linked to antibiotic resistance and the persistence of osteomyelitis. However, the intrinsic phenotypic instability of SCV has hindered a thorough investigation of its pathogenic mechanisms. In this study, phenotypically stable SCV strains are successfully recovered from clinical specimens, characterized by elevated drug resistance and reduced immunogenicity. Multi-omics analysis revealed that the acquired high drug resistance is associated with altered flux in the purine metabolism pathway, attributable to mutations in the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase ( hpt ) gene. Furthermore, this study innovatively discovered that lonidamine, an inhibitor of cellular energy metabolism, can effectively mitigate SCV resistance to β-lactam antibiotics, thereby facilitating its eradication. The underlying mechanism involves the reprogramming of purine metabolism. Therefore, a co-delivery system for lonidamine and oxacillin is constructed with amino-modified dendritic mesoporous silica as a carrier, which showed high efficacy and safety in combating SCV both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Overall, this study elucidated the pathogenic mechanisms of a class of clinically isolated SCV isolates with hpt mutations and provided a paradigm for treating SCV-associated osteomyelitis by reprogramming purine metabolism.},

However, the specific cellular and neural circuit mechanisms underlying the generation of RRB remain unclear. In this study, it is reported that the absence of the ASD-related protein Neuroligin 1 (NLGN1) in dopamine receptor D2-expressing medium spiny neurons (D2-MSNs) in the dorsal striatum is associated with the duration and frequency of self-grooming and digging behaviors. The Nlgn1 -deficient D2-MSNs are hyperactivated, which correlates with excessive self-grooming and digging behaviors. Inhibiting the activity of D2-MSNs reduces the duration and frequency of these RRBs. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the generation of self-grooming and digging behaviors depends on distinct patterns of D2-MSN activity. Finally, through single-nucleus RNA sequencing (sn-RNAseq) and protein detection verification, it is revealed that the overactivation of protein kinase C (PKC) in Nlgn1 -deficient mice contributes to excessive repetitive behaviors and increased neuronal excitability. In this study, potential mechanisms are proposed for the generation of self-grooming and digging behaviors, as well as suggest possible treatments and interventions ASD.},

The proposed structure not only suppresses EMI through charge sharing but also enables simultaneous energy harvesting and actuation, enhancing the overall electrical performance of the system. The system demonstrated a remarkable improvement in output performance, exceeding that of traditional single-modal DE generators by up to 30%.

Here, we present a type of smart and flexible watchband that includes a mini flexible electrode array based on Mo-Au filament mesh, combined with mesoscopic hybridized silk fibroin films. As the layer in contact with the skin, waterborne polyurethane and SF create a highly flexible and permeable meso-hybridized SF/WPU layer, ensuring skin-friendliness and comfortable wearing. The flexible FM electrodes are created by integrating Mo-Au FM into 2D-interconnected networks. Molybdenum filaments provide high rigidity and are coated with Aurum to enhance conductivity. The use of Mo-Au FMs in warp-knitted patterns results in high SNR (43.22 dB), high sensitivity (44.43 mV/kg), and significant motion noise reduction due to the pattern&#39;s elastic deformability and skin-gripping properties. Leveraging these unique technologies, these smart watchbands excel in prolonged sensing operation, grasping force detection, and gesture recognition. Through smart raining via deep learning, we achieved an unparalleled recognition rate (96% across 20 volunteers of different genders) among other EMG sensing devices. These results have significant implications for human-machine interaction, including applications in underwater robot control, drone operation, and autonomous vehicle control.},

It still has notable gap between metal-free and metal-based electrocatalysts, due to lacking accurate and efficient p -band regulation methods on non-metal atoms. Herein, a molecular modularization strategy is proposed for fine-tuning the p -orbital states of series metal-free covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for realizing OER performance beyond benchmark precious metal catalysts. Optimized combination of benzodioxazole/benzodiimide-based building blocks achieves an impressive applied potential of 1.670 ± 0.004 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and 1.735 ± 0.006 V versus RHE to deliver enhanced current densities of 0.5 and 1.0 A cm −2 , respectively. Moreover, it holds a notable charge transfer amount (stands for a long service life) within operation period that outperforms all reported metal-free electrocatalysts. Operando differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) with isotope labeling identifies the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM). A variety of spectroscopic techniques and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the p -band center of these catalysts can be shifted stepwise to optimize the oxygen intermediate adsorption and lower the reaction energy barrier. This work provides a novel perspective for enhancing the electrocatalytic performance of metal-free COFs.},

However, cell-targeting and metabolome-preserving methods for analysis of low mass, hydrophilic metabolites (&lt;200 Da) in large cell populations are lacking. Here, the PRISM-MS ( PR escan I maging for S mall M olecule – M ass S pectrometry) mass-guided MSI workflow is presented, which enables space-efficient single cell lipid and metabolite analysis. In conjunction with giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) as MSI ground truth for cell-sized objects and Monte Carlo reference-based consensus clustering for data-dependent identification of cell subpopulations, PRISM-MS enables MSI and on-cell MS2-based identification of low-mass metabolites like amino acids or Krebs cycle intermediates involved in stimulus-dependent cell activation. The utility of PRISM-MS is demonstrated through the characterization of complex metabolome changes in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated microglial cells and human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia. Translation of single cell results to endogenous microglia in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures indicates that LPS-activation involves changes of the itaconate-to-taurine ratio and alterations in neuron-to-glia glutamine-glutamate shuttling. The data suggests that PRISM-MS can serve as a standard method in single cell metabolomics, given its capability to characterize larger cell populations and low-mass metabolites.},

  abstract     = {Vascular calcification (VC) in type 2 diabetes (T2D) poses a serious threat to the life and health of patients. However, its pathogenesis remains unclear, resulting in a lack of effective treatment for the root cause. It is found that both intestinal Bacteroides fragilis (BF) and peripheral M2 monocytes/macrophages are significantly elevated in patients with T2D VC. M2 macrophages are identified as a significant risk factor for T2D VC. Both BF and their extracellular vesicles (EV) promote T2D VC and facilitate macrophage M2 polarization. Macrophages clearance significantly antagonized BF EV-induced T2D VC in mice. Mechanistically, EV-rich double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) activates stimulator of interferon response cGAMP interactor 1 (Sting), promotes myocyte enhancer factor 2D (Mef2d) phosphorylation, upregulates tribbles pseudokinase 1 (Trib1) expression, and induces macrophage M2 polarization. Concurrently, Mef2d activated by the EV targets and upregulates the expression of pro-calcification factor Serpine1, thereby exacerbating T2D VC. Clinical studies have shown that Serpine1 is significantly elevated in the peripheral blood of patients with T2D VC and is closely associated with T2D VC. In summary, this study reveals that intestinal BF promotes Trib1 expression through the EV-Sting-Mef2d pathway to induce macrophage M2 polarization and upregulates serpin family E member 1 (Serpine1) expression, thereby aggravating T2D VC. The findings provide a new theoretical and experimental bases for optimizing the strategies for prevention and treatment of T2D VC.},

Recently, mRNA modification by N6-methyladenosine (m6A) has emerged as a crucial epigenetic mechanism regulating plant biological processes; however, its impact on shade avoidance remains unexplored. In this study, the double mutants, gmmtas , that are impaired in two m 6 A writer genes, GmMTAa and GmMTAb that encode m 6 A methyltransferases or m 6 A writers are generated. It is found that the gmmtas mutants showed a substantial reduction of m6A levels, a dwarf phenotype, and a diminished sensitivity to LBL. Further investigation of the gmmtas mutants demonstrates that GmMTA regulates shade avoidance response by altering the expression of GmCRY1s , GmSPAs , and GmCOP1s , resulting in increased accumulation of GmSTFs that are known to suppress the shad avoidance response in response to LBL in soybean. The findings reveal a novel molecular mechanism regulating shade resistance in soybean, providing insights into the epigenetic mechanisms of plant adaptation to changing light environments and paving the way for the development of shade-tolerant soybean varieties.},

Herein, a novel nanocomposite combining silicon nanoparticles and carbon-doped titania, C-TiO 2 /SiNPs, is designed as a fluorescence probe and visible-light photocatalyst to simultaneously monitor and degrade oxytetracycline (OTC). C-TiO 2 /SiNPs emit blue fluorescence, which can be quenched by OTC through inner filter effect. Meanwhile, green fluorescence is turned on upon OTC addition by aggregation-induced emission. Thus, C-TiO 2 /SiNPs successfully act as a fluorescence colorimetric probe for quantitation and semi-quantitation of OTC. Additionally, C-TiO 2 /SiNPs show adorable visible-light photocatalytic activity toward OTC, achieving a removal rate of 93.3% in 30 min. This process is driven by the superoxide radicals, holes and hydroxyl radicals produced by C-TiO 2 /SiNPs under visible light irradiation. The total toxicities obviously reduce after OTC is degraded by C-TiO 2 /SiNPs. The concentration during the OTC degradation can be estimated by naked eyes through the change of fluorescence color, but also precisely quantified by a fluorometer. This study innovatively develops a one-stone-two-birds strategy to achieve simultaneous degradation and in situ real-time detection of OTC, paving a promising paradigm for the highly efficient monitoring and removal of residual drugs.},

Bulk gene expression analyses reveal that SMG alters Hippo and BMP signaling in brain organoids. The neuropathological deficits in SMG-treated organoids can be rescued by regulating YAP/BMP/ID1 axis. Furthermore, sing-cell RNA sequencing data show that SMG results in perturbations in the number and function of neural stem and progenitor cell subpopulations. One of these subpopulations senses SMG cues and transmits BMP signals to the subpopulation responsible for tube morphogenesis, ultimately affecting the proliferating cell population. Finally, SMG intervention leads to persistent neurologic damage even after returning to normal gravity conditions. Collectively, this study reveals molecular and cellular abnormalities associated with SMG during human brain development, providing opportunities for countermeasures to maintain normal neurodevelopment in space.},

  abstract     = {As the demand for the neuromorphic vision system in image recognition experiences rapid growth, it is imperative to develop advanced architectures capable of processing perceived data proximal to sensory terminals. This approach aims to reduce data movement between sensory and computing units, minimizing the need for data transfer and conversion at the sensor-processor interface. Here, an optical neuromorphic synaptic (ONS) device is demonstrated by homogeneously integrating optical-sensing and synaptic functionalities into a unified material platform, constructed exclusively by all-inorganic perovskite CsPbBr 3 quantum dots (QDs). The dual functionality of each unit within the ONS device, which can be operated as either an optical sensor or a synaptic device depending on applied electrical polarity, provides significant advantages over previous heterogeneous integration methods, particularly regarding material selection, structural compatibility, and device fabrication complexity. The ONS device exhibits distinct wavelength responses essential for emulating colored image recognition capability inherent in the human visual system. Additionally, the seamless integration of electronics and photonics within a unified material system establishes a novel paradigm for optical retrieval, enabling real-time perception of the encoded status of the ONS device. These findings represent substantial advancements in near-sensor computing platforms and open a new horizon for all-inorganic perovskite optoelectronic technologies.},

Rationally arranging Pt particles on carbon support is the primary approach for reducing mass transport resistance. Herein, using a unique method coupling Hybrid Reverse Monte Carlo, molecular dynamics simulations, and experimental measurements, a Pt particle arrangement strategy is proposed to reduce local oxygen transport resistance, based on a molecular-level understanding of its impact. The densely arranged Pt particles with a small interparticle distance lead to the denser ionomer layer due to the co-attraction effect, leading to a high local oxygen transport resistance. The nonuniformly arranged Pt particles with various interparticle distances cause the heterogeneous ionomer density, inducing the heterogeneous oxygen transport. Increasing the Pt-Pt interparticle distance from 2 to 5 nm substantially reduces the local oxygen transport resistance by over 50%. The uniform arrangement of Pt particles makes the ionomer layer density more homogeneous, resulting in more uniform oxygen transport. Therefore, uniformly arranging Pt particles with an interparticle distance of &gt;5 nm on carbon support is preferred for reducing local oxygen transport resistance and improving the homogeneity of oxygen transport.},

  abstract     = {Decellularized allografts have emerged as promising candidates for vascular bypass grafting, owing to their inherent bioactivity and minimal immunogenicity. However, graft failure that results from suboptimal regeneration and pathological remodeling has hindered their clinical adoption. Recent advances in vascular biology highlight the pivotal role of COUP-TFII in orchestrating endothelial identity, angiogenesis, safeguarding against atherosclerosis, and mitigating vascular calcification. Here, plasmid DNA (pDNA) encoding COUP-TFII is incorporated into decellularized allografts to realize localized delivery. Comprehensive in vitro investigation complemented by a bone marrow transplantation model on genetic-lineage-tracing mouse revealed the underlying mechanisms of COUP-TFII in regulating vascular regeneration and remodeling. COUP-TFII augmented endothelialization and inhibited calcification in decellularized allografts by modulating the Ang1/Tie2/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway that dictates the fate of Sca-1 + stem/progenitor cells. Heparin-polyethyleneimine nanoparticles (HEPI) are prepared as COUP-TFII pDNA nanocarriers (COUP-TFII@HPEI) and used to modify decellularized allografts, achieving long-term and stable overexpression of COUP-TFII. Functionalized grafts are evaluated in rat abdominal artery replacement models, demonstrating enhanced neo-artery regeneration without calcification. The study provides an effective strategy to enhance the applicability of decellularized allograft and illustrates their translational prospects for vascular bypass grafting.},

Under pure water-fed conditions, electrochemical reactions occur solely at active sites connected to ionic networks. This study introduces an eco-friendly patterning technique leveraging membrane swelling properties by applying mechanical stress during dehydration under fixed constraints. The method increases active sites by creating additional hydroxide ion pathways at the membrane-electrode interface, eliminating the need for additional ionomers in the electrode. This innovation facilitates ion conduction via locally shortened pathways. Membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) with patterned commercial membranes demonstrated significantly improved performance and durability compared to MEAs with conventional catalyst-coated substrates and flat membranes under pure water-fed conditions. The universal applicability of this technique was confirmed using in-house fabricated anion exchange membranes, achieving exceptional current densities of 13.7 A cm −2 at 2.0 V in 1.0 M potassium hydroxide (KOH) and 2.8 A cm −2 at 2.0 V in pure water at 60 °C. Furthermore, the scalability of the technique was demonstrated through successful fabrication and operation of large-area cells. These findings highlight the potential of this patterning method to advance AEMWE technology, enabling practical applications under pure water-fed conditions.},

  abstract     = {Aberrant upregulation of hepatic lipogenesis induced by chronic and excessive alcohol consumption is a critical driver of the progression of alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), however, no effective approaches inhibiting lipogenesis are currently available for treating ALD patients. Moreover, little is known about whether and how nonethanol ingredients in alcoholic beverages regulate the pathogenesis of ALD. Here the discovery of a small molecule that activates the production and secretion of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is reported. It is shown that the activator ethyl lactate, a nonethanol ingredient found in distilled liquors, ameliorates alcoholic hepatosteatosis, inflammation and acute-on-chronic liver injury by stimulating FGF21. In response to chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding or fasting, ethyl lactate mimics lipogenesis lowering effects by stimulating FGF21 production through the NAD + -dependent deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) signaling pathway. These ethyl lactate-mediated beneficial effects are abolished by inhibition of SIRT1 through injection of EX527. Importantly, FGF21 deficiency in hepatocytes blocks the downregulation of lipogenesis by ethyl lactate and exacerbates alcoholic steatosis, inflammation and liver injury. The regulatory mechanism is discussed during the pathophysiological conditions and suggests new lines of research into the therapeutic use of a foodborne small molecule ethyl lactate.},

  abstract     = {Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is combined with sonodynamic therapy (SDT) to increase response rates and enhance anticancer efficacy. However, the “always on” property of most sonosensitizers in reducing tumor microenvironment (TME) compromises the therapeutic outcome of sonoimmunotherapy and exacerbates adverse side effects. Precisely controllable strategies combining sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) gas therapy with cancer immunotherapy can address these issues but remain lacking. Herein an “activatable SO 2 nanosonosensitizer” for precise sono-gaseous checkpoint trimodal therapy of orthotopic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is reported, whose full activity is initiated by ultrasound (US) irradiation in the reducing TME. This “activatable SO 2 nanosonosensitizer,” Aza-DNBS nanoparticles (NPs), are established by self-assembling Aza-boron-dipyrromethene based sonosensitizer molecules and 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonate (DNBS)-caged SO 2 prodrug. The activity of Aza-DNBS NPs is initially silenced, and the sonodynamic, gaseous, and immunosuppressive TME reprogramming activities are precisely awakened under US irradiation. Due to the glutathione-responsiveness of Aza-DNBS NPs, Aza-DNBS NPs can generate large amounts of SO 2 for gas therapy-enhanced SDT, which triggers robust immunogenic cell death activation and reprogramming of the immunosuppressive TME, thereby significantly suppressing orthotopic tumor growth and delaying lung metastasis. Thus, this study represents a strategy for designing a generic nanoplatform for precisely combined immunotherapy of orthotopic HCC.},

Probe-based data storage, such as mechanical storage using an atomic force microscope tip, is a potential solution with storage densities exceeding hard disks. However, the storage medium must be modifiable on the nanoscale. While polymers are promising storage media, they face challenges with synthesis, erasing temperatures, and stability. Here, a low-cost and robust polymer system is reported that allows repeated writing, reading and erasing. The polymer is made by inverse vulcanization, providing a network of S─S bonds that can be broken and re-formed repeatedly. This property is leveraged in mechanical indentation to encode information, and thermal S─S metathesis and polymer re-flow to erase. Exquisite control of indentation depth is possible over 1–30 nm. This control enables data encoding not just as a function of the presence or absence of an indent, but also indentation depth. This ternary coding increases the data density four-fold over binary coding. Furthermore, the coding can be done at room temperature which is rare for mechanical information storage. The low cost, ease of synthesis, and dynamic S─S bonds in these polymers are a promising advance in polymer storage media for probe-based data storage.},

However, the low drug delivery efficiency caused by lysosomal sequestration and the activation of protective mitochondrial autophagy severely restricts the therapeutic efficacy. Herein, an in situ transformable nanoparticle named KCKT is developed to promote lysosomal escape and directly damage mitochondria while blocking mitochondrial autophagy. KCKT exhibits acid responsiveness for precise self-assembly into nanofibers within the lysosomes of cancer cells. The massive accumulation of nanofibers and excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under sonodynamic therapy synergistically induce lysosomal damage. This facilitates the escape of nanofibers from lysosomal sequestration, thereby enhancing drug delivery. Subsequently, the escaped nanofibers specifically aggregate around the mitochondria for long-term retention and generate ROS under ultrasound irradiation to induce mitochondrial damage. Notably, due to lysosomal dysfunction, damaged mitochondria cannot be cleared by autophagy, further aggravating oxidative damage. These results reveal that KCKT effectively improves drug delivery and mitochondria-targeted therapy efficiency by blocking protective autophagy. These findings hold significant potential for advancing the field of mitochondria-targeted therapy.},

With the advent of atomically thin 2D van der Waals (vdW) magnets, a pertinent question is whether such compounds could make their way into this realm where interactions can be tailored so that unconventional states of matter can be assessed. Here, it is shown that square islands of CrGeTe 3 vdW ferromagnets distributed in a grid manifest antiferromagnetic correlations, essential to enable frustration resulting in an artificial spin-ice. By using a combination of SQUID-on-tip microscopy, focused ion beam lithography, and atomistic spin dynamic simulations, it is shown that a square array of CGT island as small as 150 × 150 × 60 nm 3 have tunable dipole–dipole interactions, which can be precisely controlled by their lateral spacing. There is a crossover between non-interacting islands and significant inter-island anticorrelation depending on how they are spatially distributed allowing the creation of complex magnetic patterns not observable at the isolated flakes. These findings suggest that the cross-talk between the nano-patterned magnets can be explored in the generation of even more complex spin configurations where exotic interactions may be manipulated in an unprecedented way.},

  abstract     = {Epigenetic control of cell fates is a critical determinant to maintain cell type stability and permit differentiation during embryonic development. However, the epigenetic control mechanisms are not well understood. Here, it is shown that the histone acetyltransferase reader protein BRD8 impairs the conversion of primed mouse EpiSCs (epiblast stem cells) to naive mouse ESCs (embryonic stem cells). BRD8 works by maintaining histone acetylation on promoters and transcribed gene bodies. BRD8 is responsible for maintaining open chromatin at somatic genes, and histone acetylation at naive-specific genes. When Brd8 expression is reduced, chromatin accessibility is unchanged at primed-specific genes, but histone acetylation is reduced. Conversely, naive-specific genes has reduced repressive chromatin marks and acquired accessible chromatin more rapidly during the cell type conversion. It is shown that this process requires active histone deacetylation to promote the conversion of primed to naive. This data supports a model for BRD8 reading histone acetylation to accurately localize the genome-wide binding of the histone acetyltransferase KAT5. Overall, this study shows how the reading of the histone acetylation state by BRD8 maintains cell type stability and both enables and impairs stem cell differentiation.},

  abstract     = {Spinel-type nickel ferrite (Ni x Fe 3-x O 4 , x≤1) is a widely used electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Due to the lower hybridization of metal- d and oxygen- p orbitals, the OER process on Ni x Fe 3-x O 4 follows the sluggish adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM). Generally, activating the lattice oxygen to trigger the lattice-oxygen-mediated mechanism (LOM) can enhance the OER activity. Herein, to trigger the LOM pathway while maintaining high stability, iron foam (IF)-supported Ni 0.75 Fe 2.25 O 4 (NiFeO) with geometrical defects of [NiO 6 ] (nickel cation coordinated with six oxygen anions) units and higher ratio of Fe to Ni cations in octahedral sites ( d -NiFe HR O/IF) is prepared by ion-exchanging with polar aprotic solvent followed by annealing. As a result, as-synthesized d -NiFe HR O/IF exhibits excellent activity (at 295 mV overpotential to achieve 100 mA cm −2 ), fast kinetics (Tafel slope of only 34.6 mV dec −1 ), and high stability (maintaining a current density of 100 mA cm −2 over 130 h) for the OER. The theoretical calculations reveal that the construction of octahedral defect in Ni x Fe 3-x O 4 enhances the overlap of Fe- d and O- p orbitals, which can activate the lattice oxygen. Therefore, increasing the ratio of Fe to Ni will further improve the lattice oxygen redox activity, and thus trigger the fast LOM pathway, ultimately facilitating the OER process.},

  abstract     = {The global incidence of metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) has risen sharply. This condition is strongly associated with the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), but how MAFLD affects the development and progression of CVD, particularly concerning vascular calcification, remains unclear. Herein, extracellular vesicles (EVs) are identified from steatotic hepatocytes as a trigger that accelerated the progression of both vascular intimal and medial calcification. Steatotic hepatocytes are found to release more EVs, which are able to reach the vascular tissue, be taken up by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), and promote their osteogenic differentiation. Within these toxic vesicles, a protein cargo is identified called lectin galactoside-binding soluble 3 binding protein (Lgals3bp) that acted as a potent inducer of osteochondrogenic transformation in VSMCs. Both the inhibition of EV release and the liver-specific knockdown of Lgals3bp profoundly attenuated vascular calcification. This work partially explains the reason for the high incidence of vascular calcification in MAFLD and unveils a novel mechanism that may be used to prevent or treat cardiovascular complications in patients with MAFLD.},

  abstract     = {Chemoresistance poses a critical obstacle in bladder cancer (BCa) treatment, and effective interventions are currently limited. Elevated oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) has been linked to cancer stemness, a determinant of chemoresistance. However, the mechanisms underlying increased OXPHOS during cancer cell chemoresistance remain unclear. This study revealed that the mitochondrial translational activator of cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (TACO1) is linked to stemness and cisplatin resistance in BCa cells. Mechanistically, mitochondrial TACO1 enhances the translation of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (MTCO1), promoting mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) by upregulating OXPHOS, consequently driving cancer stemness and cisplatin resistance. Intriguingly, the mitochondrial translocation of TACO1 is mediated by the heat shock protein 90 β (HSP90β), a process that requires circFOXK2 as a scaffold for the TACO1-HSP90β interaction. The mutations at the binding sites of TACO1-circFOXK2-HSP90β disturb the ternary complex and inhibit cancer stemness and cisplatin resistance in BCa cells by suppressing the MTCO1/OXPHOS/mtROS axis. Clinically, BCa patients with increased mitochondrial TACO1 expression respond poorly to cisplatin treatment. This study elucidates the mechanisms by which TACO1 promotes BCa stemness and cisplatin resistance, providing a potential target for mitigating cisplatin resistance for BCa and a biomarker for predicting cisplatin response.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of antibiotic resistance, particularly bacterial resistance to β-lactam antibiotics, the most widely prescribed therapeutic agents for infectious diseases, poses a significant threat to public health worldwide. The discovery of effective therapies against antibiotic-resistant pathogens has become an urgent need, necessitating innovative approaches to accelerate the identification and development of novel antibacterial agents. On the other hand, the expression of the β-lactam-hydrolyzing enzyme (β-lactamase), the major cause of bacterial resistance to β-lactam antibiotics, provides a distinctive opportunity to visualize bacterial infection, evaluate the efficacy of existing antibiotics, screen for novel antibacterial agents, and optimize drug dosing regimens in live animals. Herein, a hydrophilicity-switching, self-immobilizing, near-Infrared fluorogenic β-lactamase probe for the highly sensitive imaging of bacterial infection in live mice is reported. This probe, in addition to a significant increase in fluorescence upon selective hydrolysis by β-lactamases as conventional β-lactamase probes, also massively enriches within β-lactamase-expressing bacteria (over 1500-folds compared to the incubation medium), which renders excellent sensitivity in the imaging of bacterial infections in living animals. This agent has proven to enable the assessment of antibiotic therapeutic efficacy and potency of β-lactamase inhibitors in living animals in a non-invasive and much more convenient manner.},

Herein, the chirality evolution of supramolecular helices based on l -phenylalanine derivative (LPF) and naphthylamide derivate (NDIAPY) is achieved by the strategy of electron transfer (ET) assisted secondary nucleation. ET from LPF to NDIAPY can be triggered by 5 s UV irradiation on left-handed LPF-NDIAPY co-assemblies, leading to NDIAPY radical anions and partial disassembly of the helices. Meanwhile, spontaneous reversion of radical anions into monomers occurs upon removal of UV light, and the surface of residual co-assemblies can accelerate the reversion process. This surface accelerated reversion of ET further facilitates the secondary nucleation-elongation events, giving rise to the formation of scale-amplified and g vale-increased left-handed helices. Meanwhile, chirality evolution controlled by ET assisted secondary nucleation process can be also realized by adding the prepared LPF-NDIAPY co-assemblies into the total ET system. This study may provide a useful approach to constructing and modulating diverse chiral structures by manipulating the secondary nucleation process.},

According to in vitro and in vivo experiments, the SRHLS reshaped the tumor microenvironment and markedly inhibited tumor growth, recurrence, and metastasis.

An improved YoloV8n-seg network tailored for detecting elongated roots is proposed, which outperforms the original YoloV8seg in all network performance metrics. Additionally, the post-processing method introduced reduces root identification errors, ensuring a one-to-one correspondence between each root system and its detection box. The experiment yields phenotypic parameters for fine-grained roots, such as fine-grained root length, diameter, and curvature. Compared to traditional parameters like total root length and average root diameter, these detailed phenotypic analyses enable more precise phenotyping and facilitate accurate artificial intervention during crop cultivation.},

However, current knowledge remains limited, as short-read RNA sequencing—the predominant method for assessing gene expression—depends on incomplete gene annotations and struggles to resolve the diverse transcripts produced by genes. To address these limitations, an integrative approach combining nanopore direct RNA sequencing (DRS), ATAC-Seq, and short-read RNA-seq is used. This method enabled the analysis of RNA landscapes across major mouse organs under fasting and fed conditions, representing two extremes of the caloric cycle. This study uncovered tens of thousands of novel transcripts and identified hundreds of genes with tissue-specific expression, revealing additional layers of regulated pathways within each organ that conventional short-read RNA-seq cannot resolve. By profiling transcript expression across multiple organs under identical conditions, it is conducted comparative analyses exposing significant differences in transcript isoforms and regulations. Moreover, nanopore DRS revealed dynamic changes in poly(A) tail length and m6A modifications of transcripts, many regulated in a tissue-specific manner. These changes likely contribute to functional differentiation and metabolic specialization of various organs. Collectively, this findings reveal previously unrecognized layers of gene regulation, offering new insights into the metabolic basis of organ function.},

The BM environment significantly influences the progression of MM. Celastrol, a natural compound derived from traditional Chinese medicine, exhibits significant anticancer effects. This study aimed to identify specific targets of celastrol and develop more effective and less toxic treatment options for MM. Celastrol is used as a probe to determine its specific target, pyridoxine-5′-phosphate oxidase (PNPO). Increased levels of PNPO are associated with poor outcomes in MM patients, and PNPO promotes MM cell proliferation and induces osteoclast differentiation through exosomes. Mechanistically, PNPO oxidizes disheveled 3 M282 (DVL3), leading to abnormal activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Based on the critical sites of PNPO R95/K117 , Eltrombopag is identified as a potential therapeutic candidate for MM. In addition, the experiments showed its efficacy in mouse models. Eltrombopag inhibited the growth of MM cells and reduced bone lesions by disrupting the interaction between PNPO and DVL3, as supported by preliminary clinical trials. The study highlights the importance of PNPO as a high-risk gene in the development of MM and suggests that Eltrombopag may be a promising treatment option.},

  abstract     = {Anal fistula is a common disease with recurrent inflammation and accumulated exudate. Traditional treatments often fail to effectively eliminate inflammation and ensure adequate drainage, leading to prolonged healing time and a high recurrence rate. Herein, a new class of quaternized molecular brush-grafted injectable microgel (denoted as GAA@CNT- g -PVBTMA) is developed through thermal polymerization and mechanical fragmentation to promote the healing process of anal fistula. Benefiting from the fragmented morphology with a porous structure, the microgel can effectively fill the fistula and facilitate the drainage of exudate. Owing to the electrostatic interactions between the positively charged quaternized carbon nanotube molecular brush (CNT- g -PVBTMA) and the negatively charged inflammatory cytokines, GAA@CNT- g -PVBTMA microgel exhibits excellent anti-inflammatory properties with scavenging rates of 92.6% for tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and 92.5% for interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Rat inflammatory anal fistula model demonstrates that the microgel can effectively reduce inflammation and epithelialization of the fistula, thereby promoting the healing of the anal fistula. By integrating effective filling, adequate drainage, and excellent anti-inflammatory properties, GAA@CNT- g -PVBTMA microgel provides a promising new direction for the treatment of anal fistula.},

  abstract     = {Atherosclerotic plaque rupture mainly contributes to acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Insufficient repair of these plaques leads to thrombosis and subsequent ACS. Central to this process is the modulation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) phenotypes, emphasizing their pivotal role in atherosclerotic plaque stability and healing post-disruption. Here, an expansion of FSP1 + cells in a tandem stenosis (TS) model of atherosclerotic mice is unveiled, predominantly originating from VSMCs through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses and VSMC lineage tracing studies. Further investigation identified TEA domain transcription factor 1 (TEAD1) as the key transcription factor driving the trans-differentiation of VSMCs into fibroblast-like cells. In vivo experiments using a TS model of plaque rupture demonstrated that TEAD1 played a crucial role in promoting plaque stability and healing post-rupture through pharmacological or TEAD1-AAV treatments. Mechanistically, it is found that TEAD1 promoted the expression of fibroblast markers through the Wnt4/β-Catenin pathway, facilitating the trans-differentiation. Thus, this study illustrated that TEAD1 played a critical role in promoting the trans-differentiation of VSMCs into fibroblast-like cells and subsequent extracellular matrix production through the Wnt4/β-Catenin pathway. Consequently, this process enhanced the healing mechanisms following plaque rupture, elucidating potential therapeutic avenues for managing atherosclerotic instability.},

  abstract     = {Individuals with homozygous laminA/C p.R527C mutations manifest a severe form of Mandibuloacral dysplasia-(MAD) and exhibit overlapping progeroid symptoms, for which the underlying molecular pathology remains unknown. Herein, it is shown that MAD patients achieved inflammaging with different pro-inflammatory cytokines compared to progeria-(HGPS) patient. Characterization of MAD iPSC-derived Mesenchymal stem cells (MAD-iMSC) uncovers deregulated mitochondrial Ca +2 as the primary cause of inflammaging, mediated through inflammasome formation rather than the cGAS-STING pathway. Moreover, MAD-iMSCs extracellular vesicles (EVs) can also upregulate mitochondrial Ca +2 in healthy cells. This deregulated Ca +2 homeostasis is indirectly mediated by mitochondrial calcium mediator, signal transducer, and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3), situated on the mitochondrial associated membrane (MAM). Inflammaging is mitigated by various FDA-approved MAM-STAT3 upstream inhibitors, such as (Tocilizumab) or by correcting R527C mutation with CRISPR/CAS9. These results provide new insights into MAD disease and propose targeting defective mitochondrial Ca +2 homeostasis as a promising therapy for reversing immunosenescence.},

In this work, a facile chemical-based strategy is presented for the fabrication of precise NP patterns using a combination of soft thermal nanoimprinting and template-directed assembly. The approach enables the creation of well-defined NP arrays with single-particle resolution and yields over 99%, covering a diverse range of NP sizes from 30 to 150 nm. These patterns can be transferred onto various substrates including semiconductors, insulators, 2D materials, and flexible polymers, maintaining high uniformity and repeatability for over 60 cycles with minimal degradation. Moreover, the method enables the fabrication of extensive NP arrays up to 1 cm 2 with a positional accuracy of ±11 nm for 30 nm NPs. As a result, the obtained silver NP arrays exhibit ultranarrow surface lattice resonances with a linewidth of 4 nm and a quality factor ( Q ) of 216. The method offers new avenues for the creation of plasmonic NP arrays for flexible and wearable devices.},

Notably, DNA methylation undergoes adaptive changes in neurological disorders, emerging as a promising target for neuromodulation. In this study, systemic administration of PTX leads to a decrease in the expression of the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3a, while concurrently upregulating the expression of Gabrb1 mRNA and its encoded GABA A Rβ1 protein in the medial PFC (mPFC) of male mice. Overexpression of DNMT3a in the mPFC alleviates PTX-induced pain hypersensitivity, and anxiety-like behavior in these mice. Additionally, it reverses the PTX-induced increase in inhibitory synaptic transmission in the pyramidal neurons of the mPFC. Mechanistically, the upregulation of GABA A Rβ1 in the mPFC is linked to the reduced expression of DNMT3a and DNA hypomethylation at the promoter region of the Gabrb1 gene. Furthermore, a long-term diet rich in methyl donors alleviates PTX-induced pain hypersensitivity and anxiety-like behavior in mice. These findings suggest that the DNMT3a-mediated upregulation of GABA A Rβ1 in the mPFC contributes to PTX-induced neuropathic pain and anxiety, highlighting DNA methylation-dependent epigenetic regulation as a potential therapeutic target for addressing chemotherapy-induced cortical dysfunction.},

However, the interplay and underlying mechanisms of how these factors synergistically induce PTSD remain inadequately elucidated. Here, mice in the TBI (induced by biological shock tube blast injury) and PTSD (induced by single prolonged stress method) groups both displayed symptoms of PTSD behaviors, with the TBI+PTSD (composite model) group exhibiting more severe manifestations. The result of snRNA-seq demonstrated a noticeable increase in the population of Gabra6 + neurons in the prefrontal cortex region of mice in the TBI+PTSD group. Knocking down cortical Gabra6 mitigated PTSD-related behavioral outcomes. Mechanistically, the Smad3/4 complex activation led to the upregulation of Gabra6 expression in cortical neurons. Interaction of Gabra6 with Homer1 activated downstream cAMP signaling pathways. Homer1 KO-Nestin mice show reduced susceptibility to PTSD. Subsequently, the efficacy of monoclonal antibody intervention at the 218 site of Gabra6 in ameliorating PTSD development is verified. This study suggests that TBI and stressors act as independent components in PTSD development, with Gabra6 + neurons pivotal in synergistically facilitating PTSD formation. Strategies geared toward minimizing exposure to singular or combined stressors may effectively diminish the risk of developing PTSD.},

Cholesterol-rich tumor fragments significantly contribute to IRTM deterioration. This study developed a cholesterol-targeted catalytic hydrogel, DA-COD-OD-HCS, to enhance the synergy between MWA and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for HCC treatment. Cholesterol oxidase (COD), modified with dimethyl maleic anhydride (DA) for release in acidic IRTM, is used to degrade cholesterol. Oxydextran (OD) and hemin-chitosan (HCS) formed a dual network gel, ensuring long-term fixation of COD and hemin in the IRTM post-MWA. In both in vitro and in vivo HCC models, DA-COD-OD-HCS effectively released COD, degraded cholesterol, and induced tumor cell ferroptosis, enhancing the antitumor immune response. Combined with anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy, this strategy inhibited primary tumor growth and distant metastases, without side effects on adjacent tissues. This work highlights that cholesterol-targeting catalytic hydrogels fueled by tumor debris can significantly improve the efficacy of MWA and ICIs, offering a novel therapeutic approach for HCC.},

However, current studies on the pathogenesis of NS are limited. Here, through the integration analysis of proteomics and single-cell transcriptomics, Toll-like/NF-κB signaling is identified as the key pathway involved in CNS damage caused by Tp . Moreover, monocyte-derived macrophages are key cells involved in the inflammatory response to Tp in the CNS of NS patients. In addition, it is found that inflammatory cells in peripheral blood may cause neurological damage through disruption of the blood‒brain barrier (BBB) in individuals with NS. Notably, activation of the Toll-like/NF-κB signaling pathway, as well as dysregulation of neural function, is likewise validated in an in vitro NS brain organoid model. In conclusion, the results revealed the mechanisms of inflammation-mediated brain injury in Tp -induced NS and provided new ideas for the clinical treatment of Tp infection.},

While aberrant epithelial remodeling is a key factor in IPF progression, the molecular mechanisms behind this process remain elusive. Harnessing a 3D patient-derived organoid model and multi-omics approach, the first inventory of the connection between metabolic alteration, chromatin accessibility, and transcriptional regulation in IPF aberrant epithelial remodeling is provided. This remodeling is characterized by an increase in chromatin accessibility, particularly at JUNB motif-enriched promoter regions proximal to transcription start sites of metabolic and pro-fibrotic genes. Mechanistically, JUNB undergoes O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine modification (O-GlcNAcylation), a critical step in modulating pro-fibrotic responses to chronic injury. This modification is pivotal in fostering the emergence of aberrant epithelial basal cells in the alveolar niche, a proposed driver of IPF pathology. Specific deletion of O-GlcNAcylation sites on JUNB attenuates the metaplastic differentiation of basal cells, thereby aiding in the restoration of the alveolar lineage. Together, the findings reveal a novel link between metabolic dysregulation and cell fate regulation at the chromatin level in fibrosis, mediated by the O-GlcNAc-JUNB axis, suggesting avenues for the development of new therapeutic strategies in IPF.},

In subcutaneous and intraperitoneal endometriosis mouse models, siRNAs targeting GBP2 and HCK notably reduced lesion volume and weight, with decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis within lesions. Both subcutaneous and intraperitoneal administration of Lifitegrast, an approved ITGB2 antagonist, effectively suppresses lesion growth. Collectively, these data present Lifitegrast as a previously unappreciated intervention for endometriosis treatment and identify GBP2 and HCK as novel druggable targets in endometriosis treatment.

The study revealed that the Lyn/RUVBL1 complex is highly expressed in CRC and is closely correlated with liver metastasis. On the one hand, ATAC-seq and HiCut suggested that Lyn/RUVBL1 regulates the expression of TRIB3 through the POL II-mediated chromatin conformation of TRIB3 and thus the expression of β-catenin. This promotes the proliferation and migration of CRC through β-catenin-mediated upregulation of MMP9 and VEGF. On the other hand, metabolomics revealed that Lyn/RUVBL1 regulates the expression of PGE2 through the enzyme COX2, thereby promoting arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism. CUT-Tag showed that Lyn/RUVBL1 silencing reduces the H3K27ac level in the COX2 promoter. Then, it is found that COX2 is regulated by the transcription factor FOXA1. Lyn/RUVBL1 modulates AA metabolism by regulating the chromatin accessibility of FOXA1. AA metabolism promotes the metastasis of CRC by affecting β-catenin nuclear translocation and upregulating MMP9 and VEGF. These findings suggest that the Lyn/RUVBL1 complex mediates epigenetic remodeling to regulate the metabolic reprogramming of AA, highlighting its role in promoting the metastasis of CRC.},

  abstract     = {Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is characterized by abnormal bile acid metabolites and altered gut microbiota, with no effective treatments available. Vancomycin, a glycopeptide antibiotic, has emerged as a promising candidate. However, the mechanism by which vancomycin impacts the progression of PSC remains unknown. Mice treated with vancomycin exhibit increased hepatic collagen deposition and injury, due to the inhibition of intestinal FXR-FGF15/19 axis and the elevation of bile acid levels. These effects are associated with the reduction in Clostridia XIVa , especially Clostridium scindens ( C. scindens ). Gavage of C. scindens alleviates vancomycin-induced bile acid accumulation and liver fibrosis via activating intestinal FXR-FGF15/19 signaling. Similar effects are observed in mice treated with engineered Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 that are capable of expressing bile acid 7α-dehydratas (BaiE) from C. scindens (EcN-BaiE). Activating intestinal FXR-FGF15/19 signaling by fexaramine (Fex) or recombinant protein FGF19 reverse vancomycin-induced liver injury and fibrosis. These results demonstrate that long-term oral vancomycin exacerbates cholestatic liver injury, while C. scindens mitigates this effect by activating the intestinal FXR-FGF15/19 signaling pathway. This underscores the importance of monitoring bile acid levels in PSC patients receiving vancomycin treatment and suggests that C. scindens may serve as a potential therapeutic approach for PSC patients.},

  abstract     = {Kawasaki disease (KD) is a severe acute febrile illness and systemic vasculitis that causes coronary artery aneurysms in young children. Platelet hyperreactivity and an aberrant immune response are key indicators of KD; however, the mechanism by which hyperactive platelets contribute to inflammation and vasculopathy in KD remains unclear. A cytokine-mediated positive feedback loop between KD platelets and monocytes is identified. KD platelet–monocyte aggregates (MPAs) are mediated by an initial interaction of P-selectin (cluster of differentiation 62P, CD62p) and its glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL-1). This is followed by a coordinated interaction of platelet glycoprotein (GP)Ibα with monocyte CD11b. Monocyte-activated platelets initiate transforming growth factor (TGF)β1 release, which results in nuclear localization of nuclear factor kappaB in monocytes, therefore, driving the phenotypic conversion of classical monocytes (CD14 + CD16 − ) into proinflammatory monocytes (CD14 + CD16 + ). The platelet-activated monocytes release interleukin-1 and tissue necrotic factor-α, which promote further platelet activation. KD-induced inflammation and vasculopathy are prevented by inhibiting the components of this positive feedback loop. Notably, mice deficient in platelet TGFβ1 show less MPA and CD14 + CD16 + monocytes, along with reduced inflammation and vasculopathy. These findings reveal that platelet–monocyte interactive proteins (CD62p/PSGL-1 and (GP)Ibα/CD11b) and cytokine mediators (platelet TGFβ1) are potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for KD vasculopathy.},

  abstract     = {The clinical efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy is significantly compromised in the metabolically disordered tumor microenvironment (TME), posing a formidable challenge that cannot be ignored in current antitumor strategies. In this study, TME-responsive nanoparticles (HMP1G NPs) loaded with 1-methyltryptophan (1-MT; an indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 [IDO1] inhibitor,) and S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO; a nitric oxide donor) is developed to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of 1-MT-mediated ICB. The HMP1G NPs responded to H + and glutathione in the TME, releasing Mn 2+ , GSNO, and 1-MT. The released Mn 2+ catalyzed the production of abundant reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide from hydrogen peroxide and GSNO, and the generated nitric oxide, synergistically with 1-MT, inhibited the accumulation of kynurenine mediated by IDO1 in the tumor. Mechanistically, HMP1G NPs downregulated tumor cell-derived IDO1 via the aryl hydrocarbon receptor/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3/interleukin signaling axis to improve kynurenine/tryptophan metabolism and immunosuppression. In a murine breast cancer model, treatment with HMP1G NPs elicited effective antitumor immunity and enhanced survival outcomes. This study highlights a novel nano-platform that simultaneously improves metabolism and enhances ICB efficacy to achieve a new and efficient antitumor strategy.},

Here, we collected tumor samples from treatment-naïve primary and post-HAIC HCC, and integrated single-nucleus RNA sequencing with spatial transcriptomics to characterize the tumor ecosystem in the post-HAIC HCC. Increased fractions and enhanced cellular communication of CD4 + T, CD20 + B, and dendritic cell subtypes were identified in post-HAIC tumors. Moreover, it is substantiated that HAIC promoted tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) formation, and addressed the roles of TLSs as spatial niches of cellular communication. Specifically, intermediate exhausted CD8 + T cells expressing Granzyme-K and PD-1 (PD-1 + CD8 + Tex-int) expanded following HAIC and exhibited a functionally antitumor phenotype. PD-1 + CD8 + Tex-int accumulated in the TLS vicinity and disseminated throughout the tumor microenvironment, demonstrating potential as an effective biomarker for HAIC-based treatment in HCC.

This mechanism manifests when light scattering from nanometer-sized clusters including a specific case of self-assembled nanostructures that form a long-range translational order but local disorder (crystal-liquid duality). In this paper, a new strategy based on both cases for the light-matter-interaction enhancement in a direct bandgap semiconductor – lead halide perovskite CsPbBr 3 – by using electric pulse-driven structural disorder, is addressed. The disordered state allows the generation of confined photons, and the formation of an electronic continuum of static/dynamic defect states across the forbidden gap (Urbach bridge). Both mechanisms underlie photon-momentum-enabled electronic Raman scattering (ERS) and single-photon anti-Stokes photoluminescence (PL) under sub-band pump. PL/ERS blinking is discussed to be associated with thermal fluctuations of cross-linked [PbBr 6 ] 4- octahedra. Time-delayed synchronization of PL/ERS blinking causes enhanced spontaneous emission at room temperature. These findings indicate the role of photon momentum in enhanced light-matter interactions in disordered and nanostructured solids.},

High-fidelity preclinical models can improve AS management by enabling therapeutic innovation, early diagnosis, and tailored treatment planning. However, their use is currently limited by complex workflows necessitating lengthy expert-driven manual operations. Here, we propose an AI-powered computational framework for accelerated and democratized patient-specific modeling of AS hemodynamics from computed tomography (CT). First, we demonstrate that the automated meshing algorithms can generate task-ready geometries for both computational and benchtop simulations with higher accuracy and 100 times faster than existing approaches. Then, we show that the approach can be integrated with fluid-structure interaction and soft robotics models to accurately recapitulate a broad spectrum of clinical hemodynamic measurements of diverse AS patients. The efficiency and reliability of these algorithms make them an ideal complementary tool for personalized high-fidelity modeling of AS biomechanics, hemodynamics, and treatment planning.},

  abstract     = {Proteins play an essential role in various biological and engineering processes. Large protein language models (PLMs) present excellent potential to reshape protein research by accelerating the determination of protein functions and the design of proteins with the desired functions. The prediction and design capacity of PLMs relies on the representation gained from the protein sequences. However, the lack of crucial 3D structure information in most PLMs restricts the prediction capacity of PLMs in various applications, especially those heavily dependent on 3D structures. To address this issue, S-PLM is introduced as a 3D structure-aware PLM that utilizes multi-view contrastive learning to align the sequence and 3D structure of a protein in a coordinated latent space. S-PLM applies Swin-Transformer on AlphaFold-predicted protein structures to embed the structural information and fuses it into sequence-based embedding from ESM2. Additionally, a library of lightweight tuning tools is provided to adapt S-PLM for diverse downstream protein prediction tasks. The results demonstrate S-PLM&#39;s superior performance over sequence-only PLMs on all protein clustering and classification tasks, achieving competitiveness comparable to state-of-the-art methods requiring both sequence and structure inputs.

Herein, molecular expression and proteolytic activity of three distinct proteases, namely neutrophil elastase, matrix metalloproteinases, cysteine cathepsins (cathepsin-K and cathepsin-B) are comprehensively profiled, in the subcutaneous host response of immuno-competent mice against different biomaterial implants. Quantitative non-invasive monitoring with activatable fluorescent probes reveals that different microparticulate materials induce distinct levels of protease activity with degradable poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid inducing the strongest signal compared to nondegradable materials such as polystyrene and silica oxide. Furthermore, protein expression of selected proteases, attributable to both their inactive and active forms, notably deviates from their activities associated only with their active forms. Protease activity exhibits positive correlations with protein expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin 6 but negative correlation with pro-fibrotic cytokine transforming growth factor β1. This study also demonstrates the predictive utility of protease activity as a non-invasive, pro-inflammatory parameter for evaluation of the anti-inflammatory effects of model bioactive compounds on material-induced host response. Overall, the findings provide new insights into protease presence in material-induced immune responses, facilitating future biomaterial assessment to evoke appropriate host responses for implant applications.},

While assessed in neurons, astrocytes, and microglia, its role is far less investigated in myelinating glia, including Schwann cells (SCs), responsible for peripheral nerve myelination. Remarkably, the dysregulation in endosomal trafficking is emerging as a pathophysiological mechanism underlying peripheral neuropathies, such as demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) diseases. By knocking out Beclin 1 in SCs here a novel mouse model ( Becn1 cKO) is generated, developing a severe and progressive neuropathy, accompanied by involuntary tremors, body weight loss, and premature death. Ultrastructural analysis revealed abated myelination and SCs displaying enlarged cytoplasm with progressive accumulation of intracellular vesicles. Transcriptomic and histological analysis from sciatic nerves of 10-day and 2-month-old mice revealed pro-mitotic gene deregulation and increased SCs proliferation at both stages with axonal loss and increased immune infiltration in adults, well reflecting the progressive motor and sensory functional impairment that characterizes Becn1 cKO mice, compared to controls.

  abstract     = {The application of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has revolutionized the management of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). However, disease relapse and progression particularly due to persistent leukemia stem cells (LSCs) remain a big challenge in the clinic. Therefore, validation of the therapeutic vulnerability in LSCs is urgently needed. This study verifies the critical role of protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) in the maintenance of CML LSCs. It is found that PRMT1 promotes the survival and serially plating abilities of human primary CML LSCs. Genetic deletion of Prmt1 significantly delays the leukemogenesis and impairs the self-renewal of LSCs in BCR-ABL – driven CML mice. PRMT1 regulates LSCs and leukemia development depending on its methyltransferase activity. Pharmacological inhibition of PRMT1 activity by MS023 remarkably eliminates LSCs and prolongs the survival of CML mice. Mechanistical studies reveal that PRMT1 promotes transcriptional activation of ribosomal protein L29 (RPL29) via catalyzing asymmetric dimethylation of histone H4R3 (H4R3me2a) at its gene promoter region. PRMT1 augments the global protein synthesis via RPL29 in CML LSCs. Taken together, the findings provide new evidence that histone arginine methylation modification regulates protein synthesis in LSCs and highlight PRMT1 as a valuable druggable target for patients with CML.},
