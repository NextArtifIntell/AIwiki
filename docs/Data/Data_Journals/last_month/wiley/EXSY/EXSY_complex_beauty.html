  abstract     = {Several decision-making approaches involve ordinal labelling between feature values and decision outcomes. These issues refer to ordinal classification under monotonicity constraints. Recently, some machine learning approaches have been designed to deal with these kinds of problems. Indeed, numerous experiments have shown that these algorithms are widely used in real-life applications because of their flexibility and efficiency in terms of interpretation and predictions. In this paper, we introduce novel approaches for measuring feature quality and information quantity, called Rényi-Tsallis Monotonic Tree (RTMT), which uses the advantages of Rényi and Tsallis entropies while incorporating monotonicity constraints through an optimisation framework. Moreover, we introduce Mono-CART, a variant of the CART approach adapted for monotonic classification. New decision tree algorithms are designed on the basis of aforementioned entropies while considering the monotonicity constraints within an optimisation system. The experiments conducted using some benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approaches compared to existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) often involves evaluating or ranking alternatives on multiple attributes, a process that is far from trivial due to flexible preferences and uncertainty in the criteria importance. The recently proposed W eightless, I nterval- B ased A pproach (WIBA) tackles these issues by relying on an ordering of the criteria (according to their relevance) instead of explicit weights and using interval scores to evaluate alternatives. Although originally proposed for selecting solutions of interest in the context of multi-objective and many objective optimization problems, it can be adapted to rank such solutions. However, the robustness of WIBA rankings has not been studied, and sensitivity analysis approaches based on perturbations of the weights cannot be applied. Furthermore, there is no friendly environment for exploring WIBA properties. This paper addresses these gaps by (1) introducing a novel local sensitivity analysis technique to explore how small perturbations in the order of criteria affect rankings, and (2) presenting WIBApp, a freely available visual software tool that implements WIBA features, including the proposed sensitivity analysis. Using a case study on the selection of technical universities, the paper first illustrates WIBA&#39;s flexibility and utility in real-world decision scenarios, enabling decision makers to effectively deal with uncertainty and complexity, and second shows how WIBApp simplifies data management, enhances analysis and facilitates comparisons among rankings. By advancing the theoretical foundations of WIBA and providing a practical implementation, this work contributes to providing decision makers with a robust framework for handling multi-criteria problems, enhancing the reliability of rankings and supporting informed decisions.},

In the first stage, a simplified fuzzy optimization learning model is introduced to mitigate uncertainty caused by abnormal capacity fluctuations in battery data. The proposed fuzzy model reconstructs degradation data into a consistent downward trend based on mid- and short-term tendencies of the battery, alleviating abnormal variability and improving suitability for predictive modelling. In the second stage, uncertainty arising during the recursive prediction process of a standalone Transformer model was mitigated through the integration of a particle filter. This approach dynamically manages prediction errors using particles, effectively controlling cumulative errors and enhancing the stability and reliability of long-term predictions. This methodology can lead to extended battery life and increased operational reliability through accurate RUL prediction. The proposed methodology is validated through experiments using NASA and CALCE battery datasets, demonstrating superior prediction accuracy and stability compared to conventional approaches by systematically reducing uncertainties.},

  abstract     = {Wind turbine blades (WTB) are critical components of wind energy systems. Operating in harsh environments WTBs face significant challenges, since damage to their leading edge caused by erosion or additive surface roughness can reduce performance, and increase maintenance costs and operational downtime. One approach to detect WTB damage is to use machine learning, but properly designing a predictive system is not trivial. Auto machine learning (AutoML) can be used to simplify the design and implementation of machine learning pipelines. This work presents the first comparison of state-of-the-art AutoML methods, Auto-Sklearn, H2O-DAI and TPOT, to detect erosion and additive roughness in WTBs. The Leading-Edge Erosion Study database is used, which provides measurements of the pressure coefficient along the airfoil under different conditions. This is the first work to combine the pressure coefficient and AutoML systems to detect these types of damage. Results show the viability of using AutoML in this task, with H2O-DAI producing the best results, achieving an accuracy above in many cases. However, statistical analysis shows that a standard classifier can achieve similar performance across all problems considered, based on the Friedman test and the Wilcoxon-Holm post hoc analysis with an significance level. However, AutoML systems perform better as the complexity and difficulty of the problem increases.},

However, existing meta-heuristic algorithms still suffer from several shortcomings, including a poor balance between global and local search, a tendency to converge toward the centre of the solution space, and susceptibility to getting trapped in local optima. To overcome these shortcomings, a novel meta-heuristic algorithm, called artificial orca optimiser (AOO), is proposed based on the unique behaviours of orcas in nature. Within the framework of AOO, the switching factor, guidance phase, and iterative formulas that do not converge toward the centre of the solution space, are designed to enhance the equilibrium between exploration and exploitation, ensure agents the ability to escape from the local optimum, and comprehensively explore the solution space without being limited to the centre of the solution space, thereby increasing the likelihood of finding the global optimal solution. Qualitative, quantitative, scalability, sensitivity, and practical application analyses of the experimental results demonstrate that AOO overcomes the issue of converging to the centre of the solution space, alleviates the problems of poor balance and susceptibility to the local optimum, and exhibits outstanding optimising performance, fast convergence, great scalability, high robustness, and excellent practicality.},

  abstract     = {Driven by the rise of the internet, recent years have witnessed the gradual manifestation of commercial values of online reviews. In movie industry, sentiment analysis serves as the foundation for mining user preferences among diverse and multi-layered audiences, providing insight into the market value of movies. As a representative task, aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to analyse and extract fine-grained sentiment elements and their relations in terms of discussed aspects. Relevant studies, particularly in the realm of deep learning research, face challenges due to insufficient annotated data. To alleviate this problem, we propose a guideline for fine-grained sentiment annotations that defines aspect categories, describes the method for annotating aspect sentiment triplets, either simple or complex and designs a scheme to represent hierarchical labels. Based on this, an ABSA dataset tailored for the movie domain is curated by annotating on 1100 Chinese short reviews acquired from Douban. Applicability of both the annotation guideline and curated data is evaluated through inter-annotator consistency and self-consistency checks, and domain adaptation assessment of e-commerce and healthcare cases. Predictive performance of machine learning models on this dataset shed light on possible applications in more fine-grained sentiment analysis in the movie domain, for example, figuring out the aspects from which to stimulate viewership and influence public opinions, thereby providing substantial support for the movie&#39;s box office performance. Finally, we extended our fine-grained sentiment annotation guideline to the e-commerce and healthcare. Through empirical experimentation, we demonstrated the universality of these guideline across diverse domains.},

Subsequently, the researchers across various domains have integrated different services to facilitate the end users. However, the real issue faced by the cloud infrastructure is the network latency due to the physical dispersion between clients and cloud data centers. According to an estimate, billions of internet of things (IoT) devices are sharing approximately two exabytes of data daily. Such a huge amount of data can affect network performance if the underlying physical system does not expand up to the required levels, leading to performance degradation. To overcome these issues, a new computing paradigm called Fog Computing has emerged in recent years. In this paper, we discuss the recent developments in fog computing with the integration of real-time Healthcare 5.0 technology. Furthermore, we describe the proposed layered architecture and taxonomy of resource management (RM) techniques in fog computing, which consists of energy awareness, scheduling, reliability and scalability. Besides that, our survey covers the three-tier layered architecture, evaluation metrics, real-time application aspects of fog computing and tools providing the implementation of RM techniques in fog computing. Furthermore, the proposed layered architecture of the standard fog framework and different state-of-the-art techniques for utilising the computing resources of fog networks have been covered in this study. Moreover, we include various sensors to demonstrate the fog data offloading example in healthcare 5.0 applications.

The suggested algorithm considers several parameters that influence the hunting behaviour of lionfish, such as visual acuity, mobility, striking success, and prey swallowing potential. Furthermore, this study examines the influence of the physiological traits of the lionfish and their relationship with environmental factors. The novel search algorithm has shown enhanced performance and efficiency, particularly in scenarios where the integration of visual cues and intricate hunting strategies is vital. The suggested LFS method was evaluated using 20 well-known single-modal and multi-modal mathematical functions to analyse its different characteristics. The LFS method has shown remarkable efficacy in both exploration and exploitation, effectively reducing the likelihood of being trapped in local optima. Additionally, it has a rapid convergence capacity, particularly in the realm of large-scale global optimization. Comparisons were made between the LFS algorithm, and 10 other prominent algorithms mentioned in the literature. The proposed LFS metaheuristic algorithm outperformed the others on almost all of the examined functions, demonstrating a statistically significant advantage. Moreover, the positive results found in three practical optimization situations demonstrate the effectiveness of the LFS in accomplishing problem-solving tasks that have limited and unknown search areas.},

  abstract     = {Driven by rapid urbanisation, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region (BTH) has experienced a dramatic increase in resource consumption and environmental strain. Investigating the relationships among water, energy and carbon can help balance efficient resource utilisation, environmental conservation and economic growth, while promoting sustainable urban development. This study develops an analytical framework for the water-energy-carbon nexus within the urban eco-transformation. Specifically, this study first illustrates the conceptual model for the interaction among water use, energy consumption and carbon emissions theoretically, then examines the water-energy-carbon dynamics in urbanisation and ecological transition of the BTH region. Furthermore, an empirical analysis was conducted taking Beijing city as the case study area to explore the water-energy-carbon nexus and its decoupling with socio-economic development. Results show rapid urbanisation has significantly increased population and economic scale, exerting substantial pressure on water resources, energy supply and the environment. The study reveals a significant positive interaction between water consumption, electricity consumption and carbon emissions in Beijing, with an inverted U-shaped parabolic relationship between GDP and population. Beijing is expected to decouple economic growth from carbon emissions after 2030 and from water consumption after 2037, reducing resource consumption and carbon emissions while sustaining economic growth. To achieve sustainable development, it is recommended that the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region accelerate industrial transformation, enhance water resource efficiency, develop clean energy and improve power system efficiency. This paper provides a theoretical foundation and practical insights for decision-making and facilitates ecological urbanisation in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region.},

In recent days, there have been only a few devoted surveys associated with deep learning related video anomaly identification as the research domain is in its initial stages. In this review work, the abnormal behaviour analysis models using deep learning are reviewed in depth in for security applications. Based on the traditionally used abnormal behaviour analysis models in crowded scenes, we widely categorised the methods into classification using object tracking, classification using handcrafted extracted features, classification using non-contact heart rate variability and blood pressure, analysing motion patterns from the visual frames, and classification using face images. We also discuss the comparative analysis of the previous methods with respect to datasets, computational infrastructure, and performance measures for both qualitative and quantitative analysis. In addition, the open and trending research challenges are analysed for future research.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a new data clustering technique aimed at enhancing the performance of the trainable path-cost algorithm and reducing the computational complexity of data clustering models. The proposed method facilitates the discovery of natural groupings and behaviours, which is crucial for effective coordination in complex environments. It identifies natural groupings within a set of features and detects the best clusters with similar behaviour in the data, overcoming the limitations of traditional state-of-the-art methods. The algorithm utilises a density peak clustering method to determine cluster centers and then extracts features from paths passing through these peak points (centers). These features are used to train the support vector machine (SVM) to predict the labels of other points. The proposed algorithm is enhanced using two key concepts: first, it employs Q-Generalised Extreme Value (Q-GEV) under power normalisation instead of traditional generalised extreme value distributions, thereby increasing modelling flexibility; second, it utilises the random vector functional link (RVFL) network rather than the SVM, which helps avoid overfitting and improves label prediction accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed clustering algorithm is evaluated through various experiments, including those on UCI benchmark datasets and real-world data, demonstrating significant improvements across multiple performance metrics, including F1 measure, Jaccard index, purity, and accuracy, highlighting its capability in accurately identifying paths between similar clusters. Its average F1 measure, Jaccard index, purity, and accuracy is measured 76.87%, 56.29%, 80.29%, and 79.64%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {This systematic review looks at the advances, trends, and challenges within semantic role labelling (SRL) for both English and Indian languages. SRL stands as a pivotal undertaking in the realm of natural language processing (NLP), entailing the identification of semantic connections between predicates and their corresponding arguments in a given sentence. The synthesis of findings from publicly available NLP repositories in this review sheds light on the progression of SRL methodologies and their use across various linguistic contexts. The investigation examines the distinct hurdles presented by Indian languages, which are characterised by their morphological complexity and syntactic variability, juxtaposed with the more widely studied English language. Furthermore, we perform an analysis of the impact of sophisticated machine learning algorithms, particularly deep learning, on enhancing SRL efficacy across these languages. The review identifies key research gaps and proposes future research pathways to address the complex nature of SRL in multilingual environments. By offering a comprehensive overview of the evolutionary trajectory of SRL research, the primary objective of this article is to contribute to the advancement of more resilient and adaptable NLP systems capable of accommodating a myriad of languages.},

  abstract     = {Text Summarization (TS) is a technique for condensing lengthy text passages. The objective of text summarization is to make concise and coherent summaries that contain the main ideas from a document. When thinking about a page or watching a video, researchers or readers might imagine an abbreviated version which will just catch important parts only. This paper provides an overview of research work done by different authors on this field. There are numerous machine learning and deep learning-based approaches and methods for implementing text summarization in practice because of several factors like time saving, increased productivity, effective comparative analysis, among others. In this article we explore the concept of text summarization as well as techniques, general framework, applications, evaluation measures within both Indic and Non-Indic scripts. Additionally, the article brings out some related issues between text summarization and other intelligent systems such as script nature datasets architectures latest works, and so forth. Finally, the authors presented the challenges of text summarization, as well as analytical ideas, conclusions, and future directions for text summarization.},
