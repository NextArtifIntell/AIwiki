  abstract     = {This article proposes a shared control system model between the human pilot and autopilot for the special issue of carrier-based aircraft landing task. A key point of the shared and cooperative control is that the decision-sharing system depends on the longitudinal safety boundaries for manual/automatic landing. Two strategies of the human pilot are adopted, including capture strategy and tracking strategy. A hidden model tracking control method is utilized to model the autopilot. To address the issue of frequent switching between the human pilot and autopilot caused by relying solely on safety boundaries to allocate control authority, fuzzy control theory is introduced to reduce the workload of the human pilot. The time-domain simulation results show that considering the fuzzy control, the frequency of switching and the flight states have been improved compared with the results without fuzzy control. Nonlinear pilot-induced oscillation metric evaluation results show that the human-automation shared and cooperative control considering the fuzzy control can alleviate the workload of the human pilot. The shared and cooperative control system model has certain significance in ensuring the safety of carrier-based aircraft landing.},

  abstract     = {The objective was to modulate the resistance of a hand-held device, e.g., joystick, for customizing a rehabilitative therapeutic patient-centric virtual environment protocol. Two similar sets of springs (each set having three springs with graded rigidness) were customized to increase the handle-resistance. The springs were experimentally calibrated to determine individual spring-constant value. The amount of exerted force values during joystick movements were standardized in a cohort of healthy subjects (n = 15). Coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated to determine the variability among healthy subjects. Further, five (n = 5) patients with stroke were enrolled in this pilot study and performed three separate virtual reality sessions using different springs. Task-performance metrics, i.e., time to complete, trajectory smoothness, and relative error, were evaluated for each of the levels. The values of spring-constants as determined experimentally were found to be 1.34 × 103 ± 16.1, 2.23 × 103 ± 29.8, and 6.47 × 103 ± 470.9 N/m for springs with increased rigidity, respectively. The mean force values for different joystick movements were observed to be increasing linearly with increasing spring-rigidity. The calculated CV ≤ 14% indicated the variability in the recorded force values of healthy subjects. Increased task-performance metrics and visual analog scale-fatigue scores for session 2 and 3 as compared to session1, indicated increasing task difficulty at session 2 and 3.},

This allows optimizing the strategy to be followed to achieve full individual and collective development, thus resulting in an improvement in performance, which helps in the prevention of injuries, and better collective work. This is especially important in the early stages of an athlete&#39;s career. The present study is based on a follow-up survey consisting of 117 female football players ranging from 10 and 20 years old, making it one of the first studies amongst this age group. A low-cost electronic performance and tracking system was developed to gather data on the players. During the training sessions, objective data (position, distances, etc.) and subjective parameters were collected using forms based on the rate of perceived exertion. This article deals with the evolution of the player&#39;s performance from both a physical and mental point of view. An emotional evaluation, based on well-being forms, is carried out and its possible influence on training. Finally, analysis is conducted on the level of health risk. It was found that the performance of female footballers improves with age and in competition-like situations. It has also been concluded that sporting activity leads to healthy lifestyle habits, which translates into a lower risk to their health.},

  abstract     = {Co-representation, which co-represents samples and features, has been widely used in various machine learning tasks, such as document clustering, gene expression analysis, and recommendation systems. It not only reveals the cluster structure of both samples and features, but also reveals the sample–feature correlation. Given a tabular data matrix, co-representation usually exhibits as the co-occurrence structures of rows and columns. However, identifying such structured patterns in complex real-world data can be very challenging. To address this problem, we propose an unsupervised discriminative co-representation learning model based on multidimensional scaling (DCLMDS). The main novelty is that DCLMDS introduces a co-representation learning term to ensure the discriminability between co-occurrence structures. As a result, the co-representation learned by DCLMDS contains richer information of the underlying correlation between samples and features within data. This could subsequently enhance the capacity of machines and systems for processing complex real-world information more proficiently. Furthermore, inspired by the fuzzy set theory, we integrate fuzzy membership degree that can accurately capture the uncertainty within data, thus enabling DCLMDS to learn a more effective co-representation in a soft manner. To evaluate the performance of DCLMDS, we conduct extensive experiments on 18 datasets, and the results demonstrate that DCLMDS can generate both accurate and discriminative co-representation, which well meets our desired outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Recent literature suggests that the surface electromyography (sEMG) signals have nonstationary statistical characteristics, specifically due to the random nature of the covariance. Thus, the suitability of a statistical model for sEMG signals is determined by the choice of an appropriate model for describing the covariance. The purpose of this study is to propose a compound-Gaussian (CG) model for multivariate sEMG signals in which the latent variable of covariance is modeled as a random variable that follows an exponential model. The parameters of the model are estimated using the iterative expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Further, a new dataset, electromyography analysis of human activities database 2 (EMAHA-DB2), is developed. The proposed model is evaluated through both qualitative and quantitative methods. Based on the model fitting analysis on the sEMG signals from EMAHA-DB2, it is found that the proposed CG model fits more closely to the empirical pdf of sEMG signals than the existing models. In addition, statistical analyses are carried out among the models and estimated parameters under different scenarios. The estimate of the exponential model&#39;s rate parameter exhibits a clear relationship with training weights, potentially correlating with underlying motor unit activity. Finally, the average signal power estimates of the channels show distinctive dependency on the training weights, the subject&#39;s training experience, and the type of activity.},

  abstract     = {The research on human-following robot is important for practical applications. It is a hot field of human–machine technology. This article proposes an adaptive recurrent proportional integral differential (PID) control algorithm with self-tuning filter based on vision to address the issue of insufficient recognition accuracy of specific following targets in the presence of occlusion, multiple people, or deformation. It also aims to further improve the control accuracy and immunity of a human-following robot. First, a depth camera-based red green blue (RGB) picture and a depth image are acquired. The person reidentification algorithm and the YOLOv8 algorithm are used to detect and track the targets. The spatial position information of the targets is calculated by the depth image. Additionally, the orientation proportional differential (PD) controller and the speed proportional integral (PI) controller are built. Its foundation is the discrepancy between the relative posture of the user and the robot. In order to minimize sensor data fluctuations and lessen the negative impacts of relative positional instability, a self-tuning filter is developed. To remember the relative postures between the robot and the user in the history window, an adaptive recurrent mechanism is suggested. The controller has the ability to output the control quantity in an adaptive manner based on the current system state. Finally, experiments are conducted to verify the reliability of the proposed method. The experimental findings demonstrate that the visual pedestrian tracking algorithm proposed in this article is highly adaptable. Compared to the traditional PID, fractional-order PID, and virtual spring model, our method demonstrates significant enhancements, reducing the average distance error by 64.29%, 57.14%, and 60.52% in steering scenarios, and by 42.86%, 40.00%, and 40.00% in straight-ahead scenarios, respectively.},

  abstract     = {In scenarios involving robots generating and executing plans, conflicts can arise between cost-effective robot execution and meeting human expectations for safe behavior. When humans supervise robots, their accountability increases, especially when robot behavior deviates from expectations. To address this, robots may choose a highly constrained plan when monitored and a more optimal one when unobserved. While this behavior is not driven by human-like motives, it stems from robots accommodating diverse supervisors. To optimize monitoring costs while ensuring safety, we model this interaction in a trust-based game-theoretic framework. However, pure-strategy Nash equilibrium often fails to exist in this model. To address this, we introduce the concept of a trust boundary within the mixed strategy space, aiding in the discovery of optimal monitoring strategies. Human studies demonstrate the necessity of optimal strategies and the benefits of our suggested approaches.},

This article presents a deep reinforcement learning-based affective workload allocation controller specifically for multihuman multirobot teams. The proposed controller can dynamically reallocate workloads based on the performance of the operators during collaborative missions with multirobot systems. The operators&#39; performances are evaluated through the scores of a self-reported questionnaire (i.e., subjective measurement) and the results of a deep learning-based cognitive workload prediction algorithm that uses physiological and behavioral data (i.e., objective measurement). To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed controller, we conduct an exploratory user experiment with various allocation strategies. The user experiment uses a multihuman multirobot CCTV monitoring task as an example and carry out comprehensive real-world experiments with 32 human subjects for both quantitative measurement and qualitative analysis. Our results demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed controller and highlight the importance of incorporating both subjective and objective measurements of the operators&#39; cognitive workload as well as seeking consent for workload transitions, to enhance the performance of multihuman multirobot teams.},

For this, the selected three-compartment controller fatigue model including a resting recovery parameter was adapted to a dynamic walking task scenario, incorporating a torque–velocity–angle dependency to quantify muscle activity. The model parameters were experimentally verified in a study with six healthy subjects, demonstrating accurate prediction of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) decline with an average mean absolute error of 4.9%MVC. Subsequently, an HiL control mechanism was developed, utilizing ratings of perceived fatigue and state of fatigue values as reference metrics. The presented control approach effectively regulates fatigue levels within a 0%MVC–6%MVC steady-state error range during simulations. Experimental validation confirmed this performance, however, with partly higher steady-state errors mainly due to the restrictions of the exoskeleton&#39;s assistance. This preliminary study provides a promising foundation for future research, demonstrating the potential to manage fatigue effectively in exoskeleton users, offering an improved, personalized experience.},

  abstract     = {Lower-limb active exoskeletons may experience errors in operational settings due to imperfect algorithms, which may impact users&#39; trust in the system and the human-exoskeleton fluency (the coordination of actions between the human and exoskeleton). In this study, we introduced pseudorandom catch trials (errors) in 1.68% of all strides, where an expected exoskeleton torque was not applied for a single stride, to understand the immediate and time-dependent responses to missed actuations. Participants (N = 15) completed a targeted stepping task while walking with a bilateral powered ankle exoskeleton. Human-exoskeleton fluency and trust were inferred from task performance (step accuracy), step characteristics (step length and width), muscle activity, and lower limb joint kinematics. Reductions in ankle plantarflexion during catch trials suggest user adaptation to the exoskeleton. Hip flexion and muscle activity were modulated to mitigate effects of the loss of exoskeleton torque and reduced plantarflexion during catch trials to support task accuracy and maintain step characteristics. Trust was not impacted by this level of error, as there were no significant differences in task performance or gait characteristics over time. Understanding the interactions between human-exoskeleton fluency, task accuracy, and gait strategies will support exoskeleton controller development. Future work will investigate various levels of actuation reliability to understand the transition where performance and trust are affected.},
