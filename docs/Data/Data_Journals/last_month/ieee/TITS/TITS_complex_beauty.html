  abstract     = {Various artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have been developed for autonomous vehicles (AVs) to support environmental perception, decision making and automated driving in real-world scenarios. Existing AI methods, such as deep learning and deep reinforcement learning, have been criticized due to their black box nature. Explainable AI technologies are important for assisting users in understanding vehicle behaviors to ensure that users trust, accept, and rely on AI devices. In this paper, an explainable Q-learning method for AV longitudinal control is proposed. First, AI control of AVs is realized by constructing a deep Q-network (DQN) with an intelligent driver model, with the control objective maximizing vehicle speed while preventing collisions. Then, a deep explainer for humans is developed via a Shapley additive explanation (SHAP), and a novel positive SHAP method that defines new base values is proposed to explain how individual state features contribute to decisions. Finally, statistical analyses and intuitive explanations are quantified based on SHAP tools to improve clarity. Elaborate numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The code is available at https://github.com/limeng-1234/Pos_Shap.},

  abstract     = {LiDAR is widely used in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and autonomous driving. The LiDAR odometry is of great importance in multi-sensor fusion. However, in some unstructured environments, the point cloud registration cannot constrain the poses of the LiDAR due to its sparse geometric features, which leads to the degeneracy of multi-sensor fusion accuracy. To address this problem, we propose a novel real-time approach to sense and compensate for the degeneracy of LiDAR. Firstly, this paper introduces the degeneracy factor with clear meaning, which can measure the degeneracy of LiDAR. Then, the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) clustering method adaptively perceives the degeneracy with better environmental generalization. Finally, the degeneracy perception results are utilized to fuse LiDAR and IMU, thus effectively resisting degeneracy effects. Experiments on our dataset show the method’s high accuracy and robustness and validate our algorithm’s adaptability to different environments and LiDAR scanning modalities.},

  abstract     = {In most of the recent literature about model predictive control (MPC) on vehicles, the finite-time and bipartite control are rarely considered. Although existing MPC methods can be applied to address the separation and rendezvous problem, they may suffer from time wasting and consistency conflicts. The finite-time control facilitates the motion planning by pre-calculating the coverage time horizon, which can avoid the unnecessary time-wasting. The bipartite control can realize the collision avoidance for the multi-vehicle system unless the reference state is zero. Therefore, a finite-time bipartite (FTB) control method for the UAV-USV system based on MPC is proposed. However, in most of the existing UAV-USV systems, the sustainable operating mechanism is not considered as usual. In this paper, to realize the sustainable operating mechanism, an UAV-USV ecosystem is introduced and further improved. Specifically, a battery replacement process is proposed and realized by the MPC method with switching topologies. Considering an UAV-USV system, the UAVs on the USV can help the USV replace the rechargeable batteries. And this process can be realized automatically by the proposed MPC method with switching topologies in a finite time. The recursive feasibility and asymptotic stability of the proposed method are proven. In addition, a series of simulations are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method.},

By integrating the Metacognitive Theory and Attribution Theory from the psychology field with reinforcement learning, this study enriches the learning mechanisms of autonomous vehicles with human cognitive processes. Specifically, it applies Metacognitive Theory’s three core elements—Metacognitive Knowledge, Metacognitive Monitoring, and Metacognitive Reflection—to enhance the control framework’s capabilities in skill differentiation, real-time assessment, and adaptive learning for interactive motion planning. Furthermore, inspired by Attribution Theory, it decomposes the reward system in RL algorithms into three components: 1) skill improvement, 2) existing ability, and 3) environmental stochasticity. This framework emulates human learning and behavior adjustment, incorporating a deeper cognitive emulation into reinforcement algorithms to foster a unified cognitive structure and control strategy. Contrastive tests conducted in various intersection scenarios with differing traffic densities demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed controller, which outperformed baseline algorithms in success rates and had lower collision and timeout incidents. This interdisciplinary approach not only enhances the understanding and applicability of RL algorithms but also represents a meaningful step towards modeling advanced human cognitive processes in the field of autonomous driving.},

  abstract     = {Given the critical need for more reliable autonomous driving systems, explainability has become a key focus within the research community. In autonomous driving models, even minor perception differences can significantly influence the decision-making process, and this impact often diverges markedly from human cognition. However, understanding the specific reasons why a model decides to stop or keep forward remains a significant challenge. This paper presents an attribution-guided visualization method aimed at exploring the triggers behind decision shifts, providing clear insights into the underlying “why” and “why not” of such decisions. We propose the cumulative layer fusion attribution method that identifies the parameters most critical to decision-making. These attributions are then used to inform the visualization optimization by applying attribution-guided weights to crucial generation parameters, ensuring that decision changes are driven only by modifications to critical information. Furthermore, we develop an indirect regularization method that increases visualization quality without necessitating additional hyperparameters. Experiments on large datasets demonstrate that our method produces insightful visualization explanations and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.},

First, a pavement maintenance level model was developed using the PCA and PSO algorithm optimized SVM model. The model was then used to separate pavement maintenance into three categories: daily, PM, and major. Second, the DBSCAN and OPTICS were utilized to further divide the PM requirements finely. In order to implement the scientific decision-making of PM, suitable maintenance procedures were ultimately chosen based on the predominant damage kinds of the pavement units. The results showed that, when compared to the original SVM model, the classification accuracy of the PCA-PSO-SVM model was greatly improved, with total accuracy and accuracy of each class increasing by 10%, 41.7%, 4.6%, and 7.8%, respectively. When clustering the airport pavement performance dataset, OPTICS outperformed the DBSCAN technique.

To address this issue, we design a scheduling strategy based on deep reinforcement learning and improve the neural network structure using a branch network approach, reducing complexity by decreasing the number of actions represented in the network’s output layer. Moreover, we introduce an action masking scheme that accelerates the algorithm’s convergence in this system.

  abstract     = {The integration of Electric Vehicles (EVs) into the energynet, the network from power generation to EV charging station, presents a symbiotic relationship with potential benefits for sustainable and efficient transportation. However, the existing research has revealed challenges in maintaining an equilibrium between energy supply and demand, often resulting in underutilization or overutilization of energy networks. Blockchain technology has emerged as a promising solution to enhance transparency and secure decentralized energy distribution; however fails to connect the equilibrium in the presence of uncertainty of demand-supply and/or handling information cascading. In this paper, we introduce TAURITE (sTAckelberg eqUilibRium in blockchaIned energyneT with Evs), a novel blockchain-based energynet framework that explicitly leverages the Stackelberg model for energy flow equilibrium within EV interfaces. TAURITE employs Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium (SPNE) to address demand uncertainty in dynamic vehicular environments. It also tackles information cascades’ impact on energy distribution, demonstrating its ability to maintain equilibrium even in such scenarios. TAURITE introduces a multi-variate polynomial-based key generation process through the smart contract AVTAL and incorporates Proof-of-Energy-Equilibrium (PoEE) as an energy sector consensus mechanism. Experimental results show that TAURITE significantly improves throughput, latency, and energy efficiency, with an average 30% enhancement in these metrics. Notably, TAURITE ensures 100% allocation stability, even in the presence of information cascades, marking a substantial advancement in sustainable and efficient energy management within the evolving energynet-EV ecosystem.},

Inspired by the prescribed performance control, an improved asymmetric barrier function with prescribed performance is provided to ensure that the yaw angle errors satisfy the prescribed performance constraints. Eventually, theoretical analysis demonstrates that the optimal formation control scheme can produce position tracking errors that converge to a prescribed arbitrarily small region within a prescribed time interval, along with the yaw angle that adheres to the time-varying partial constraints, subject to optimal cost with limited communication ranges and collision avoidance constraints.

  abstract     = {Learning multi-scale feature representations is essential for dense prediction tasks in autonomous driving. Most existing works are based on U-shaped architectures, where high-resolution representations are progressively recovered by connecting different levels of the decoder with low-resolution representations from the encoder. We observed that rich details from low-level representation and high semantic information from high-level representations are not fully utilized in the cross-stage fusion process. Additionally, current architectures often struggle to extract efficient discriminative feature along object boundaries. To address this issue, we propose CSNet, a generic cross-stage subtraction network that extracts spatial and semantic multi-scale representations through guided contextual feature. This approach allows fine-grained features to refine deeper layers, capturing discriminative high-resolution features while filtering out redundant information. Specifically, we introduce a cross-stage subtraction module (CSM), which consists of three sub-modules: 1) a Short Path Unit, focusing on capturing complementary adjacent information; 2) Medium Path Unit for effective middle-stages features aggregation; and 3) Long Path Unit for redundant information masking and long-range context modeling. Additionally, we propose the Semantic Guided Context Reasoning (SGCR) module to reason and model contextual relations between different subtraction units. CSNet demonstrates consistent performance gains across various semantic segmentation datasets. Our model, CSNet-M, achieves 82.2% mIoU on the Camvid dataset, while CSNet-S and CSNet-M attain 79.6% and 80.5% mIoU accuracy, respectively, on the Cityscapes dataset. These results show that the proposed CSNet has the potential for enhancing real-time semantic segmentation in autonomous driving applications, offering improved accuracy and efficiency in diverse urban scenarios.

  abstract     = {Traffic prediction is an essential function of intelligent transportation system for traffic control and autonomous driving. Most existing methods encode traffic spatial and temporal data separately, and then design a feature fusion module to correlate spatial and temporal features. However, spatial information is often static, and repetitive static spatial encoding leads to waste of resources, especially in large-scale traffic network prediction. In this paper, we propose a dynamic edge interaction encoding method for spatio-temporal features based on inverse Transformer (iTransformer) and Graph Transformer, named iTPGT-former. The dynamic edge interaction process is designed to embed dynamic temporal features into static edges via a convolutional embedding module. To enhance the Graph Transformer, a relative position encoding strategy based on the self-attentive score of the positive definite kernel (PDK) on graphs and a method for graph substructure encoding (GSE) via enumeration of paths are introduced. In the experimental and discussion session, the iTPGT-former is considered for accuracy, parameters, inference speed, and rich ablation experiments are provided based on six publicly available traffic datasets. The results show that iTPGT-former outperforms the baseline model in both traffic flow and traffic speed prediction. The maximum improvement is achieved in the METR-LA 60-min speed prediction task, with 15.2% reduction in Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). In addition, the inference of iTPGT-former is significantly faster than the GCN-based method. Our implementation of the iTPGT-former is available at https://github.com/ouyangnann/iTPGTN-former.},

  abstract     = {With the advancement of satellite communication technology, the maritime Internet of Things (IoT) has made significant progress. As a result, vast amounts of Automatic Identification System (AIS) data from global vessels are transmitted to various maritime stakeholders through Maritime IoT systems. AIS data contains a large amount of dynamic and static information that requires effective and intuitive visualization for comprehensive analysis. However, two major deficiencies challenge current visualization models: a lack of consideration for interactions between distant pixels and low efficiency. To address these issues, we developed a large-scale vessel trajectories visualization algorithm, called the Non-local Kernel Density Estimation (NLKDE) algorithm, which incorporates a non-local convolution process. It accurately calculates the density distribution of vessel trajectories by considering correlations between distant pixels. Additionally, we implemented the NLKDE algorithm under a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) framework to enable parallel computing and improve operational efficiency. Comprehensive experiments using multiple vessel trajectory datasets show that the NLKDE algorithm excels in vessel trajectory density visualization tasks, and the GPU-accelerated framework significantly shortens the execution time to achieve real-time results. From both theoretical and practical perspectives, GPU-accelerated NLKDE provides technical support for real-time monitoring of vessel dynamics in complex water areas and contributes to constructing maritime intelligent transportation systems.

The Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) method is then employed to optimize the outcomes produced by the WADRL, thereby mitigating the limitations of both approaches. Firstly, we design an MOVRPTW model to balance the minimization of travel cost and the maximization of customer satisfaction. Subsequently, we present a novel DRL framework that incorporates a transformer-based policy network. This network is composed of an encoder module, a weight embedding module where the weights of the objective functions are incorporated, and a decoder module. NSGA-II is then utilized to optimize the solutions generated by WADRL. Finally, extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing and traditional methods. Due to the numerous constraints in VRPTW, generating initial solutions of the NSGA-II algorithm can be time-consuming. However, using solutions generated by the WADRL as initial solutions for NSGA-II significantly reduces the time required for generating initial solutions. Meanwhile, the NSGA-II algorithm can enhance the quality of solutions generated by WADRL, resulting in solutions with better scalability. Notably, the weight-aware strategy significantly reduces the training time of DRL while achieving better results, enabling a single DRL model to solve the entire multiobjective optimization problem.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates discrete-time sliding mode trajectory tracking control for fully actuated autonomous surface vessels (ASVs) with unknown nonlinear dead-zone and saturation inputs, utilizing a switching dynamic event-triggered mechanism (DETM). Through model integration, a direct relationship between ASV position and control inputs is established, simplifying trajectory tracking strategy design. ASVs face dead-zone and saturation constraints in control inputs, where low input signals may not overcome static friction, hindering maneuverability, and further increases are ineffective once actuators reach maximum thrust. Unlike linear dead-zone and saturation input constraints with known parameters, this paper considers a more realistic scenario of unknown nonlinearity, employing adaptive neural networks to approximate and compensate for the resulting unknown dynamics. Moreover, limited internal communication resources constrain real-time inter-subsystem communication in ASVs, while frequent short-period sampling in stable conditions results in unnecessary energy and computational consumption, collectively degrading trajectory tracking performance. A novel switching DETM is proposed to reduce unnecessary data transmission, which switches triggering conditions based on variations in auxiliary dynamic variables. Meanwhile, the controller output variation is integrated into the event-triggered conditions to enhance tracking control performance. Based on this, a discrete-time sliding mode trajectory tracking controller suitable for large sampling periods is designed. This ensures satisfactory tracking control effectiveness while further reducing unnecessary data transmission frequency and conserving limited communication resources within a larger range of sampling periods. All tracking errors are proven to be controlled within a small vicinity near zero. The numerical simulation results validate the efficacy of the proposed control strategy.},

The vehicle self-organizing formation control module organizes the merging vehicles within the V2V communication range into multiple local platoons. The dynamic self-adjusting critical interval and a fixed-topology second-order platoon consistency control protocol are proposed to divided the vehicles reasonably and make the states of local platoon vehicles consistent. The merging vehicles merge into the target platoon as a whole in the form of a local platoon, which transforms the complex multi-vehicle merge problem into a platoon cooperative control problem and improves the merging efficiency. The platoon cooperative merging control module adopts a distributed model predictive control (DMPC) theory to design two longitudinal cooperative merging controllers, which control the target platoon to split to create a merging gap and the local platoon to align with this gap longitudinally. The lateral merging controller controls the local platoon change the lane to merge into the target platoon safely and smoothly. Simulation experiments are conducted in typical scenarios, and it is verified that the proposed control strategy can enable multi-vehicles to merge into a platoon efficiently, safely, and stably.},

While recent works have explored various multi-modal fusion methods to enhance accuracy and robustness, fusing multi-view images and high-definition (HD) maps remains uncharted. Inspired by our previous work, we endeavor to introduce HD maps to camera-based detection, prompting the design of a new framework. To address this, we first analyze the function of HD maps in object detection to understand their benefits and the rationale for their fusion. From this analysis, we identify key disparities in view, semantics, and scale, leading to the development of MIM, a framework for HD Maps Incorporated Multi-view 3D object detection. HD maps are enriched in semantics by sampling unlabeled areas and encoding them into map features. Simultaneously, multi-view images are transformed into features in bird’s-eye view (BEV) using the adopted baseline. These features are then fused using attention mechanisms to align scales. Experiments conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MIM outperforms camera-based methods. Moreover, an in-depth analysis investigates how HD maps impact object detection regarding each semantic layer. The results underscore the operational intricacies of HD maps in perception, setting the stage for future research. Code is available at https://github.com/WHU-xjs/MIM-3D-Det.},

  abstract     = {Safe urban driving is challenging due to the high density of traffic flow and various potential hazards, such as the sudden appearance of unknown objects. Traditional rule-based approaches and imitation learning methods struggle to address the diverse driving scenarios encountered in urban environments. Reinforcement learning (RL), which adapts to a wide range of driving scenarios through continuous interaction with the environment, has demonstrated success in autonomous driving. Making safety decisions when driving in urban environments necessitates a comprehensive perception of the current scene and the ability to predict the evolution of the dynamic scene. In this paper, we present a novel cascade deep reinforcement learning framework, CDRP3, designed to enhance the safety decision-making capabilities of self-driving vehicles in complex scenarios and emergencies. We leverage a multi-modal spatio-temporal perception (MmSTP) module to fuse multi-modal sensor data and introduce temporal perception to capture spatio-temporal information about dynamic driving environments, and a future state prediction (FSP) module to model complex interactions between different traffic participants and explicitly predict their future states. Subsequently, in the PPO-based planning module, we use the comprehensive environmental information obtained from perception and prediction to decode an optimized driving strategy using a lateral and longitudinal separated multi-branch network structure guided by a customized reward function. This approach enables knowledge transfer from the perception and prediction components to planning, and planning-oriented enhancement of safety decision-making capabilities to improve driving safety. Our experiments demonstrate that CDRP3 outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing superior driving safety in complex urban environments.},

Various objectives must be fulfilled in a PP task, and the majority of prior works integrate all objectives into a unified cost function. To prioritize the dominant objectives of each PP stage, we propose to decouple the PP task into two separate subtasks, enabling the logical establishment of subtask-oriented segmented PP methods. First, based on risk evaluation of four vehicle vertices, an improved artificial potential field was established. Second, a novel transit point selection method was applied to decouple the PP task into two segmented subtasks. Then, the optimization problem was converted into a multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) problem and the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method was utilized to obtain two optimal segmented paths. Finally, a velocity planner based on cubic polynomial, in conjunction with a support vector machine-based stability classifier, was designed. The proposed trajectory planner was then verified in six typical driving scenarios, including both simulation and real vehicle studies. Verification results demonstrate that the proposed planner effectively decouples the PP task and achieves a safe, comfortable, efficient, and trackable trajectory.},

  abstract     = {Urban Air Mobility (UAM), powered by flying cars, is poised to revolutionize urban transportation by expanding vehicle travel from the ground to the air. This advancement promises to alleviate congestion and enable faster commutes. However, the fast travel speeds mean vehicles will encounter vastly different environments during a single journey. As a result, onboard learning systems need access to extensive environmental data, leading to high costs in data collection and training. These demands conflict with the limited in-vehicle computing and battery resources. Fortunately, learning model sharing offers a solution. Well-trained local Deep Learning (DL) models can be shared with other vehicles, reducing the need for redundant data collection and training. However, this sharing process relies heavily on efficient vehicular communications in UAM. To address these challenges, this paper leverages the multi-hop Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) technology to improve DL model sharing between distant flying cars. We also employ knowledge distillation to reduce the size of the shared DL models and enable efficient integration of non-identical models at the receiver. Our approach enhances model sharing and onboard learning performance for cars entering new environments.

The model’s backbone employs structured reparameterization and lightweight Vision Transformers, using multi-branch and Feed-Forward Network structures to boost informational richness and positional awareness, respectively. The Neck network utilizes the Low-GD structure to enhance the aggregation and integration of multi-scale features, reducing information loss during cross-layer exchanges.

Our method excels on the YCTL2024 traffic light dataset, achieving a detection speed of 135 FPS and 98.23% accuracy, with only 1.3M model parameters.

  abstract     = {Lane changing presents a dynamic scenario characterized by intricate interactions among vehicles. Within mixed-autonomy traffic environment, modeling a human-like lane-change trajectory enables human drivers to better understand and predict autonomous vehicles’ behaviors, thereby enhancing road safety and travel efficiency. In this study, we achieve human-like interactive lane-change modeling based on a novel framework named Diff-LC. The human-like modeling of LCV behaviors relies on an advanced diffusive planner, and the implemented trajectory is selected based on the recovered LCV reward function learned through Multi-Agent Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning (MA-AIRL). To account for interactions between FVs and LCVs, we further employ a diffusive predictor to forecast future behaviors of FVs conditioned on both historical and planned trajectories. Additionally, we leverage the recovered reward function of FVs to enable controllable prediction of trajectories. In the experimental part, we begin by analyzing the significance of features in the recovered reward functions and then proceed to compare the distinctions between the LCV and the FV. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we compare the diffusive predictor and planner with several state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrate that motions planned by Diff-LC closely reach the intended positions with small displacement errors and exhibit highly similar speed and jerk distributions to those of human drivers. We also conduct a dynamic simulation to evaluate Diff-LC’s performance across different traffic conditions. Finally, we explore customized generation using the Diffusion Posterior Sampling method.

  abstract     = {Human mobility is intricately influenced by urban contexts spatially and temporally, constituting essential domain knowledge in understanding traffic systems. While existing traffic forecasting models primarily rely on raw traffic data and advanced deep learning techniques, incorporating contextual information remains underexplored due to insufficient integration frameworks and the complexity of urban contexts. This study proposes a novel context-aware knowledge graph (CKG) framework to enhance traffic speed forecasting by effectively modeling spatial and temporal contexts. Employing a relation-dependent integration strategy, the framework generates context-aware representations from the spatial and temporal units of CKG to capture spatio-temporal dependencies of urban contexts. A CKG-GNN model, combining the CKG, dual-view multi-head self-attention (MHSA), and graph neural network (GNN), is then designed to predict traffic speed utilizing these context-aware representations. Our experiments demonstrate that CKG’s configuration significantly influences embedding performance, with ComplEx and KG2E emerging as optimal for embedding spatial and temporal units, respectively. The CKG-GNN model establishes a benchmark for 10-120 min predictions, achieving average MAE, MAPE, and RMSE of 3.46±0.01, 14.76±0.09%, and 5.08±0.01, respectively. Compared to the baseline DCRNN model, integrating the spatial unit improves the MAE by 0.04 and the temporal unit by 0.13, while integrating both units further reduces it by 0.18. The dual-view MHSA analysis reveals the crucial role of relation-dependent features from the context-based view and the model’s ability to prioritize recent time slots in prediction from the sequence-based view. Overall, this study underscores the importance of merging context-aware knowledge graphs with graph neural networks to improve traffic forecasting.},

  abstract     = {The increased prevalence of stairs and ramps in urban areas has highlighted the importance of understanding pedestrian dynamics on inclined surfaces. Previous studies indicate that pedestrians exhibit distinct motion characteristics on slopes compared to level ground. While traditional rule-based models used for pedestrian simulation may not accurately capture the complexities of pedestrian behaviour on slopes, this paper presents a Transferable Pedestrian Motion Simulation Network (TPMSN) tailored for accurately modelling pedestrian dynamics on slopes. The TPMSN incorporates five key input features to capture relative position information, neighbour motion states, and trends in pedestrian motion. Through a transferable layer, the network demonstrates versatility in handling crowd simulation tasks across different slope angles. Networks pre-trained with data from pedestrian single-file flow experiments exhibit robust fitting performance, with R-square values ranging from 0.848 to 0.999. Furthermore, transfer learning is applied with experimental data from pedestrian unidirectional flow on slopes. Two independent networks are trained to predict instantaneous velocity vectors. Simulations carried out by the two networks demonstrate promising accuracy and authenticity, which are validated by a mean Average Displacement Error (ATE) of 0.0926 m and reproduction of flow-density fundamental diagrams. Additionally, the networks could capture pedestrian lateral body sway, a crucial aspect of real-life pedestrian behaviour on slopes, as evidenced by lane entropy trends consistent with empirical studies. Overall, the TPMSN offers a successful approach for crowd simulation on slopes. This work contributes to the advancement of crowd simulation techniques in complex terrains, offering valuable implications for urban planning, crowd management and architectural design.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid expansion of information technology, the complexity of transportation systems is increasing, which promotes the application of prediction on the field of intelligent transportation. However, the existing methods about intelligent transportation prediction have the phenomenon of losing some important information in the prediction process. Meanwhile, some redundant features affect the improvement of prediction accuracy. Moreover, the randomness of k-value selection in k-nearest neighbour (KNN) leads to some limitations in the prediction performance of intelligent transportation prediction. To address these challenges, this paper designs a dynamic prediction system of generalized regression neural network (GRNN) with feedback mechanism by virtue of KNN and modified grey wolf optimization algorithm (MGWO), named KNN-MGWO-FMGRNN. Firstly, the discrepancy value between different samples for each feature is calculated and the k nearest samples to a certain sample are taken as the discrepancy result of this sample under this feature. Then, the KNN results are fused with the difference results and combined with the MGWO algorithm to obtain the optimal k-value. Next, the optimal k-value is used to recalculate the difference result and the KNN result to complete the feature subset selection (FSS). Further, the optimal FSS and model learning are completed simultaneously using FMGRNN. Finally, the availability and merits of the established model are affirmed by six real data sets.},

The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming aiming to minimize operational costs and risks over a day-to-day rolling planning horizon. A two-stage decomposition (TSD) method is proposed to solve this challenging problem. In the first stage, bus maintenance is scheduled on a daily basis. The second stage then optimizes specific bus maintenance and vehicle schedules within each day. With such a problem decomposition, the computational complexity is significantly reduced as the within-day problems become independent. Computational experiments conducted on a real-world bus line demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the TSD method. Compared to a one-step solution method and an algorithm in a similar existing study, the proposed TSD method consumes far less computation time, while delivering high-quality solutions. Moreover, the TSD solution method can be further greatly accelerated if the within-day problems of the second stage are solved in parallel with different computers. The computational results also highlight the benefits of the proposed two-stage optimization approach in enhancing operational cost-efficiency and bus resource utilization.},

In this paper, we first propose to ensure the isolation of VDTs with the assistance of intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) and network slicing (NS), and obtain better update time of the VDTs within limited resources. Specifically, we divide resources for VDTs with different update requirements to ensure the isolation of VDTs and the resources required for update. On the other hand, considering that the communication performance between vehicles and base stations is affected by urban building density, we propose using an intelligent controller to achieve intelligent control of the physical channel by adjusting the phase shift of passive reflective elements to ensure better transmission performance during VDTs updating. Secondly, considering the dynamic variability of vehicles and the environment, we propose an improved deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on the actor-critic framework to allocate communication, computing resources, and adjust the phase shift of the IRS. Finally, a large number of simulation results indicate that our proposed algorithm performs better than the benchmark algorithms.},

Specifically, battery swapping is a novel mode of power supply for EVs. However, the new way of energy supply complicates the action policies of EVs, especially when the number of power supply facilities is limited. To address this issue, this paper proposes a multilevel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method to coordinate the action of EVs within the battery charging and swapping station (BCSS) environment. Firstly, an action-driven simulation framework is developed to simulate the BCSS environment and obtain the EVs’ attributes. Then the multilevel algorithm is proposed to drive the EVs to obtain charging strategies. In the multilevel algorithm, the initial decision for EVs is provided by a DRL-based model. Then the advantage value function is utilized to adjust the initial decision of EVs to meet the constraints of limited charging and swapping equipment. Besides, unlike traditional DRL-based methods, the proposed model is driven by the rewards obtained from EV actions. Finally, extensive experiments have shown that the proposed multilevel DRL-based method has superior performance over existing methods in resolving coordinated battery charging and swapping actions. In particular, the proposed model can provide a suggested and reasonable price range for the practical battery swapping mode operation.},

However, current ISAC research often focuses on overall performance assessment across extended periods, potentially overlooking practical sensing requirements, resulting in degraded or even unstable communication performance. To mitigate these challenges, we propose an Integrated On-Demand Sensing and Communication (IDSAC) mechanism for HSRMNs. IDSAC optimizes train communication energy efficiency (EE) by jointly optimizing target sensing selection and transmit beamforming, while adhering to Age of Information (AoI) constraints and ensuring beam pattern gain for designated targets. To tackle the non-convex mixed-integer programming challenge, we decompose the problem into two parts. First, we employ iterative algorithms using successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) to address the EE problem. Second, we introduce a dynamic control algorithm employing the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty method to manage AoI constraints and sensing selection. Our joint optimization approach achieves optimal EE under dynamic operational constraints typical of high-speed rail systems. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of IDSAC in optimizing ISAC performance, enhancing railway safety and communication efficiency.},

In this paper, we propose a novel flow-based generative method JTE-CFlow for low-light image enhancement, which consists of a joint-attention transformer based conditional encoder (JTE) and a map-wise cross affine coupling flow (CFlow). Specifically, JTE executes short-range and long-range operations by RRDBs (i.e., residual-in-residual dense blocks) and JATs (i.e., joint-attention transformer blocks) in series connection. JAT achieves weak information amplification and information loss restoration of zero-element pixels by the integration of self-attention and specific-attention with sharing the same value vectors, where the query and key vectors of specific-attention are from the zero-map feature of the low-light image. On the other hand, CFlow develops a map-wise cross affine coupling (MCAC) layer to perform cross learning for the flow feature, and a multiplication coupling network (MCN) to learn the transformation parameters of MCAC. JTE-CFlow learns to map the subtraction of outputs of CFlow and JTE (i.e., the residual code) into a standard normal distribution, and the inverse network of CFlow takes the latent feature of the low-light image as its input to infer the enhanced image. Experiments show that JTE-CFlow outperforms most SOTA methods on 7 mainstream low-light datasets with the same architecture, and can be applied to enhance NTM images.

This paper introduces a novel lane-changing method that interactively combines prediction and planning to cope with the complex traffic scenarios. Firstly, a new target vehicle trajectory prediction network based on the hierarchical attention modules is proposed. The initial predictions are fed into a combined sampling and optimization method for selecting an ego vehicle lane changing maneuver. Unlike previous unidirectional frameworks, the selected maneuver is re-entered into the prediction network so that extra ego vehicle planning information can be incorporated to reduce prediction uncertainties. Finally, based on the planning-informed predictions and the selected maneuver, we design a nonlinear model predictive controller to achieve a safe, efficient and comfortable lane change trajectory in the Frenet coordinate. The root mean square errors of the proposed prediction network at the fifth second on the NGSIM and HighD test sets are 3.54 m and 1.18 m, respectively, which both achieve the state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, the results of real traffic data based simulations and real-vehicle experiments highlight the effectiveness of the lane-changing framework.},

  abstract     = {Person Re-identification (ReID) aims to retrieve the specific person across non-overlapping cameras, which greatly helps intelligent transportation systems. As we all know, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers have the unique strengths to extract local and global features, respectively. Considering this fact, we focus on the mutual fusion between them to learn more comprehensive representations for persons. In particular, we utilize the complementary integration of deep features from different model structures. We propose a novel fusion framework called FusionReID to unify the strengths of CNNs and Transformers for image-based person ReID. More specifically, we first deploy a Dual-branch Feature Extraction (DFE) to extract features through CNNs and Transformers from a single image. Moreover, we design a novel Dual-attention Mutual Fusion (DMF) to achieve sufficient feature fusions. The DMF comprises Local Refinement Units (LRU) and Heterogenous Transmission Modules (HTM). LRU utilizes depth-separable convolutions to align deep features in channel dimensions and spatial sizes. HTM consists of a Shared Encoding Unit (SEU) and two Mutual Fusion Units (MFU). Through the continuous stacking of HTM, deep features after LRU are repeatedly utilized to generate more discriminative features. Extensive experiments on three public ReID benchmarks demonstrate that our method can attain superior performances than most state-of-the-arts.

  abstract     = {Given the complex nature of interaction under ambiguous right-of-way scenarios, the interactions between Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and Human-driven Vehicles (HVs) present considerable challenges to the safety and efficiency of the traffic system. Existing AVs struggle to comprehend and apply common HV social norms, especially the proactive behavior exhibited by adept human drivers in ambiguous right-of-way scenarios. In this study, we propose a novel framework to leverage expert priors for proactive-aware decision-making in ambiguous right-of-way, merging Reinforcement Learning (RL) with parameterized modeling. Building upon unprotected-turning interactions from real-world driving datasets, we select typical cases under ambiguous right-of-way as human-expert priors, which are utilized to guide the learning of the RL agent. Then, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), which is governed by interpretable parameters derived from expert priors, introduces human decision updating mechanism into AV strategy. Experimenting with typical driving tasks, our approach achieves balanced safety and efficiency in tackling ambiguities of right-of-way, with superior decision-making performance via the guidance of expert priors when compared with established baselines. Furthermore, the results indicate that the proposed method enables AVs to accelerate the convergence during the interaction by consistent probing and decision updates.},

  abstract     = {The U-shaped yard is an important part of the U-shaped automated container terminal (U-ACT), which consists of a set of blocks used for storing containers, I-lanes for automated guided vehicles (AGVs) travel, and U-lanes for external trucks (ETs) travel. Double-side cantilever yard cranes (DCYCs) perform stacking and unstacking operations for containers transported by AGVs and ETs. Managing and coordinating the operations of DCYC, AGVs, and ETs, not only improves the operation efficiency of U-ACTs but also helps to promote the development of green ports. This paper addresses the problem of scheduling DCYCs and path planning for AGVs and ETs in the U-ACT. To achieve this, we establish a bi-objective mixed integer programming model to minimize both the makespan and the energy consumption. The model considers conflicts between two DCYCs within each block, ensures workload balance for these DCYCs, optimizes parking slots for AGVs and ETs, and schedules appropriate entry times for AGVs and ETs into the yard to reduce conflicts. To solve this model, we develop an improved multi-objective particle swarm optimization (IMOPSO) algorithm, where a globally optimal heuristic search mechanism and several conflict avoidance strategies to plan conflict-free spatiotemporal paths are introduced to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superiority of the IMOPSO approach in terms of multiple metrics, confirming the effectiveness of the optimized vehicle entry timing strategy, which improves efficiency by 7.33% and yields energy savings by 11.72%. These findings clearly highlight that our model and solution approach can effectively enhance the operational efficiency of DCYCs, AGVs, and ETs, contributing to the overall improvement of container terminal operations.},

Due to the complexity of the proposed model, the instances that can be solved to optimality are usually small to medium-sized and face computational difficulties in solving larger instances.

  abstract     = {Vision-language tracking is a new rising topic in intelligent transportation systems, particularly significant in autonomous driving and road surveillance. It is a task that aims to combine visual and auxiliary linguistic modalities to co-locate the target object in a video sequence. Currently, multi-modal data scarcity and burdensome modality fusion have become two major factors in limiting the development of vision-language tracking. To tackle the issues, we propose an efficient and effective one-stage vision-language tracking framework (CPIPTrack) that unifies feature extraction and multi-modal fusion by interactive prompt learning. Feature extraction is performed by the high-performance vision-language foundation model CLIP, resulting in the impressive generalization ability inherited from the large-scale model. Modality fusion is simplified to a few lightweight prompts, leading to significant savings in computational resources. Specifically, we design three types of prompts to dynamically learn the layer-wise feature relationships between vision and language, facilitating rich context interactions while enabling the pre-trained CLIP adaptation. In this manner, discriminative target-oriented visual features can be extracted by language and template guidance, which are used for subsequent reasoning. Due to the elimination of extra heavy modality fusion, the proposed CPIPTrack shows high efficiency in both training and inference. CPIPTrack has been extensively evaluated on three benchmark datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that it achieves a good performance-speed balance with an AUC of 66.0% on LaSOT and a runtime of 51.7 FPS on RTX2080 Super.},

  abstract     = {Coordinated ramp metering (CRM) is one effective measure to alleviate urban expressway congestion. Traditional model-based methods generally concentrate on single-bottleneck scenarios, while ignoring the case of multiple bottlenecks. In addition, the fixed-sensor fails to fully capture the dynamic traffic characteristics. The rapid development of traffic detection technology has made available a large amount of automatic vehicle identification (AVI) data, which can record detailed individual trajectories. Taking advantage of the AVI data, CRM can be improved. Besides, multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) and game theory have been proven to be effective for traffic signal control. These methods can address the challenges faced by CRM, such as solving nonlinear and high-dimensional optimization problems. This paper proposes a distributed CRM strategy with multi-bottleneck to minimize the total travel time and balance the multiple on-ramps equity, using the individual trajectory information from AVI data. Firstly, the paper defines road segment units, road segment groups, and bottlenecks. Next, the problem is formulated as a potential game that captures the interaction among multiple bottlenecks. The controllers utilize the MADDPG algorithm to determine the green duration of the on-ramps. Finally, the proposed strategy is tested on a real-world urban expressway in a microsimulation platform SUMO. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed strategy performs better than the baseline methods in eliminating mainline congestion and improving the multiple on-ramps equity. Compared to the no-control scenario, the proposed strategy has improved the performance of the system throughput, average travel time, and average mainline speed by 1.31%, 44.36%, and 115.23%.},

  abstract     = {This study addresses the challenge of retrieving traffic road visibility in the Internet of Video Things (IoVT). The complexity arises from the highly ill-posed inverse problem of estimating road visibility from video frames due to indirect inference, leading to ambiguity and multiple possible solutions. Initially, this study formulates the fog effects on images and discovers that the first and second eigenvalues of the observed image matrix closely approximate those of the airlight component under fog conditions. Based on this important discovery, a four-step framework is proposed for estimating road visibility. The framework includes defining persistent scatterers, formulating a singular value decomposition (SVD)-based method for background and airlight separation, extracting crucial physical features, and designing a hybrid convolutional long short-term memory (LSTM) network for accurate visibility estimation. Specifically, the foundational step defines persistent scatterers in visual scenes, followed by a sophisticated SVD-based method for background and airlight separation. Subsequently, physical features, including eigenvalue-based entropy and persistent scatterer intensity, are computed. The framework concludes with a novel hybrid convolutional LSTM network tailored for traffic road visibility estimation. To validate the methodology, three comparative research methods are introduced: one based on the Koschmieder law, another utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN), and a third employing a deep LSTM approach. Results indicate correlation coefficients of 0.2417, 0.3325, 0.7930, and 0.9484 for the Koschmieder law-based, CNN, deep LSTM, and the proposed method, respectively, when compared to true visibility measurements. Furthermore, the averaged root mean square estimation errors are 6539 m, 9095 m, 1600 m, and 681 m for the Koschmieder law-based, CNN, deep LSTM, and the proposed method, respectively.

In this paper, we propose the RSTR model, which is a two-layer model that takes advantages of the two mainstream methods. We model the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process and design the optimization objective.

  abstract     = {Object detection in infrared images poses a considerable challenge due to its small-scale targets, low contrast and poor signal-to-clutter ratio, often resulting in a high false alarm rate. To improve the detection accuracy on infrared small targets, we introduce Light-SGMTLM, a lightweight and saliency-guided multi-task learning model. This model integrates saliency detection into the YOLOv5x framework through a parallel multi-task learning structure and employs a joint loss function during training. Such integration significantly alleviates the impact of complex backgrounds and improves the precision of small target localization. Moreover, we have developed a streamlined module, termed SIWD, to create a more agile backbone, which establishes an optimal balance between precision and efficiency, making the model more suitable for situations with limited computational resources. Comprehensive comparative experiments were conducted on six infrared small target datasets, namely, Small-ExtIRShip, Small-SSDD, IHAST, NUAA-SIRST, IRSTD-1k, and IRDST, and we assessed the model’s performance against ten leading target detection models, such as YOLOv7, YOLOv8, DINO, and Relation-DETR. The findings reveal that our method’s unique joint learning architecture, combining saliency and object detection tasks, significantly improves accuracy for infrared small target detection. Notably, it achieved impressive mean average precision (mAP) values of 92.60% and 75.71% on the NUAA-SIRST and IRSTD-1k datasets, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Headway regularity is an essential indicator of transit reliability, directly influencing passenger waiting time and transit service quality. In this paper, we employ multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to develop a Cooperative Transit signal priority strategy with Variable phase for Headway adherence (CTVH) under a multi-intersection network. Each signalized intersection is controlled by an RL agent, which determines the next step’s signal, adapting to real-time traffic dynamics of transits and non-transits and promoting transit headway adherence. The proposed approach considers four critical aspects, i.e., complicated states with multiple conflicting bus requests, rational actions constrained by domain knowledge, comprehensive rewards balancing buses and cars, and a collaborative training scheme among agents. They are correspondingly addressed by proper state representation with estimated bus headway deviations, irrational actions masking, reward functions formulated by general traffic queue and transit headway deviation, and appropriate MARL approach with synchronous action processing. Our method also takes into account the phase transition loss by setting yellow and all-red time. Simulation results compared with the coordinated fixed-time signal (CFT) and bus holding (BH) strategy verify the merits of the proposed method in terms of improvements in transit headway adherence and influence on general traffic. Based on the results, we further discuss the BH method’s limitations due to bus bay length and various holding lines and the CTVH method’s benefits in the three-intersection environment and the entire-line network. The proposed method has a promising application in practice to improve transit reliability.},

  abstract     = {Monocular 3D object detection finds applications in various fields, notably in intelligent driving, due to its cost-effectiveness and ease of deployment. However, its accuracy significantly lags behind LiDAR-based methods, primarily because the monocular depth estimation problem is inherently challenging. While some methods leverage additional information to aid in network training and enhance performance, they are hindered by their reliance on specific datasets. We contend that many components of monocular 3D object detection lack the necessary adaptability, impeding the performance of the detector. In this paper, we propose six adaptive methods addressing issues related to network structure, loss function, and optimizer. These methods specifically target the rigid components within the detector that hinder adaptability. Simultaneously, we provide theoretical insights into the network output and propose two novel regression methods. These methods facilitate more straightforward learning for the network. Importantly, our approach does not depend on supplementary information, allowing for end-to-end training. In comparison with existing methods, our proposed approach demonstrates competitive speed and accuracy. On the KITTI dataset, our method achieves a 17.72% AP3D(IOU =0.7, Car, Moderate), outperforming all previous monocular methods. Additionally, our approach prioritizes speed, achieving a runtime of up to 52 FPS on an RTX 2080Ti GPU, surpassing all previous monocular methods.

Existing systems often compromise essential foreground point features and local spatial interactions through random down-sampling, focusing primarily on local feature extraction. However, this neglects interactions among distant yet significant points, limiting semantic information and detection performance due to inherent point cloud data sparsity. Addressing this, our proposed Geometric Feature Aggregation and Self-Attention in a Multi-Head Transformer (GFA-SMT) architecture leverages Graph Convolutional Networks and multi-channel transformers to enhance weak semantic information of distant sparse objects. GFA-SMT comprises three modules: Distance Suppression for Local Receptive Fields (DsLRF), Geometric Feature Aggregator with Multi-head Self Attention (GFaSA), and Predicted Key-point Weighting and Refinement (PKwR). DsLRF preserves foreground features, GFaSA encodes similar features and aggregates edge features, while PKwR focuses on key-points for enhancing geometric knowledge of distant and sparse objects. Extensive experiments on KITTI, DIARV2X-I and NuScenes datasets show significant enhancements in widely used techniques, resulting in notable increases in average precision (AP) for 3D object detection: 4.08%, 5.56%, and 4.62%, respectively, on the KITTI test dataset. GFA-SMT enhances point cloud detection accuracy, particularly at medium and long distances, with minimal impact on run-time performance and model parameters.},

  abstract     = {The availability of GPS data from motorized vehicles potentially enables a much more detailed, accurate, and up-to-date analysis of traffic behavior than survey data. Exact routes and driving behavior (speed, acceleration, etc.) can be observed, making it possible to analyze and model congestion and emissions on specific road sections. However, these advantages come with drawbacks: Raw GPS data usually only includes timestamps and coordinates and lacks information on trip purpose, transportation mode, and socio-demographics. This is one reason traffic simulation models are still primarily based on conventional travel survey data. Conventional travel surveys suffer from small sample sizes and infrequent updates. To exploit the potential of GPS data, we present a method for detecting trip purposes from raw GPS data of motorized vehicles. In contrast to previous approaches that rely on supervised machine learning and require ground truth data for training, our methodology uses only unsupervised machine learning techniques. This enables the utilization of any GPS datasets, a capability previously unavailable. The proposed method is based on the plausible assumption that especially destination areas can reveal trip purposes. We apply this methodology to analyze 170, 000 trips for Frankfurt / Germany. Initially, we segment the study area into clusters of sub-areas to condense origin and destination information, which we then integrate with other trip-related variables in a multi-phase trajectory clustering process. Our analysis identifies eight distinct trip purposes. These findings are validated by comparing them with results from the national travel survey, demonstrating the plausibility of our proposed methodology.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicles in Intelligent Transportation Systems aim to boost the adaptability performances of complex problem-solving behaviour in the Sim-to-Real self-driving mission. However, the difficulty for Sim2Real adaption is the so-called “catastrophic forgetting” challenge, i.e., the pre-training policy exposes the flaws of the inability to retain previously skill motion when generalizing to the mixed real-world scenario, which affects learning in an inefficient way. This paper could deal with the above challenge by taking advantage of reconfigurable Sim2Real policies from simpler, previously learned sub-tasks, which are superior to those of pre-defined artificial systems. Specifically, a novel reward-oriented hierarchical learning framework based on hierarchical cognitive mechanisms is proposed dedicated to Sim2Real autonomous driving. Such a learning mechanism breaks down the behavior-aware experience into two distinguished types concerning environmental rewards: basic task-agnostic background and dynamic object-specific foreground. It further reveals the intrinsic association between previously learned knowledge and multiple changing events, by utilizing goal-conditioned key skill motion tailored for specific sub-task rewards. Moreover, the reconfigurable Sim2Real rehearsal is developed to boost the efficiency of high-level policies’ generalization ability according to the reuse of the configurable skill motion via mirrored composition. Extensive validation on both simulated and real-world Sim2Real testbench of challenging autonomous driving scenarios outperforms, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed learning mechanism in improving task efficiency and handling stochasticity throughout learning.},

Existing research has focused on traditional graph neural networks, which use predefined graphs and have shared parameters. But intuitive predefined graphs introduce biases into prediction tasks and the fine-grained spatio-temporal information can not be obtained by the parameter sharing model. In this paper, we consider it is crucial to learn node-specific parameters and adaptive graphs with complete edge information. To show this, we design a model based on graph structure that decouples nodes and edges into two modules. Each module extracts temporal and spatial features simultaneously. The adaptive node optimization module is used to learn the specific parameter patterns of all nodes, and the adaptive edge optimization module aims to mine the interdependencies among different nodes. Then we propose a Decoupled Adaptive Graph Convolution Attention Network for Traffic Forecasting (DAGCAN), which relies on the above two modules to dynamically capture the fine-grained spatio-temporal relationships in traffic data. Experimental results on four public transportation datasets, demonstrate that our model can further improve the accuracy of traffic prediction.},

  abstract     = {In the domain of route planning, the critical concern for travel efficiency has shifted towards optimizing travel time over distance due to the rise in congestion and the dynamic nature of modern road networks. Addressing this shift, we introduce Dynamic Route Optimization with Multi-Category Constraints (DROMC) for Point-of-Interest (POI) visits, which seeks to find the most time-efficient path that satisfies a user-defined list of requirements, considering both the spatial and temporal dimensions. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages a path enumeration algorithm, which iteratively validates the k-fastest paths until all user queries are satisfied, ensuring adherence to time constraints and POI availability. To enhance the algorithm’s efficiency, we employ several key methodologies. First, we adapt the kSP algorithm to account for POI-focused path enumeration. We also introduce a Shared Prefix Tree (SPFT) with binary encoding, which significantly improves the storage and retrieval of path information. Moreover, we integrate a grid-based heuristic for quicker computation and implement strategic pruning methods to circumvent redundant calculations and manage POI business hours effectively. Our extensive experiments on real-world networks demonstrate the algorithm’s superiority in finding more efficient paths in shorter time frames compared to existing methods.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a traffic oscillation mitigation-oriented optimal control framework for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) in a mixed traffic environment where the behavior of human-driven vehicles (HVs) is unknown. The primary objective of this framework is to alleviate traffic oscillations, thereby improving overall traffic flow. To achieve this, we introduce a novel total equilibrium spacing estimation method, incorporating stochastic parameters into a car-following model and quantifying the deviation between the mean and equilibrium spacing. This estimation, integrated with a jam-absorption driving strategy, is embedded into a Model Predictive Control (MPC) model for the objective of mitigating traffic oscillations. The efficacy of the proposed control method is evaluated through two experiments utilizing real vehicle trajectory datasets. The first experiment focuses on a single CAV, exploring the impact of key controller parameters on oscillation mitigation. Results demonstrate the optimal performance of the proposed Oscillation Mitigation-based Model Predictive Control (OM-MPC) model, even with a shorter CAV distance (e.g., 100 m), revealing a positive correlation between CAV distance and suitable preset oscillation duration. The second experiment extends the investigation to multiple stop-and-go shockwaves and varying CAV penetration rates. A comparative analysis of control models, including OM-MPC, regular MPC, and proportional-integral with saturation, is conducted based on velocity mean (VM), road segment congestion index (RI), and vehicle stop times (VST). The findings underscore the effectiveness of the proposed control method in mitigating traffic oscillations and enhancing overall traffic efficiency, establishing it as the optimal choice among the three approaches.},

IRSs are not only used to improve communication channels, but also employed as cooperative intelligent targets to enhance some objects of interest, such as vehicles and pedestrians in an intelligent transportation system. The optimal design objective function is to maximize the radar performance, while keeping the communication rate constant. The measure of radar performance is the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) of the direction of departure (DOD), which is a special capability of a collocated antenna array multiple input multiple output (MIMO) radar. The joint optimization process comprises two steps, namely the passive optimization of IRSs and the active transmit beamforming. Due to the non-convexity of the optimization problem, a solver based on semidefinite relaxation (SDR) is proposed.

This study introduces a novel approach, specifically a dynamic control authority allocation method, for implementing shared control in autonomous vehicles. Unlike conventional mixed-initiative control techniques that blend human and vehicle inputs with weights determined by predefined index, the proposed method utilizes optimization-based techniques to obtain an optimal dynamic allocation for human and vehicle inputs that satisfies safety constraints. Specifically, a convex quadratic programm (QP) is constructed incorporating control barrier functions (CBF) for safety and control Lyapunov functions (CLF) for satisfying automated control objectives. The cost function of the QP is designed such that human weight increases with the magnitude of human input. A smooth control authority transition is obtained by optimizing over the change rate of the weight instead of the weight itself. The proposed method is verified in lane-changing scenarios with human-in-the-loop (HmIL) and hardware-in-the-loop (HdIL) experiments. Results show that the proposed method outperforms index-based control authority allocation method in terms of agility, safety and comfort.},

  abstract     = {Game-theoretic decision making has the potential to bring human-like reasoning skills to autonomous vehicles (AVs), fostering trust between humans and AVs. However, to make these approaches sufficiently practical for real-world use, challenges such as game complexity and incomplete information have to be addressed. Game complexity refers to the difficulties in solving a game-theoretic problem, which include solution existence, algorithm convergence, and scalability. We show in our recent work that a possible solution to overcoming these difficulties is to use potential games. However, constructing a potential game often requires specific cost function designs, limiting their broad use. To address this challenge, we propose to employ a game projection technique in this paper, relaxing the cost function design conditions and making the potential game approach applicable to broader scenarios, even including the ones that cannot be modelled as a potential game. Incomplete information refers to the ego vehicle’s lack of knowledge of other traffic agents’ cost functions. In a driving scenario, deviations of the ego vehicle assumed/estimated others’ cost functions from their actual ones are often inevitable. This necessitate the robustness analysis of a game-theoretic solution. This paper defines the robustness margin of a game solution as the maximum magnitude of cost function deviations that can be accommodated without changing the optimality of the game solution. With this definition, closed-form robustness margins are derived. Numerical studies using highway lane-changing scenarios are reported.},

Traditional methods for panoramic observation and map generation suffer from issues such as limited parallax tolerance, poor stitching robustness, and low mapping accuracy. In this paper, these problems are addressed by a proposed online panoramic method based on multi-perspective image projection and camera pose rectification. The proposed method incorporates a modified inverse projection module that dynamically adapts to the ship’s attitude, thereby stably restoring the sea-ice images into bird’s-eye view (BEV) in real-time. In order to resolve the challenging sea-ice feature alignment under significant parallax, a planar feature registration method is proposed which robustly aligns the features between the projected images. Moreover, a camera pose rectification module is specifically designed for planar projection tasks, which virtually adjusts the camera’s extrinsic parameters for obtaining more precise and high-quality panoramic sea-ice maps. Finally, online construction of global sea-ice field maps is achieved by fusing the local maps during navigation. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other panoramic methods in terms of map accuracy and stitching quality. Additionally, the proposed method is more suitable for downstream tasks, including polar simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and path planning.},

This study addresses a challenge within maritime transportation, specifically the continuous berth allocation and time-variant quay crane assignment problem (C/T-V BACAP). We formulate a comprehensive mathematical model of C/T-V BACAP. To solve the problem, we propose an effective memetic algorithm with a heuristic decoding method, named HMA, which comprises three essential components: a three-stage heuristic decoding method, a clustering-based evolutionary strategy, and a target-guided local search operator. The three-stage heuristic decoding method guarantees solution feasibility and high quality through the entire optimization, allowing the following strategies to fully utilize their search capabilities. The clustering-based evolutionary strategy refines the search space and diversifies the promising candidates. Meanwhile, the target-guided local search operator rapidly optimizes the allocation for the challenging vessel. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm delivers excellent performance, especially in handling large-scale instances (up to 60 vessels). Our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art BACAP algorithms by an average margin of 150% in terms of berth offset and waiting time in most problem instances.},

  abstract     = {In large-scale urban environments, precise six-degree-of-freedom (6DOF) pose estimation is essential for vehicles and robots to perform autonomous driving and exploration, as well as to achieve high intelligence and full autonomy of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). Achieving 6DOF pose estimation in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-denied environments is challenging. The performance of relative 6DOF localization systems based on Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), vision, and inertial data is easily affected by environmental conditions, leading to error accumulation and a significant decrease in estimation accuracy in complex environments. To address this issue, we propose a tightly coupled framework based on nonlinear optimization for vision, LiDAR, inertial, and GNSS raw data. In the experimental section, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization factor model for GNSS data, LiDAR data, and visual data in improving position and orientation estimation accuracy through simulations. Additionally, we use real datasets to compare the proposed algorithm with several existing open-source programs in terms of computational efficiency, pose estimation accuracy, worst-case scenarios, and reliability. The experimental results show that, although the total processing time increases, the position estimation accuracy and orientation estimation accuracy of the proposed fusion algorithm improve by at least 58.0%. Overall, the proposed tightly-coupled algorithm outperforms the existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the movement of crowds is important to the management of public places and urban safety. Existing researches mostly focused on tracking pedestrians in video clips from a single camera or across multiple cameras (Multi-Object Tracking) by identifying individuals with similar appearance or spatial-temporal movement features. However, how crowds navigate through invisible area between cameras in crowded environments have been overlooked. Moreover, identifying individuals across camera in a crowded environment could be challenging due to cluttered pedestrian appearance and highly uncertain movements. In this paper, we focus on recovering crowd trajectories in the invisible area of sparse camera networks within crowded public environments. We achieve better spatial-temporal feature matching by estimating the most likely travel time between segmented tracklet observations of individuals with elaborate consideration of pedestrian interactions, which reduces the dependence on unreliable appearance features. Subsequently, we recover trajectories for matched tracklets in the invisible area with a high fidelity crowd simulation model. Extensive experiments on two real-world trajectory datasets show that our proposed method is superior to existing spatial-temporal based MOT methods and improves the appearance-based MOT models in terms of association accuracy and trajectory fidelity.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel terrain-adaptive local trajectory planner designed for the autonomous operation of off-road vehicles on deformable terrains. State-of-the-art solutions either do not account for deformable terrains, or do not offer sufficient robustness or computational speed. To bridge this research gap, the paper introduces a novel model predictive control (MPC) formulation. In contrast to the prevailing state-of-the-art approaches that rely exclusively on hard or soft constraints for obstacle avoidance, the present formulation enhances robustness by incorporating both types of constraints. The effectiveness and robustness of the formulation are evaluated through extensive simulations, encompassing a wide range of randomized scenarios, and compared against state-of-the-art methods. Subsequently, the formulation is augmented with an optimal-control-oriented terramechanics model from the literature, explicitly addressing terrain deformation. Additionally, a terrain estimator employing the unscented Kalman filter is utilized to dynamically adjust the sinkage exponent online, resulting in a terrain-adaptive formulation. This formulation is tested on a physical vehicle in real world experiments against a rigid-terrain formulation as the benchmark. The results showcase the superior safety and performance achieved by the proposed formulation, underscoring the critical significance of integrating terramechanics knowledge into the planning process. Specifically, the proposed terrain-adaptive formulation achieves reduced mean absolute sideslip angle, decreased mean absolute yaw rate, shorter time to goal, and a higher success rate, primarily attributed to its enhanced understanding of terramechanics within the planner.},

  abstract     = {Although current Artificial Intelligence (AI) can detect maneuvering intentions, it often overlooks the underlying driving goals that reveal drivers’ genuine requirements. To detect real-time driving goals using AI for providing effective decision aids, this research introduces the Framework of Adaptive Driving (FAD), which considers cognitive activities and action strategies. We have outlined five driving goals to elucidate the connections between Situation Awareness (SA), and intentions. The study involved 31 participants and 573 driving simulation events, during which we collected both eye-tracking and kinetic data. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) identified 8 factors, categorized into SA and maneuver-related factors. Statistical and qualitative analysis follow up to specify the varying requirements among the driving foals defined. Generally, factor ‘Cognitive load’ can reflect cognitive activities, while ‘Saccade on the surroundings’ and ‘Saccade movement’ can indicate action strategies. For the goals where emerging risks are not a concern, ‘Active acceleration’ signifies drivers’ intention to enhance driving efficiency. However, the diverse features in ‘Saccade on the surroundings’ imply varying driving considerations. Goals for routine tasks focus on internal vehicle operations, while goals for driving benefits management highlight adjacent surroundings. Conversely, for goals addressing emerging risks, ‘Deceleration’ prevails. Furthermore, ‘Steering strategy’ implies a preference for steering when SA is adequate. In this context, SA-related factors like ‘Front observation,’ ‘Saccade movement,’ and ‘Cognitive load’ signify efforts to enhance SA under time constraints. However, for the driving goals under extreme urgency, the factor ‘Lateral movement’ replaces ‘Steering strategy’, implying severe steering without adequate SA.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle detection based on remote sensing images is widely used in urban traffic management and disaster rescue. RGB images, which are used more, lead to poor detection performance in low light conditions due to the imaging mechanism. At present, the main solution is to improve the detection performance in low light by fusing with infrared images. However, the current methods often overlook the impact of illumination changes on RGB images, and ignore the important role of high-frequency information for object detection, especially for low-light target detection. In this paper, we propose a Cross-modality and Cross-domain Low-light Detector (CCLDet) for low-light vehicle detection, including three improvements. First, an object illumination-aware module (OIAM) is proposed, which can adjust adaptively the weight of different modalities according to the object illumination intensity in the training phase and enables the detector to adapt to different lighting conditions. Second, we propose a visibility loss, which converts the position deviation into the illumination intensity deviation of each point in the object area. Compared with relying only on semantic information for object localization, the illumination makes the information that can be used for localization more abundant. Third, we design a cross-domain feature fusion module (CDFFM), which can enhance high-frequency features and enrich target information when low-frequency features are lost due to low light pollution. Extensive experiments on three challenging RGB-infrared objects detection datasets demonstrated the mAP and the parameter quantities of CCLDet over popular object detectors.},

By enhancing the perceptual capabilities of the model to accurately anticipate the actions of vulnerable road users, the overall driving experience can be significantly improved, ensuring higher levels of safety. Existing research efforts focusing on the prediction of pedestrians’ crossing intentions have predominantly relied on vision-based deep learning models. However, these models continue to exhibit shortcomings in terms of robustness when faced with adverse weather conditions and domain adaptation challenges. Furthermore, little attention has been given to evaluating the real-time performance of these models. To address these aforementioned limitations, this study introduces an innovative framework for pedestrian crossing intention prediction. The framework incorporates an image enhancement pipeline, which enables the detection and rectification of various defects that may arise during unfavorable weather conditions. Subsequently, a transformer-based network, featuring a self-attention mechanism, is employed to predict the crossing intentions of target pedestrians. This augmentation enhances the model’s resilience and accuracy in classification tasks. Through evaluation on the Joint Attention in Autonomous Driving (JAAD) dataset, our framework attains state-of-the-art performance while maintaining a notably low inference time. Moreover, a deployment environment is established to assess the real-time performance of the model. The results of this evaluation demonstrate that our approach exhibits the shortest model inference time and the lowest end-to-end prediction time, accounting for the processing duration of the selected inputs.},

Therefore, establishing security measures against potential threats through trust assessment and trust authentication has become a key goal. Blockchain has the characteristics of traceability, anonymity, transparency, etc., and can achieve trust authentication for trust assessment. In our work, we propose a lightweight decentralized authentication and trust management scheme for edge AI-enabled CPSs that supports access control on the basis of extended chaotic maps, which meets the privacy and security needs of data transmission in a broader sense. Moreover, we develop a trust model for checking the trustworthiness of data collected by smart devices/sensor nodes. A formal security analysis is executed by utilizing the broadly applicable real-or-random (RoR) model. Our scheme, which is different from previous methods, combines high security with relatively low communication and computational costs. Through an informal security analysis, we verify that our proposal is in compliance with the security requirements and can withstand various forms of attacks. Furthermore, the functionality and performance analysis results indicate that our method is better suited for lightweight validation in CPS networks while providing a higher level of security than other methods.},

  abstract     = {Driving trajectory data remains vulnerable to privacy breaches despite existing mitigation measures. Traditional methods for detecting driving trajectories typically rely on map-matching the path using Global Positioning System (GPS) data, which is susceptible to GPS data outage. This paper introduces CAN-Trace, a novel privacy attack mechanism that leverages Controller Area Network (CAN) messages to uncover driving trajectories, posing a significant risk to drivers’ long-term privacy. A new trajectory reconstruction algorithm is proposed to transform the CAN messages, specifically vehicle speed and accelerator pedal position, into weighted graphs accommodating various driving statuses. CAN-Trace identifies driving trajectories using graph-matching algorithms applied to the created graphs in comparison to road networks. We also design a new metric to evaluate matched candidates, which allows for potential data gaps and matching inaccuracies. Empirical validation under various real-world conditions, encompassing different vehicles and driving regions, demonstrates the efficacy of CAN-Trace: it achieves an attack success rate of up to 90.59% in the urban region, and 99.41% in the suburban region.},

  abstract     = {Deep graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have shown promising performance in traffic prediction tasks, but their practical deployment on resource-constrained devices faces challenges. First, few models consider the potential influence of historical and future auxiliary information, such as weather and holidays, on complex traffic patterns. Second, the computational complexity of dynamic graph convolution operations grows quadratically with the number of traffic nodes, limiting model scalability. To address these challenges, this study proposes a deep encoder-decoder model named AIMSAN, which comprises an auxiliary information-aware module (AIM) and a sparse cross-attention-based graph convolutional network (SAN). From historical or future perspectives, AIM prunes multi-attribute auxiliary data into diverse time frames, and embeds them into one tensor. SAN employs a cross-attention mechanism to merge traffic data with historical embedded data in each encoder layer, forming dynamic adjacency matrices. Subsequently, it applies diffusion GCN to capture rich spatial-temporal dynamics from the traffic data. Additionally, AIMSAN utilizes the spatial sparsity of traffic nodes as a mask to mitigate the quadratic computational complexity of SAN, thereby improving overall computational efficiency. In the decoder layer, future embedded data are fused with feed-forward traffic data to generate prediction results. Experimental evaluations on three public traffic datasets demonstrate that AIMSAN achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, while reducing GPU memory consumption by 41.24%, training time by 62.09%, and validation time by 65.17% on average.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicles (AVs) still pose challenges in improving intelligence, safety, and reliability in complex motorway scenarios. Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated superior decision-making capabilities in dynamic environments compared to rule-based methods. However, it requires considerable training resources due to a lack of innovative DRL component design (e.g., state space and reward) to link observation and action accurately. Its opaque nature may also result in hazardous driving conditions. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid autopilot framework that amalgamates three modules: (i) DRL is employed to build a smart, learnable, and scalable driving policy across various motorway scenarios; (ii) a kinematic-based co-pilot strategy is devised to bolster training efficiency and provide flexible decision-making guidance; and (iii) a rule-based system assesses and determines the final action outputs in real-time between itself and the DRL policy to further enhance safety. Extensive simulations are conducted under different complex motorway scenarios. The results indicate that the proposed framework surpasses the baseline DRL policy in terms of training efficiency, intelligence, safety, and reliability.},

To this end, a time-homogeneous preset-time algorithm is presented to coordinate multiple vehicles within an identical time window, where arrival time delays are used to characterize the arrival time of the vehicles. Consequently, the considered package delivery problem is formulated by two phases: “Active phase” and “Sleeping phase”, over which vehicles use the neighboring information to achieve coordination. For the proposed algorithm, we use Lyapunov based method to derive condition guaranteeing the coordination of vehicles, under a very mild communication topology condition. As an extension, a time-heterogeneous preset-time algorithm is designed. We demonstrate that coordination among vehicles is determined by the maximal preset-time. Built upon this observation, we further show that there is an equivalence between the proposed formulation and the dynamical equation of the interacting vehicles. Finally, a numerical example for a package delivery problem, comprised of two coordination phases, is carried out to illustrate the proposed preset-time coordination formulation, and the time-heterogeneous case is further discussed as well.},

  abstract     = {In urban areas, roads with dedicated cycle lanes play a vital role in cyclist safety. However, accidents can still occur when vehicles cross the cycle lane at intersections. Accidents mostly occur due to failure of the driver to see a cyclist on the cycle lane, particularly when the cyclist is going straight through the intersection, and the vehicle is turning. For safe driving, it is critical that the drivers visually scan the area in the vicinity of the junction and the car, particularly using the wing-mirror, prior to making turns. This paper describes results from a set of test drives using in-vehicle non-invasive eye-tracking and in-vehicle CAN bus sensors to determine driver behaviour. In total, 20 drivers were monitored through 5 different intersections with cycle lanes. The study found that approximately 83% of drivers did not check their wing mirror prior to, or during their turning manoeuvre, potentially putting pedestrian, cyclists, scooter and hoverboard users in danger. An algorithm was developed to analyse driver gaze during the turning manoeuvre to identify cases where they failed to look at the wing mirror. The gaze pattern and gaze concentration on the mirror helps to identify safe and unsafe driving behaviour. This information can then be used to improve Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) to create a safer environment for all road users.},

Currently, the optimization of multimodal transport solutions and the allocation of capacity are planned as two separate parts, and the research on customer classification of multimodal transport is insufficient. The current bottleneck in multimodal transportation systems is optimizing multimodal customer classification and transportation solutions. Additionally, such an optimization can significantly improve the system’s overall revenue. Based on the customer classification theory of revenue management, we classified and managed multimodal transport customers and allocated and priced the transportation capacity according to the demand characteristics and price sensitivities of different customers. Furthermore, we considered the impact of transportation scheme planning on the profit of multimodal transport. Accordingly, we developed a joint optimization model for multimodal transport schemes, capacity allocation, and pricing by considering the customer classification. We solved the model using a hybrid particle swarm algorithm and validated it using arithmetic examples. The results indicate that a customer classification strategy can significantly improve the profit of multimodal transport operators when customer demand is unstable, and the total profit of the transportation system is increased by 7%. Moreover, these results suggest combining transportation solution optimization with customer classification can lead to more profitable multimodal revenue management solutions. Thus, our results can guide multimodal operators for systematically dealing with the customer classification problem and optimizing transportation schemes while improving their profits. Moreover, this study offers a reference for decision-making in multimodal operation management.},

  abstract     = {Edge collaboration is expected to effectively relieve the load of base stations and enhance the driving experience of autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, in existing edge collaboration schemes, the frequent information exchange between AVs will consume a significant amount of resources. In addition, the existing schemes ignore the types of services, where services with different types may be combined into a composite service which affects the utility of AVs. To this end, we consider various types of services in autonomous vehicular networks (AVNs) and propose a digital twin (DT)-enabled edge collaboration scheme for composite services. Specifically, we first divide the DTs of service requesters (DT-SRs) into service request groups (SRGs) based on the same basic service requests and propose an architecture to facilitate the edge collaboration between the DTs of the leaders of SRGs (DT-L-SRGs) and the DTs of the service providers (DT-SPs). In this architecture, different service composition forms will result in different resource purchase strategies for DT-L-SRGs and different resource pricing strategies for DT-SPs. Therefore, we model the process of service composition as a coalition game to determine the optimal service composition form for each basic service. In the process of the coalition game, in order to obtain the optimal resource purchase strategy for each DT-L-SRG and the optimal resource pricing strategy for each DT-SP under different coalition structures, the interaction between the DT-L-SRGs and the DT-SPs is formulated as a Stackelberg game. By obtaining the game equilibrium, the optimal strategies of each DT-L-SRG and each DT-SP can be determined to measure the performance of the given coalition structure until a stable and optimal composite service structure is finally formed through multiple rounds of iterations. Compared with traditional schemes, the simulation results demonstrate that our scheme can bring the highest utilities to both the SRs and the SPs.},

  abstract     = {Automated Vehicle (AV) safety is a critical issue and appeals to worldwide focus. To ensure AV safety, AV functions should be tested and evaluated in an enormous number of scenarios. Since such AV testing is time-consuming, scenario filters have been developed to identify safety-critical scenarios and omit ordinary ones. However, the scenarios identified by these filters do not uniquely match the AV function to be tested and are most likely not critical for the AV function. Therefore, an enhanced scenario filter is proposed in this paper. It bears the following features: 1) Automated-driving-function-specific scenario identification; 2) High coverage of critical scenarios; 3) Enhanced identification efficiency by avoiding adopting a surrogate model; 4) High reliability of critical scenario identification. To enable the above features, the proposed filter formulates the identification problem into an optimization problem and solves it with a model-free approach. Experiments have been conducted to evaluate and validate the proposed filter. The results confirm that the proposed filter is able to improve coverage of critical scenarios, efficiency of identification, and reliability of identification compared to the state-of-the-art filter. Specifically, the proposed filter improves coverage by up to 70 percent, efficiency by up to 97 percent, and reliability by up to 22 percent. The results also reveal that the proposed filter shows an increasing advantage for testing AV functions with higher complexity.},

This method is applied to calibrate two car-following control models: linear control and model predictive control (MPC). The method is likelihood-function-free, where the likelihood function is replaced by simulation to approximate the posterior distribution of model parameters. This structure affords flexibility to calibrate posterior joint distributions of complex models, even those without analytical closed forms such as MPC. Two experiments were conducted to evaluate how well the proposed method reproduces: (i) marginal and joint distributions of model parameters, using synthetic data and (ii) vehicle trajectories (acceleration, speed, and position), using field data involving two commercial adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems. The results showed that the ABC method can reproduce marginal and joint distributions reasonably well for the linear controller as well as the non-analytical MPC-based controller, which was previously infeasible. The method can also robustly characterize the commercial ACC behavior at the trajectory level, which suggests that the simple linear controller better describes their behavior.},

  abstract     = {VSLAM is one of the key technologies for indoor mobile robots, used to perceive the surrounding environment, achieve accurate positioning and mapping. However, traditional VSLAM algorithms based on the assumption of a static environment still face certain challenges. The movement, occlusion, and appearance changes of dynamic objects can lead to feature point-matching errors, making data association difficult and causing biases in motion estimation. In order to address this challenge, this paper proposes a dynamic feature point removal method and a closed-loop detection method for high dynamic scenes, aiming to effectively improve the robustness and positioning accuracy in dynamic environments. First, the YOLOv7-tiny object detection network and LK optical flow algorithm are combined to detect the dynamic area, and the adaptive threshold keyframe selection method is adopted to solve the problem of poor quality of keyframe caused by the existing heuristic threshold selection method. Then, this paper proposes a dynamic keyframe sequence creation method based on the angle difference between keyframes, which reduces the workload of loop back detection and accelerates the efficiency of loop back detection in the system. Next, the ParC_NetVLAD image matching algorithm is proposed. In this paper, ConvNeXt-Tiny network is used for feature extraction of images, and ParC-Net network and CBAM attention mechanism are added to the feature extraction network. Finally, NetVLAD is used to cluster the extracted local features to obtain global features that can represent images. Experiments are conducted on public TUM RGB-D datasets and in real-world situations. The proposed algorithm reduces the ATE (Absolute Trajectory Error) by 96.4% and the RPE (Relative Trajectory Error) by 82.8% on average in highly dynamic scenarios. In the Pittsburgh30k dataset, the average accuracy of loop closure detection has been improved by 2.6%.},

  abstract     = {Traffic state prediction, a classical task for traffic management, is a central component of intelligent transport systems to maintain safe and efficient operation. While extensive and intensive research has been conducted on traffic state prediction, most studies have concentrated on enhancing the accuracy of specific traffic state parameters. However, traffic state is a co-evolutionary multivariate time series with various parameters such as flow, velocity, occupancy, etc. At the same time, traffic state data will inevitably be lost during collection. So accurate traffic prediction still faces the following challenges: First, how to deal with the complex missing situations in observational data? Second, how to learn the co-evolutionary relationships between different traffic state parameters while mining the high-dimensional spatio-temporal traffic state patterns? In this paper, we propose a mechanism-data blending-driven co-evolving traffic state parameter prediction method: multi-parameter hybrid tensor deep learning networks (MHT-Net), which consists of a multi-parameter tensor graph convolutional network (MTGCN) and a tensor recurrent neural network (T-RNN). MTGCN implements knowledge embedding of synergistic mechanisms between traffic parameters, ensuring that the road network spatial dependency and the synergistic influence relationship of the parameters can be obtained simultaneously; T-RNN is used to learn high-dimensional temporal features of traffic states. Experiment results on a real-world dataset from Jiangsu province outperform the state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed method and providing an effective tool for traffic state prediction with missing values. A mechanism-data blending driven co-evolving traffic state parameter prediction method, multi-parameters hybrid tensor deep learning networks (MHT-Net) is proposed, which implements knowledge embedding of synergistic mechanisms between traffic parameters and learn the road network spatial dependency and the synergistic influence relationship of the parameters simultaneously.

However, existing methods generally ignore the impact of ground points. Although some traditional ground segmentation algorithms are available to remove ground point clouds, they usually suffer from over-segmentation, which leads to a sub-optimal and even worse performance for the downstream 3D detection task. We conduct an in-depth analysis and attribute this phenomenon to the reason that some crucial foreground points attached to the ground (e.g., the wheels of Cars, or the feet of Pedestrians) are directly removed due to over-segmentation. To this end, we propose a new Attached Point Restoring (APR) module to recover these discarded foreground points. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of APR by integrating it into various ground segmentation algorithms to boost the performance or the running time of 3D detection on KITTI and Waymo datasets. Finally, we hope this paper can serve as a new guide to inspire future research in this field. Code is available at https://github.com/yhc2021/GPR.},

  abstract     = {Pedestrian trajectory prediction is a key component for various applications that involve human and vehicle interactions, such as autonomous driving, traffic management and smart city planning. Existing methods based on graph neural networks have limited ability to capture group interactions and precisely model complex associations among multi-agents. To solve these problems, we propose OST-HGCN, an optimized hypergraph convolutional network. It models multi-agent trajectory interactions from both temporal and spatial perspectives using hypergraph structures, and optimizes the spatio-temporal hypergraph structure to enable fine-grained analysis of multi-agent trajectory motion intentions and high-order interactions. We employ OST-HGCN to a CVAE-based prediction framework, and use the optimized hypergraph structure to predict multi-agent plausible trajectories. We conduct extensive experiments on four real trajectory prediction datasets of NBA, NFL, SDD and ETH-UCY, and verify the effectiveness of the proposed OST-HGCN.},

  abstract     = {Collective spatial keyword query (CoSKQ) is an important variant of spatial keyword queries and has become a research hotspot. In real life, user behavior usually has a certain directionality, so they may want to obtain the result object that conforms to a specific direction, which is what the direction-constrained query studies. In addition, query time information also plays an important role in location-based query processing. To this end, this paper takes the lead in studying the Time-aware and Direction-constrained Collective Spatial Keyword Query (TDCoSKQ). To facilitate direction-related operations, space objects are organized using the polar coordinate system. Firstly, an efficient space partition method is designed, and on this basis, a new hybrid index structure KRPQT is designed. Based on KRPQT, several pruning strategies are proposed to prune irrelevant regions and objects from the perspective of keyword, time, and direction, and the basic algorithm KRPQB is proposed. To further improve the efficiency of query processing, the possible areas of the result objects are analyzed and shrunk to greatly reduce the number of candidate objects, and three optimization algorithms KRPSW, KRPSW+LFO, and KRPSW+KRPQB are proposed. Then, we discuss how to extend the proposed methods to deal with TDCoSKQ queries with other distance functions and TDCoSKQ queries with weight objects. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed algorithm is verified by simulation experiments.},

  abstract     = {Binocular stereo matching is a crucial task in autonomous driving for accurately estimating the depth information of objects and scenes. This task, however, is challenging due to various ill-posed regions within binocular image pairs, such as repeated textures and weak textures which present complex correspondences between the points. Existing methods extract features from binocular input images mainly by relying on deep convolutional neural networks with a substantial number of convolutional layers, which may incur high memory and computation costs, thus making it hard to deploy in real-world applications. Additionally, previous methods do not consider the correlation between view unary features during the construction of the cost volume, thus leading to inferior results. To address these issues, a novel lightweight binocular-separated feature extraction module is proposed that includes a view-shared multi-dilation fusion module and a view-specific feature extractor. Our method leverages a shallow neural network with a multi-dilation modeling module to provide similar receptive fields as deep neural networks but with fewer parameters and better computational efficiency. Furthermore, we propose incorporating the correlations of view-shared features to dynamically select view-specific features during the construction of the cost volume. Extensive experiments conducted on two public benchmark datasets show that our proposed method outperforms the deep model-based baseline method (i.e., 13.6% improvement on Scene Flow and 2.0% on KITTI 2015) while using 29.7% fewer parameters. Ablation experiments show that our method achieves superior matching performance in weak texture and edge regions. The source code will be made publicly available.},

  abstract     = {Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) aims to reconstruct the reward function from expert demonstrations to facilitate policy learning, and has demonstrated its remarkable success in imitation learning. To promote expert-like behavior, existing IRL methods mainly focus on learning global reward functions to minimize the trajectory difference between the imitator and the expert. However, these global designs are still limited by the redundant noise and error propagation problems, leading to the unsuitable reward assignment and thus downgrading the agent capability in complex multi-stage tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel Curricular Subgoal-based Inverse Reinforcement Learning (CSIRL) framework, that explicitly disentangles one task with several local subgoals to guide agent imitation. Specifically, CSIRL firstly introduces decision uncertainty of the trained agent over expert trajectories to dynamically select specific states as subgoals, which directly determines the exploration boundary of different task stages. To further acquire local reward functions for each stage, we customize a meta-imitation objective based on these curricular subgoals to train an intrinsic reward generator. Experiments on the D4RL and autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed methods yields results superior to the state-of-the-art counterparts, as well as better interpretability.

Firstly, the construction of the physical model of the vehicle system is carried out to obtain the coupling relationship between the components. Secondly, the coupling relationship between the components is embedded into the loss function of the deep neural network as physics-informed constraints. Further, the network parameters satisfying certain physical laws are obtained by minimizing the loss function. Finally, the proposed lightweight 3D convolutional neural network is used to predict the vibration state of the vehicle system. The dynamic response resulting from both the data-driven simulation model and the multi-body simulation model are investigated and compared. The simulation results show that the data-driven dynamics simulation model can accurately predict the vibration state of the vehicle system.

In the experimental study, a custom vehicle trajectory dataset extracted from roadside LiDAR data, along with the V2X-Seq-TFD dataset, was utilized for network training and testing. The optimal LSTM network obtained through Bayesian optimization was compared against two benchmark models: a handcrafted LSTM network and a Kalman filter with a 2D constant velocity motion model. The results demonstrate that the proposed deep learning-based framework, with robust hyperparameter selection through Bayesian optimization, yields more accurate and consistent prediction performance than the benchmark models.},

An expert driver model based on a multi-layer feed-forward neural network (MLFN) is developed to generate the reference steering angle for haptic assistance design. The individual driver’s arm characteristics are identified and incorporated into the adaptive haptic assistance controller design to generate personalized torque assistance, facilitating a typical driver to achieve the same trajectory-tracking performance as experts. The nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode (NFTSM) is applied to calculate the assistance torque to ensure the fast finite-time convergence and robustness of the system.

The process of generating the holograms so that they appear in a specific position in the world is also known as image registration. Since AR devices employ see-through Head-Mounted Displays, realistic image registration requires high-accuracy head tracking. Solutions exist in static environments where state-of-the-art simultaneous localization and mapping algorithms suffice. Vehicles are more challenging. In aerospace, costly optical-inertial tracking systems are regularly employed. This paper focuses instead on low-cost ground vehicles and proposes a solution that does not require aerospace-grade Inertial Measurement Units and is easily integrable on cars. The proposed solution, tested on a racing circuit, is based on passive markers and on the stereoscopic detection of the road plane on which the AR features are anchored.},

  abstract     = {Drowsy driving is one of the greatest threats to road safety, which increases the importance of intelligent systems that can monitor driver drowsiness. Electroencephalogram (EEG)–based monitoring systems have gained attention because EEG is known to directly measure brain activities that reflect the mental state of the driver. However, calibration is necessary before using the system because EEG signals vary between and within subjects. Therefore, generalized EEG-based drowsiness estimation has become challenging. In this paper, we propose an EEG-based driver drowsiness classification framework without the need for calibration, which can be generalized to unseen subjects. We augment the features of unseen domains (i.e., subjects) with a Dirichlet mixup between prototypes of source domains to complement other domain knowledge. The parameter $\boldsymbol {\alpha }$ vector of the Dirichlet distribution adjusts the intensity of the mixup, allowing for diverse enhancement. Furthermore, we utilize an auxiliary batch normalization module for augmented samples to avoid inaccurate estimation by the difference in distribution. The experiments were carried out using two EEG datasets, each measured using different drowsiness indicators, the Karolinska sleepiness scale, and reaction time. In leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, the proposed framework achieved outstanding performance in both datasets, an ${F}1$ -score of 62.69% and 70.33% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 71.73% and 73.80%, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate the potential for practical applications of brain-computer interfaces without calibration.},

  abstract     = {The safety and efficiency of an Autonomous Vehicle (AV) manoeuvre planning heavily depend on the future trajectories of surrounding vehicles. If an AV can predict its surrounding vehicles’ future trajectories, it can make safe and efficient manoeuvre decisions. In this paper, we present a Deep Spatio-Temporal Context-Aware decision Network (DST-CAN) for predictive manoeuvre decisions for AVs on highways. DST-CAN has two main components, namely spatio-temporal context-aware map generator and predictive manoeuvre decisions engine. DST-CAN employ a memory neuron network to predict the future trajectories of its surrounding vehicles. Using look-ahead prediction and past actual trajectories, a spatio-temporal context-aware probability occupancy map is generated. These context-aware maps as input to a decision engine generate a safe and efficient manoeuvre decision. Here, CNN helps extract feature space, and two fully connected network generates longitudinal and lateral manoeuvre decisions. Performance evaluation of DST-CAN has been carried out using two publicly available NGSIM US-101 and I-80 highway datasets. A traffic rule is defined to generate ground truths for these datasets in addition to human decisions. Two DST-CAN models are trained using imitation learning with human driving decisions from actual traffic data and rule-based ground truth decisions. The performances of the DST-CAN models are compared with the state-of-the-art Convolutional Social-LSTM (CS-LSTM) models for manoeuvre prediction. The results clearly indicate that the context-aware maps help DST-CAN to predict the decision accurately over CS-LSTM. Further, an ablation study has been carried out to understand the effect of prediction horizons of performance and a robustness study to understand the near collision scenarios over actual traffic observations. The context-aware map with a 3 second prediction horizon is robust against near collision.},

  abstract     = {In the past decade, deep learning has been widely applied across various fields. However, its applicability in open-world scenarios is often limited due to the lack of quantifying uncertainty in both data and models. In recent years, a multitude of uncertainty quantification (UQ) approaches for neural networks have emerged and found applications in safety-critical domains such as autonomous vehicles and medical analysis. This paper aims to review the latest advancements in UQ methods and investigate their application specifically in the field of computer vision and autonomous vehicles. Initially, we identify several key qualifications, namely practicability, robustness, accuracy, scalability, and efficiency (referred to as PRASE), and employ them as evaluation criteria throughout this study. By considering these criteria as uniform measurements, we meticulously evaluate and compare the performance of different types of UQ methods, including Bayesian methods, ensemble methods, and single deterministic methods. Furthermore, we delve into the discussion of their application in diverse tasks within the autonomous vehicle domain, such as semantic segmentation, object detection, depth estimation, and end-to-end control. Through comprehensive analysis and comparison, we identify a range of challenges and propose future research directions in this field. Our findings shed light on the importance of addressing uncertainty quantification in deep learning models and provide insights into enhancing the reliability and performance of autonomous vehicles in real-world scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Detecting small objects in optical images and videos is a significant challenge in numerous intelligent transportation and autonomous systems. State-of-the-art generic object detection methods fail to accurately localize and identify such small objects (e.g., pedestrians, small vehicles, obstacles). Because small objects occupy only a small area in the input image (e.g., $32 \times 32$ pixels or less), the information extracted from such a small area is not always rich enough to support decision-making. Multidisciplinary strategies are being developed by researchers working at the interface of deep learning and computer vision to enhance the performance of Small Object Detection (SOD). In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of over 160 research papers published between 2017 and 2022 in order to survey this growing subject. This paper summarizes the existing literature and provides a taxonomy that illustrates the broad picture of current research. We further explore methods to boost the performance of small object detection in maritime settings, where enhanced performance is crucial for ensuring safety and managing traffic. Detecting small objects in the maritime environment requires additional considerations and the current survey aims to review the advanced techniques addressing those aspects. In addition, the popular SOD datasets for generic and maritime applications are discussed, and also well-known evaluation metrics for the state-of-the-art methods on some of the datasets are provided. The link to these datasets appears in https://github.com/arekavandi/Datasets_SOD.},
