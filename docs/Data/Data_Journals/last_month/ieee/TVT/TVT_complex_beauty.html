However, with the continually increasing popularity of IoT devices, resource-constrained ENs cannot ensure low-latency services for tasks generated by these devices. To address this issue, in this study, we propose a cooperative service caching mechanism that caches highly demanded services and processes tasks requiring those services across multiple ENs. Considering the waiting time for tasks to be processed at the EN, we formulate a delay minimization problem in cooperative service caching. To solve this problem, we devise an ant colony optimization-based algorithm. The simulation results show that the proposed method can achieve a lower total delay than existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Integrated satellite-terrestrial networks (ISTN) are regarded as a critical 6G technology capable of providing seamless global communication coverage. However, to provide more real-time and efficient communication services, information freshness is becoming increasingly important in the ISTN. In this paper, we investigate a multi-agent DRL-based power control algorithm for minimizing the average age of information (AoI) in the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) enabled ISTN. Specifically, a multi-agent proximal policy optimization (PPO) is employed to jointly allocate the power and reduce inter-beam interference. Due to the imperfect serial interference cancellation (SIC), the average AoI minimization is formulated as a non-convex problem that satisfies both quality of service constraints and total power limitations. Therefore, a generalized advantage estimation PPO-based power allocation (GAP3A) algorithm is proposed, which operates by centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) to enhance the training stability. Especially, an ingenious, global reward function is designed to guide the DRL training towards minimizing the average AoI of the ISTN. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CTDE-based GAP3A algorithm can effectively lower the average AoI to an optimal level and significantly outperforms the other three benchmarks.},

However, providing high-performance broadcasting service remains a crucial challenge when users are located in areas with poor channel quality and the transmit power budget is insufficient. To address such difficulty, intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) can be employed to construct reconfigurable BS-IRS-user links, thereby enhancing spectral and power efficiency. In this paper, we design a quality-driven video broadcasting framework assisted by the IRS. The problem is formulated as the maximization of the minimum peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) for all users via a joint optimization of active and passive beamforming. To address the formulated non-convex problem, we introduce an effective algorithm that leverages penalty-based successive convex approximation (P-SCA) to achieve a suboptimal solution. Simulation results validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm and unveil the impact of video spatial-temporal content complexity on PSNR.},

Specifically, supervised contrastive learning is utilized to enhance the feature representation of the signal, and a joint loss with dynamic weights is constructed to balance the representation and classification tasks. In addition, a lightweight MSSAN encoder is proposed to enhance the recognition performance with lower computations and parameters.

  abstract     = {In this work, we develop a power allocation policy for low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite communications with uneven traffic distribution. The inter-beam interference is one of the bottlenecks for achieving high data rates. To manage interference, we represent the power allocation policy by a graph neural network (GNN) that is scalable to the number of beams of the satellite. The domain knowledge in satellite communications is exploited to design the structure and hyper-parameters of the GNN. To improve the generalization ability of the GNN in scenarios with different traffic distributions, we train the GNN in an unsupervised manner by using meta-learning. The idea is to train the GNN with different traffic distributions and then test it in unseen scenarios. Our simulation results show that the data rate achieved by the GNN-based power allocation policy is 30% higher than existing power allocation policies and is close to the upper bound. The GNN outperforms the fully-connected neural network in terms of scalability. Finally, we demonstrate that with meta-learning, the GNN does not need samples in unseen scenarios to achieve high data rates.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has been deemed as a promising technology to reconfigure the signal propagation environments cost-effectively. However, due to the lack of radio-frequency (RF) chains at the IRSs, their channel estimation becomes a significant challenge. In this correspondence, we propose a novel phase hopping scheme for IRS-aided multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems, which dispenses with the channel state information (CSI) by randomly changing the IRS&#39;s reflections over different time slots within the channel coherence time, thereby creating artificial time diversity to enhance the communication performance. Based on a minor modification on the current cellular protocol, we first design a new and compatible frame structure for the proposed phase hopping scheme. Then, we derive its ergodic capacity and outage probability in closed-form using random matrix theory and gain essential insights into its asymptotic behaviors. Numerical results validate our theoretical analysis and show the superiority of our proposed phase hopping scheme to the benchmark scheme without phase hopping.},

  abstract     = {In orthogonal time-frequency space communications, the performances of existing on-grid and off-grid channel estimation (CE) schemes are determined by the delay-Doppler (DD) grid density. In practice, multiple real-life DD channel responses might be co-located within a same DD grid interval, leading to performance degradation. A finer grid interval is needed to distinguish these responses, but this could result in a significantly higher CE complexity when traditional methods are used. To address this issue, a grid evolution method for doubly fractional CE is proposed by evolving the initially uniform coarse DD grid into a non-uniform dense grid. Simulation results show that our proposed method leads to improved computational efficiency, and achieves a good trade-off between CE performance and complexity.},

Exact expressions of the probability density function (PDF) and the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) for each user are derived. Using these statistical expressions, precise analytical expressions for average rate (AR), outage probability (OP), and average bit error rate (BER) can be obtained. By comparing the simulation results with the numerical calculations, the precision of the theoretical framework is verified. Additionally, asymptotic analysis is performed and diversity gains are obtained for further insights. According to these performance indicators, the communication system&#39;s performance is evaluated and finally the validation results are plotted. The results show that pointing errors and ATHD have a great impact on system performance, and the RS scheme can improve the performance of THz wireless transmission systems.},

To achieve covert transmission in the NOMA network, in the proposed scheme, the IRS switches between the IRS and IOS mechanisms to create uncertainty. To analyze the performance of this scheme, we first characterize the statistical properties of the users&#39; cascaded channels. Then, we derive the closed-form expressions of the expectation of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and the average block error rates (BLERs) of NOMA users. To balance covertness and reliability, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the effective covert throughput (ECT) subject to the reliability and delay constraints and the level of covertness. Via this optimization, we then obtain closed-form expressions for optimal power and blocklength.

The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer non-linear programming problem. To tackle it, we first derive the close-form expressions for both the optimal TP at the ES and the optimal PRC at each IN, resulting in two subproblems where the optimal TP and PRC are utilized. Then the optimal solution to the original problem (OP) corresponds to that of the subproblem with the lower EP at the worst IN. After replacing integer variables with continuous ones, the convexities of the two subproblems are demonstrated. Consequently, the solution to the OP can be achieved by addressing the two subproblems via convex tools and utilizing an integer conversion method.

Unlike the amplitude ratio controlled RHS, the amplitude-controlled RHS is firstly modelled in the satellite broadcasting system. To reduce the computational complexity of the RHS sum rate maximization problem, the unrolled gradient projection (GP) method is proposed.

In each transmission, BS transmits the information to R, while one selected tag also conveys its own information to R by modulating and backscattering the BS&#39;s signals simultaneously. The communications from BS to R and tags to R are called as the cellular and backscatter communication (BackCom) transmissions, respectively. To describe the randomness of the position and number of the tags, the homogeneous Poisson point process is used. Besides, the consumed power by tags is considered and the optimal dynamic reflection coefficient is adopted. To achieve the tag access, the random selection access (RSA) scheme and selection diversity access (SDA) scheme are proposed and the corresponding outage performances are analyzed for both the cellular and BackCom transmissions. Numerical results show that the SDA scheme has a significantly superior outage performance compared to the RSA one at the cost of a higher system overhead. If neglecting the randomness of the number and position of tags, the obtained results will obviously deviate the practical performance. Moreover, the performance of the fixed RC scheme is much lower than that of the optimal dynamic RC.},

This may cause severe undesired performance degradation for the other cells unless the reflection coefficients are properly designed. To tackle this issue, by utilizing the Riemannian manifold optimization method, an RIS reflection coefficients design is proposed in this paper to maximize the performance improvements of the cell that deploys the RIS while minimizing the undesired performance degradation for the other cells simultaneously.

Except for the large-scale fading, the small-scale fading, allocated power from APs and inter-user interference are considered as important criteria for AP selection in this paper. Rather than the conventional FL method with predetermined fuzzy membership function, in the proposed adaptive FL scheme, the thresholds are adjusted adaptively according to the change of criteria&#39;s numerical ranges, which is more robust to the changing network environment. The proposed method considers the time-variation of the channel in each coherence block and remains system scalability in signal processing for data transmission and power control. This method also focuses on the AP clusters association by choosing the power and inter-user interference as criteria in FL, to avoid redundant connection and reduce interference between UEs. To achieve scalability in channel estimation, an initial association algorithm with switching scheme is proposed, making an attractive balance between UE fairness and limited AP processing capabilities. Simulation verifies that the adaptive FL based AP selection scheme outperforms other existing algorithms in terms of UE fairness, spectral efficiency and energy efficiency.},

The surge in the number of base station (BS) antennas has introduced new characteristics such as spatial non-stationarity in the wireless channel, which means users at different locations probably ‘see’ different parts of the BS antenna array, namely their visible regions (VRs). The concept of VR has been widely employed to simplify the design of XL-MIMO transmission. However, the VR information has yet to be utilized in the design of non-orthogonal pilots. Therefore, we aim to leverage the VR information to reduce the pilot overhead. To this end, we first establish the relationship between the VRs of users and the spatial correlation of the corresponding channel. Subsequently, we formulate the non-orthogonal pilot scheduling problem for XL-MIMO systems with spatial non-stationarity. Assuming knowledge of all users&#39; VRs, we propose a graph-based non-orthogonal pilot design approach called the two-stage graph partitioning (TSGP), which jointly exploits the VR and angle domain information. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed TSGP algorithm can effectively reduce the pilot overhead without compromising sum rate performance compared to the conventional orthogonal training approach.},

  abstract     = {A new design called spatial media-based modulation with multi-dimensional spatial constellation (SMBM-SC), which develops multiple index domains such as the channel index (CI), antenna index (AI) and key index for improving the spectral efficiency (SE), is proposed to construct the $\alpha$-dimensional ($\alpha$-D) complex spatial symbols to be transmitted over the specified channel states on the active antennas whose each with $n_\mathrm{rf}$ mirrors. Specifically, with the control of $\alpha$ Switches, the $\alpha$-D complex spatial symbol is generated by the $\alpha$-D signal symbol. Then, with the aid of the specified AI vector with the AI bits, one Switch Controller feeds $\alpha$ components of the generated spatial symbol into $\alpha$ active antennas. Another Switch Controller feeds the CI information into $\alpha$ CI Vector Selectors and then modulate $\alpha$ components on the specified channel states with the CI bits to be transmitted, respectively. In addition, in order to further improve the SE, ($\alpha +1$)-D spatial symbol is designed for exploiting the component permutation index by combining two types of signal symbols. The SE, the detection complexity and the average bit error probability (BEP) are analyzed. Simulation results demonstrate that the SMBM-SC enhance the reliability of communications as compared with the existing MBM schemes.},

To regress the model, those PLEs are extracted via measurement and the region map. We also verify the model in two suburban areas and compare with the 3GPP path loss model and the Alpha-Beta-Gamma (ABG) model.

In this work, integrating the concept of spatial crowdsourcing (SC), we develop an SC-based MDC network model and investigate the task allocation problem for UAV-assisted MDC. In variable maritime service scenarios, tasks are allocated to UAVs based on the spatial and temporal requirements of the tasks, as well as the mobility of the UAVs. To address this problem, we design an SC-based task allocation algorithm for the MDC (SC-MDC-TA). The quality estimation is utilized to assess and regulate task execution quality by evaluating signal to interference plus noise ratio and the UAV energy consumption. The reverse auction is employed to potentially reduce the task waiting time as much as possible while ensuring timely completion. Additionally, we establish typical task allocation scenarios based on maritime service requirements indicated by electronic navigational charts. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SC-MDC-TA algorithm effectively allocates tasks for various MDC scenarios.

  abstract     = {Satellite edge computing (SEC) has emerged as an innovative paradigm for future satellite-terrestrial integrated networks (STINs), expanding computation services by sinking computing capabilities into Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) satellites. However, the mobility of LEO satellites poses two key challenges to SEC: 1) constrained onboard computing and transmission capabilities caused by limited and dynamic energy supply, and 2) stochastic task arrivals within the satellites&#39; coverage and time-varying channel conditions. To tackle these issues, it is imperative to design an optimal SEC offloading strategy that effectively exploits the available energy of LEO satellites to fulfill competing task demands for SEC. In this paper, we propose a dynamic offloading strategy (DOS) with the aim to minimize the overall completion time of arriving tasks in an SEC-assisted STIN, subject to the long-term energy constraints of the LEO satellite. Leveraging Lyapunov optimization theory, we first convert the original long-term stochastic problem into multiple deterministic one-slot problems parameterized by current system states. Then we use sub-problem decomposition to jointly optimize the task offloading, computing, and communication resource allocation strategies. We theoretically prove that DOS achieves near-optimal performance. Numerical results demonstrate that DOS significantly outperforms the other four baseline approaches in terms of task completion time and dropping rate.},

  abstract     = {Due to the limited battery capacity and computational power of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, emerging IoT applications depend on mobile edge computing (MEC) networks for computational offloading and wireless power transfer (WPT) to sustain energy levels, with transfer performance influenced by the propagation environment and transmission strategies. Compared to the traditional reflecting-only reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), simultaneously transmitting and reflecting (STAR)-RIS extends coverage from half-space to full-space, significantly enhancing transferring efficiency. This paper compares the performance of three different uplink transmission schemes on a STAR-RIS WPT MEC network. On this basis, for each scenario, a non-convex optimization problem is formulated to maximize the total computational bits for the system, where energy transfer, local processing, uplink transmission allocated resources, and phase shift vectors of STAR-RIS are jointly optimized. To address the non-convexity, each scenario is decoupled into two main subproblems: phase shift vectors of STAR-RIS optimization and joint power, time, and computing frequency optimization. While a closed-form expression is derived to optimize the phase shift vector of STAR-RIS in time division multiple access (TDMA), semi-definite relaxation is employed to optimize the phase shift vectors under Hybrid TDMA-non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and NOMA. Furthermore, block coordinate descent is employed to address the remaining resources. Simulation results indicate the superiority of the proposed scheme for all scenarios in terms of total computational bits compared to benchmark schemes. Moreover, among the three uplink transmission schemes, TDMA performs the best in total computational bits and user fairness owing to its ability to flexibly adapt STAR-RIS phase shift vectors.},

To enhance flexibility, we introduce a smart dynamic task partitioning and cooperative offloading/delivery mechanism, enabling users to offload task partitions to various MEC servers. Uncertainties stemming from users&#39; high mobility and traffic variations may lead to unpredictable task offloading demands and Imperfect Channel State Information (I-CSI), potentially causing unsuccessful task offloading/delivery. In response, we propose a robust and cooperative two-time-scale task offloading/delivery approach, adept at handling demand uncertainty and I-CSI. The problem formulation involves a two-time scale Markov decision process, aimed at minimizing task offloading/delivery costs while maximizing task completion rates. Large time-scale slots incorporate intelligent RSU activation/deactivation, while short time-scale slots focus on task offloading/delivery. To efficiently implement this framework, we propose Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) algorithm based on Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG); namely Low overhead Multi-Agent DDPG (LoMADDPG) where at each slot, all agents tune their Actor and Critic neural network weights with the help of Global Software-defined Networking (SDN) Controller (GSC) which acts as a global weight tuner.

Artificial intelligence and machine learning are regarded as key enablers thanks to the massive amount of data that smart vehicles will collect from onboard sensors. Federated learning is one of the most promising techniques for training global machine learning models while preserving data privacy of vehicles and optimizing communications resource usage. In this article, we propose vehicular radio environment map federated learning (VREM-FL), a computation-scheduling co-design for vehicular federated learning that combines mobility of vehicles with 5G radio environment maps. VREM-FL jointly optimizes learning performance of the global model and wisely allocates communication and computation resources. This is achieved by orchestrating local computations at the vehicles in conjunction with transmission of their local models in an adaptive and predictive fashion, by exploiting radio channel maps. The proposed algorithm can be tuned to trade training time for radio resource usage. Experimental results demonstrate that VREM-FL outperforms literature benchmarks for both a linear regression model (learning time reduced by 28%) and a deep neural network for semantic image segmentation (doubling the number of model updates within the same time window).},

The requirement for compute-intensive and delay-sensitive services is increasing rapidly. As a new network paradigm, Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) can offer an environment for information technology service and extend cloud computing capability to the edge of mobile communication network. So communication data can be timely processed near the source to effectively solve the limitation of on-board resources. In this paper, we consider the heterogeneous characteristics of services and different requirements of tasks in urban rail transit system, and a MEC system architecture based on task classification is designed. To effectively utilize communication and computing resources, a resource allocation strategy based on Task Classification Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient (TC-TD3) algorithm is proposed, which includes communication and computing resources allocation. In addition, to address the offloading selection issue of multi-MEC servers, a task offloading algorithm based on balancing tasks priority of MEC is designed. In the system model, considering the random arrival time of tasks and the dynamic resource allocation at each time slot, we propose a dynamic task execution model which is more suitable for the urban rail transit system.

  abstract     = {Long-range (LoRa) communication technology, distinguished by its low power consumption and long communication range, is widely used in the Internet of Things. However, the LoRa MAC layer adopts pure ALOHA for medium access control, which may lead to severe packet collisions as the network scale expands, consequently reducing the system energy efficiency (EE). To address this issue, it is critical to carefully allocate transmission parameters such as the channel (CH), transmission power (TP) and spreading factor (SF) to each end device (ED). Owing to the low duty cycle and sporadic traffic of LoRa networks, evaluating the system EE under various parameter settings proves to be time-consuming. Therefore, we propose an analytical model to calculate the system EE while fully considering the impacts of multiple gateways, duty cycling, quasi-orthogonal SFs and capture effects. On this basis, we investigate a joint CH, SF and TP allocation problem with the objective of optimizing the system EE for uplink transmissions. Due to the NP-hard complexity of this optimization problem, it is decomposed into two subproblems: CH assignment and SF/TP assignment. First, a matching-based algorithm is introduced to address the CH assignment subproblem. Then, an attention-based multiagent reinforcement learning technique is employed to address the SF/TP assignment subproblem for EDs allocated to the same CH, which reduces the number of learning agents to achieve fast convergence. The simulation outcomes indicate that the proposed approach converges quickly under various parameter settings and obtains significantly better system EE than the baseline algorithms.},

  abstract     = {LightFidelity (LiFi) is one of the most promising techniques to meet such high demand for indoor users by utilizing the visible light spectrum. A major challenge of LiFi is that its coverage is relatively limited, as the surrounding walls, objects, and other surfaces mostly absorb visible light. Thus, a number of studies have proposed aggregating the bandwidth of WiFi and LiFi to serve all users within a room. However, complementing LiFi with WiFi via bandwidth aggregation typically comes with an overhead in terms of both aggregation and computation, which reduces the data rates that can be used. Furthermore, data provided to users are often also limited by the backhaul capacity, which is typically wired Ethernet in indoor settings. In this work, we model the utilization of the functioning of WiFi and LiFi access points as a two-dimensional flow graph and show that the problem of maximizing the sum of data rate across all users is NP-Hard in practice. We then design an algorithm FLADA to solve this problem by solving its relaxed version where the variables are treated as real numbers, and then rounding to the nearest integer. We prove formally that it provides a solution that is at least $0.5\times$ the optimal. We further compare it with a greedy baseline approach through extensive simulations and show that it outperforms it by up to 81.6%.},

  abstract     = {Internet of Drones (IoD) has become crucial due to the surge of drone-based applications. In a dynamic wireless network, drones often share data with multiple users, which is vulnerable to various security threats, e.g., eavesdropping, privacy leakage, and impersonation. Ensuring secure sharing of drone operation data is a critical issue. Existing schemes employ blockchain to ensure accountability in untrusted IoD contexts. However, drones perform excessive operations, e.g., consensus and homomorphic encryption, leading to impractical drone computation overhead. Furthermore, these existing schemes perform point-to-multipoint (P2MP) data sharing by using identity-based broadcast encryption (IBBE) as it has stateless receiver property, i.e., drones can directly establish sharing groups based on the receiver identities. However, these IBBE-based schemes need to preset the sharing group capacity, reducing sharing efficiency and flexibility in dynamic IoD networks. Also, identities in sharing groups probably result in receiver privacy breaches. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-assisted data-sharing scheme with accountability and privacy-preserving for IoD networks. We utilize on-chain immutable smart contracts and short signatures to construct a lightweight accountability mechanism that can verify and punish the above misbehavior. We develop an efficient privacy-preserving IBBE algorithm for P2MP sharing of drone operation data that enables dynamic group sharing. We prove that our algorithm is secure and receiver anonymity against chosen ciphertext attacks. The experiment results show that our scheme outperforms existing schemes in computational and communication overhead. In real-world logistics scenarios, the wireless data rate of 50Mbps can satisfy the communication requirements for ciphertext lengths up to 19.5KB. For a sharing group of 60 receivers, drone encryption costs only about 101 ms. The decryption cost remains constant and takes about 3.1 ms.},

To characterize the preferences of radars for tracking decision, the utility function consisting of the reward function under the quality of service framework and the cost function with considering system resources is devised. Then, the hierarchical coalition game is formulated to describe the cooperative task assignment and power allocation process of radars, and the existence of the stable coalition partition of the game is proven.

  abstract     = {Electric vehicles (EVs) bring convenience to public transport while having the potential to increase energy efficiency. With the rapid growth of the number of EVs, cross-domain charging will become a strong demand. Despite massive research on EV charging, existing schemes can hardly meet the security requirements of privacy protection and access control for cross-domain scenarios. Meanwhile, centralized methods bring the single point of failure and data modification. The problem of designing a secure cross-domain EV charging scheme to simultaneously ensure decentralization, privacy and access control has not been studied and remains open. Therefore, in this paper, we design BlockPPA, the first blockchain-assisted privacy-preserving authentication scheme for cross-domain EV charging in order to achieve this purpose. Our scheme makes each EV obtain an attribute-based secret key, which is used to authenticate itself and also anonymously illustrate that it really satisfies a designated access policy when cross-domain authentication happens. Only authorized EVs satisfying the policy do they have the ability to charge. We design three smart contracts and exploit Fabric blockchain to record the domain&#39;s detailed information and the authentication record of each cross-domain access from an EV, while achieving the decentralized verification of an authentication request. The results of security and performance analysis show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed cross-domain authentication mechanism.},

  abstract     = {LEO satellite networks provide global users with satellite internet services, yet the risk of cascading failures severely threatens the reliable operation of the network. Failures rapidly propagate from congested and overloaded satellites to normal satellites, causing the network to be trapped in a vicious cycle of periodic failures, unable to return to a stable state capable of providing regular services. Existing routing schemes focus on optimizing network performance under normal conditions, paying little attention to fault tolerance mechanisms after satellite failures, or the mechanisms are too simplistic to handle large-scale cascading scenarios of satellite failures, ultimately leading to rapid failure propagation or even complete network paralysis. To address these issues, this paper proposes a distributed anti-cascading routing scheme based on fuzzy logic, aimed at promptly initiating takeover routing after the network triggers cascading failures, preventing further failure propagation, and restoring the network to stable operation. A strategy for collecting and sharing information of two-hop neighboring satellites is introduced, and a routing decision method based on fuzzy logic is constructed, five main update steps for the membership functions based on a detailed analysis of cascading scenarios. Satellites can make routing decisions to reduce the risk of cascading based on two-hop neighbor information. Compared with six routing schemes under a case constellation, simulation results show that the proposed scheme can ensure stable recovery within 35% satellite failure.

This can extend GTs&#39; computing capability and save their energy cost. However, to enhance the energy efficiency of UAV propulsion, ensure successful completion of each GT&#39;s mission, and maintain a stable UAV-GT uplinks, it is crucial to design a rational UAV 3D trajectory and mission offloading strategy. To address this joint problem, We further build a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based framework in the UAV-enabled MEC system, which applies Double Deep Q-learning (D-DQN) and convex optimization techniques to jointly work out the near-optimal UAV 3D-trajectory and task offloading strategy among GTs in an online manner. With the proposed framework, the UAV-enabled MEC system can finish each GT task quickly and save the UAV mission time and propulsion energy effectively. Numerical results show that the DLR-based framework outperforms the benchmark solutions, e.g., In scenario 1, the throughput, the average data transferring rate through UAV-GT links, and the average energy efficiency of UAV compared to DQN are improved from 64.24Kb to 72.99Kb, 4.72Kbps to 20.75Kbps, 0.32bits/J to 0.36bits/J, respectively, and almost the same as the existing Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) solution, making the energy efficient edge computing truly viable in UAV-enabled MEC system.},

This challenge is further exacerbated when the number of terminal devices increases and multiple edge servers are required to collaborate to handle task requests. To this end, this paper proposes a fine-grained Collaborative DNN Model Selection scheme for heterogeneous edge computing systems (CoMS), aiming to promote cooperation between edge servers and achieve more effective model selection. Specifically, we first design a reinforcement learning scheme with real-time dynamic normalization strategy, aiming to accelerate model convergence and improve the efficiency of model selection. Next, we introduce a model selection strategy based on greedy algorithm and an efficient fine-grained collaborative model selection strategy respectively to promote cooperation between edge servers, thereby further achieving a balance between inference accuracy and overhead. Extensive experimental results show that compared with baselines, our CoMS reduces the average trade-off overhead by 4.2% to 12.8% and improves the success ratio by 3% to 16%.},

  abstract     = {Radio tomographic Imaging (RTI) provides high-precision localization of targets in a monitoring area by exploiting the relationship between target location and radio link attenuation. Most recent RTI approaches leverage pre-processing and data-driven strategies to improve the accuracy of moving targets. However, these approaches suffer from limitations such as training time and low frame rate, which constrain RTI to quickly and accurately localize the moving target. To address these limitations, we develop a coarse-to-fine RTI (CF-RTI) system that achieves a maximum frame rate of 29 frames per second (fps), surpassing the minimum requirement of 16 fps for a typical RGB camera while maintaining remarkable accuracy and resolution. First, CF-RTI enables high frame rate imaging by constructing a visual fingerprint database that establishes connections between target locations and potentially affected links, thereby enabling multi-step acquisition, reconstruction, and estimation. Second, the multi-step processing exploits the knowledge gained from localization efforts during acquisition processing, enabling high-quality imaging by rapidly identifying and collecting measurements from the target&#39;s affected links. Finally, the experimental results show that our CF-RTI can achieve centimeter-level positioning accuracy and a maximum frame rate of 29 fps while using only 9% of the traditional RTI measurements. The maximum frame rate of our CF-RTI is comparable to that of standard RGB cameras. These results suggest that our CF-RTI has excellent potential for implementing RTI techniques in real-world scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Traditional spectrum sensing schemes devised under the presumption of circular signals may suffer from performance deterioration when non-circular (NC) signals are present. To circumvent this drawback, this paper devises a novel non-circular signal detection scheme within the framework of generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) by employing the non-circular characteristic of primary signals. The proposed method is able to leverage the exhaustive second-order statistical information of NC signals by taking into account both the standard covariance and complementary covariance. Performance merits in terms of false alarm probability (FAP) and detection probability (DP) are analyzed in the exact and approximate manners. Specifically, the exact distribution of proposed statistic under null hypothesis is derived with the support of Mellin transform, leading to a closed-form expression for the probability of false alarm. The Wilks&#39; theorem is then used to approximately compute the FAP in the large-sample regime. Moreover, a computationally efficient and high-precision approximation for the FAP is provided via the method of Beta-based moment matching. Detection probability (DP) is also obtained by employing the moment-matching method once more.

  abstract     = {This study explores a new resource allocation framework for a multi-user multiple-input and multiple-output (MU-MIMO) downlink system utilizing aerial reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ARIS) in a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) scheme under ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). The objective is to maximize the overall spectral efficiency of users located in severely blocked dead zones, where there is no direct link between the base station (BS) and the users and, the ARIS acts as a relay to facilitate communication. To achieve this, we formulate a sum-rate maximization problem considering the joint design of active beamforming at the BS, passive beamforming at the ARIS, and determination of the ARIS height. The constraints include given packet size and packet error probability (PEP) requirements. Since the original problem is non-convex, we propose an alternating optimization framework to solve it. The framework involves solving sub-problems of beamforming design and ARIS location alternately. The beamforming design sub-problem is addressed using successive convex approximation, while the ARIS location sub-problem is solved using a particle-swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The proposed solution demonstrates fast convergence within a few iterations, as validated through numerical simulations. Additionally, a computational complexity analysis is performed. The results show that the proposed RSMA scheme for the ARIS-aided DL URLLC system surpasses conventional multiple access schemes in terms of rate performance. The findings highlight the potential of utilizing ARIS and RSMA to enhance the spectral efficiency and meet the requirements of URLLC applications.},

This study leverages the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture&#39;s flexibility and programmability to introduce a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) strategy for QoS-aware intra-slice resource allocation. By employing intelligent agents and a Deep Q-Network (DQN)-based framework, our approach precisely tailors resource distribution within O-RAN, optimizing for enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) slices. The proposed method, featuring intelligent QoS-aware resource allocation (IQRA) and its low-complexity variant (LIQRA), demonstrates significant throughput improvements for eMBB by 11.5% compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and reduces URLLC latency by 19.94% and 16.54%, achieving up to 45.5% lower latency than baseline. A streamlined algorithm effectively reduces computational complexity, ensuring robust performance under resource constraints. Simulation results underscore the algorithm&#39;s ability to substantially enhance 5G network slice performance, offering a parameterized solution for user association in O-RAN networks using DRL. This research not only meets high key performance indicators (KPIs) but also advances edge intelligence, fostering a more responsive network ecosystem.},

However, the security issues raised by the open nature of the wireless transmission deserve attention, especially when confronted with cooperative wardens and eavesdroppers. To this end, we consider a new framework for an energy-efficient design of AAV-aided short-packet transmission systems against cooperative hostile detection and eavesdropping attacks. Specifically, the false rate of the cooperative hostile detection is first derived by utilizing the likelihood ratio test and the bivariate Gaussian distribution property. Then, we formulate a problem to maximize the minimum covert secrecy energy efficiency (MCSEE) by jointly optimizing the user association, AAV power control, and AAV three-dimensional (3D) trajectory design. We propose a penalty-based dual-loop iterative optimization algorithm to tackle this complex problem suboptimally with the aid of auxiliary penalty variables, where the communication resource scheduling, the AAV trajectory planning, and the auxiliary penalty variables are optimized in the inner loop. In particular, the intractable joint AAV power control and 3D trajectory design sub-problem is suboptimally addressed by introducing slack variables and employing successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. The penalty factor is updated in the outer loop. Finally, numerical results are provided to verify the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed solution to several benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {The space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) greatly improves coverage and reliability for millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication in high-speed railway (HSR) scenarios. However, a significant challenge arises in the transmission scheduling due to the rapid changes in channel state, link selection for train mobile relays (MRs), and order of the flow scheduling. To tackle this challenge, we introduce an optimization problem focused on maximizing the weighted sum completed flows that satisfy the quality of service (QoS) requirements for HSR mmWave communication in SAGIN. To facilitate the simultaneous scheduling of flows by base station-MR (BS-MR), satellite-airship-MR, and satellite-MR links, we propose a link selection algorithm, which can help each flow choose a suitable set of links in every frame and determine whether the BS networks need the assistance of the satellite and airship. Furthermore, taking into account the priority and occupied time slots (TSs) resource of different flows, we propose a multi-link weighted flow scheduling (MWFS) algorithm. This algorithm not only prioritizes scheduling high-priority flows but also aims to maximize the weighted sum completed flows for MRs. Our simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithm significantly increases the weighted sum completed flows and the total transmitted bits. Additionally, the proposed algorithm can achieve the optimal flow transmission in different link switching periods and enhance the scheduling of high-priority flows compared to other algorithms.},

Although cognitive radio (CR) technology has been widely studied in 5G communications, its influence on connectivity, particularly in CVNs, has been seldom discussed. In this paper, probability theory is adopted to deduce the connectivity probabilities of CVNs by analyzing the cognitive and communication characteristics of CVs, so as to unveil the correlations between network connectivity and the channel environment together with road traffic factors. In particular, to demonstrate the impact of cognitive and vehicular capacity on connectivity performance, two traffic scenarios with different vehicular transmission coverages and relay behaviors are discussed. Simulation results present the variation of connectivity probabilities with different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), coverage ranges of both RSUs and CVs, and the densities of CVs. It can be found that the improvement of channel environment leads to better network connectivity, thus demonstrating the significant impact of cognitive activities on the connectivity of CVNs.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a non-uniform pilot pattern based on the cyclic difference set (CDS) for sparse channel estimation in multiple-input-multiple-output orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems. The CDS-based pilot patterns can effectively enhance the performance of sparse channel estimation by applying compressed sensing (CS) techniques. However, the existing CDS pilot patterns are limited to single-input-single-output orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (SISO-OFDM) systems. In MIMO-OFDM systems, as the required number of CDS increases, there will be a growing number of intersecting (overlapping) elements among different CDSs (antennas), thus introducing significant interference among different antennas. To tackle this problem, a special CDS property called identical multi-set intersection (IMI) property is disclosed which can significantly reduce the inter-antenna interference. In addition, two constructions of desired CDS collection $\bf D_{I}$ having such IMI property are presented. To further eliminate the residual interference due to the remaining intersecting elements, i.e. the exact $\lambda$ overlapping positions among all antennas, two pilot placement algorithms, i.e., zero setting (ZS) and partial orthogonal cover coding (POCC), are proposed to achieve orthogonal pilot patterns in frequency. Our simulation results show that our proposed MIMO non-uniform IMI CDS pilot patterns exhibit superior estimation accuracy, closely approaching that of SISO systems. Furthermore, our MSE simulation results also show that, under the same condition, the proposed IMI CDS pilot scheme significantly outperforms the 3GPP 5G NR MIMO-OFDM pilot schemes, offering better estimation performance while maintaining much lower generating complexity compared with other existing multi-antenna pilot schemes.},

However, the major drawback is the significant expense required to deploy and maintain numerous infrastructure sites and connect them to a central processing unit (CPU) for baseband processing. This paper proposes utilizing CF-M-MIMO processing atop existing micro/macrocellular deployments in current 5G networks. It suggests connecting all base stations (BSs) to a CPU via fronthaul links to enable joint processing of user equipment (UE) without the costly deployment of many scattered access points (APs). By jointly managing all transmit/receive points (TRPs) in the network, a novel switch on/off strategy is derived to maximize energy efficiency by exploiting the sleep mode capabilities of current baseband/RF hardware, adapting to changes in UE behavior and operator requirements. Additionally, the paper considers multiantenna user terminals, common in current 5G setups, and proposes a technique to manage the number of streams directed to each UE, balancing multiplexing gains and increased pilot contamination.},

This paper presents a three-tier system for edge caching, integrating massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) networks. We consider a scenario with an extensive file library whose size is larger than the aggregated caching capacity of the small base stations (SBSs). Each SBS proactively caches files based on dynamic file popularity that is unknown in advance. A distinguishing aspect of our model is its file-wise approach to the cache instead of the conventional vector-wise methods based on aggregate popularity. This approach introduces additional computational challenges concerning the extensive file library. We formulated the optimization problem to maximize the long-term discounted cache hit rate while minimizing the delivery delay. For the solution, two multi-agent federated $Q$-learning algorithms are proposed. The first algorithm employs selective updates of the $Q$-values of popular files to minimize computational overhead. The second algorithm incorporates linear function approximation (LFA) and tensor completion (TC) to streamline the updating process further, reducing the required parameter number. Through the real-world MovieLens dataset and compared with various baseline algorithms, simulations demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can reduce the delay by around 2.60--21.29%, improve the cache hit rate by around 5.71--66.42%, and reduce the computational complexity by at most 97.91%.},

We model the FSO link using the Málaga ($\mathcal {M}$) distribution with two detection schemes and use an RIS-aided Rayleigh fading model for the RF link, both of which consider the satellite-terrestrial loss. At high SNRs, we determine the relevant asymptotic expressions and validate the analytical results through Monte Carlo simulations. Additionally, we evaluate the impacts of key system parameters, such as RIS configuration parameters and imperfect CSI, on the end-to-end performance.},

  abstract     = {With the remarkable development of the location-aware communications, joint localization and communication (L&amp;C) has become one of the strongest competitors for the 6G key enabling technologies. Meanwhile, the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as an important enhancing technology for both communication and localization. In this paper, we investigate a RIS-aided joint L&amp;C system, where the localization and data transmission functions are integrated in a time-division pattern. Specifically, we aim to jointly optimize the covariance matrices of the localization signal and the communication signal, the RIS beamforming matrix and the time division ratio to simultaneously improve the localization and communication performance. An alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is proposed via jointly leveraging the successive convex approximation technique, the semidefinite relaxation method and the projected gradient descent with momentum algorithm, based on which we strike a compelling trade-off between the localization and communication performance. Considering the high computational cost in the large-scale array scenario, we also develop a low-complexity algorithm free of iterations. To analyze the optimality of our proposed AO algorithm, we further consider the special single-user line-of-sight (LoS) scenario and validate that our AO algorithm could achieve the beam alignment, implying its effectiveness. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed algorithm.},

Specifically, by exploiting the correlation of angle information during multiple consecutive channel coherence blocks, we estimate the full channel state information in the first coherence block (FCB) and only update the gain information in each subsequent block. Then, based on the ambiguity property, a low-pilot-overhead two-stage method is adopted in the FCB. In Stage 1, all users jointly transmit pilot to estimate the angles of arrival at the BS and the correlation factors between different paths of the common BS-RIS channel via introducing a set of matching matrices and a designed RIS phase shift matrix, which achieves a significant MU diversity gain. By exploiting the mmWave cascaded channels&#39; ambiguity property, an ambiguous common BS-RIS channel is constructed with the estimated correlation factors. In Stage 2, each user independently transmits a limited number of pilots to estimate their individual ambiguous RIS-user channel, leading to a comprehensive cascaded channel estimation. For the remaining blocks, we adopt a straightforward least-squares method for rapid gain estimation. Simulation results confirm the method&#39;s effectiveness in providing accurate estimation with reduced pilot overhead, outperforming existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) techniques are capable of boosting the throughput of next 6G networks. However, due to the large number of antennas in the wideband XL-MIMO systems, they suffer from the so-called near-field beam split effect, where beams at different frequencies are focused on different locations. This effect imposes a severe performance loss on near-field channel estimation. To address this issue, in this paper, we investigate the wideband near-field channel covariance estimation problem of XL-MIMO systems. Explicitly, we first propose a sophisticated polar-domain dictionary for the wideband near-field channel at different frequencies. Specifically, the proposed polar-domain dictionary consists of several sub-matrices. For each sub-matrix, the angle is sampled from a unique range while the distance is sampled from the same range. Meanwhile, considering the beam split effect, we construct the corresponding dictionaries for different frequencies that can beneficially adjust the grid of the sampled angles and distances. Then we propose an algorithm termed as the correlation coefficient sparsity adaptive matching pursuit relying on parameter refinement (CCSAMP-PR) to reconstruct the near-field channel without any prior knowledge of the channel sparsity. More explicitly, an iterative parameter refinement step is conceived for gradually refining the angles and distances per iteration. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is capable of adaptively adjusting its step size for ensuring rapid convergence. Finally, numerical results are provided for demonstrating that both our proposed polar-domain dictionary and CCSAMP-PR algorithm outperform the family of existing schemes.},

  abstract     = {Mixed-numerology transmission is a flexible physical layer waveform technology to support different service. The coexistence of different numerologies causes inter-numerology interference (INI) and deteriorates the system performance. In uplink transmission, the detection of mixed-numerology signal is based on Least common multiple (LCM) symbols to ensure the integrity of symbol sampling for each numerology. However, the LCM symbol-based detection increases the latency for delay sensitive services, which adopt numerologies with short symbols. In this paper, we propose an active INI cancellation (A-INIC) algorithm at the transmitter and a soft iterative INI cancellation (soft I-INIC) algorithm at receiver for uplink mixed-numerology transmission. Based on the proposed algorithms, we construct an A-INIC transceiver which can pre-cancel the INI with multi-path fading channel. In the transmitter, the A-INIC module actively compensate for the INI generated by the user itself to adjacent subbands as well as the corresponding secondary INI in target subband, which facilitate symbol-based detection at receiver for latency reduction. In the receiver, a soft I-INIC module is applied to cancel the residual INI when the feedback channel state information (CSI) for INI pre-compensation is imperfect. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms in block error ratio (BLER) performance even without any guard subcarrier.},

  abstract     = {Orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) modulation is fast becoming a popular modulation scheme for high-mobility wireless communication due to its ability to render time-varying channels invariant and sparse. However, due to the limited time duration and frequency bandwidth of the transmitted OTFS signal, the occurrence of fractional delay and Doppler shifts becomes inevitable, causing both inter-delay interference (IDeI) and inter-Doppler interference (IDI). In this paper, an impulse-based channel estimation method is used, which takes advantage of the fact that the pilot impulse is a pulse tone (pulsone). A pulsone maintains its shape despite time delay and Doppler shift operations, as well as being self-dual between time and frequency domains. Exploiting these two features, a low-complexity algorithm is proposed to estimate the fractional delay and fractional Doppler channel. We derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the estimated fractional channel and show that the developed estimator is efficient. Then, we provide the computational complexity analysis of the proposed algorithm. After that, we show and stress that the proposed channel estimation scheme is better in terms of the channel normalized mean squared error (NMSE) and the bit-error rate (BER).

  abstract     = {Cognitive electronic warfare (CEW) has received increasing attention, and it is widely recognized that it will play a significant role. Cognitive jamming decision-making, as one of the critical technologies of CEW, dramatically impacts the global battlefield situation. In this paper, we introduce the A2C algorithm into cognitive jamming decision-making and propose a heuristic improved A2C algorithm. As a fusion algorithm of DQN and Policy Gradient, on the one hand, the Actor-Critic algorithm has the advantages of iterative updating of policies and high efficiency in complex spaces, compared to the DQN algorithm. On the other hand, compared with the Policy Gradient algorithm, it features fast convergence. But, it suffers from high variance, making convergence difficult. First, we establish a cognitive jamming decision-making model to address the above issues. Then, we develop an improved A2C algorithm by introducing a baseline and dueling networks. The baseline reduces the variance of the critic network, while dueling networks further decrease variance, enhancing the convergence of the A2C algorithm. Additionally, the improved A2C algorithm does not rely on prior information, and enhances the adaptive capability of the jammer when interacting with the target radar. We conducted numerical simulations based on the designed cognitive jamming decision-making model. The results demonstrated that compared with the four algorithms (DQN, Policy Gradient, Actor-Critic, A2C), the convergence speed of the improved A2C algorithm is improved by 50$\%$, 57.8$\%$, 34.5$\%$, and 13.64$\%$, respectively, and verified the excellent performance of the improved A2C. Finally, we introduce the heuristic reward function and propose the heuristic improved A2C algorithm. Compared with the improved A2C algorithm, the convergence speed of this algorithm is improved by 31.58$\%$. The simulation results prove that the algorithm can greatly improve our advantage in electronic countermeasures.},

As user nodes in vehicle networks, vehicles have high mobility, which leads to the highly complex and unstable topology of vehicle networks. Therefore, we propose a practical solution to solve the problem of advertising dissemination among Intelligent Networked Vehicles (INVs). In our strategy, advertisements are first sent to a group of selected seed INVs and then spread among INVs. To encourage INVs to disseminate advertising actively, we propose an incentive scheme that combines online and offline to maximize profit. We propose a dynamic seed INVs replacement algorithm using the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm to decide the update cycle of the seed INVs set. Simulation results show that the proposed strategy is superior to the existing methods in terms of delivery ratio of advertisement dissemination and expected profit of merchant.},

Motivated by the fact that switches are phase-independent and more power/cost efficient than PSs, we consider the switch-based HBF (SW-HBF) for wideband large-scale multiple-input multiple-output systems in this paper. We first derive a closed-form expression of the beam squint ratio unveiling that the severity of beam squint linearly increases with the number of antennas, the antenna spacing distance, and the fractional bandwidth. We then focus on the SW-HBF designs to maximize the spectral efficiency (SE) in both single-user (SU) and multiuser (MU) systems. The formulated problems in both cases exhibit intractable non-convex and mixed-integer challenges. To address them, for the SU case, by combining the tabu search (TS) method and projected gradient ascend (PGA), we propose an efficient heuristic PGA-TS algorithm to design analog beamformers while the digital ones admit closed-form solutions. For the MU case, we develop a two-step algorithm based on fractional programming and the PGA-TS method. Simulation results show that the proposed SW-HBF schemes are efficient and can outperform PS-based HBF architectures in terms of both SE and energy efficiency in wideband systems.},

To achieve these objectives, a low complexity and cost-efficient hybrid NOMA-OMA-based resource allocation mechanism is introduced which can enhance network connectivity without aggravating interference. The hybrid successive-interference-cancellation (SIC) decoding method is utilized to improve transmission robustness. Additionally, a novel hybrid SIC decoding approach is specifically designed when the transmitted signals experience the same fading effects over a common channel transmission mode, i.e. the link between the relay and the base station (BS). We show that the FD relay-assisted vehicular communication system suffers from an outage probability error floor. Hence a modified zero-forcing (ZF) criterion-based transmit beamformer is designed to enhance the transmission robustness and eliminate the residual self-interference (SI) caused by FD operation. Moreover, a truncated Gaussian distribution is considered to model vehicle mobility. In order to minimize the line-of-sight (LoS) link obstruction phenomenon, the optimal vehicle speed is derived. Further, the exact and asymptotic outage probability expressions are derived, based on which the analysis of diversity order is provided. To validate the accuracy of our analytical results, Monte-Carlo simulations are conducted. Our results reveal that the hybrid SIC-based decoding scheme for SGF NOMA transmission provides a superior outage performance compared to the conventional NOMA transmission with the conventional SIC-based decoding scheme. Additionally, combining the hybrid SIC decoding method with the relay beamforming approach can eliminate the outage probability error floor while guaranteeing the quality of service (QoS) for the primary vehicle in the uplink FD cooperative vehicular communication system.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate the SWIPT (simultaneous wireless information and power transfer) based MEC (mobile edge computing) system in the mmWave band, where wireless devices offload partial tasks to the MEC server in the uplink, receive the computing result and harvest energy in the downlink. We focus on exploiting multiple beams in the mmWave band to enhance the multi-device downlink transmissions and maintain fairness among multiple devices. Specifically, we concentrate on the joint optimization of the uplink offloading, downlink beam management for multi-device transmissions, downlink power splitting within each beam for computing result receiving and energy harvesting, and time allocation between uplink and downlink. We formulate the joint optimization problem to maximize the minimum residual device energy. As the problem is a mixed-integer non-convex optimization program, we design a heuristic algorithm with low computing complexity, by relaxing the integer constraint and exploiting the successive convex approximation method. We carry out extensive simulations to verify our proposed algorithm performance. The simulations demonstrate that the joint optimization of beam management can increase the minimum residual energy and ensure the max-min fairness among multiple devices within the mmWave SWIPT-based MEC system.},

  abstract     = {In wireless communications and vehicle communications, it is useful to use adaptive filtering techniques for channel estimation, beamforming and echo cancellation. In this paper, we propose a general constrained adaptive filtering (GCAF) algorithm for single channel estimation and beamforming, which is obtained by integrating a general and adaptive loss function into the constrained adaptive filtering (CAF) framework. By selecting the parameter in the GCAF, it can approximate to several popular CAF algorithms. Then, the convergence, stability boundary and the stability analysis of the mean squared-deviation have been analyzed and presented in detail. Additionally, The complexity of the GCAF is presented and compared with the existing algorithms. The proposed GCAF is used for single-input and single-output (SISO) channel estimation and beamforming under different noises, and the tracking performance of the GCAF is also analyzed. The simulation results demonstrate that the GCAF algorithm outperforms the typically adaptive filtering algorithms and can effectively approxiamte the similar algorithms under heavy-tailed noises, which makes the proposed GCAF more robust and general.},

For the first time, we derive a spatial-domain interference signal model that accounts for not only the time-frequency incoherence (e.g., different FMCW parameters and time offsets) but also the slow-time MIMO code incoherence and array configuration differences between the victim and interfering radars. Using the explicit interference signal model with the standard MIMO-FMCW object signal model, we turn the interference mitigation into a spatial-domain object detection under incoherent MIMO-FMCW interference. By exploiting the structural property of the derived interference model at both transmit and receive steering vector space, we derive a detector via beamforming optimization to achieve good detection performance and further propose an adaptive version of this detector to enhance its practical applicability. Performance evaluation using analytical closed-form expressions, synthetic-level simulation and system-level simulation confirms the effectiveness of our proposed detectors over selected baseline methods.},

  abstract     = {Supporting massive access from Internet of Things (IoT) devices plays a pivotal role in the design of 6G networks. Nonetheless, concurrent massive access to the network deteriorates the quality of 6G communications. To overcome the challenge of massive access, our focus shifts to optimizing the age-critical frameless ALOHA (ACFA) random access protocol. The conventional ACFA suffers from high latency and unreliability when massive devices attempt to access the network. Consequently, we introduce an adaptive algorithm to address the transmission issues. This paper optimizes the random access channel (RACH) procedure by maximizing a long-term multi-objective function, which consists of the average age of information (AoI), normalized throughput, traffic load and the average number of successfully accessed machine-type communication devices. To achieve the optimal objective in ACFA, we apply deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms. In our algorithms, agents take action in both distributed and centralized manners. In the distributed approach, each device learns the choice of the access probability and the slot, guided by feedback from the base station (BS). Simultaneously, in the centralized approach, the BS restricts a specific number of devices from accessing the network and dynamically adjusts the frame length based on the transmission results of devices. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme surpasses benchmark schemes and exhibits significant potential to minimize AoI performance.},

  abstract     = {The lateral state information of vehicles is pivotal for their lateral control and safety monitoring of motion states. In light of the high cost associated with a vehicle&#39;s lateral speed sensor, this study focuses on estimating the lateral velocity of autonomous vehicles using the vehicle&#39;s longitudinal speed and yaw rate. The main difficulty is that the state estimation is affected by sampled and delayed sensor data measurements as well as unknown modeling uncertainties. To overcome these challenges, this article proposes a novel sampled data neural network observer. The proposed observer consists of two components: a continuous state observer and a compensating injector. The compensating injector is devised to offset the information loss during sampling by digital sensors. Additionally, a radial basis function neural network is employed to approximate the unknown dynamics and modeling uncertainties in the vehicle systems. The weights of the neural network are updated using a newly designed weight update law. Furthermore, to tackle the challenge of both sampling and delay measurement, an additional integrator is incorporated in the designed compensating injector. This additional integrator aims to mitigate the impact of sensor data delays on the estimation process. Finally, the stability of the proposed method is demonstrated using the Lyapunov technique. The effectiveness of the proposed sampled data neural network observer is verified through simulation and experiment performed on a full driving automation vehicle experimental platform.},

First, to estimate the yaw rate of the ASV, an adaptive cubature Kalman filter (ACKF) estimator is designed, in which an adaptive dynamic programming is utilized to tackle the model mismatches and generate a compensation term for the reduction of the estimation error. Second, the saturation model with smooth function is presented to deal with the saturation nonlinearities, aiming to restrict the surge force, sway force, and yaw moment of the ASV in the predefined boundaries. Third, a finite-time prescribed performance robust integral of the sign of the error (RISE) control method with the radial basis function neural network is proposed to overcome model uncertainties and external disturbances, dedicating to guarantee the transient performance and achieve the asymptotic trajectory tracking of the ASV. For the closed-loop system, the finite-time asymptotic stability is proved by employing the Lyapunov stability theorem.

  abstract     = {Fuel cell hybrid electric vehicles (FCEVs) are considered an appealing option for heavy-duty and long-distance vehicles. However, they require the use of multiple power converters to manage power distribution among the fuel cell, battery or ultracapacitor, and AC motor, leading to increased power losses and a more complex system. To overcome this challenge, multi-port power converters have been proposed to combine two power sources and the AC motor into one conversion stage, boosting overall efficiency and power density in hybrid powertrains. However, these converters still rely on a high number of semiconductors and involve complex control systems. This paper introduces a three-port converter (TPC) for FCHEVs, using only one power stage with 6 semiconductors, achieving high performance control of an ac motor, a fuel cell and a battery. A multivariable optimal control (Finite-Control-Set Model Predictive Current Control) manages the power flows between the energy sources and drives the motor simultaneously. Additionally, the performance of the multiport converter is improved by replacing its three inductors with a custom coupled inductor designed to reduce circulating AC currents. This innovation contributes to improved efficiency and overall functionality of the FCHEV system. The proposed system was validated through an 0.5kW experimental test bench and simulations of an urban driving cycle. The system controlled the multiple variables of the hybrid system with proper operation and fast dynamics, meanwhile the coupled inductor decreases the current magnitude in 20$\%$ compared to the non-coupled configuration.},

Meanwhile, an adaptive linear quadratic regulator-based feedback controller with a piece-wise affine tire model is put forward to account for the influence of vertical load, road adhesion condition, and yaw rate tracking error. The controller adopts an adaptive weighting coefficient mechanism to satisfy various working conditions based on different steady-state gains of the front and rear wheel angles over the yaw rate. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is experimentally verified under comprehensive testing scenarios through Hardware-in-the-Loop tests.

To improve the performance of Battery/Supercapacitor (SC) based EV, an adaptive EMS based on Pontryagin&#39;s Minimum Principle (PMP) considering actual road slope and velocity prediction through Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based method is proposed. An adaptive EMS is designed by considering the solution obtained from PMP based EMS. The solution obtained by PMP is based on a constant costate variable which cannot be applied to uncertain driving conditions. To solve this problem, the costate variable is adjusted in real time using a novel adaptation law which considers the future power demand of the vehicle, actual road slope and battery conditions. The integration of ANN based velocity prediction model with EMS results in an enhanced technique that can adapt automatically to changing road and vehicle conditions and thus improves the efficiency of the EV. The entire system is tested on three actual road slope conditions and different driving cycles. A Rule Based Strategy (RBS) and PMP based technique without velocity prediction are also studied to compare and analyse the performance of the proposed Adaptive EMS based on PMP (APMP).

  abstract     = {The field of intelligent connectivity in modern vehicles continues to expand, with vehicle functions becoming increasingly complex over time. This expansion has led to numerous vehicle safety issues, which can easily result in safety failures, leading to injuries and deaths. Therefore, it is particularly important to identify high-risk intelligent connected systems in vehicles, as it can inform safety personnel which systems are most susceptible to safety failures, enabling them to conduct more thorough inspections and tests. In this paper, we develop a new model for vehicle intelligent connected system risk assessment by combining Interval Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (I-FAHP) with Fuzzy Cluster Analysis (FCA), called VSRQ model. We extract crucial indicators related to vehicle safety, utilizing FCA in conjunction with the I-FAHP to identify vulnerable components in the vehicle intelligent connected system. Priority testing is then conducted on these components to mitigate risks and ensure vehicle safety. We evaluate the model on OpenPilot and provide experimental evidence of the VSRQ model&#39;s effectiveness in assessing the safety of vehicle intelligent connected systems. Our experiments fully adhere to the ISO 26262 standard, and our model exhibits a higher accuracy rate compared to other models. These results provide a promising new research direction for predicting the safety risks of vehicle intelligent connected systems and provide typical application tasks for VSRQ. The experimental results show that the accuracy rate is 94.36%, and the recall rate is 73.43%, which is at least 14.63% higher than all other known methods.},

  abstract     = {Unlike traditional fuel vehicles, the air conditioning system of electric vehicles not only undertakes the thermal management of the cabin but also the thermal management of the battery system and even the thermal management of the electric motor control. The high demand for heating and cooling power leads to a significant reduction in cruising range. As the heart of the air conditioning system, E-compressors play the most critical role in the thermal management of electric vehicles. This paper shows that SiC MOSFETs are preferred for 800V electric vehicle E-compressors compared to Si IGBTs. A systematic comparison of SiC MOSFET and conventional IGBT solutions for E-compressor application in terms of system energy efficiency, compressor operation boundary, NVH performance, and system miniaturization trend is described in this paper. Besides, the cost reduction potential and gate oxide reliability issues of SiC MOSFET are also discussed.},

  abstract     = {In order to solve the safety issues such as broken hooks and derailment caused by the longitudinal impact of long trains, this paper proposes a functional variable universe fuzzy (FVUF) PID (FVUF-PID) controller incorporated with a genetic algorithm (GA) for the segmented electro-pneumatic (SEP) braking system of heavy-haul trains. To study the performance of the SEP braking system with the controller, the simulation model of the SEP braking system with a high fidelity to the static standard bench of 150-marshalling freight train is established based on the principle of Model-120 distribution valve, and extensive simulations for the SEP braking performance with the controller are carried out. The controller can realize an online adaptive tuning for the PID parameters by applying the GA to optimize the scaling factors and control rules of variable universe fuzzy inference, resulting in a great enhancement of control performance. The simulation and experiment results show that, compared with traditional pneumatic braking and SEP braking with FVUF-PID controller optimized by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), the time difference of starting rise of the braking cylinder between the first and last car of a 150-marshalling freight train can be reduced by 78% and 15.3%, respectively. Also, the braking time and distance of the SEP braking system with the proposed controller are shorter by 20.9% and 23.03%, and 3.13% and 5.63%, respectively, compared with those of the traditional pneumatic braking system and SEP braking with FVUF-PID controller optimized by PSO at a pressure reduction of 140kPa. Furthermore, the maximum compressional forces of the coupler during traditional pneumatic braking are reduced by $18.11-62.83\%$ under different decompression pressures, demonstrating a significant improvement on the SEP braking performance by using the controller.},

  abstract     = {In the 2000s, the liberalization of the rail markets for freight and passenger travel opened up the competition. Nowadays, local, regional, and long-distance passenger rail are gradually following suit. As a consequence of the paradigm of realizing smart and sustainable cities, the operators of local railway infrastructures (i.e., metro, light railway, and commuter) are studying strategies to improve the energy efficiency of the overall system. The operators are thus involved in renewing technological infrastructures and examining new operation models for coordinating the motion of the trains fleet. With this regard, the present work proposes a timetable adjustment approach to reduce energy consumption in metro rail transit systems. In addition, a centralized control strategy to manage the output voltage of Traction Power Substations (TPSs), train regenerative power, and charge/discharge power profiles of off-board Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) is proposed. The approach is based on a two-step procedure aimed at optimally allocating the layover time among the train stops. This approach is formulated as an optimization problem, which consider the adopted control strategy, because of the correlation between control actions and timetable. Numerical examples have been carried out based on the real data from metro line 1 of Naples, (Italy). The results highlight the capability of the strategy to achieve relevant results in terms of energy saving. In addition, the advantages introduced by the proposed centralized control strategy are emphasized through a comparison with the conventional local control strategy.},

In this regard, the thermal management system (TMS) study is being broadened as it is in charge of battery packs&#39; good performance and durability. New systems or adaptions of already employed ones are being studied to improve electric vehicle outcomes. In this context, the system presented in this work is a hybrid system between the current cold plates and the lately studied phase change materials (PCMs), which is incorporated into a real case electrification of a commercial vehicle. As a result, integrating the PCM buffer into the battery pack&#39;s base structure aims to improve mechanical strength while also improving thermal management. The operation analysis results under 6 C fast charge and motorway speed discharge showed the capability of the proposed TMS. The increase in the system&#39;s thermal capacitance by 31.9% when combining the use of cold plate with PCM enabled distributing the heat dissipation along the charge and discharge, despite the weight being increased by 10.14%. Hence, the auxiliary cooling system&#39;s peak power was reduced, allowing for size reduction and an energy consumption reduction of 21%. Moreover, the PCM delimits the maximum temperature reached by the system with a reduction at the end of fast charge of more than 10%, serving as a security element with the cold plate switched off. Therefore, the proposed system&#39;s weight demerits could be overcome with temperature and auxiliary consumption reductions, proving an effective system for a high-performance vehicle.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the development of electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure and efforts to achieve more sustainable transportation systems have increased. The enhanced utilization of EVs will require fast charging systems, which will overload utility power grids and require high-cost additional installations and equipment. However, a significant amount of regenerative braking energy (RBE) is available in electric railway systems (ERSs), which needs to be properly stored and accommodated. The integration of ERSs and EV charging stations (EVCS) at strategic points, such as parking areas close to ERS stations or rail freight intermodal terminals where EVs are parked most hours of the day, can be a promising solution to save RBE in the dedicated internal EV batteries. In this article, a new method is proposed to charge EVs by transferring RBE from ERSs to EVCSs, taking advantage of a combined power management scheme based on stationary hybrid energy storage systems (HESSs) integrated with railway power flow controllers (RPFCs). A coordinated hierarchical control (CHC) method collaborating with an internal model predictive control (IMPC) strategy is presented to manage an optimal power flow paradigm for various operating system modes. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is confirmed through simulations executed with the desired precision representing real system behavior.},

  abstract     = {Recently, multi-motor electric vehicles (EVs) gain much attraction from both academics and industry as they offer prospective advantages in performance and efficiency improvement thanks to the torque-split configuration. Such EVs can enhance the energy consumed throughout normal operation by using a suitable torque distribution system. However, researches on conventional energy management system regularly do not take into account the dynamics of the vehicle, particularly the loss caused by the slip phenomenon of the wheel on the road. Dealing with dual-motor all-wheel-driven EVs, we propose an efficiency-based optimal strategy considering longitudinal vehicle dynamics for improving energy consumption by formulating an energetic cost function that links the energy management and the motion control of EVs. For that, the proposed strategy optimally distributes the required total torque to the front and rear axles to maximize the efficiencies of traction motors in both acceleration and deceleration duration. Software simulation and experiment are carried out on multiple testing scenarios to validate the performance of the proposal. The results show that the proposed distribution strategy can save from 4.4% to 18.8% of consumed energy, compared to several other management strategies described in the article.},

In this article, specific attention is paid to the models of the vehicles, the traction power substation, and the rail supply network to enable an accurate estimation of the energy consumption. The energetic macroscopic representation formalism is used to organize the models of the subsystems so they have the right interactions. The developed model is validated by experimental tests on a real subway line. The error on the global energy consumption is lower than 2.2%. The model is then employed to examine the influence of the vehicle time interval on energy consumption. A 10-second adjustment in this time interval can result in a substantial 22% decrease in energy consumption for the analyzed real subway line.},

This substitution is to decrease the circuit complexity, cost, and required space. However, fulfilling these goals highly depends on the selection of a suitable topology. This paper performs a multi-criteria ranking to deeply analyze the impact of different ZSI topologies on the performance of a recreational FC-HEV, composed of FC stack and lithium-ion capacitor bank. First, the dual-energy sources are embedded into the Z-source network (ZSN). Subsequently, the Preference Ranking Organization METHod for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE) is utilized to rank different possible ZSI topologies based on four scenarios (standard, compactness, input current ripple, and compactness versus input current ripple). This analysis indicates that each scenario can have a suitable topology with respect to its requirements. Finally, the two highest-ranked ZSI topologies according to standard scenario are implemented by signal hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) to validate the effectiveness of the performed analysis. The results indicate that the use of the ZSI topologies lead to higher average efficiencies (1.98% and 4.07%), and smaller size and volume of passive components, compared to a conventional two-stage inverter.},

Although the onboard measurement of EIS can be done by controlling the harmonic content of the power converter at the output of the fuel cell, the implementation of in-vehicle diagnostic algorithms is still limited by the absence of a large database listing the evolution of performance throughout the life cycle. This paper presents a fast-diagnostic method able to consider the occurrence of new data to adapt the dimensional space representing the health state and compensate for the lack of data.

The spatial-temporal correlation analysis of VPS information of multiple parking lots in a region shows that not only the number of VPS in each parking lot has a stable temporal correlation, but also there is obvious spatial correlation among different parking lots. Given this, this article takes full advantage of the space-time correlation and makes short-term (within 30 min) and long-term (over 30 min) predictions about the number of VPSs in multiple parking lots in an area parallelly. Specifically, this article develops a deep gated graph recurrent neural network (G$^{2}$RNN) model which has the ability to extract both spatial and temporal correlations concurrently between different parking lots. The advantages of the G$^{2}$RNN model are that, first, spatial and temporal correlations between different parking lots can be accurately obtained simultaneously, and second, there is no need to grid the raw data since it uses graph-structured data. For long-term predictions, two different approaches, namely the single-step and iterative predictions, are investigated. The performance of the G$^{2}$RNN based prediction method is extensively evaluated with practical data collected from eight public parking lots in Santa Monica. The results show that it can achieve considerably high accuracy in both short-term and long-term predictions.},

The safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is profoundly influenced by the driving behavior of different drivers, especially in complex and dynamic scenarios. To address these safety risks arising from various driving behavior, this study introduces a low-risk, high-efficiency motion planning approach based on a trajectory prediction model. Firstly, an unsupervised driving style recognition framework using real-world data information is developed to categorize vehicles into three distinct driving style: cautions, normal, and aggressive. Next, a trajectory prediction model incorporating different driving styles is established using the Transformer prediction network to predict the future trajectories of surrounding vehicles (SVs). Subsequently, a motion planning framework that incorporates driving intentions is constructed to generate candidate planning trajectory cluster. Moreover, based on trajectory prediction and driving style information of SVs, a personalized risk assessment model is established, while also comprehensively considering the impact of safety, efficiency and comfort. Finally, the proposed approach is verified through real datasets and comparative experiments. The results show that the proposed framework achieves high-precision trajectory prediction and attains a 99% success rate in closed-loop testing with real datasets, thereby providing safe motion planning for AVs in dynamic environments.},

  abstract     = {The widespread adoption of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) has revolutionized high-precision positioning services. However, the accuracy of these systems is significantly compromised by Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) signals, especially in urban canyons. Specifically, Line-of-Sight (LOS) signals are obstructed, and the reflections lead to substantial errors. Machine learning has emerged as a promising tool for identifying NLOS signals. However, traditional methods often train models on extensive datasets from various environments and fine-tune them with new data to adjust to new scenarios. This fine-tuning can result in catastrophic forgetting, which impairs the models&#39; generalization performance across different environments. To address the limitations of model fine-tuning, we introduce NICL, an approach for NLOS Identification with Continual Learning. NICL preserves performance on previously encountered scenarios while adapting to new environments by employing simple regularization techniques that do not require access to the data from the old scenarios. Specifically, our method incorporates Kullback-Leibler divergence regularization and explainability-based regularization to maintain the model&#39;s prior outputs and the logic behind those outputs, thus mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results on real-world GNSS datasets have shown that our NICL method outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving an absolute improvement of 5%-12% in NLOS identification accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Maximizing traffic flow at signalized intersections using adaptive signal control (ASC) strategy has proven highly effective in mitigating the risk of traffic congestion. However, existing ASC strategies typically consider the traffic conditions of a single downstream road at a time, limiting their overall effectiveness. To address this limitation and enhance ASC strategies, this paper proposes an improved adaptive signal control (IASC) which considers traffic conditions of multiple downstream roads during phase selection. Furthermore, with the emergence of vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) technologies, traffic light agents can now communicate with vehicle agents. By leveraging this connectivity, this paper proposes a unified framework called VR-IASC which combines vehicle rerouting strategy with the IASC strategy. First, the proposed IASC considers the intentions of the vehicles in the connected vehicle (CV) environment during the selection of the traffic light phases. Then, the road congestion levels are predicted by considering the vehicle flow affected by the selected traffic light phases. Upon detecting the congested roads, alternative routes based on travel time and remaining road capacity are assigned to the vehicles before they enter the congested roads. Based on simulation results, the proposed IASC outperforms the state-of-the-art ASC strategy by 38.1% and 12.3% in terms of percentage reduction in average travel time in a simple grid network and a real-life Kuala Lumpur (KL) network, respectively. Furthermore, by combining the proposed IASC strategy with vehicle rerouting strategy, the proposed VR-IASC framework achieves substantial reductions in average travel time of 42.26% and 34.74% in the grid network and the KL network, respectively.},

To accurately diagnose axle-box bearing surface defects, robust blind deconvolution (BD) methods are proposed to extract defect-induced repetitive impulses from axle-box vibration measurements in this article. Specifically, a unified theoretical framework for the BD methods using time-domain and frequency-domain generalized statistical indicators as objective functions is established respectively by converting the deconvolution problem into a generalized Rayleigh quotient-based generalized eigenvalue problem. On this basis, two new BD methods for extracting repetitive impulse features are presented by employing the robust power function-based Gini index as the objective function. They obtain optimal deconvolution filters by adaptively evaluating repetitive transient features in the squared envelope and squared envelope spectrum of the filtered signal, respectively. The developed methods are verified on bench experimental signals of manufactured and naturally occurring axle-box bearing faults. The results show that the presented BD methods can effectively enhance repetitive impulse features and diagnose various defects of railway vehicle axle-box bearings.},

While prior research has predominantly focused on employing a two-dimensional wheel profiles, it has overlooked the combined effects of circumferential and lateral wear. Furthermore, although there is evidence suggesting that interharmonics can influence wheel wear, existing studies have not thoroughly explored this aspect. Therefore, this paper examines the evolution characteristics of three-dimensional (3D) PW under the influence of interharmonics from the perspective of electromechanical coupling. Initially, an evolution model for 3D wheel PW is developed, integrating an electromechanical coupling model, a 3D wheel profile model, and the USFD wear function. Subsequently, 3D distribution characteristics of PW under multiple operating conditions are analyzed. The results reveal significant differences in the order and depth of PW across different lateral positions. Specially, on curved tracks, the order of PW is presented in distinct groupings. The dominant polygon of the locomotive running (70 km/h) on a straight track is 200 mm, attributed to $| {5f - 7{{f}_0}} |$ interharmonic effect, whereas on the curved track, it is 316 mm, attributed to P2 resonance. Moreover, as the curve radius increases, the ratio between PW depth of 316 and 200 mm significantly decrease.},

In view of this, this paper proposes a consensus based reinforcement learning method for differentiated formation control (DFC) of UAVs, to balance the obstacle avoidance flexibility and consistency. In this method, to promote obstacle avoidance flexibility of a UAV swarm, a consensus mechanism with differentiated formation control strategies is designed, it allows each UAV in a swarm changes its formation control strategy among aggregation, formation keeping and obstacle avoidance according to its local environment, and calculates its own current subgoal based on the selected strategy. Further, to improve the flight efficiency of the UAV swarm, a reinforcement learning model is provided to generate the optimal offset vector for each UAV according to its current subgoal. Moreover, to enhance the obstacle avoidance consistency of the UAV swarm, a collaborative obstacle avoidance algorithm is designed in the obstacle avoidance strategy, it requires UAVs to share their obstacle information and obstacle avoidance actions, and provides obstacle avoidance consensus rules to help UAVs to choose consistent obstacle avoidance directions. The experiment results show that the proposed method can combine obstacle avoidance flexibility and consistency of UAVs, thereby achieving higher flight efficiency and maintaining stable network connectivity.},

Therefore, to enhance the overall disturbance-resisting performance of the MMLS, this paper proposes an ultra-local sliding mode adjacent cross-coupling controller (USMACC). First, a general model of the MMLS is established. The coupling relationship between LPs is deduced considering the composite motion of the system centroid. Then, an ultra-local sliding mode controller (USMC) is designed, which eliminates the parameter dependency of an accurate system model and possesses excellent dynamic performance for each LP. Next, adjacent cross-coupling control (ACC) is integrated into USMC, effectively reducing tracking errors of each LP and synchronization errors between LPs. Last, comparative experiments with conventional PID and USMC demonstrate that the MMLS adopting the proposed USMACC possesses exceptional overall disturbance-resisting performance under various inconsistent external disturbances.},

By treating catenary voltages as control variables, we show that the dynamic electric power flow for the typical double-track DC railway system can be considered within the NLP, with no need to develop a complex power flow calculation for the coupled circuits.

Specifically, a novel performance index, estimation gain, is introduced to evaluate the benefit of scheduling one sensor for estimation error reduction. Then, sensor scheduling and data transmission are jointly optimized to minimize the time-accumulated estimation error, which is challenging to directly solve due to the unclear impact of imperfect transmission on estimation performance. To this end, an estimation gain-based algorithm is designed to determine the scheduled sensors. Besides, an iterative algorithm is designed to solve the adaptive cooperative transmission problem.

The area comprises feasible flight trajectories and helps to sustainably regenerate trajectories through instantaneous computation. Thus, it is essential for online plan decisions, particularly in emergencies. However, computing end positions can be challenging when there is high degree of nonlinear coupling between the flight constraints, dynamics, objective functions, and thermal/load factors. To solve this issue, we propose a new flight profile that easily satisfies strict constraints. In addition, we devise a series of analytic dynamics to instantly predict the thermal/load factors and objective functions. The analytic models integrate Earth&#39;s perturbations and rotations and complex aerodynamic models, thus improving the accuracy of the derived reachable area. Based on a novel Mercator plane with minimum projection deformation, we devise a lateral profile using a cubic B-spline model that easily satisfies the extensively checked waypoints. Based on the results, the proposed algorithm mitigates nonlinear coupling to a significant extent and facilitates reachable area generation. In addition, we study and reveal the principles of evolutionary method improvements and convergence and devise a deep reinforcement learning-based multiobjective particle swarm optimization method to obtain the Pareto Set. The Set maximizes/minimizes the down/crossrange of a vehicle and comprises a series of end positions to define the reachable area. The reachable area is then employed to rapid vehicle trajectory recomputation. Finally, we validate our algorithm through numerical simulations analyze the results for future improvements.},

However, unexpected failures within this system during braking could potentially lead to accidents. To address this concern, we propose an integrated safe replanning and motion control framework to mitigate collision risks in the event of braking failures. Unlike previous fault-tolerant control works, the steering system is intervened to eliminate failure risks instead of re-configuring the braking torque; therefore, the longitudinal driving risks can be lessened from the lateral perspective. To achieve this approach, firstly, a risk assessment function with a failure factor is constructed to reconsider the driving target. Then, the driving target position and surrounding obstacle information are incorporated into one novel integral heuristic barrier Lyapunov function to reformulate the motion replanning and tracking problems as one yaw angle tracking problem. After, a novel barrier function-based sliding mode controller is introduced to ensure the yaw angle tracking performance within constraints. In this paper, decision-making, motion planning, and tracking tasks are incorporated into one analytical solution framework uniformly.Additionally, the prescribed time stability of our strategy ensures an upper bound setting time, indicating stability before the ego vehicle stop completly. Finally, numerous simulation results are carried out to confirm the effectiveness and superiority of our strategy in circumventing the troubles of braking system failures.},

We use average nonlinear age (ANA) to measure data freshness and study linear, squared and exponential penalty functions. We prove that the zero-wait sampling, the uniform quantization, and the ANA-optimal coding policies together provide an asymptotically optimal solution, in the sense that, as the average distortion approaches zero, the solution achieves the minimum ANA asymptotically, for the linear and squared penalty functions. When the probability density function (pdf) is weakly unimodal, we also prove that the zero-wait sampling, the K-L quantization which is asymptotically optimal for the quantization with Rényi entropy constraint, and the ANA-optimal coding policies are asymptotically optimal for the exponential penalty function. Furthermore, we prove that the optimal ANA is asymptotically linear with respect to the log MSE distortion with a slope of $-\frac{3}{4}$, $-\sqrt{\frac{7}{12}}$ and $-1$, corresponding to the linear, squared and exponential penalty functions, respectively.},

The complementary antenna features a wide impedance bandwidth of 56.5%, covering from 6.07 to 10.85 GHz, and the profile height of the proposed structure is 0.165λ0 at the operating frequency of 8.46 GHz. In addition to its broadband and tilted radiation performances, the antenna can generate four switchable tilted beams in different directions to cover the entire hemispheric space. Measured results show that a gain of 7.89 dBi is achieved. Compared to available works, the proposed antenna demonstrates a notable bandwidth improvement, making it a preferable candidate for future intelligent wireless communication.},

  abstract     = {Improved advancements in 5G communication and intelligent connected vehicle technologies have accelerated the implementation of intelligent transportation systems. Intelligent vehicles, roadside devices, and open wireless communication networks collectively expand the vulnerability landscape of intelligent transportation system (ITS) security, thereby increasing the potential exposure to security risks. Nonetheless, mobile vehicles require frequent authentication with Roadside Units (RSUs), which in turn results in substantial computational and communication overhead. Consequently, this approach leads to performance bottlenecks in resource-constrained On-Board Units (OBUs). In this paper, we are concerned with a lattice-based certificateless secure data transmission scheme for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) based on Blockchain. The proposed protocol incorporates identity authentication functionality and effectively integrates the cross-domain authentication characteristics of the Blockchain. Initially, the Trusted Authority (TA) uploads the registration information of vehicles onto the Blockchain to verify the authenticity of a vehicle&#39;s identity by examining the data stored in the Blockchain. When Roadside Units securely collect authenticated transactions and message transmission traffic, the integrity of the messages is ensured through the utilization of the lattice-based signcryption algorithm as part of a block. Subsequently, according to the data transmission algorithm, these partial blocks are transformed into complete blocks and disseminated across the entire network. The complete blocks were subsequently mined using a consensus algorithm that incorporated a voting mechanism. Furthermore, the security of the proposed protocol is rigorously proven by employing a random oracle model. Finally, the efficiency of the data transmission algorithm was rigorously evaluated under the Barabasi-Albert BA (3) and Erdos-Renyi ER (0,1) models, ensuring its effectiveness in various network topologies.},

In this paper, both Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) and polarized Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) channel measurements are conducted in an IIoT scenario at the less congested Wi-Fi band, i.e., 5.5 GHz. The purpose is to investigate wireless characteristics of communications between access points and terminals mounted on automated guided vehicles as well as those surrounding manufacturing areas. For SISO channel measurements, statistical properties including the delay Power Spectral Density (PSD), path loss, shadowing fading, delay spread, excess delay, K-factor, and amplitude distribution of small-scale fading are analyzed and compared with those observed in an office scenario. For MIMO channel measurements, results show that there are multiple Dense Multipath Component (DMC) processes in the delay PSD. An estimation algorithm based on the algorithm for a single DMC process is proposed to effectively process the multi-processes data. Moreover, delay, angular, power, and polarization properties of DMCs are investigated and compared with those of specular multipath components. Furthermore, effects of DMCs on Singular Values (SVs) and channel capacities are explored. Ignoring DMCs can overestimate SVs and underestimate channel capacities.},

  abstract     = {Positioning with fifth-generation (5G) new radio (NR) signals is promising, particularly in areas where the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) is blocked. However, the design of the receiver for 5G NR signals is challenging by the presence of multipath in indoor and urban environments, especially for time-of-arrival (TOA) tracking. In this paper, we propose a signal parameter estimation method for 5G NR that utilizes the estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques (ESPRIT) and the state space model to achieve signal parameter estimation. First, the ESPRIT is employed as the delay and phase discriminator, and a path selection criterion based on amplitude is proposed to avoid outliers in ESPRIT estimation caused by overestimating the channel order based on the minimum description length (MDL) criterion. Then, the state space model is used for carrier phase and Doppler frequency estimation, and the measurement matrix based on the phase error of the ESPRIT discriminator is derived. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is tested in an indoor environment containing a commercial small cell base station (BS). The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the DLL and ESPRIT, with a pseudorange estimation root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.63m. Therefore, the proposed method in this article has essential reference significance for promoting and commercializing 5G indoor positioning.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is considered as one of the revolutionary technologies for sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication as it can be adapted to assist communication systems by adaptively manipulating the propagation environment and greatly expanding network coverage. In this case, the aerial IRS (AIRS)-assisted communications have unique advantages, such as more flexible deployment and wider service coverage. However, accurate channel modeling of AIRS-assisted system is challenging due to mobility. In this paper, we propose a novel geometry-based three-dimensional (3D) wideband channel model for AIRS-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems, where the rotational degrees of freedom in three directions and the arbitrary trajectory of AIRS in space are specially considered. Firstly, a novel geometry-based 3D channel model that considers the realistic motion trajectory of UAVs in reality is proposed. The scatterers in the environment are modeled as different clusters set to simulate the frequency-selective fading caused by multipath effects. Secondly, a space-time-related cluster visibility algorithm based on the birth-death process is developed to characterize the non-stationarity introduced by the mobility of AIRS. Based on the model, the channel impulse responses (CIRs) and the corresponding statistical characteristic functions are derived. Finally, we investigate and analyze the impacts of different AIRS trajectories on channel statistical characteristics, such as the space-time correlation function, Doppler power spectral density, and channel capacity. Meanwhile, the influence of non-ideal AIRS on the channel is discussed, including discrete phase design and discrete time reflection phase. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model can accurately capture the channel properties, which therefore provides valuable insights for future development of AIRS for 6G systems.},

This paper presents a diffusion model-based data augmentation for enhanced vehicular network applications. The existing data augmentation techniques fail to modify the semantics of the images in the dataset. Addressing this, we propose a diffusion-based model for effective data augmentation. The augmentation technique involves feeding a randomly generated prompt (covering several image features like weather, lighting, background, visibility, and surface) along with canny edge features of an existing image to a diffusion model to generate an image with desired features. We used a vision-based accident detection dataset and a MobileNet-based deep learning model to understand the efficacy of the proposed data augmentation technique. Our experimental analysis indicates the proposed data augmentation technique improves the performance notably (3%).},

First, a dynamic model for the multiple-point levitation module of a maglev vehicle is established. Considering the actuator drive redundancy, the mode matrix is given for each possible fault. Next, based on each fault mode, the corresponding control signal is designed to ensure the stability and asymptotic tracking performance of the system, and the multi-controller set is formed. Then, the control switching mechanism is designed to select the most appropriate controller to generate control signals.

  abstract     = {As network and autonomous driving technologies rapidly advance, traffic flow prediction has become a crucial area of research. It plays a significant role in optimizing urban traffic management and enhancing road safety, drawing increasing attention from researchers. As a specific form of time-series data, traffic flow data is often used in prediction tasks utilizing large language models. Recent developments in graph data and improvements in graph neural networks have led researchers to employ methods like adjacency and Laplacian matrices for addressing relational issues among distant nodes. However, most existing methods focus on enhancing prediction performance through network architectures or using adaptive matrices to capture spatiotemporal relationships, with limited exploration into the impact of input embedding. This paper introduces an innovative approach to traffic flow prediction, the ASTRformer, which emphasizes the fusion of spatial and temporal information in historical data through an adaptive spatio-temporal relation learning mechanism. This mechanism integrates feature embedding with adaptive spatial and temporal embeddings. A learnable spatio-temporal fusion network then parameterizes these embeddings, producing the input representations. Subsequently, a transformer model captures these representations to predict future traffic flows. Experimental results on six datasets demonstrate that our method effectively captures spatio-temporal dependencies, achieving state-of-the-art performance across various prediction metrics.},

  abstract     = {The integration of video monitoring and intelligent applications in intelligent transportation and pedestrian navigation has sparked concerns regarding privacy protection. Person re-identification, a key application, utilizes deep learning models to manage traffic efficiently and guide pedestrians. However, this technology raises privacy issues. Existing de-identification methods, such as blurring or pixelation, compromise the realism of crucial pedestrian attributes for identification, and often overlook the importance of identity restoration and person attributes required by law enforcement. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Attribute-Consistency Reversible Pedestrian De-Identification (ACRPD) framework. ACRPD comprises three main processes: attribute-level contrastive learning, cross-view pedestrian anonymization generation, and raw pedestrian image recovery. Attribute-level contrastive learning ensures consistency in attributes between anonymized pedestrian images, using a predictor trained on attribute labels like ID, gender, age, and clothing. The cross-view pedestrian anonymization generation module employs attribute transformation and adversarial training to generate anonymized images while preserving important attribute information and removing ID details. For reversibility, a raw pedestrian image recovery stage reconstructs original images from anonymized ones, ensuring compatibility with authorized scenarios. Extensive experiments on two person reidentification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ACRPD, achieving average 12.1% and 5.0% rank-1 accuracies on Market and MSMT17 datasets respectively. ACRPD successfully maintains attribute consistency while safeguarding privacy-sensitive ID information, offering a promising solution for privacy protection in intelligent transportation and pedestrian navigation applications.},

However, the different modality information is inhomogeneous, multimodal 3D object detection still has challenges, such as difficult semantic alignment of modal elements and inadequate fusion. To mitigate these challenges, we first propose the sparse interaction with centroid query (SICQ) for voxel-level features from different modalities, which aligns different modal semantic information through more precise and fine-grained interaction. Then, we propose the dense fusion with multi-scale masked attention (DFMMA), using multi-scale feature masks from bird&#39;s-eye-view (BEV)-level multimodal features to improve performance for small object feature perception. Finally, we propose the multimodal grid encoder with positional information (MGEPI), through positional information implicitly guiding and the transformer-based attention mechanism for grid-level features, improves the perception of detection scene context spatial information and enhances the robustness of the algorithm. Additionally, this paper performs comprehensive experiments on the popular KITTI dataset and demonstrates that our algorithm has superior 3D object detection performance.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents an innovative large model framework for optimizing the task offloading efficiency in vehicular edge networks, with a focus on ultra-reliable low-latency communication. We introduce a comprehensive model that integrates quantum computing with a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model, supported by long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and a digital twin framework. This integration is designed to address the complexities of distributed vehicular edge computing networks, targeting efficient latency, energy, and quality-of-service management. Our model utilizes the parallel processing capabilities of quantum computing to enhance the DRL algorithm, effectively handling high-dimensional decision spaces. LSTM networks provide predictive insights into future network states in a digital twin framework and ensure real-time synchronization and adaptive strategy optimization. We employ a multi-agent framework, encompassing vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles, and base stations, each utilizing a Nash equilibrium-based strategy for optimal decision-making, supplemented by incentive and penalty functions for reward optimization. Simulation results demonstrate notable improvements in task offloading efficiency, highlighting the model&#39;s efficacy over conventional DRL models.},

However, due to cost constraints, most sensor nodes are unable to obtain their own location information, making determining the location of unknown sensor nodes a critical issue. This paper aims to address three key issues in WSNs: accurate positioning accuracy, high positioning coverage, and minimizing energy consumption. Therefore, we model the coverage control problem of WSNs as a multi-objective programming problem and propose a Multi-Objective Whale Optimization Algorithm (MOWOA) based on reverse elite retention and Levy mutation. Our proposed algorithm combines reverse learning strategies and improves congestion calculation, adds learning rates and external solution set strategies, and combines a non-dominated sorting method based on reference points. Experimental results show that MOWOA can provide higher-quality non-dominated solutions, select suitable node locations, and optimize their performance metrics.},

The vehicle routing problem based on waste classification for collection and transportation (C&amp;T) has garnered increasing attention as a typical issue within this system. Given the diverse nature of waste types and the need to organize multiple vehicles to service collection points, congestion often arises due to simultaneous vehicle operations or queuing, posing a significant challenge. To address this, our study introduces asynchronous constraints on vehicle operations to mitigate congestion. Furthermore, building upon the separate loading and unified loading waste C&amp;T models, a combined C&amp;T model grounded in waste classification is devised. We propose an enhanced ant colony optimization algorithm to solve this intricate problem and validate its efficacy. Experimental findings reveal that, compared to both separate and unified schemes, the proposed combined model yields respective reductions of 5.38% and 2.75% in C&amp;T costs. Meanwhile, the comprehensiveness of the combined model has been demonstrated through other experiments, providing a reference for the improvement and optimization of garbage classification C&amp;T schemes.},

The objective of this article is to analyze the safety issues of human electromagnetic exposure containing implants in the electric vehicle wireless power transfer (EV-WPT). This article establishes an adult male human model with a coronary artery stent and hip joint implant and is exposed to the leakage magnetic field of an EV-WPT system. The EV-WPT system has a transmission power of 30 kW and a working frequency of 85 kHz. Fully considering the uncertainty of human exposure to the electromagnetic environment of the EV-WPT system, such as the distance between the human body and the EV-WPT system, the distance between the EV-WPT system coils, and the parameters of the compensation circuit, this article uses Bayesian Neural Networks to evaluate human electromagnetic safety. Bayesian neural networks can obtain accurate results with fewer training sets and have higher computational efficiency. The results showed that the probability of electromagnetic exposure levels significantly exceeding the standard limit in the human body with hip joint implants was almost 100%, while the probability of exceeding the standard limit in the human heart with coronary artery stents did not exceed 31.5%. Patients with medical implants may need to limit power when using the EV-WPT system.},

Firstly, we introduce a reputation value considering factors like time and model loss. This value guides our incentive mechanism, which encourages high-quality data-seeking clients to join the training process. Secondly, we implement an auction mechanism that allows clients to auction local training tasks to fog nodes, improving efficiency, and addressing performance imbalances. Thirdly, we integrate lightweight cryptographic primitive Oblivious Transfer (OT) into gradient sharing to protect vehicle privacy.

Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technology can provide a multitude number of communication services between vehicles and Roadside Units (RSUs), making vehicle cooperative caching a viable solution. Nevertheless, for new energy vehicles such as electric ones, how to reduce the energy consumption of the vehicle network system remains a formidable challenge. Additionally, the task delay of vehicle cooperative caching can also be further reduced. In this paper, a clustering caching model is proposed by considering constraints for tolerable delay of tasks and the residence time of vehicles, and the kinetic energy recovery scheme of vehicles and the Energy Harvesting (EH) mechanism of RSUs are designed to reduce the system energy consumption. Terahertz (THz) communication is employed in vehicle to vehicle (V2V) to accelerate the completion of tasks. Subsequently, the energy consumption optimization problem for the vehicle cooperative caching system is constructed. Furthermore, the continuity and high-dimensionality properties of the decision variables for the optimization problem are analyzed, and we propose the joint Download Size and Bandwidth Allocation (DSBA) algorithm to explore an approximate optimal solution for task decomposition and resource allocation in the high-dynamic environment. We also propose an algorithm named Vehicle Cache Content Recommendation (VCCR) to avoid the additional delay and the waste of energy caused by the vehicle user cache miss-hit problem.

Recently, UAVs have been used as flying relays to support terrestrial cellular networks for enhancing coverage and connectivity. Multiple UAVs serve as data collectors at a common altitude in a UAV-aided Internet of Things (IoT) network. Data collected is processed by Federated Learning (FL) before being sent to central servers to protect users&#39; privacy and reduce communication costs. Batteries in UAVs are tiny and efficient only for a short duration, making FL challenging to execute for many iterations. Therefore, a Multi-UAV Energy Efficient Coverage Deployment algorithm based on a Spatial Adaptive Play (MUECD-SAP) is proposed in this article. MUECD uses a modified Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to optimize the accurate location of deployed UAVs based on the Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SINR) to increase the data collection rate. Also, to make the FL run for multiple iterations, SAP dynamically allocates resources using Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) to optimize the energy consumed and the link latency between the user and the UAV system. The proposed MUECD algorithm outperforms all the state-of-the-art algorithms by achieving an improved data rate and balanced SINR value. The proposed SAP resource allocation strategy has improved the FL execution by 66.67% and attains a very low latency and energy consumed compared to other resource allocation techniques.},

Due to stochastic EV charging behaviour, high charging demand at charging stations (CSs) elevates the load curve which may lead to a spatially imbalanced load demand. As such, forecasting the highly stochastic EV charging load considering an individual EV&#39;s unique charging behaviour can result in maintaining safe operation of the grid and distribution network. Therefore, in this work, we propose Block-FeDL, a blockchain-based Federated Learning (FL) approach for EV charging load forecasting considering private and sensitive charging information of each EV user. Thereafter, we use a Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) model within FeDL for predicting EV charging load patterns at each client. Moreover, instead of using a centralized server for global model aggregation, we use blockchain technology, where model aggregation is performed in a decentralized manner and local model parameters shared by FL clients can be validated and securely recorded. Lastly, the results show that Block-FeDL outperforms the second-best baseline method by 95%, 96%, and 77% in terms of mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE) for forecasting EV charging load.},

The deployed IoV devices allow traffic participants to generate and analyze the traffic information such as driving status and road condition. They can further share the collected traffic data through the centralized cloud service to improve road operation efficiency, safety and reduce economic losses. Storing sensitive traffic data in an untrusted cloud server, however, raises the requirement of data access control to protect valuable business issues. Unfortunately, using pure cryptographic access control schemes for traffic data faces several limitations. In this paper, we first develop a pure cryptographic construction to enforce attribute-based access control (ABAC) model in untrusted cloud for IoV system based on ciphertext policy-attribute based encryption (CP-ABE) and explore three limitations of it. By studying ABAC in the context of CP-ABE, we can effectively lower-bound the costs that would be incurred when using more advanced and more expensive predicate encryption schemes. We then propose a new attribute based access control system (AACS) for cloud-aided IoV system to overcome the barriers of CP-ABE by using trusted hardware (Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX)). AACS uses a secure data division framework to achieve a small Trusted Computing Base (TCB) and integrates SGX with several cryptographic protocols as well as optimization techniques. We comprehensively evaluate AACS to show the design advantages of it.},

Instead of instance-level contrastive learning, SPCC retains the useful representations selectively under the guidance of the superpixel subregion. The proposed framework treats each sample as a view for its belonged cluster and learns cluster-level semantic representations. SPCC enhances the separability of samples by employing contrastive loss, which proves effective for vehicle detection tasks. Extensive experiments are designed to obtain competitive results for the popular clustering methods on three Hyperspectral image datasets. The experimental results indicate that SPCC performs well in both hyperspectral image clustering and vehicle recognition tasks.},

  abstract     = {Numerous efforts have been made to improve intersection operations under signal-free control enabled by connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). However, vehicle crossing paths in existing literature primarily followed conventional geometric design. The performance of unconventional intersections with alternative conflict layouts under signal-free control remains a knowledge gap. To address this problem, we model the operations of three unconventional (signal-free) autonomous intersections and compare their operational performance with one conventional autonomous intersection. Results show that unconventional vehicle crossing paths at intersections are likely to reduce vehicle delay and fuel consumption compared with conventional intersections in most scenarios. Three crucial intersection layout factors, i.e. the number of conflicts, the distance between conflicting points, and the conflict angle, are investigated, which provides new insights into the mechanism of the performance change of unconventional intersections under the CAV environment. Our analysis suggests vehicle path design offers new space for operational performance enhancement of autonomous intersections.},

This study addresses this challenge by leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) based hybrid dispatching framework for formulating dispatching strategies, where the need for commonsense understanding by EV drivers is paramount. This paper proposes a framework LLM-D3PG, LLM-guided dual Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient, which empowers EV drivers to articulate their expectations for AI-generated dispatching strategies using natural language instructions. These instructions serve as guidance for the generation of dispatching strategies within complex distributed network scenarios. According to this strategy, the proposed framework seamlessly integrates the decision-making capabilities of LLM with multiple D3PG models to generate a large number of candidate dispatching strategies and then uses the whale optimization algorithm to optimize these strategies to achieve better dispatching results. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and show outperformance in comparison to some existing methods for power dispatching tasks with the random connection of EVs in SAGVNs.},

However, how to flexibly allocate computing tasks within vehicles and efficiently manage the resources consumed by tasks has emerged as a challenge. To tackle this issue, this research advances the proposition of employing an auxiliary vehicle (AV) for task offloading and introduces a novel Auxiliary Vehicle Algorithm (AVA). AVA integrates both federated learning and multi-agent reinforcement learning to fully utilize computing resources in the vehicular environment, and simultaneously achieves task delay reduction, energy consumption minimization, and task completion rate augmentation. Moreover, we establish a federated learning framework to judiciously determine the proportion of resource allocation of AV through the implementation of inventive mechanisms. Experiment results validate that our approach not only leads to the improvement of key system performance indicators, but also ensures the comprehensive exploitation of the computing resources of mobile vehicles.},

These advancements in VANETs play a critical role in enhancing traffic management systems, promoting collision prevention, bolstering road safety, and efficiently handling emergency scenarios. Modern vehicles, equipped with advanced data collection tools, accumulate extensive information encompassing vehicle health, fuel requirements, and comprehensive location histories. This rich data repository is instrumental in forecasting future destinations and facilitating timely arrangements, embodying the essence of ambient intelligence within the Internet of Things (IoT) framework. In emergency contexts, the rapid analysis of vehicle data is crucial for identifying the nearest emergency facilities. This paper proposes an innovative approach that leverages machine learning and edge computing techniques to predict vehicles&#39; subsequent locations using large-scale data, concurrently prioritizing user privacy. We employ federated learning for processing at the network&#39;s edge and integrate a blockchain-based distributed database to ensure robust data privacy and security. The application of blockchain and federated learning in training models on expansive datasets is particularly effective in estimating the proximity to medical facilities and emergency services. Furthermore, this study introduces an optimization method to monitor vehicle speed and outlines a comprehensive attack model, along with effective protection measures.

One of these scenarios can be formulated as an online continual learning (OCL) problem. That is, data come in an online fashion, and models are updated according to these streaming data. Two major OCL challenges are catastrophic forgetting and data imbalance. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose an Analytic Exemplar-Free Online Continual Learning algorithm (AEF-OCL). The AEF-OCL leverages analytic continual learning principles and employs ridge regression as a classifier for features extracted by a large backbone network. It solves the OCL problem by recursively calculating the analytical solution, ensuring an equalization between the continual learning and its joint-learning counterpart, and works without the need to save any used samples (i.e., exemplar-free). Additionally, we introduce a Pseudo-Features Generator (PFG) module that recursively estimates the mean and the variance of real features for each class. It over-samples offset pseudo-features from the same normal distribution as the real features, thereby addressing the data imbalance issue. Experimental results demonstrate that despite being an exemplar-free strategy, our method outperforms various methods on the autonomous driving SODA10M dataset.},

Incorporating artificial intelligence and machine learning, these LMs are poised to revolutionize various aspects of transportation. This paper proposes LMs-based approaches for cooperative control and coordination of connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) fleets. Specifically, algorithms based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) are developed for distributed optimization of CAV trajectories. The synchronous ADMM and asynchronous ADMM algorithms enable parallelized coordination of large-scale CAV systems. Simultaneously, we propose a distributed training scheme where each CAV trains its cost and dynamics networks on simulators local to each vehicle. A central coordinator interacts with the vehicles to tune the coupling networks. Then, we introduce an innovative car-following model named the integrated velocity and acceleration fusion model that integrates state information from multiple lead and following vehicles to determine the optimal acceleration for the subject CAV. While we utilize graph sample and aggregate –based neural network and the gated recurrent unit and propose a model for recognizing driving intentions and predicting the trajectories of surrounding vehicles based on these theories. Simulation results demonstrate enhanced traffic efficiency, safety, robustness, and scalability using LMs for cooperative control of CAV.},

  abstract     = {3D object detection in autonomous driving systems perceives the surrounding environment and is the foundation for autonomous driving. Due to the sparsity inherent in point clouds in autonomous driving scenarios, LiDAR-based 3D object detection often fails to distinguish distant objects effectively. Addressing the issue of point cloud sparsity will enhance the detection range in autonomous driving scenarios. Pseudo point clouds have been used to enhance the ability of deep learning models to detect distant points. However, this approach has several shortcomings. In this paper, a curbed fake point collector (CFPC), which addresses the three issues caused by pseudo points, is proposed to support 3D object detection for autonomous vehicles. First, for noise points with inaccurate coordinates, the dead pixel checker (DPC) calculates the depth map gradient using the Sobel operator. This approach enables the deep learning model to identify noise points. Second, because of the excessive quantity of points, sparse prioritized local sampling (SPLS) reduces the number of input point clouds to a lightweight level that can be accommodated by computing devices with limited memory. This is achieved through grid-based random sampling and real-point-prioritized farthest point sampling. This module effectively samples an appropriate pseudo point cloud based on the density of points in local space. Third, with respect to interference among channels, channel mask set abstraction (CMSA) isolates channels describing different information within the point cloud using GroupMLP, which is an MLP that separates channels into their respective groups. Group separation facilitates the extraction of features without mutual influence, allocating half of the output channels to color information and the other half to geometric information. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by the results of experiments conducted on the KITTI dataset. It is superior to the baseline in most situations, particularly in the categories of cars and riders.},

  abstract     = {The traditional vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) gradually evolved into the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), which has also become a potential target for attacks and faces security challenges in an open network environment. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) based on machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) are introduced to mitigate security threats. However, existing ML/DL-based IDS suffer from challenges in IoV environments. First, due to the limitations of ML/DL-based methods, classification performance is unsatisfactory when they extract only unidirectional contextual features or spatial characteristics. Second, existing research on in-vehicle network IDS often limits validation and testing to a static dataset of a single vehicle model. This approach may not adequately address diverse potential attacks in a dynamic environment. Third, few studies of hybrid IDS can simultaneously implement in-vehicle and extra-vehicle network intrusion detection. Large language models (LLM) have shown outstanding applications in fields such as natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). In particular, bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) obtain new state-of-the-art results on eleven famous NLP tasks. Consequently, this paper introduces a hybrid network IDS in IoV utilising LLM, denoted as IoV-BERT-IDS. This framework encompasses four modules: semantic extractor (SE), input embedding, IoV-BERT-IDS pre-training, and IoV-BERT-IDS fine-tuning. To conform to the BERT model, the semantic extractor is introduced to transform traffic data devoid of apparent semantics into contextual semantics, comprising bidirectional and unidirectional SE. Through SE, controller area network (CAN) data is transformed into a CAN byte sentence (CBS), while extra-vehicle network traffic data is transformed into a traffic byte sentence (TBS). Additionally, two pre-training tasks, the masked byte word model (MBWM) and next byte sentence prediction (NBSP) are proposed to acquire bidirectional contextual features from contextual semantics. These features can be adapted to downstream tasks in both in-vehicle and extra-vehicle networks through fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate that IoV-BERT-IDS outperforms in CICIDS, BoT-IoT, Car-Hacking, and In-vehicle network intrusion detection challenge (IVN-IDS) datasets and shows good generalisation capabilities to in-vehicle networks of different vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have been applied to the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) to provide convenience services such as traffic flow prediction. However, concerns regarding privacy and security are on the rise as huge amounts of data are aggregated to form large models (LMs). Although federated learning (FL), which trains and updates a model without sharing the actual datasets, has been intensively researched to prevent privacy breaches, there are still potential security threats like a single point of failure and intentional tampering with malicious data. This is because of the vulnerability of a central curator and a lack of authentication. As participants, they (i.e., vehicles) may unintentionally update low-quality data caused by poor wireless connectivity, unstable availability, and insufficient training datasets. They may also intentionally update unreliable data to carry out poisoning attacks. The divergence among local models, trained on non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data, can slow convergence and diminish model accuracy when these models are aggregated. Therefore, it is important to carefully select trustworthy participants. In this paper, we propose a new reliable and secure federated learning for IoV based on decentralized blockchain and reputation management. To cope with a single point of failure, injection of malicious data, and lack of authentication while ensuring privacy and traceability, our scheme combines blockchain and a lightweight digital signature. Moreover, we employ the concept of the reputation of vehicles to select suitable participants with reliability, ultimately improving accuracy. Security analysis results, including comparisons with previous works, prove that the proposed scheme can address security concerns. The results of performance evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular networks have huge potential to improve road safety and traffic efficiency, especially in the context of large models. Cloud computing can significantly improve the performance of vehicular networks, and the concept of cloud-assisted vehicular networks comes into being. Reputation management plays a crucial role in vehicular networks, since it can help each vehicle evaluate the trustworthiness of the other vehicles and the received messages. Reputation updating is essential in reputation management and it is usually done by the Trusted Authority (TA) regularly after collecting, decrypting, and verifying a large number of reputation feedbacks, which leads to great computation and communication overheads on the TA side and even makes the TA become the bottleneck of reputation management system. In this paper, we propose a novel Privacy-Preserving Reputation Updating (PPRU) scheme for cloud-assisted vehicular networks based on the Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and Paillier algorithms, in which the reputation feedbacks are collected and preprocessed by the honest-but-curious Cloud Service Provider (CSP) in a privacy-preserving manner, and the computation and communication overheads on the TA side can be dramatically reduced by about 88.36% and 83.88% as a result, respectively. Meanwhile, the proposed scheme can provide strong privacy preservation, strong security, and robust reputation management with acceptable computation and communication overheads. Furthermore, the comprehensive theoretical analysis and simulation evaluation are conducted, and the results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is significantly superior to the existing schemes in several aspects.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, concomitant with the rapid advancements in large models (LMs) technologies within the field of artificial intelligence (AI), the domain of intelligent Internet of Vehicles (IoV) network has also experienced swift progress. Those potential applications such as autonomous driving, intelligent driver assistance systems, personalized driver experience, and traffic flow and urban mobility management are dependent on the excellent IoV wireless communications system. However, there still exist many fundamental challenges when involving LMs into IoV network. How to provide effective coverage for intervening massive heterogeneous terminals in complex dynamic wireless network environments is a challenging problem. Besides, the generalization and robustness of beamforming within various scenarios are the fundamental for IoV applications mentioned above. To address the aforementioned issues, we in this paper formulate and integrate LMs to achieve excellent hybrid beamforming within IoV wireless communications system which is aided by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and base stations (BSs) to provide additional channels and coverage gains. Benefiting from RISs, wireless channels become complex and reconstructable, thus providing the possibility of creating LMs based hybrid beamforming. The proposed LMs are formulated by utilizing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to effectively interact with environments so that robust beamforming can be maintained within RIS aided IoV network. Finally, we exploit the excellent performance of LMs enabled hybrid beamforming and investigate the impact of critical learning parameters. Comprehensive experimental results have consistently confirmed that the proposed LMs enabled hybrid beamforming for RIS aided IoV outperforms traditional schemes in the respect of system throughput and network coverage under dynamic wireless environments.},

  abstract     = {In order to address the data security and communication efficiency of vehicles during high-speed mobile communication, this paper investigates the problem of secure in-vehicle communication resource allocation based on slow-variable large-scale fading channel information, to meet the quality of service requirements of vehicular communication, i.e., to ensure the reliability of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication and the time delay while maximizing the transmission rate of the cellular link. And an eavesdropping model is introduced to ensure the secure delivery of link information. Considering that the high mobility of vehicles causes rapid channel changes, we model the problem as a Markov decision process and propose a resource allocation optimization framework based on the Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Algorithm (MARL-DDQN), in which a large-scale neural network model is built to train vehicular to learn the optimal resource allocation strategy for optimal communication performance and security performance. Simulation results show that the load successful delivery rate and confidentiality performance of the vehicular communication network are effectively improved compared to the baseline and MADDPG strategies while ensuring link security. This study provides useful references and practical value for the optimization of secure communication resource allocation in vehicular networking.},

  abstract     = {The advancement of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) significantly relies on the integration of Internet-of-Things technology for real-time data processing and decision-making. Object detection, a critical component of AVs, necessitates utilizing machine learning techniques. However, this poses challenges including data privacy and the inefficiency of transmitting large volumes of data to a central server. To overcome these challenges, we employ Federated Learning (FL), which allows local devices to train a global model without sharing their raw data. While effective, synchronous federated learning can be time-consuming due to stragglers and often encounter device dropout issues. In contrast, asynchronous federated learning provides faster updates but frequently yields sub-optimal models compared to its synchronous counterpart. Motivated by that, in this paper, we introduce a novel FL framework that combines the strengths of both synchronous and asynchronous methods. Further, by organizing devices into a hierarchical structure, we aim to optimize model convergence while mitigating straggler and dropout problems. Moreover, deploying large models on local edge devices is impractical due to limited computational capabilities, necessitating the adoption of lightweight models to mitigate prolonged training and prediction duration. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we conduct a series of experiments using publicly available datasets and subsequently compare the results. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances the model convergence and performance in object detection for AVs.},
