  abstract     = {In this article, we investigate the event-triggered consensus control approaches for multiple single-link flexible manipulators formulated by partial differential equations with time-varying boundary disturbances. By designing an event triggering mechanism based on switching thresholds, the controller can only be updated after the trigger conditions are met, thereby avoiding the waste of network resources. Under local communication conditions, a finite-time distributed observer is constructed to estimate the leader state of a flexible manipulator. Fuzzy logic systems are applied to identify unmodeled dynamics. Disturbance observers are designed to estimate mixed perturbations consisting of disturbances and estimation errors. Moreover, the proposed control method can ensure that all signals in the closed-loop system are bounded, the elastic deflection of each flexible manipulator can be suppressed, the angle achieves consensus control, and Zeno behavior is avoided. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed theory is verified by numerical examples.},

Fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) are utilized to identify the unknown nonlinear dynamics of QUAV, and a fuzzy state observer is devised to estimate immeasurable states. By using the command filter, the problem of “explosion of complexity” is successfully averted, meanwhile the influence of filtered error is eliminated by way of the fractional power error compensation mechanism. The issue of singularity is effectively tackled by the hyperbolic tangent function&#39;s property and L&#39;Hospital&#39;s rule. A predefined-time performance function is inserted into the control scheme to ensure that the tracking errors are restricted to the preassigned performance bounds. It is strictly proven that the closed-loop system is practically predefined-time stable, and the position and attitude tracking errors are driven into a small region around zero in a predefined time. Finally, a comparative simulation example is provided to show the validity and superiority of the proposed predefined-time adaptive control algorithm.},

Since the communication between agents is affected by time-varying delay and some agents cannot access the leader&#39;s information under jointly connected switching topology, a communication-delay-related distributed formation observer is designed to estimate the leader&#39;s information and simultaneously mitigate the effects of communication delays. By using fuzzy logic systems to approximate the unknown functions, the controlled uncertain NMASs are transformed into the strict-feedback parameterized NMASs. Then, based on the designed communication-delay-related distributed formation observer and the backstepping control design theory, a fuzzy adaptive formation control algorithm is proposed. By constructing the Lyapunov functions, it is proved that the designed communication-delay-related distributed formation observer errors converge to zero exponentially and the proposed distributed fuzzy formation control algorithm can ensure that the closed-loop systems are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded, with the formation tracking errors converging to an adjustable neighborhood around zero. Finally, we apply the distributed fuzzy formation control scheme to marine surface vehicles (MSV), the simulation results and comparisons with the previous control methods verify its effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {The clustering algorithm has always been a hot spot in machine learning, which has made great progress and been widely used in different scenarios. Due to the characteristics and requirements of some application scenarios, the branch of the balanced clustering algorithm has been developed. The ideal of these algorithms is to obtain clusters containing approximately the same number of samples. However, when there are data points distributed at the boundary of different clusters, resulting in different probabilities of their belonging, hard-partitioned balanced clustering may not be able to handle these boundary data well, thus limiting their performance. Motivated by this, we propose a Fuzzy Min-Cut with Soft Balancing Effects (FCBE) method in this article. Specifically, the FCBE model utilizes fuzzy constraints to simultaneously enhance the ability of the balanced algorithm to capture boundary data members and the advantage of directly obtaining the partitioning results of graph-cut problem without postprocessing. In addition, a sparse regularization is introduced to avoid trivial solutions and maintain the separability of the relationship matrix. Furthermore, the proposed FCBE method can be viewed as a flexibly adjustable generalization pattern that not only has clear interpretability but also can become special cases with clear physical meanings under different parameter values. The feasibility of FCBE has been verified on real datasets.},

One of the innovations of this article is the presentation of an adaptive input range fuzzy logic system (AFLS) with portability and adaptability, offering a novel approach for determining the input range of the FLS. The method effectively resolves the current dilemma of relying on a specific problem and model for determining the FLS input range. In addition, to enhance convergence speed and achieve predefined-time convergence of the fuzzy predefined-time robust zeroing neural network (FPRZNN) model, we introduce a novel segmental predefined-time robust activation function (SPRAF). Furthermore, three key theorems are proposed to prove the stability, convergence, and robustness of the FPRZNN model. Finally, the numerical simulations showcase the superior convergence and robustness of the FPRZNN model compared to other existing ZNN models.},

  abstract     = {Multiview anchor graph clustering has been a prominent research area in recent years, leading to the development of several effective and efficient methods. However, three challenges are faced by current multiview anchor graph clustering methods. First, real-world data often exhibit uncertainty and poor discriminability, leading to suboptimal anchor graphs when directly extracted from the original data. Second, most existing methods assume the presence of common information between views and primarily explore it for clustering, thus neglecting view-specific information. Third, further exploration and exploitation of the learned anchor graph to enhance clustering performance remains an open research question. To address these issues, a novel dual anchor graph fuzzy clustering method is proposed in this article. First, a novel matrix factorization-based dual anchor graph learning method is proposed to address the first two issues by extracting highly discriminative hidden representations for each view and subsequently deriving both common and specific anchor graphs from these hidden representations. Then, to address the third issue, a novel anchor graph fuzzy clustering method is developed with cooperative learning to exploit and utilize the common and specific anchor graphs fully. Meanwhile, a fuzzy membership structure preservation mechanism with dual anchor graphs is constructed to enhance clustering performance. Finally, negative Shannon entropy is further introduced to adaptively adjust the view weighing. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

However, these generalizations have a limited application to signals defined on domains with arbitrary geometry. To overcome this limitation, we propose using nonseparable membership functions induced by kernels, allowing the application of the F-transform to more general domains. We introduce a universal concept of a fuzzy partition that includes a kernel representation, a fuzzy partition, and the corresponding F-transform. In addition, we discuss the main properties of this generalized F-transform and characterize the nonlocal Laplace operator in terms of the F-transform. We also discuss image denoising as the main application and compare our results with state-of-the-art methods and different noise types and intensities.},

To overcome the above difficulty, we construct a novel composite observer based on the attack compensator, whereby the system states can be reconstructed. Moreover, with the help of the time-varying constraint function, the prescribed-time tracking control problem for nonlinear systems is transformed into the constraint problem of tracking error. At the same time, a new dynamic event-triggered adaptive prescribed-time safety fuzzy controller is built and remains applicable in the systems that operate continuously after the predefined time. The adaptive fuzzy safety control method proposed in this article ensures that the tracking error converges to the user-specified region in the predefined time, all signals of the closed-loop system remain bounded under intermittent DoS attacks, and the repeated transmission of samples from the controller to the actuator can be further reduced, generating fewer events and saving communication resources.

  abstract     = {In group decision-making (GDM), traditional consensus models have primarily focused on cardinal consensus. In reality, irrespective of whether the objective of GDM is to select the optimal alternative or to rank alternatives, it is imperative to establish a ranking that garners the utmost assent from all decision-makers (DMs). When preferences are articulated through fuzzy preference relations (FPRs), cardinal information emerges in numerical form, quantifying the degree of preference for alternatives, while ordinal relations are implicitly embedded within pairwise comparisons. To delve into both cardinal and ordinal consensus among DMs, this study introduces two consensus optimization models that strive to minimize adjustments to FPRs while fostering consensus in terms of preference intensity and ranking. To this end, we first propose two ordinal consensus measurement methods: one precisely discerns whether DMs have achieved consensus on the selection of the best alternative, while the other assesses the consistency of different preference rankings, taking into account the importance of positions. Based on these methods, two systems of inequalities are designed to explicitly govern both types of ordinal consensus. Subsequently, two consensus control rules are formulated, tailored to distinct objectives. These rules necessitate not only cardinal consensus among all DMs, but also their alignment in terms of either the selection of the best alternative or the preference ranking. Ultimately, these rules are integrated as constraints into two mixed-integer programming models aimed at minimizing preference adjustments. The proposed models have been applied in a case study, confirming their practicality, with thorough comparative analyses demonstrating their effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Selecting a compact and relevant feature subset for hybrid decision systems is a key task in decision-making. Fuzzy rough set (FRS) is an effective method for this purpose, but its space complexity can be a hindrance when dealing with large data sets. A scalable FRS-based feature subset selection framework, FDM-FMFRS, was proposed earlier. This framework integrates FRS with fuzzy min–max neural network (FMNN) as a preprocessing step to handle large datasets. FMNN model transforms object space into hyperbox space. However, its implementation requires all input variables to be numeric. One way to handle categorical data is to replace them with numerical values, but this method may define an unsuitable metric for the categories. This article presents an extended version of FDM-FMFRS, called Hybrid-FDM-FMFRS, which is applicable to both numeric and categorical variables by incorporating set-valued data for categorical attributes. A weighted set is presented to represent the frequency distribution of distinct categories within the hyperbox, helping to create set-valued data for categorical attributes and providing the proposed approach greater flexibility and broader applications on definite space. A comprehensive comparative analysis is conducted on hybrid benchmark datasets, and it is established that the proposed algorithm obtained relevant reduct while preserving satisfactory classification accuracy in much less computational time. In addition, the proposed approach retains the scalability benefits of FDM-FMRS, allowing it to handle large datasets where the compared algorithms fail to compute reducts.},

The proposed adaptive distributed FTC method is composed of a fuzzy feedforward output-feedback distributed FTC and a fuzzy error feedback distributed optimal controller. The fuzzy feedforward distributed FTC is designed by backstepping design technique and fuzzy state observer, which can solve unmeasured states problem of the agents and transform the strict-feedback nonlinear multiagent systems (MASs) into a linearizable feedback nonlinear MASs. The fuzzy distributed optimal controller is designed for the error nonlinear MASs based on adaptive dynamical programming to find a Nash equilibrium solution of the mutiplayer differential graphical game.

  abstract     = {Fuzzy rule-based models constructed in the presence of numeric data are nonlinear numeric models producing for any input some numeric output. There are no ideal models so the obtained numeric output could create a false illusion of achieved accuracy. A desirable approach is to augment the results with some measure of confidence (credibility) by admitting a granular rather than numeric format of the produced output values of the model. Our focus of this study is on fuzzy Takagi–Sugeno rule-based models whose conclusions are constant. The ultimate objective is to extend such models to the generalized granular structure with the conclusions formed as information granules. We study information granules described by intervals and fuzzy sets as well as probabilistic Gaussian information granules. The original design of the granular model is realized by involving the principle of justifiable granularity. Using this principle, we also show how to determine the equivalence between information granules. The construction of probabilistic information granules of the model is completed with the aid of optimized Gaussian process models. The granular models built in this way constitute a substantial and application-oriented departure from the numeric fuzzy models by offering a comprehensive insight into the quality of the produced results. The experimental studies based on synthetic and publicly available data demonstrate the design process and discuss the quality of the obtained results.},

  abstract     = {Motion planning, considered a fuzzy sequential decision-making problem, encounters significant challenges due to inherent environmental uncertainty. Traditional planning methods that rely on single strategies often struggle in complex scenarios. While fuzzy systems excel at handling uncertainty, high-dimensional continuous spaces require a large number of fuzzy rules, which significantly increases computational complexity. In contrast, humans leverage limited and fuzzy information to address various decision-making scenarios flexibly and efficiently. The concurrent reasoning mechanism in the prefrontal cortex plays a crucial role during this process. Consequently, the brain-inspired model and the concept of multiple fuzzy rules offer a novel perspective for the above issues. Motivated by these insights, this article proposes a brain-inspired motion planning method called harmonized learning with concurrent arbitration (HLCA). Specifically, inspired by the concurrent inference model, a concurrent arbitration module is employed in the planning process to effectively manage the boundary between exploration and exploitation. Furthermore, inspired by the multistrategy processing mechanism, HLCA introduces multistrategy harmonized learning by referring to the mechanism for operating multiple fuzzy rules, allowing the dynamic selection of strategies through a reliability function to enable self-improving learning. Experimental results demonstrate that HLCA outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, highlighting its potential to enhance the planning performance of robots by learning from the human brain.},

  abstract     = {As a low-cost cargo delivery manner, cable-suspended aerial transportation system is highly regarded by researchers. However, existing works seldom consider the relative distance adjustment between the payload and the multirotor, which greatly limits the application scope, such as tunnel traversing or payload releasing. In addition, treating the hook and the payload as a single point mass while ignoring the hook effect results in an inaccurate description of the dynamic model. To address the aforementioned problems, the dynamic model of the variable-length cable-suspended aerial transportation system is established accurately through Lagrange&#39;s equation with consideration of the motion of the multirotor, the payload, and the hook. Subsequently, an adaptive control method is presented through energy-based analysis, and swing angle related fuzzy rules are established to dynamically adjust the control parameters, which can simultaneously achieve multirotor positioning, payload hoisting/lowering, and hook/payload swing suppression. Moreover, the cable length is constrained within a feasible range by an elaborately designed auxiliary control signal. Lyapunov techniques and LaSalle&#39;s invariance theorem are utilized to prove the asymptotic convergence of the closed-loop system. Finally, a series of simulations are conducted to verify the control performance of the designed method.},

In the online control unit, the time-triggered way is first implemented to steer the system state into the TCS quickly, and then in the offline control unit, the involved event-triggered pattern plays its role in conserving resources while ensuring the control performance. Two offline optimization problems (OPs) are presented to design the TCS and the approximate robust one step sets, respectively, and an online OP is given to design the control laws to steer the system state into TCS. Based on these three OPs, we propose an MTEM-based multistep fuzzy MPC algorithm and demonstrate the feasibility of the algorithm together with the input-to-state stability of the closed-loop system.

Unlike existing research, the proposed SOFDOs effectively solve the coupled problem between parameter estimations caused by actuator faults and disturbance estimations. Then, the AFTC scheme is designed based on the Lyapunov direct method to guarantee the stability of the closed-loop system for the quadrotor UAV. In addition, since the chosen control parameters are selected based on stability concerns without considering performance optimization, a modified particle swarm optimization algorithm is introduced to optimize the design parameters of the proposed scheme.

  abstract     = {Fuzzy rule interpolation (FRI) has been successfully applied to address real-world problems where domain knowledge is incomplete, particularly in situations where observations do not directly match existing rules. However, most of the existing research focuses on fuzzy systems based on Mamdani models. Recently, a pioneering approach has been proposed for rule interpolation within Takagi–Sugeno–Kang (TSK) fuzzy models, employing two distinct techniques that cluster neighboring rules to facilitate interpolated outcomes. Although promising, these techniques have been developed through empirical methods, lacking formal representation and theoretical justification. This article formalizes such emerging empirical studies with the aim of strengthening the theoretical foundation of FRI. It introduces the location view of rules and rule bases regarding TSK models, analyzing the influence of individual rules within FRI techniques for such models. Through geometrizing sparse rule bases, comparative investigations of the empirical and theoretical results are carried out. Moreover, geometric projection of the rules is combined with a rule weight adjustment mechanism to reinforce the capability of the formalized FRI techniques. By embedding directional parameters into the rules, the resulting method increases the weighting of critical rules, strengthening the FRI algorithms&#39; performance when many rules may be selected for interpolation. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the theoretical model and the consistency with the existing empirical findings. This highlights the potential and significance of formal studies in guiding algorithmic improvements on FRI with TSK models.},

Meanwhile, in virtue of two different and independent Bernoulli random variables, the stochastic cyber-attack model involving not only denial-of-service attacks but also deception attacks is introduced. Then, some algebraic criteria are deduced to accomplish fixed-time synchronization for the QVFNNs with or without stochastic cyber-attacks through the fuzzy set theory, Lyapunov functional method, and impulsive system theory.

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has made remarkable achievements in extensive fields, whereas its closed boxnature limited applications in many critical areas. Against this drawback, explainable AI (XAI), has emerged as a focal point of current research. Recently, fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) attract increasing attention in XAI because of their linguistic representation, which can be naturally understood by humans. However, the focus of these works is limited by simply relying on inherent rule-based structures for explanation. Motivated by further exploring, the potential of FLS to overcome the challenges of XAI in terms of comprehensibility, scalability, and transferability, in this work, we propose fuzzy model-agnostic explanation (FMAE) as a post-hoc paradigm to explain the behavior of closed boxmodels. The innovations and contributions of this work provide a unified framework offering four levels of explanation, develop the associated algorithms to present the hidden knowledge behind the closed boxmodel in human-understandable form at different levels of granularity, and create the interface to deliver explanations to users. First, we introduce the hierarchical FMAE framework to formulate explanations into four levels including sample, local, domain, and universe. Second, the learning and explaining algorithms are developed to systematically construct FLS to model the behavior of closed boxmodels in the four levels where downscaling is performed by simplification to facilitate explanations with concise rules and upscaling is performed by the aggregation to integrate explanations at a higher level. Third, the proposed explanation interface unifies two typical forms of expression in XAI by fuzzy rules: the semantic inference explanation revealing the decision mechanism of the closed boxmodel and the feature salience explanation reflecting the attribution and interaction of input features. Simulated user experiments are designed on the comprehensive explanatory metrics. Compared with mainstream methods, the result shows outstanding explanation performance on real-world datasets for both regression and classification tasks.},

First, a programming model, with an objective of minimizing the difference between the original and adjusted opinions of DMs, is developed to objectively determine the weights of DMs, taking into account the tolerance levels of DMs for opinion adjustments. Additionally, considering the interval preference information of criteria importance, a Bayesian hierarchy best worst method is proposed to infer the probability distribution of criteria weights, in which the criteria weights are regarded as stochastic variables. A numerical example shows that ignoring psychological factors of DMs can lead to biased decisions, while the proposed method providing a probabilistic distribution of alternative rankings forms robust decision results.},

Besides, a novel resilient quantitative prescribed performance control (RQPPC) is developed, which incorporates finite-time performance boundaries with input-relevant dynamic boundaries generated by an auxiliary system, being expected to flexibly adapt to input saturation without violating performance constraints. Building upon the RQPPC, the transient and steady-state behaviors of consensus errors can be quantitatively predesigned free from repeated parameter tuning processes.
