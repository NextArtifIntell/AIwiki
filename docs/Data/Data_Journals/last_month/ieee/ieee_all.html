We propose a novel outlier-robust scheme, MCIC-MEKF, utilizing the minimum correntropy-induced cost (MCIC) criterion. We provide a theoretical analysis of its outlier robustness through stochastic stability, proving exponentially bounded mean square posterior estimation error under natural conditions. In addition, we present a technical approximation for the adaptive Kalman gain, enhancing efficiency without compromising performance. Simulation results confirm MCIC-MEKF&#39;s robustness against various non-Gaussian noises with large outliers, outperforming several filtering benchmarks.},

Different from the traditional stochastic systems with continuous or periodic output signals, the system output measurements under consideration are only available at sampling times and they are aperiodic. To deal with this problem, we propose a compensator for the unmeasurable system states and a novel aperiodic event-triggered control (AETC) based on the compensator and output to guarantee a good convergence of the state error. Subsequently, we apply the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method (LKFM) to solve the difficulty induced by the delays involved in both SFDSs and output values. Then, the mean-square exponential stabilization of SFDSs is established by AETC and LKFM. Finally, the obtained results are verified by a two-stage chemical reactor system.},

  abstract     = {This technical note deals with asymptotic stabilization of general nonlinear discrete-time systems by dynamic output feedback control. First, a sufficient condition for the dynamic output feedback stabilization with the closed-loop domain of attraction (DOA) estimation is given. For a given Lyapunov function of the plant state and the controller state, the negative-definite domain (NDD) in the $(z_+$-$u$-$z$-$y)$-space is proposed, where $z_+,u,z$, and $y$ denote the next controller state, the current control input, the current controller state and the current plant output, respectively. All points $(z_+;u;z;y)$ in the NDD can make the time difference of the Lyapunov function negative-definite for the controller state $z$ and all plant states in a set of plant states, which is determined by the controller state $z$ and the plant output $y$. The NDD in the $(z_+$-$u$-$z$-$y)$-space could be viewed as an unstructured dynamic output feedback stabilization controller set. And any invariant subset of the projection of the NDD in the $(z_+$-$u$-$z$-$y)$-space onto the $(z$-$x)$-space is an estimate of the DOA for the closed-loop, where $x$ denotes the current plant state. Second, based on the NDD, the controller design problem is converted to a set approximation problem in Euclidean space. Using numerical set approximation methods, dealing with strong nonlinearities is no longer the bottleneck. An estimation method for the unstructured dynamic output feedback stabilization controller set is proposed based on interval analysis, which is a kind of guaranteed numerical method for approximating sets.},

We also prove that, under weak assumptions on the collected data, the solvability conditions derived by means of the data-driven approach are in fact equivalent to those obtained through the model-based one. In other words, the data-driven conditions do not impose further constraints with respect to the classic model-based ones, expressed in terms of the original system matrices.},

It employs a dynamics update law and a state synchronizing control law, collectively termed a two-level controller, to facilitate synchronization in heterogeneous MASs autonomously. Nevertheless, the existing theory is constrained by the requirement of network topology information for calculating sufficiently large gains to design both the dynamics update law and the state synchronizing control law. To overcome this limitation, this article proposes a novel design for the two-level controller, enabling synchronization without reliance on network topology. The design parameters undergo adaptive updates until achieving autonomous synchronization, herein termed adaptive autonomous synchronization.},

In our method, the generalized blended dynamics is presented to analyze the heterogeneity of systems. By utilizing polynomial Lyapunov functions, the synchronization criterion for HPNSs under directed topology is presented, along with a bounded set where the synchronization errors of HPNSs reside when the time progresses towards infinity. Compared with the existing criteria from quadratic Lyapunov functions, our results yield a smaller bounded set and thus are less conservative. Drawing upon the established criterion, the synchronization verification problem is transformed into a sum-of-squares optimization problem. This consequential optimization problem aligns with the paradigm of convex programming, thereby affording a polynomial-time solvability. The proposed optimization algorithm efficiently generates polynomial Lyapunov functions, facilitating automatic verification of bounded synchronization. Finally, two examples are given to demonstrate the efficacy of our method.},

First, a distributed synergistic hybrid controller is synthesized by leveraging a coadjoint incidence matrix to assign to neighboring agents a hybrid feedback that is based on their relative position. It leads to robust and global asymptotic stability in tree networks. Second, the existence of synergistic potential functions (SPFs)—the key ingredient for deriving the hybrid feedback—is established on compact Lie groups. Moreover, a direct extension shows that there exists an SPF on the noncompact special Euclidean group $\text{SE}(n)$. In contrast with some existing results, the proposed controller removes the invariance condition on the hybrid feedback, and the existence of the SPF ensures that our controller is applicable to many Lie groups of practical interests. Finally, a worked example of multiple planar rigid-body systems on $\text{SE} (2)$ is used to illustrate our approach.},

  abstract     = {Distributed Nash equilibrium (NE) seeking problems for networked games have been widely investigated in recent years. Despite the increasing attention, communication expenditure is becoming a major bottleneck for scaling up distributed approaches within limited communication bandwidth between agents. To reduce communication cost, an efficient event-triggered and compressed distributed NE seeking (ETC-DNES) algorithm is proposed in this article to obtain an NE for games over directed graphs, where the communication efficiency is improved by event-triggered exchanges of compressed information among neighbors. ETC-DNES saves communication costs in both transmitted bits and rounds of communication. Furthermore, our method only requires the row-stochastic property of the adjacency matrix, unlike previous approaches that hinged on doubly stochastic communication matrices. We provide convergence guarantees for ETC-DNES on games with restricted strongly monotone mappings and testify its efficiency with no sacrifice on the accuracy. The algorithm and analysis are extended to a compressed algorithm with stochastic event-triggered mechanism, i.e., stochastic event-triggered and compressed distributed NE seeking (SETC-DNES) algorithm. In SETC-DNES, we introduce a random variable in the triggering condition to further enhance the algorithm efficiency. We demonstrate that SETC-DNES guarantees linear convergence to the NE while achieving even greater reductions in communication costs compared to ETC-DNES. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

The original contribution of the article is to present two new strong Lyapunov functions (e.g., Lyapunov functions with negative definite derivative), assessing global uniform asymptotic stability properties under the classical persistency of excitation condition. The first Lyapunov function, in the continuous-time framework, covers general (full-order) gradient-like adaptive observer forms—possibly taking into account the presence of projection algorithms and exhibiting piecewise continuous regressor matrices—that have so far restrictively required uniform boundedness of the (everywhere defined) derivative of the regressor. The second Lyapunov function, in the discrete-time framework, owns the advantage feature of being nonanticipating (e.g., characterized by a causal time-varying matrix that is available at runtime), which allows the designer to solve further adaptation issues.},

To tackle the mixed relative degree and avoid the undesired position offset for the nonholonomic unicycle model, we propose a novel construction of a CBF that can directly be integrated with our recent gradient-ascent source-seeking control law.

The main feature of the proposed IDB attack is that, by intercepting the measurement output, the adversary can identify the important packets transmitting among sensing nodes, and by injecting more power to increase the attack success probability (ASP) of these packets, thereby enhancing the attack destructiveness. Then, according to the identified ASP of packets, a scheme is designed to allocate the attack power to each channel with the help of the signal-to-noise ratio such that packets with higher ASP would face attacks with more power. Subsequently, the relationships are characterized among the attack parameter, the ASP, the attack power, and the constrained energy via stochastic analysis method, and the threshold of the attack parameter is designed to achieve a balance between the attack effects and the energy constraint. Finally, an illustrative simulation is given to verify the effectiveness of the stochastic IDB attack strategy and stochastic IDB attack power allocation method.},

  abstract     = {This article focuses on the predictability verification problem of fault patterns for both bounded and unbounded discrete event systems modeled with labeled Petri nets. A system is said to be predictable with respect to a fault pattern if any complete fault behavior in a fault pattern can be correctly predicted before its occurrence, where the fault patterns are characterized by a particular composition of a labeled Petri net with a fault pattern net. In this article, we construct a fault pattern predictor net and a basis fault pattern predictor graph (PG) that is based on the notion of basis markings. By exploiting the fault pattern predictor net and basis fault pattern PG, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition to check fault pattern predictability, which does not need the full reachability/coverability graph of a net, thus gaining practical computation benefits.},

Both state-feedback and static output-feedback cases are investigated. Instead of using case-by-case relaxation techniques, we propose a tractable first-order method to solve this structural optimal control problem. More specifically, we equivalently reformulate it as a constrained optimization and characterize its first-order optimality condition via Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions. To solve this NP-hard problem, we propose a novel optimization method, called log-barrier search (LBS), which incorporates a modified log-barrier term into the control objective function and adaptively changes its parameters during the computation process. The convergence of our method is theoretically guaranteed and at least a stationary solution can be obtained. We compare the proposed method with other existing algorithms, where the LBS method shows a very competitive performance in both speed and optimality.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a rate-coded secure control is investigated for the consensus of multiagent systems (MASs). The challenge lies in how to design a broadcasting protocol when the communication bit is critical, and to strengthen its security at the same time. A novel rate-coded algorithm is designed for MASs from an encoding–decoding viewpoint, where only an encrypted $L$-length codeword, instead of the sensitive system information, is transmitted over the network between each agent and its neighbors whenever the triggering condition is satisfied. Unlike most existing results, our algorithm&#39;s triggering condition is correlated with the changing rate of the transmitted signal, effectively alleviating the signal distortion problem when its changing rate is too small or too large. As a result, the proposed rate-coded secure control not only ensures uniformly bounded consensus outcomes without continuous monitoring of neighbors&#39; states but also reduces bandwidth requirements and enhances communication security. Finally, simulation results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of our theoretical finding.},

We employ power means and generalized functional means to capture robust satisfaction over space and time. We show that our general definition encompasses many of the STL robustness functions in the literature. Most importantly, we show how that our notion of robustness addresses the two main limitations of the the traditional robustness (masking and locality), which currently limit using robustness-based approaches for control. The proposed robustness function parameters affect the conservativeness of the score, and can be chosen based on desired performance. We show how the proposed robustness can be used for control.},

The salient feature of this work is that the switching communication networks can be uniformly strongly connected, and the communication delays are allowed to be arbitrarily unknown, time-varying and bounded. To solve the problem, we construct a distributed estimator for each player to estimate all players&#39; strategies through unreliable communication networks. Based on the gradient play technique, we design a distributed Nash equilibrium seeking law. Then, we obtain the closed-loop system, which is an interconnected system of a nonlinear subsystem and a linear time-delay subsystem. By constructing the Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional, and designing the controller parameter in the sense of the small gain theorem, we achieve robust Nash equilibrium seeking asymptotically in spite of unreliable communication networks. Finally, we illustrate our proposed approach by its application to practical motion control of mobile robots with an experiment.},

The dual equivalent observability problem is identified. It consists of estimating the boundary sources, localized on a given subset of the boundary, out of boundary measurements on the complementary subset. Classical unique continuation and smoothing properties of the heat equation allow us proving approximate tracking controllability properties and the smoothness of the class of trackable trajectories. We also develop a new transmutation method that allows to transfer known results on the sidewise controllability of the wave equation to the tracking controllability of the heat one.

In this work, the Bayesian theorem plays a crucial role in two key aspects. First, the unknown uncertainties are estimated using Gaussian process models, which provide mean and variance information incorporated into the QP framework to determine the control inputs. The integration ensures the attainment of desired objectives with high probability. Second, the Bayesian optimization algorithm is employed to optimize some hyperparameters. These selected hyperparameters enhance the solvability of the QP problem and simultaneously improve the control performance of multiagent systems.},

With the aid of the obtained equivalent form, an inversion-free iterative algorithm (IFIA) is developed to obtain the positive definite solutions of the discrete coupled Riccati matrix equation via the principle of fixed points. To improve the convergence performance, the latest updated information is exerted in the presented algorithm.

The article proposes an optimal input design method where the achieved Fisher information matrix (FIM) is fitted to the desired Fisher matrix, together with a coordinate transformation designed to make the regressors in the transformed coordinates have low mutual coherence.

  abstract     = {This article tackles the asynchronous cooperative output regulation problem for heterogeneous nonlinear multiagent systems (MASs) characterized by jointly connected switching topologies. Considering the heterogeneity inherent in the MASs, we propose two distributed asynchronous observers. The first observer is developed to estimate the exosystem matrix, and the second is tailored to estimate the exosystem state. To guarantee the estimation accuracy of these observers, we formulate a relationship linking the maximum detection delay of unmatched intervals to the minimum dwell time of matched intervals. Capitalizing on the states from the distributed asynchronous observers and employing the backstepping structure, we proceed to design heterogeneous adaptive controllers for the nonlinear MASs. The effectiveness of our theoretical contributions is substantiated through numerical simulations, which are presented to validate the proposed control strategies.},

The transition and sojourn information is incompletely known, and the coupling between the known (or unknown) transition and unknown (or known) sojourn information renders the known probabilistic information difficult to be fully leveraged, which can lead to conservative results in system analysis and synthesis. To approximate the unknown transition and sojourn information, a polyhedral approach is developed, which facilitates the incorporation of the known probabilistic information coupled with unknown information. Accordingly, novel vertex-based Lyapunov functions are proposed to establish stability conditions. New criteria are established for the stability analysis and control of SMJLSs by incorporating all the jointly known transition and sojourn information, all the known probabilistic information, and both the known and the approximation of unknown probabilistic information, respectively. The effectiveness and superiority of the theoretical results are illustrated by a numerical example and a simulated continuous stirred tank reactor process.},

Our first contribution is to provide sufficient conditions for sISS of networks using sISS vector Lyapunov functions. These sufficient conditions are given in terms of the Lyapunov functions of the agents. We use vector Lyapunov functions, the comparison lemma, and contraction analysis to prove the result. Our second contribution provides conditions for sISS of weakly coupled interconnected systems.

On the basis of covariant derivative and parallel transport, the original Cucker–Smale model on complete Riemannian manifolds can reach velocity alignment. By using the logarithm map on Riemannian manifolds, an attractive–repulsive force is added, which enables all agents to achieve collision avoidance and aggregation on Riemannian manifolds. The proposed model is consistent with the related model on the Euclidean space. Moreover, five specific complete Riemannian manifolds are taken into consideration: the unit sphere, the hyperboloid, the infinite cylinder, the unit circle, and the special orthogonal group. After giving the corresponding covariant derivatives, parallel transports, and logarithm maps, the explicit forms of the proposed model on those manifolds are shown.

Furthermore, with a dynamic coupling gain on the communications among the interval observers, a completely distributed interval observer is designed without any prerequisite, except for the joint detectability of the partial measurements and the strong connectivity of the properly defined directed sensor network.

Robustness thereby reduces to a problem of subspace estimation. This article proposes a new subspace estimator that recovers the non-persistently exciting (non-PE) subspace for a large class of regressors. This is achieved through a characterization of PE subspaces and the use of principal component analysis. Correctness of the design is proved using matrix perturbation theory, while an averaging analysis demonstrates that the design is best employed as a slow process. We develop a general error model capturing those commonly appearing in adaptive control, and we prove that the $\mu$-modification provides a modular robust design, without compromising error regulation.},

Resampling is proposed to guarantee the equivalence of lattice PWA approximations and optimal MPC control law at the sample points. Under certain conditions, the disjunctive lattice PWA approximation constitutes a lower bound, whereas the conjunctive version formulates an upper bound of the original optimal control law. The equivalence of the two lattice PWA approximations then guarantees error-free approximations in the domain of interest, which is tested through a statistical guarantee. The performance of the proposed approximation strategy is tested through two simulation examples, and the results show that error-free lattice PWA approximations can be obtained with low offline complexity and small storage requirements. Besides, the online complexity is less compared with the state-of-the-art method.},

To optimize the synchronization performance of such networks, topological adjustments have been identified as effective and efficient ways. This article establishes a theoretical framework for accelerating synchronization convergence by introducing an additional directed edge or increasing edge weight to a network topology. The convergence speed is quantified by the second smallest real part of Laplacian matrix eigenvalues, called Fielder eigenvalue. We develop a necessary and sufficient condition guaranteeing synchronization acceleration with additional edge of single-root digraphs, enabling efficiently screening out all such edges through computation of graph Laplacian eigenspace. Moreover, for a sufficiently small topological variation, the accelerating extent and optimal edge can be approximately estimated as well. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed identification method of acceleration edges.},

In this problem, the system state evolves on the nonlinear manifold $ \mathit{SE}(3)\times \mathbb {R}^{3\mathit{n}}$, on which we design dynamic extensions such that the deterministic VI-SLAM problem can be reformulated—without any approximation—into online constant parameter identification, expressed as a linear regression. This demonstrates that deterministic VI-SLAM can be translated into a linear least squares problem globally and exactly. Based on this observation, we propose a novel SLAM observer, following the recently established parameter estimation-based observer methodology. A notable merit of the proposed observer is its almost global asymptotic stability. Unlike most existing methods, its convergence does not rely on persistency of excitation or uniform complete observability—assumptions commonly used in stability proofs that can be challenging to satisfy in real-world applications.},

In other words, “practical safety” is maintained during the entire period of convergence to the constrained extremum. Our design is based on quadratic program (QP) CBF style filters for safety, which is applied in an average and estimated sense. Using nonsmooth analysis tools, we guarantee semiglobal practical asymptotic (SPA) stability of the global constrained optimum, practical convergence to the safe set if starting in a condition violating the CBF, and practical safety for all time—semiglobally—if starting in safe set. The safety result of this article is analogous with modern notions of SPA stability, guaranteeing that, for any small violation of safety, there exist design coefficients that guarantee that such a small violation is not exceeded. This article outlines a set of sufficient conditions on the barrier and objective functions, and by way of a Lyapunov argument, we demonstrate that nonconvex constrained optimization problems can be solved. We present these results in the setting of a static map and a dynamical system. A simulation example illustrates the results.},

Despite its simple formulation, versatility, and predisposition to be employed in model-free settings, the LP approach has not enjoyed the same popularity as the other methods. The reason is the often poor scalability of the exact LP approach and the difficulty to obtain bounded solutions for a reasonable amount of constraints. We mitigate these issues here, by investigating fundamental geometric features of the LP and developing sufficient conditions to guarantee finite solutions with minimal constraints. In the model-free context, we show that boundedness can be guaranteed by a suitable choice of dataset and objective function.},

For a class of general linear average consensus algorithms, we identify the least information set required by an attacker to infer the initial value of the target node. We then propose a novel algorithm that protects the initial value effectively if the attacker fails to have this least information. Furthermore, we show that the initial value of nodes may be disclosed even if the attacker does not know any information exchanged between the target node and its neighbors. Finally, we propose a novel eavesdropping algorithm if the least information is available. Several numerical examples are given to verify the validity of our results.},

In this article, we examine the continuum limit of high-dimensional measurements and analyze state estimation in linear time-invariant systems with infinite-dimensional measurements but finite-dimensional states, both corrupted by additive noise. We propose a linear filter and derive the corresponding optimal gain functional in the sense of the minimum mean square error, analogous to the classic Kalman filter. By modeling the measurement noise as a wide-sense stationary random field, we are able to derive the optimal linear filter explicitly, in contrast to previous derivations of Kalman filters in distributed-parameter settings. Interestingly, we find that we need only impose conditions that are finite-dimensional in nature to ensure that the filter is asymptotically stable. The proposed filter is verified via simulation of a linearized system with a pinhole camera sensor.},

  abstract     = {The distributed observer design problem holds significant importance in cases in which the output information of a system is decentralized across different subsystems. Each subsystem has a local observer and access to one part of the measurement outputs and information exchanged through communication networks. This article focuses on the design of distributed observer with jointly connected directed switching networks. The problem presents challenges due to passive switching modes and the open-loop unboundedness that results from local observability. To overcome these challenges, we develop a network transformation mapping method whereby each local observer can classify itself into an independent subgraph based on independent judgment. Next, an observable decomposition and reorganization method is developed for the digraph case to ensure that each subgraph possesses independent dynamic properties. Asymptotic omniscience is then proven using a developed recursive proof method. This article includes many previous results as special cases, because most are only suitable for undirected switching topologies or fast-switching cases. An adaptive coupling gain design is proposed to simplify the calculation and verification of conditions that guarantee asymptotic omniscience. Finally, simulation results with the power system show the validity of the developed theory.},

The convergence of the EM algorithm for MAP estimation is investigated, and it is proven that the sequence of estimates converges to a local optimal solution.

A novel concept of modal functional observability coinciding with the notion of modal observability is proposed. This notion introduces necessary and sufficient conditions for functional observability and detectability in a unified way without resorting to system observability decomposition, and facilitates the design of a functionally observable/detectable system. Afterward, SFO is redefined rigorously from a generic perspective, contrarily to the definition of structural observability. A complete graph-theoretic characterization for SFO is proposed. Based on these results, the problems of selecting the minimal sensors from a prior set to achieve functional observability and SFO are shown to be NP-hard. Nevertheless, supermodular set functions are established, leading to greedy heuristics that can find approximation solutions to these problems with provable guarantees in polynomial time. A closed-form solution along with a constructive procedure is also given for the unconstrained case on systems with diagonalizable state matrices. Notably, our results also yield a polynomial-time verifiable case for structural target controllability, a problem that may be hard otherwise.},

Without using the model or its simulator, the proposed approach can learn a piecewise affine Lyapunov function with a finite and fixed offline dataset. The learnt Lyapunov function is robust to any dynamics that are consistent with the ofline dataset, and its computation is based on second-order cone programming.

The proposed approach introduces a new type of integral transformation to tackle in-domain couplings in the different subsystems while guaranteeing a “clear actuation path” between the control input and the different subsystems. Then, it is possible to state several essential properties of each subsystem: output trajectory tracking, input-to-state stability, and predictability (the possibility of designing a state prediction). We recursively design a stabilizing state-feedback controller by combining these properties. We then design a state observer that reconstructs delayed values of the states. This observer is combined with the state-feedback control law to obtain an output-feedback controller. Simulations complete the presentation.},

In this article, we propose the first receding horizon scheme based on the repeated computation of finite horizon regret-optimal policies, and we establish stability and safety guarantees for the resulting closed-loop system. Our derivations combine novel monotonicity properties of clairvoyant policies with suitable terminal ingredients. We prove that our scheme is recursively feasible, stabilizing, and that it achieves bounded regret relative to the infinite horizon clairvoyant policy. Last, we show that the policy optimization problem can be solved efficiently through convex–concave programming. Our numerical experiments show that minimizing regret can outperform standard receding horizon approaches when the disturbances poorly fit classical design assumptions—even when the finite horizon planning is recomputed less frequently.},

The first stage utilizes available Bayesian regression results to compute robust credible sets for the true parameters of the system. For the second stage, we introduce methods for systems subject to both stochastic and parametric uncertainties. We provide simulation relations for enabling correct-by-design control refinement that are founded on coupling uncertainties of stochastic systems via subprobability measures. The presented relations are essential for constructing abstract models that are related to not only one model but to a set of parameterized models.

  abstract     = {This article presents a new paradigm to stabilize uncertain stochastic linear systems. Herein, second moment polytopic (SMP) systems are proposed that generalize systems with both uncertainty and randomness. The SMP systems are characterized by second moments of the stochastic system matrices and the uncertain parameters. Further, a fundamental theory for guaranteeing stability of the SMP systems is established. It is challenging to analyze the SMP systems owing to both the uncertainty and randomness. An idea to overcome this difficulty is to expand the SMP systems and exclude the randomness. Because the expanded systems contain only the uncertainty, their stability can be analyzed via robust stability theory. The stability of the expanded systems is equivalent to statistical stability of the SMP systems. These facts provide sufficient conditions for the stability of the SMP systems as linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). In controller design for the SMP systems, the LMIs reduce to cubic matrix inequalities (CMIs) whose solutions correspond to feedback gains. The CMIs are transformed into simpler quadratic matrix inequalities (QMIs) that can be solved using optimization techniques. Moreover, solving such nonconvex QMIs is relaxed into the iteration of a convex optimization. Solutions to the iterative optimization provide feedback gains that stabilize the SMP systems. As demonstrated here, the SMP systems represent linear dynamics with uncertain distributions and other existing systems such as independently identically distributed dynamics and random polytopes. Finally, a numerical simulation shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Through deriving properties of switching laws regarding signs and dimension, this article proposes a definite condition for time-optimal control. Guided by the developed theory, a trajectory planning method named the manifold-intercept method (MIM) is developed. The proposed MIM can plan time-optimal jerk-limited trajectories with full state constraints, and can also plan near-optimal nonchattering higher order trajectories with negligible extra motion time compared to optimal profiles. Numerical results indicate that the proposed MIM outperforms all baselines in computational time, computational accuracy, and trajectory quality by a large gap.},

Here, we prove a much crisper and detailed bound on the closed-loop behavior consisting of three terms: a decaying exponential on the initial condition, a linear-like convolution bound on the exogenous inputs, and a constant scaled by the square root of the constant in the denominator of the estimator update law; we also provide an upper bound on the two-norm of the tracking error.

While synchronous algorithms are heavily impacted by a few slow nodes or edges in the graph (the straggler problem), their asynchronous counterparts are notoriously harder to parameterize. Indeed, their convergence properties for networks with heterogeneous communication and computation delays have defied analysis so far. In this article, we use a continuized framework to analyze asynchronous algorithms in networks with delays. Our approach yields a precise characterization of convergence time and of its dependence on heterogeneous delays in the network. Our continuized framework benefits from the best of both continuous and discrete worlds: the algorithms it applies to are based on event-driven updates. They are thus essentially discrete, and hence, readily implementable. Yet their analysis is essentially in continuous time, relying in part on the theory of delayed ordinary differential equations. Our algorithms moreover achieve an asynchronous speedup: their rate of convergence is controlled by the eigengap of the network graph weighted by local delays instead of the network-wide worst-case delay as in previous analyses. Our methods thus enjoy improved robustness to stragglers.},

First, we propose an explicit rule to adaptively adjust the discount factor by exploring the stability margin of a linear control policy. Then, we establish the sample complexity of PG methods for stabilization, which only adds a coefficient logarithmic in the spectral radius of the state matrix to that for solving the LQR problem with a prior stabilizing policy. Finally, we perform simulations to validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a class of nonlinear systems.},

  abstract     = {Safety control of dynamical systems using barrier functions relies on knowing the full state information. This article introduces a novel approach for safety control in uncertain multiple-input–muiltiple-output (MIMO) systems with partial state information. The proposed method combines the synthesis of a vector norm barrier function and a dynamic output feedback safety controller to ensure robust safety enforcement. The safety controller guarantees the invariance of the barrier function under uncertain dynamics and disturbances. To address the challenges associated with safety verification using partial state information, a barrier function estimator is developed. This estimator employs an identifier-based state estimator to obtain a state estimate that is affine in the uncertain model parameters of the system. By incorporating a priori knowledge of the limits of the uncertain model parameters and disturbances, the state estimate provides a robust upper bound for the barrier function. Comparative analysis with existing control barrier function-based methods shows the advantage of the proposed approach in enforcing safety constraints under tight input constraints and the utilization of estimated state information.},

Our first technical contribution is to show the stability in the game theoretic sense of these equilibria on a specific local subset of the original feasible set. Remarkably, we show that the proposed notion of local equilibrium can be equivalently formulated as the solution of a quasi-variational inequality with equal Lagrange multipliers. Next, under the additional proximal smoothness assumption of the coupled feasible set, we define conditions for the existence and local uniqueness of an LGNE. To compute such an equilibrium, we propose two discrete-time dynamics, or fixed-point iterations implemented in a centralized fashion. Our third technical contribution is to prove convergence under (strongly) monotone assumptions on the pseudogradient mapping of the game and proximal smoothness of the coupled feasible set. Finally, we apply our theoretical results to a noncooperative version of the optimal power flow control problem.},

To solve system level synthesis problems, prior work relies on finite impulse response approximations that lead to deadbeat control, and that can experience infeasibility and increased suboptimality, especially in systems with large separation of time scales. The new design method does not result in deadbeat control, is convex and tractable, always feasible, can incorporate prior knowledge, and works well for systems with large separation of time scales. Suboptimality bounds with convergence rate depending on the geometry of the pole selection are provided. An example demonstrates superior performance of the method.},

Amid the evolving landscape of data-driven methodologies, enhancing decision-making performance in complex scenarios has emerged as a prominent research focus. Despite considerable advancements, current learning-based decision-making approaches exhibit potential for refinement, particularly in aspects of policy articulation and safety assurance. To address these challenges, we introduce DDM-Lag, a diffusion decision model, augmented with Lagrangian-based safety enhancements. This work conceptualizes the sequential decision-making challenge inherent in autonomous driving as a problem of generative modeling, adopting diffusion models as the medium for assimilating patterns of decision-making. We introduce a hybrid policy update strategy for diffusion models, amalgamating the principles of behavior cloning and Q-learning, alongside the formulation of an actor–critic architecture for the facilitation of updates. To augment the model&#39;s exploration process with a layer of safety, we incorporate additional safety constraints, employing a sophisticated policy optimization technique predicated on Lagrangian relaxation to refine the policy learning endeavor comprehensively. Empirical evaluation of our proposed decision-making methodology was conducted across a spectrum of driving tasks, distinguished by their varying degrees of complexity and environmental contexts. The comparative analysis with established baseline methodologies elucidates our model&#39;s superior performance, particularly in dimensions of safety and holistic efficacy.},

Despite the advances, most of the studies are focused on synchronized decision-making to attain Nash equilibrium, where all the players take actions simultaneously. On the other hand, however, in complex applications, certain players may have an advantage in making sequential decisions and this situation introduces a hierarchical structure and influences how other players respond. The control design for such system is challenging since it relies on solving the coupled Hamilton–Jacobi equation. The situation becomes more difficult when the learning process is exposed to complex uncertainties with unreliable data being exchanged. Therefore, in this article, we develop a new learning-based control approach for a class of nonlinear hierarchical multiplayer systems subject to mismatched uncertainties. Specifically, we first formulate this new problem as a multiplayer Stackelberg–Nash game in conjunction with the hierarchical robust–optimal transformation. Theoretical analysis confirms the equivalence of this transformation and ensures that the designed control policies can achieve stable equilibrium. Then, a two-level neural-RL-based approach is developed to automatically and adaptively learn the solutions. The stability of this online learning process is also provided. Finally, two numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed learning-based robust control design.},

  abstract     = {Recent developments in Swin Transformer have shown its great potential in various computer vision tasks, including image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection. However, it is challenging to achieve desired performance by directly employing the Swin Transformer in multiview 3-D object recognition since the Swin Transformer independently extracts the characteristics of each view and relies heavily on a subsequent fusion strategy to unify the multiview information. This leads to the problem of the insufficient extraction of interdependencies between the multiview images. To this end, we propose an aggregation strategy integrated into the Swin Transformer to reinforce the connections between internal features across multiple views, thus leading to a complete interpretation of isolated features extracted by the Swin Transformer. Specifically, we utilize Swin Transformer to learn view-level feature representations from multiview images and then calculate their view discrimination scores. The scores are employed to assign the view-level features to different groups. Finally, a grouping and fusion network is proposed to aggregate the features from view and group levels. The experimental results indicate that our method attains state-of-the-art performance compared with prior approaches in multiview 3-D object recognition tasks.

First, we pretrain a network based on consistency learning to ensure the invariant feature extraction from the source and target domains. Then, we propose an end-to-end unsupervised domain adaptation, which includes the layer matching and the unsupervised domain adaptation to promote more confident knowledge transfer. Finally, the pretrained network receives feedback of the domain adaptation&#39;s performance. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we perform the comprehensive experiments on fault diagnosis datasets and human activity recognition datasets.

However, traditional plant identification often relies on a single attribute, such as leaves or flowers, which can be unreliable due to seasonal variations. This article introduces a novel approach for accurately identifying medicinal plants using a multiattribute deep convolutional neural network. This approach aims to bridge the gap in healthcare access by empowering individuals to recognize and utilize these plants effectively.

FedPPN only transmits prototypes between clients and the server for knowledge sharing. The core idea is propagating global prototypes on each client&#39;s local graph, generating prototype-based node representations and predictions. The prototype-based prediction can then be ensembled with the prediction of local GNN, allowing clients to achieve accurate prediction. We evaluate our FedPPN on six benchmark datasets with different heterogeneous model setups. Experimental results show that our FedPPN outperforms advanced baselines in model accuracy without adding any trainable parameters on clients or the server. Besides, FedPPN&#39;s communication cost is significantly lower than methods that rely on model parameter exchange.},

  abstract     = {Accurate forecasting of the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and El-Niño-Southern Oscillation (NINO3.4) is crucial for understanding regional weather patterns in the Indian subcontinent. Addressing the challenges associated with IOD and NINO3.4 prediction, a robust multitask autoregressive deep learning (DL) model is introduced for precise forecasting of these indices and key grid projections sea surface temperature (SST), surface-level pressure gradient (SLG), and horizontal wind velocity (U-Comp) over a short to mid-term window (20 months). Utilizing spatiotemporal (SST, SLG, U-Comp) and temporal (IOD and NINO3.4) modalities, the proposed model predicts future IOD and NINO3.4, as well as SST, SLG, and U-Comp, in an autoregressive scheme. The multitask learning component regularizes the model, effectively capturing the evolving dynamics of global patterns conditioned on IOD and NINO3.4. The comprehensive evaluation explores various task settings, including a duo-setting that predicts IOD or NINO3.4 with spatiotemporal information, showcasing notable proficiency. In a multitask environment, where both temporal IOD, NINO3.4, and spatiotemporal SST, SLG, U-Comp are predicted, the model successfully forecasts IOD and NINO3.4 indices alongside grid projections with modest accuracy in root mean square error (RMSE). To enhance the model&#39;s interpretability regarding spatiotemporal dynamics, a tailored version of Grad-CAM is employed, providing critical insights for climate prediction. This research advances climate prediction models, offering a comprehensive framework with significant implications for informed decision-making in the Indian subcontinent&#39;s climatic context.},

TCEs are recognized by immune system, specifically by T cells, B cells, and antibodies. Traditional wet lab methods for identifying TCEs are often costly, challenging, and time-consuming compared to computational approaches. In this study, we propose a neural network-based ensemble machine learning (ML) model trained on physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 peptides sequences to predict TCE sequences. The performance of the model assessed using test dataset demonstrated an accuracy of &gt;95%, surpassing the results of other ML classifiers that were employed for comparative analysis. Through fivefold cross-validation technique, a mean accuracy of approximately 95% was reported. Additionally, when compared to other existing TCE prediction methods using a blind dataset, the proposed model was found to be more accurate and effective. The predicted epitopes may have a strong probability to act as potential vaccine candidates. Nonetheless, it is imperative to subject these epitopes to further scientific examination both in vivo and in vitro, to confirm their suitability as vaccine candidates.},

  abstract     = {With the great progress of three-dimensional (3-D) sensing and acquisition technology, the volume of point cloud data has grown dramatically, which urges the development of efficient point cloud compression methods. In this article, we focus on the task of learned lossy point cloud attribute compression (PCAC). We propose an efficient attention-based method for lossy compression of point cloud attributes leveraging on an autoencoder architecture. Specifically, at the encoding side, we conduct multiple downsampling to best exploit the local attribute patterns, in which effective external cross attention (ECA) is devised to hierarchically aggregate features by intergrating attributes and geometry contexts. At the decoding side, the attributes of the point cloud are progressively reconstructed based on the multiscale representation and the zero-padding upsampling tactic. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to introduce attention mechanism to point-based lossy PCAC task. We verify the compression efficiency of our model on various sequences, including human body frames, sparse objects, and large-scale point cloud scenes. Experiments show that our method achieves an average improvement of 1.15 and 2.13 dB in Bjontegaard delta (BD)-peak signal-to-noise ratio (BD-PSNR) of Y channel and YUV channel, respectively, when comparing with the state-of-the-art point-based method deep-PCAC.

  abstract     = {The human brain is exceedingly good at learning rich narratives from highly limited experiences. One of the ways this is achieved in our brain is through neuromodulators or neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and nor-epinephrine, in cortical circuits. In terms of symbolic processing, these neuromodulators add “salience” to various emotions and experiences. A salience-based neural network (SANN) architecture was proposed in [1]. We have taken this architecture and have developed a discriminator to enable efficient change detection for underwater applications. In the context of underwater, surveillance can be elucidated as one of the processes of detecting and tracking the moving objects present in underwater videos. Several researchers working on the same tried to develop different techniques for identifying moving objects from outdoor scenes. However, while applying the same for underwater environments, it is found to be unable to preserve the minute details that are important for defining an object&#39;s boundary. This is mainly due to the complex scene dynamics of the aquatic environment. Moreover, the intricate natural properties of water and some of its characteristics, such as excessive turbidity, scattering, and low visibility, also make the task of detecting the object present in underwater videos extremely challenging. In this regard, we put forth an adversarial learning-based end-to-end deep learning architecture inspired by the way neurotransmitters work in the human brain to detect underwater moving objects. The proposed architecture uses two modules for underwater object detection. The initial module is a generator composed of a probabilistic learner which is based on multiple down- and up-sampling modules. Further, the discriminator network is composed of a multilevel feature-concatenation component, which can perpetuate specifics at distinct levels. The effectiveness of the proposed method (PM) is confirmed using the underwater change detection and Fish4Knowledge benchmark datasets by contrasting its outcomes with those of different state-of-the-art methods.},

However, they have poor performance on independent validation due to differences in image scenes and tampering methods. The key question is how to design a network that is able to adaptively enhance the tampering information and suppress the generalization features during training. To this end, we propose a dual-branch network with a frequency adaptation paradigm and a feature fusion module for robust tampering image detection. First, this paradigm is designed to adaptively highlight tampering features through frequency conversion and learnable weight. Second, a feature fusion module is developed to filter redundant features and dynamically fuse two-branch features. Experiments on eight typical datasets demonstrate that our model has advantages over state-of-the-art algorithms, and our paradigm can well empower semantic segmentation networks for tampering detection.},

  abstract     = {The bone structure in a chest x-ray creates trouble for a radiologist to examine the organs, manifestation of disease, and hidden tiny abnormalities. Bone suppression in chest x-rays allows better examination of lung fields. This has the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy. Dual-energy subtraction imaging is a standard bone suppression technique that delivers a higher dose of radiation and requires specific hardware. This article proposes a novel multiscale and dual attention-guided generative adversarial network (MDA-GAN) to transform chest x-rays into bone-suppressed x-rays in an unsupervised manner. We incorporate a spatial attention module to generate attention maps that were further concatenated with the coarsely generated bone segmentation mask. This dual attention is introduced to the generator at multiple scales in between the skip connection of the encoder and decoder layer. The proposed dual attention multiscale mechanism helps the generator to learn that only bones need to be removed on the chest x-ray without tempering the remaining parts. The proposed MDA-GAN is trained with adversarial loss combined with deep supervised cycle consistency and structure similarity for unpaired training images. We employ supervision heads in all the decoder layers to convert the activation maps into an output comparable to the scaled-down images and minimize the cycle consistency loss in a deep supervised manner. Experiments are conducted on an unpaired dataset including the public and our in-house Indian dataset and results show that incorporating dual attention at multiple scales and deep cycle consistency in translation networks significantly improves the quality of bone-suppressed images.

Therefore, improving the performance of PLMs in scenarios with only a small number of training examples, also known as a few-shot setting, is of great practical significance. Current mitigation strategies for the few-shot QA task largely rely on pretraining a QA task-specific language model from scratch, overlooking the potential of foundational PLMs to generate QA pairs, particularly in the few-shot setting. To address this issue, we propose a prompt-based QA data augmentation method aimed at automating the creation of high-quality QA pairs. It employs the PFT method, adapting the question generation process of PLMs to the few-shot setting. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic text filling training strategy. This strategy simulates the progressive human learning process, thereby alleviating overfitting of PLMs in the few-shot setting and enhancing their reasoning capability to tackle complex questions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches across various few-shot configurations.},

  abstract     = {E-learning courses often suffer from high dropout rates and low student satisfaction. One way to address this issue is to use personalized learning paths (PLPs), which are sequences of learning materials that meet the individual needs of students. However, creating PLPs is difficult and often involves combining knowledge graphs (KGs), student profiles, and learning materials. Researchers typically assume that the problem of creating PLPs belong to the nondeterministic polynomial (NP)-hard class of computational problems. However, previous research in this field has neither defined the different variations of the PLP problem nor formally established their computational complexity. Without clear definitions of the PLP variations, researchers risk making invalid comparisons and conclusions when they use different metaheuristics for different PLP problems. To unify this conversation, this article formally proves the NP-completeness of two common PLP variations and their generalizations and uses them to categorize recent research in the PLP field. It then presents an instance of the PLP problem using real-world data and shows how this instance can be cast into two different NP-complete variations. This article then presents three artificial intelligence (AI) strategies, solving one of the PLP variations with back-tracking and branch and bound heuristics and also converting the PLP variation instance to XCSP${}^{3}$, an intermediate constraint satisfaction language to be resolved with a general constraint optimization solver. This article solves the other PLP variation instance using a greedy search heuristic. The article finishes by comparing the results of the two different PLP variations.},

Notably, various deep learning models, especially graph neural networks (GNNs), achieve state-of-the-art performance in traffic prediction tasks but still lack interpretability. To interpret the critical information abstracted by traffic prediction models, we proposed a flexible framework termed Traffexplainer toward GNN-based interpretable traffic prediction. Traffexplainer is applicable to a wide range of GNNs without making any modifications to the original model structure. The framework consists of the GNN-based traffic prediction model and the perturbation-based hierarchical interpretation generator. Specifically, the hierarchical spatial mask and temporal mask are introduced to perturb the prediction model by modulating the values of input data. Then the prediction losses are backward propagated to the masks, which can identify the most critical features for traffic prediction, and further improve the prediction performance. We deploy the framework with five representative GNN-based traffic prediction models and analyze their prediction and interpretation performance on three real-world traffic flow datasets. The experiment results demonstrate that our framework can generate effective and faithful interpretations for GNN-based traffic prediction models, and also improve the prediction performance.

  abstract     = {Real open network environments include the traffic generated by known applications or protocols, which have been previously identified and labeled, and unknown network traffic that cannot be identified based on existing knowledge. Accurately identifying unknown traffic is critical to network management and security, not only to help managers allocate bandwidth appropriately for all types of applications and ensure quality of service but also to prevent security breaches that may result from unknown applications or protocols. Notably, the unknown network traffic has been increasing with the emergence of new applications or protocols, which further increases the difficulty in identifying them. Existing unknown traffic classification methods based on Softmax output confidence values cause bias in the prediction probability due to overconfidence of the model during the training process, thus decreasing the identification accuracy. Thus, for unknown traffic identification, this study proposes a deep-learning-based uncertainty-estimation (EUE) approach. EUE introduces the theory of evidence to the task of identifying unknown traffic by inferring traffic uncertainty directly from traffic evidence without the need for a Softmax layer, thus avoiding overconfidence in the model. Thus, the EUE can accurately identify unknown traffic while classifying known traffic at the application level. We construct two experimental scenarios simulating the real network environments with different proportions of unknown traffic to evaluate EUE. The experimental results show that the proposed approach EUE exhibits excellent classification accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Represented by evolutionary algorithms and swarm intelligence algorithms, nature-inspired metaheuristics have been successfully applied to recommender systems and amply demonstrated effectiveness, in particular, for multiobjective recommendation. Owing to the population-based search paradigm, these algorithms can produce a number of recommendation lists, making diverse tradeoffs between multiple metrics and meeting the requirements of accuracy, novelty, diversity, and other user preferences. However, these algorithms are criticized for the low efficiency of the optimization process, especially when the number of users is large. To address this issue, this article proposes an evolutionary multitasking-based recommendation method, where each task corresponds to a user and all the tasks are optimized simultaneously, thus highly improving the efficiency of recommendation. To enhance the convergence speed, all the users are divided into multiple populations according to the similarity between their preferences, where each population evolves with internal knowledge transfer between users, and all the populations evolve with external knowledge transfer between populations. Experimental results on various datasets verify that the proposed method can better balance between multiple metrics than classical and deep neural network-based recommendation methods and exhibits significantly higher efficiency than evolutionary multiobjective optimization-based recommendation methods.},

  abstract     = {Bayesian optimization is a powerful framework for global search, using maximum a posteriori updates instead of simulated annealing. We cast it as a multiarmed bandit problem with a Gaussian process (GP) for the payoff function. Action selections rely on upper confidence bound (UCB) or expected improvement (EI). Prior works with GPs faced challenges for large iteration horizons ($T$) due to cubic scaling in posterior computation. To address this, we propose a simple thresholding: incorporating an action into the GP posterior only when its conditional entropy surpasses $\epsilon$. Doing so permits us to precisely characterize the tradeoff between regret bounds of GP bandit algorithms and complexity of the posterior distributions depending on the compression parameter $\epsilon$ for both discrete and continuous action sets. To best of our knowledge, this is the first result which allows us to obtain sublinear regret bounds while still maintaining sublinear growth rate of the complexity of the posterior which is linear in the existing literature. Moreover, a provably finite bound on the complexity could be achieved but the algorithm would result in $\epsilon$-regret which means $\textbf{Reg}_{T}/T\rightarrow\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$ as $T\rightarrow\infty$. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and complexity tradeoffs for GP bandit algorithms in global optimization, highlighting the benefits of compressed GPs in bandit settings.},

Addressing these fairness problems is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social injustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in ML and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the principles of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two distinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical review of the associated fairness metrics from a ML standpoint and examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML lifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their countermeasures. The article concludes with a discussion on the pressing challenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML and proposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing ethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.},

  abstract = {Online marketplaces often collect products to sell from several other platforms (and sellers) and produce a unique ranking/score of these products to users. Keeping as private the user preferences provided in each (individual) platform is a need and a challenge at the same time. We are currently used to rating items in the marketplace itself which, in turn, can produce more effective rankings. Hence, the shaping of an effective item ranking would require a sharing of the user ratings between the individual platforms and the marketplace, thus impacting users’ privacy. In this paper, we propose the initial steps towards a change of paradigm, where the ratings are kept as private in each platform. Under this paradigm, each platform produces its rankings, then aggregated by the marketplace, in a federated fashion. To ensure that the marketplace’s rankings maintain their effectiveness, we exploit the concept of reputation of the individual platform, so that the final marketplace ranking is weighted by the reputation of each platform providing its ranking. Experiments on three datasets, covering different use cases, show that our approach can produce effective rankings, improving robustness to attacks, while keeping user preference data private within each seller platform.},

GRAPE consists of two independent hierarchical graph neural networks for two mobility systems—one as a target graph (i.e., a bike sharing system) and the other as an auxiliary graph (e.g., a taxi system). We have designed a convolutional fusion mechanism to jointly fuse the target and auxiliary graph embeddings and extract the shared spatial and temporal mobility patterns within the embeddings to enhance prediction accuracy. To further improve the equity of bike sharing systems for diverse communities, we focus on the bike resource allocation and model prediction performance, and propose to regularize the predicted bike resource as well as the accuracy across advantaged and disadvantaged communities, and thus mitigate the potential unfairness in the predicted bike sharing usage. Our evaluation of over 23 million bike rides and 100 million taxi trips in New York City and Chicago has demonstrated GRAPE to outperform all of the baseline approaches in terms of prediction accuracy (by 15.80% for NYC and 50.55% for Chicago on average) and social equity awareness (by 32.44% and 24.43% in terms of resource fairness for NYC and Chicago, and 13.36% and 16.52% in terms of performance fairness).},

However, user profiles are difficult to acquire, especially when the data is scarce. Fortunately, we observed that similar users have similar behavior patterns in different social networks. Motivated by such observations, in this paper, we for the first time propose to study the user profiling problem from the transfer learning perspective. We design two efficient frameworks for User Profile transferring acrOss Networks, i.e., UPON and E-UPON. In UPON, we first design a novel graph convolutional networks based characteristic-aware domain attention model to find user dependencies within and between domains (i.e., social networks). We then design a dual-domain weighted adversarial learning method to address the domain shift problem existing in the transferring procedure. In E-UPON, we optimize UPON in terms of computational complexity and memory. Specifically, we design a mini-cluster gradient descent based graph representation algorithm to shrink the searching space and ensure parallel computation. Then we use an adaptive cluster matching method to adjust the clusters of users. Experimental results on Twitter-Foursquare dataset demonstrate that UPON and E-UPON outperform the state-of-the-art models.},

  abstract = {The Web of Things (WoT) is a network that facilitates the formation and distribution of information its users make. Young people nowadays, digital natives, have no trouble relating to others or joining groups online since they have grown up in a world where new technology has pushed communications to a nearly real-time level. Shared private messages, rumours, and sexual comments are all examples of online harassment that have led to several recent cases worldwide. Therefore, academics have been more interested in finding ways to recognise bullying conduct on these platforms. The effects of cyberbullying, a terrible form of online misbehaviour, are distressing. It takes several documents, but the text is predominant on social networks. Intelligent systems are required for the automatic detection of such occurrences. Most previous research has used standard machine-learning techniques to tackle this issue. The increasing pervasiveness of cyberbullying in WoT and other social media platforms is a significant cause for worry that calls for robust responses to prevent further harm. This study offers a unique method of leveraging the deep learning (DL) model binary coyote optimization-based Convolutional Neural Network (BCNN) in social networks to identify and classify cyberbullying. An essential part of this method is the combination of DL-based abuse detection and feature subset selection. To efficiently detect and address cases of cyberbullying via social media, the proposed system incorporates many crucial steps, including preprocessing, feature selection, and classification. A binary coyote optimization (BCO)-based feature subset selection method is presented to enhance classification efficiency. To improve the accuracy of cyberbullying categorization, the BCO algorithm efficiently chooses a selection of key characteristics. Cyberbullying must be tracked and classified across all internet channels, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is constructed. With a best-case accuracy of 99.5% on Formspring, 99.7% on Twitter, and 99.3% on Wikipedia, the suggested algorithm successfully identified the vast majority of cyberbullying content.},

A key bottleneck in such distributed systems is the high communication overhead for exchanging information, such as stochastic gradients, between workers. The inherent causes of this bottleneck are the frequent communication rounds and the full model gradient transmission in every round. In this study, we present SASG, a communication-efficient distributed algorithm that enjoys the advantages of sparse communication and adaptive aggregated stochastic gradients. By dynamically determining the workers who need to communicate through an adaptive aggregation rule and sparsifying the transmitted information, the SASG algorithm reduces both the overhead of communication rounds and the number of communication bits in the distributed system. For the theoretical analysis, we introduce an important auxiliary variable and define a new Lyapunov function to prove that the communication-efficient algorithm is convergent. The convergence result is identical to the sublinear rate of stochastic gradient descent, and our result also reveals that SASG scales well with the number of distributed workers. Finally, experiments on training deep neural networks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce communication overhead compared to previous methods.},

  abstract = {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for graph representation learning, but they face challenges when applied to large-scale graphs due to substantial computational costs and memory requirements. To address scalability limitations, various methods have been proposed, including sampling-based and decoupling-based methods. However, these methods have their limitations: sampling-based methods inevitably discard some link information during the sampling process, while decoupling-based methods require alterations to the model&#39;s structure, reducing their adaptability to various GNNs. This paper proposes a novel graph pooling method, Graph Partial Pooling (GPPool), for scaling GNNs to large-scale graphs. GPPool is a versatile and straightforward technique that enhances training efficiency while simultaneously reducing memory requirements. GPPool constructs small-scale pooled graphs by pooling partial nodes into supernodes. Each pooled graph consists of supernodes and unpooled nodes, preserving valuable local and global information. Training GNNs on these graphs reduces memory demands and enhances their performance. Additionally, this paper provides a theoretical analysis of training GNNs using GPPool-constructed graphs from a graph diffusion perspective. It shows that a GNN can be transformed from a large-scale graph into pooled graphs with minimal approximation error. A series of experiments on datasets of varying scales demonstrates the effectiveness of GPPool.},

  abstract = {Spatial crowdsourcing is a distributed computing paradigm that utilizes the collective intelligence of workers to perform complex tasks. How to achieve privacy-preserving task assignment in spatial crowdsourcing applications has been a popular research area. However, most of the existing task assignment schemes may reveal private and sensitive information of tasks or workers. Few schemes can support task assignment based on different attributes simultaneously, such as spatial, interest, etc. To study the above themes, in this paper, we propose one privacy-preserving task assignment scheme with multi-threshold range search for spatial crowdsourcing applications (TAMT). Specifically, we first define euclidean distance-based location search and Hamming distance-based interest search, which map the demands of the tasks and the interests of the workers into the binary vectors. Second, we deploy PKD-tree to index the task data leveraging the pivoting techniques and the triangular inequality of euclidean distance, and propose an efficient multi-threshold range search algorithm based on matrix encryption and decomposition technology. Furthermore, based on DT-PKC, we introduce a ciphertext-based secure comparison protocol to support multi-threshold range search for spatial crowdsourcing applications. Finally, comprehensive security analysis proves that our proposed TAMT is privacy-preserving. Meanwhile, theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation demonstrate that TAMT is practical and efficient.},

Cloud computing is the most suitable option to efficiently perform hierarchical clustering over numerous data.

Privacy-preserving hierarchical clustering protocol in an outsourced computing environment has never been proposed in existing works. Existing protocols have several problems that limit the number of participating data owners or disclose the information of data. In this article, we propose a parallelly running and privacy-preserving agglomerative hierarchical clustering (ppAHC) over the union of datasets of multiple data owners in an outsourced computing environment, which is the first protocol to the best of our knowledge. The proposed ppAHC does not disclose any information about input and output, including the data access patterns. The proposed ppAHC is highly efficient and suitable for Big Data analysis to handle numerous data since its cost for one round is independent of the amount of data.

Current packet-based approaches analyze packets independently, overlooking the sequential nature of network communication. This results in biased models that exhibit increased false negatives and positives. Additionally, most literature-proposed packet-based NIDS capture only payload data, neglecting crucial information from packet headers. This oversight can impair the ability to identify header-level attacks, such as denial-of-service attacks. To address these limitations, we propose a novel artificial intelligence-enabled methodological framework for packet-based NIDS that effectively analyzes header and payload data and considers temporal connections among packets. Our framework transforms sequential packets into two-dimensional images. It then develops a convolutional neural network-based intrusion detection model to process these images and detect malicious activities. Through experiments using publicly available big datasets, we demonstrate that our framework is able to achieve high detection rates of 97.7% to 99% across different attack types and displays promising resilience against adversarial examples.},

Privacy and confidentiality in Big Data aims to enable data analysis and machine learning on large-scale datasets without compromising the dataset sensitive information. Usually current Big Data analytics models either efficiently achieves privacy or confidentiality. In this article, we aim to design a novel blockchain-enabled secured collaborative machine learning approach that provides privacy and confidentially on large scale datasets generated by IoT devices. Blockchain is used as secured platform to store and access data as well as to provide immutability and traceability. We also propose an efficient approach to obtain robust machine learning model through use of cryptographic techniques and differential privacy in which the data among involved parties is shared in a secured way while maintaining privacy and confidentiality of the data. The experimental evaluation along with security and performance analysis show that the proposed approach provides accuracy and scalability without compromising the privacy and security.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, as human activities are shifting to social media, fake news detection has been a crucial problem. Existing methods ignore the classification difference in online news and cannot take full advantage of multi-classification knowledges. For example, when coping with a post “A mouse is frightened by a cat,” a model that learns “computer” knowledge tends to misunderstand “mouse” and give a fake label, but a model that learns “animal” knowledge tends to give a true label. Therefore, this research proposes a multi-classification division-aggregation framework to detect fake news, named $CKA$, which innovatively learns classification knowledges during training stages and aggregates them during prediction stages. It consists of three main components: a news characterizer, an ensemble coordinator, and a truth predictor. The news characterizer is responsible for extracting news features and obtaining news classifications. Cooperating with the news characterizer, the ensemble coordinator generates classification-specifical models for the maximum reservation of classification knowledges during the training stage, where each classification-specifical model maximizes the detection performance of fake news on corresponding news classifications. Further, to aggregate the classification knowledges during the prediction stage, the truth predictor uses the truth discovery technology to aggregate the predictions from different classification-specifical models based on reliability evaluation of classification-specifical models. Extensive experiments prove that our proposed $CKA$ outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in fake news detection.},

  abstract = {Social events reflect the dynamics of society and, here, natural disasters and emergencies receive significant attention. The timely detection of these events can provide organisations and individuals with valuable information to reduce or avoid losses. However, due to the complex heterogeneities of the content and structure of social media, existing models can only learn limited information; large amounts of semantic and structural information are ignored. In addition, due to high labour costs, it is rare for social media datasets to include high-quality labels, which also makes it challenging for models to learn information from social media. In this study, we propose two hyperbolic graph representation-based methods for detecting social events from heterogeneous social media environments. For cases where a dataset has labels, we design a Hyperbolic Social Event Detection (HSED) model that converts complex social information into a unified social message graph. This model addresses the heterogeneity of social media, and, with this graph, the information in social media can be used to capture structural information based on the properties of hyperbolic space. For cases where the dataset is unlabelled, we design an Unsupervised Hyperbolic Social Event Detection (UHSED). This model is based on the HSED model but includes graph contrastive learning to make it work in unlabelled scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approaches.},

First, a new unsupervised feature selection framework based on evolutionary computation is designed, in which the feature subspace learning and the population search mechanism are combined into a unified unsupervised feature selection. Second, a local manifold structure learning strategy and a sample pseudo-label learning strategy are presented to calculate the importance of the selected feature subspace. Third, the binary differential evolution algorithm is developed to optimize the selected feature subspace, in which the binary information migration mutation operator and the adaptive crossover operator are designed to promote the searching for the global optimal feature subspace. Experimental results on various types of real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can obtain more informative feature subset and competitive cluster performance compared with eight state-of-the-art unsupervised feature selection methods.},

However, the application of crowdsourcing learning still faces several challenges such as the low quality of crowd labels and the urgent requirement for learning models adapting to the label noises. There have been many studies focusing on truth inference algorithms to improve the quality of labels obtained by crowdsourcing. Comparably, end-to-end predictive model learning in crowdsourcing scenarios, especially using cutting-edge deep learning techniques, is still in its infant stage. In this paper, we propose a novel graph convolutional network-based framework, namely CGNNAT, which models the correlation of instances by combining the GCN model with an attention mechanism to learn more representative node embeddings for a better understanding of the bias tendency of crowd workers. Furthermore, a specific projection processing layer is employed in CGNNAT to model the reliability of each crowd worker, which makes the model an end-to-end neural network directly trained by noisy crowd labels. Experimental results on several real-world and synthetic datasets show that the proposed CGNNAT outperforms state-of-the-art and classical methods in terms of label prediction.},

This network is suitable for multiple data sources and can augment participants’ local data. Second, to address the problem of learning divergence caused by different local distributions of multiple data sources, this study proposes the aggregation algorithm FedKL. It aggregates the feedback of the local discriminator to interact with the generator and learns the local data distribution more accurately. Finally, given the problem of data waste caused by the unavailability of nonoverlapping data, this study proposes a data augmentation method called VFeDA. It uses FeCGAN to generate pseudo features and expands more overlapping data, thereby improving the data use.

  abstract = {The image hosting platform is becoming increasingly popular due to its user-friendly features, but it is prone to causing privacy concerns. Only protecting privacy, in fact, can be easy to come true, but usability is frequently sacrificed. Visual privacy protection schemes aim to make a balance between privacy and usability, whereas they are often irreversible. Recently, some reversible visual privacy protection schemes have been proposed by preserving thumbnails (known as TPE). However, they either have excessive states in the Markov chain modeled by the scheme or cannot reverse losslessly. Meanwhile, images encrypted by existing TPE schemes can not embed additional information and thus the usability is limited to visual observation. In view of this, we pertinently propose a reversible and usability-enhanced visual privacy protection scheme (called PR3) based on thumbnail preservation and data hiding. In this scheme, we utilize the sum-preserving data embedding algorithm to substitute the the lowest seven bits of the image without changing the sum. Any data overflow resulting from the above process is stored in the vacated space of the most significant bits. The remaining space serves two purposes: embedding additional information and adjusting the image to approximate the thumbnail. Compared with existing TPE works, PR3 has fewer states in the Markov chain and supports lossless recovery of images. In addition, additional information can be embedded in the encrypted image to enhance usability.},

We have implemented a distributed algorithm in Apache Spark that evaluates a Human PPI network of $\sim \!\! 180$ million potential interactions resulting from 18 994 reviewed proteins for which Gene Ontology (GO) annotations are available. The computed scores have been validated against state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.

The resulting scores are published with a web server for non-commercial use at http://fuzzyppi.mimuw.edu.pl/. Moreover, conventional PPI prediction methods produce binary results, but in fact this is just a simplification as PPIs have strengths or probabilities and recent studies show that protein binding affinities may prove to be effective in detecting protein complexes, disease association analysis, signaling network reconstruction, etc. Keeping these in mind, our algorithm is based on a fuzzy semantic scoring function and produces probabilities of interaction.},

The benefits of IoT are evident, but cyber terrorism and security concerns inhibit many organizations and users from deploying it. Cyber-physical systems that are IoT-enabled might be difficult to secure since security solutions designed for general information/operational technology systems may not work as well in an environment. Thus, deep learning (DL) can assist as a powerful tool for building IoT-enabled cyber-physical systems with automatic anomaly detection. In this paper, two distinct DL models have been employed i.e., Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), considered hybrid classifiers, to create a framework for detecting attacks in IoT-enabled cyber-physical systems. However, DL models need to be trained in such a way that will increase their classification accuracy. Therefore, this paper also aims to present a new hybrid optimization algorithm called “Seagull Adapted Elephant Herding Optimization” (SAEHO) to tune the weights of the hybrid classifier. The “Hybrid Classifier + SAEHO” framework takes the feature extracted dataset as an input and classifies the network as either attack or benign. Using sensitivity, precision, accuracy, and specificity, two datasets were compared. In every performance metric, the proposed framework outperforms conventional methods.},

This paper proposes WaWoT, a Wasm-based framework for flexible and efficient Web of Things services. WaWoT allows flexible WoT service development using annotations and automatic partitioning. It also enables dynamic service migration using WebAssembly modules to adapt placement between IoT devices and web clients. We also introduce an ahead-of-time compiler optimized for low memory usage through techniques like streamed compilation and trimming. For energy efficiency, we use optimizations like bulk instruction writing and direct I/O accessing. Safety is ensured through compile-time and run-time analyses to guarantee sandboxed execution. Evaluations demonstrate WaWoT exhibits better flexibility than existing WoT development approaches. Furthermore, WaWoT can also reduce RAM usage by 84.9x and energy consumption by 1.9x-4.9x over existing WebAssembly runtimes.

  abstract     = {While vision transformers (ViTs) have continued to achieve new milestones in computer vision, their complicated network architectures with high computation and memory costs have hindered their deployment on resource-limited edge devices. Some customized accelerators have been proposed to accelerate the execution of ViTs, achieving improved performance with reduced energy consumption. However, these approaches utilize flattened attention mechanisms and ignore the inherent hierarchical visual semantics in images. In this work, we conduct a thorough analysis of hierarchical visual semantics in real-world images, revealing opportunities and challenges of leveraging visual semantics to accelerate ViTs. We propose ReViT, a systematic algorithm and architecture co-design approach, which aims to exploit the visual semantics to accelerate ViTs. Our proposed algorithm can leverage the same semantic class with strong feature similarity to reduce computation and communication in a differential attention mechanism, and support the semantic-aware attention efficiently. A novel dedicated architecture is designed to support the proposed algorithm and translate it into performance improvements. Moreover, we propose an efficient execution dataflow to alleviate workload imbalance and maximize hardware utilization. ReViT opens new directions for accelerating ViTs by exploring the underlying visual semantics of images.

  abstract     = {Encrypted databases have been extensively studied with the increasing concern of data privacy in cloud services. For practical efficiency, most encrypted database systems are built under Dynamic Searchable Symmetric Encryption (DSSE) schemes to support fast query and update over encrypted data. However, DSSE schemes allow leakages in their security frameworks, especially access-pattern leakages (i.e., the search results corresponding to queried keywords), which lead to various attacks to infer sensitive information of queries and databases. Existing oblivious-access techniques, such as Oblivious RAM and differential privacy, suffer from excessive communication overhead and loss of query accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new DSSE scheme that enables access-pattern hiding keyword search and update operations. Servers can obliviously query and update databases within only a single communication round. Our building block is based on the Distributed Point Function (DPF), an advanced secret sharing technique that provides provable security guarantees against adversaries with arbitrary background knowledge. Moreover, we devise a novel update protocol that integrates DPF and Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption (SHE) such that servers can obliviously update their local data. We formally analyze the security and implement the prototype. The comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the security and efficiency of our scheme.},

QGCE serves the purpose of rewriting gate circuits comprised of gates from a varying input gate set to gate circuits formed of gates from a fixed target gate set. Analogously, QGCC serves the purpose of finding an approximation to the concatenation of two arbitrary elements of a varying list of input gate circuits in terms of another element from the same list. Problems of this kind occur regularly in quantum computing and are often assumed an easy task for the digital computers controlling the quantum hardware. Arguably, this belief is due to analogical reasoning: The classical Boolean equivalents of QGCE and QGCC are natively computable on digital hardware. In the present paper, we present two insights in this regard: Upon applying a rigorous theory of computability, QGCE and QGCC turn out to be uncomputable on digital hardware. The results remain valid when we restrict the set of feasible inputs for the relevant functions to one parameter families of fixed gate sets. Our results underline the possibility that several ideas from quantum-computing theory may require a rethinking to become feasible for practical implementation.},

  abstract     = {Finding the triangles of large scale graphs is a fundamental graph mining task in many applications, such as motif detection, microscopic evolution, and link prediction. The recent works on triangle counting can be classified into merge-based or binary search-based paradigms. The merge-based triangle counting paradigm locates the triangles using the set intersection operation, which suffers from the random memory access problem. The binary search-based triangle counting paradigm sets the neighbors of the source vertex of an edge as the lookup array and searches the neighbors of the destination vertex. There are lots of expensive lock operations needed in the binary search-based paradigm, which leads to low thread efficiency. In this paper, we aim to improve the triangle counting efficiency on GPU by designing a lock-free policy named Skiff to implement a hash-based triangle counting algorithm. In Skiff, we first design a hash trie data layout to meet the coalesced memory access model and then propose a lock-free policy to reduce the conflicts of the hash trie. In addition, we use a level array to manage the index of the hash trie to make sure the nodes of the hash trie can be quickly located. Furthermore, we implement a CTA thread organization model to reduce the load imbalance of the real-world graphs. We conducted extensive experiments on NVIDIA GPUs to show the performance of Skiff. The results show that Skiff can achieve a good system performance improvement than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) works.},

Existing memory interfaces must support new PIM commands to utilize PIM, making the definition of PIM commands according to memory modes a major issue in the development of practical PIM products. For performance and OS-transparency, the memory controller is responsible for changing the memory mode, which requires modifying the controller and resolving conflicts with existing functionalities. Additionally, it must operate to minimize mode transition overhead, which can cause significant performance degradation. In this study, we present NPC, a memory controller designed for mode transition PIM that delivers PIM commands via the DDR interface. NPC issues PIM commands while transparently changing the memory mode with a dedicated scheduling policy that reduces the number of mode transitions with aggregative issuing. Moreover, existing functions, such as refresh, are optimized for PIM operation. We implement NPC in hardware and develop a PIM emulation system to validate it on FPGA platforms. Experimental results reveal that NPC is compatible with existing interfaces and functionality, and the proposed scheduling policy improves performance by 2.2$\boldsymbol{\times}$ with balanced fairness, achieving up to 97% of the ideal performance. These findings have the potential to aid the application of PIM in real systems and contribute to the commercialization of mode transition PIM.},

  abstract     = {Developing energy-efficient software that leverages application-level energy optimization techniques is essential to tackle the pressing technological challenge of energy efficiency on modern heterogeneous computing platforms. While energy modelling and optimization of computations have received considerable attention in energy research, there remains a significant gap in the energy modelling of data transfer between computing devices on heterogeneous hybrid platforms. Our study aims to fill this crucial gap. In this work, we comprehensively study the energy consumption of data transfer between a host CPU and a GPU accelerator on heterogeneous hybrid platforms using the three mainstream energy measurement methods: (a) System-level physical measurements based on external power meters (ground-truth), (b) Measurements using on-chip power sensors, and (c) Energy predictive models. The ground-truth method is accurate but prohibitively time-consuming. While the on-chip sensors in Intel multicore CPU processors are inaccurate, the Nvidia GPU sensors do not capture data transfer activity. Therefore, we focus on the third approach and propose a novel methodology to select a small subset of performance events that effectively capture all the energy consumption activities during a data transfer and develop accurate linear energy predictive models employing the shortlisted performance events. Finally, we develop independent and accurate runtime pluggable software energy sensors based on our proposed energy predictive models that employ disjoint sets of performance events to estimate the dynamic energy of computations and data transfers. We employ the sensors to predict the energy consumption of computations and data transfer between a host CPU and two A40 Nvidia GPUs in three parallel scientific applications, and the high accuracy (average prediction error of 5%) of our sensors’ predictions further underscores their practical relevance.},

  abstract     = {An effective auto-scaling framework is essential for microservices to ensure performance stability and resource efficiency under dynamic workloads. As revealed by many prior studies, the key to efficient auto-scaling lies in accurately learning performance patterns, i.e., the relationship between performance metrics and workloads in data-driven schemes. However, we notice that there are two significant challenges in characterizing performance patterns for large-scale microservices. Firstly, diverse microservices demonstrate varying sensitivities to heterogeneous machines, causing difficulty in quantifying the performance difference in a fixed manner. Secondly, frequent version upgrades of microservices result in uncertain changes in performance patterns, known as pattern drifts, leading to imprecise resource capacity estimation issues. To address these challenges, we propose Humas, a heterogeneity- and upgrade-aware auto-scaling framework for large-scale microservices. Firstly, Humas quantifies the difference in resource efficiency among heterogeneous machines for various microservices online and normalizes their resources in standard units. Additionally, Humas develops a least-squares density-difference (LSDD) based algorithm to identify pattern drifts caused by upgrades. Lastly, Humas generates capacity adjustment plans for microservices based on the latest performance patterns and predicted workloads. The experiment results conducted on 50 real microservices with over 11,000 containers demonstrate that Humas improves resource efficiency and performance stability by approximately 30.4% and 48.0%, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art approaches.},

First, it quantitatively profiles available bandwidth resources in BB to ensure reliable QoS, a crucial aspect seldom studied in the literature. Second, RuYi offers fine-grained process-level QoS via an innovative process-to-BB mapping, maximizing resource utilization—something not achievable with conventional coarse-grained compute-to-BB mapping. We evaluated RuYi on a subsystem of the leading exascale supercomputer Sunway, consisting of 4,000 compute nodes and 200 BB nodes. The experimental results demonstrate that RuYi achieves an impressive end-to-end bandwidth control accuracy of 97%, while improving BB utilization by up to 116% compared to conventional coarse-grained compute-to-BB mapping.},

To that end, algorithms such as the CCSDS 123.0-B-2 are implemented on FPGAs, enabling this process in an efficient and fast manner. Single-Event Upsets (SEU) are commonplace in this scenario, e.g. bit flips in the FPGA’s configuration memory which can catastrophically alter the algorithm’s output. In this paper, we propose a fault tolerance technique for this specific case. The compression core is checked periodically by running a golden model designed to excite the full internal datapath based on a synthetic image. A failure in this check will trigger a reconfiguration of the compression core. Results show better detection rates than Dual Modular Redundancy (DMR) at a fraction of the resource cost, proving this technique as a viable alternative.

  abstract     = {Emerging persistent memory (PM) promises near-DRAM performance, larger capacity, and data persistence, attracting researchers to design PM-based key-value stores. However, existing PM-based key-value stores lack awareness of the Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) architecture on PM, where accessing PM on remote NUMA sockets is considerably slower than accessing local PM. This NUMA-unawareness results in sub-optimal performance when scaling on NUMA. Although DRAM caching alleviates this issue, existing cache policies ignore the performance disparity between remote and local PM accesses, keeping remote PM access as a performance bottleneck when scaling PM stores on NUMA. Furthermore, creating hot data views in each socket&#39;s PM fails to eliminate remote PM writes and, worse, induces additional local PM writes. This paper presents NStore, a high-performance NUMA-aware key-value store for the PM-DRAM hybrid memory. NStore introduces a NUMA-aware cache replacement strategy, called Remote Access First (RAF) cache in DRAM, to minimize remote PM accesses. In addition, NStore deploys Nlog, a write-optimized log-structured persistent storage, purposed to eliminate remote PM writes. NStore further mitigates the NUMA impacts through localized scan operations, efficient garbage collection, and multi-thread recovery for Nlog. Evaluations show that NStore outperforms state-of-the-art PM-based key-value stores, achieving up to 13.9$\times$ and 11.2$\times$ higher write and read throughput, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus is a critical problem in parallel and distributed computing systems, particularly with potential adversaries. Most prior work on BFT consensus assumes reliable message delivery and tolerates arbitrary failures of up to $\frac{n}{3}$ nodes out of $n$ total nodes. However, many systems face unpredictable message delivery failures. This paper investigates the impact of unpredictable message delivery failures on the BFT consensus problem. We propose Nicaea, a novel protocol enabling consensus among loyal nodes when the number of Byzantine nodes is below a new threshold, given by: $\frac{\left(2-\rho\right)\left(1-\rho\right)^{2n-2}-1}{\left(2-\rho\right) \left(1-\rho\right)^{2n-2}+1}n$, where $\rho$ denotes the message failure rate. Theoretical proofs and experimental results validate Nicaea&#39;s Byzantine resilience. Our findings reveal a fundamental trade-off: as message delivery instability increases, a system&#39;s tolerance to Byzantine failures decreases. The well-known $\frac{n}{3}$ threshold under reliable message delivery is a special case of our generalized threshold when $\rho=0$.

  abstract     = {Data sharing is ubiquitous in the metaverse, which adopts blockchain as its foundation. Blockchain is employed because it enables data transparency, achieves tamper resistance, and supports smart contracts. However, securely sharing data based on blockchain necessitates further consideration. Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) is a promising primitive to provide confidentiality and fine-grained access control. Nonetheless, authority accountability and key abuse are critical issues that practical applications must address. Few studies have considered CP-ABE key confidentiality and authority accountability simultaneously. To our knowledge, we are the first to fill this gap by integrating non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) proofs into CP-ABE keys and outsourcing the verification process to a smart contract. To meet the decentralization requirement, we incorporate a decentralized CP-ABE scheme into the proposed data sharing system. Additionally, we provide an implementation based on smart contract to determine whether an access control policy is satisfied by a set of CP-ABE keys. We also introduce an open incentive mechanism to encourage honest participation in data sharing. Hence, the key abuse issue is resolved through the NIZK proof and the incentive mechanism. We provide a theoretical analysis and conduct comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the data sharing system. Based on the proposed accountable approach, we further illustrate an application in GameFi, where players can play to earn or contribute to an accountable DAO, fostering a thriving metaverse ecosystem.},

  abstract     = {Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus protocols are gaining attention for their resilience against network attacks. Among them, Multi-valued Byzantine Agreement (MVBA) protocols play a critical role, which accepts input values from each replica and returns a consistent output. The state-of-the-art MVBA protocol, sMVBA, has a good-case latency of $6\delta$ and an expected bad-case latency of $12\delta$, with $\delta$ representing the network delay. Additionally, sMVBA exhibits a communication of $O(n^{2})$ in both good and bad cases. Although it outperforms other MVBA protocols, sMVBA still lags behind partially-synchronous counterparts. For instance, PBFT achieves a good-case latency of $3\delta$, and HotStuff boasts a good-case communication of $O(n)$. This paper introduces a novel MVBA protocol, Pako, aiming for performance comparable to partially-synchronous protocols. Pako leverages an existing MVBA protocol as a black box and introduces an additional view with an optimistic path to commit values efficiently. Two Pako variants, Pako1 and Pako2, provide a trade-off between latency and communication. To be more specific, Pako1 achieves a good-case latency of $3\delta$ with $O(n^{2})$ communication, while Pako2 reduces the communication to $O(n)$ with a slightly higher good-case latency of $5\delta$. A series of experiments demonstrate Pako&#39;s significant outperformance of counterparts.},

If an attack is unsuccessful, that could be due to multiple reasons. It can be that we are indeed dealing with a resistant implementation, but it is possible that the deep learning model used is faulty. In this contribution, we formalize two conditions, persistence and patience, for a deep learning model to be optimal and we propose an early stopping algorithm that reliably recognizes the model&#39;s optimal state during training. The novelty of our solution is in an efficient implementation of guessing entropy estimation as a success metric used to measure the strength of a side-channel adversary.

  abstract     = {Secure processors with hardware-enforced isolation are crucial for secure cloud computation. However, commercial secure processors have underestimated the capabilities of attackers and failed to provide secure execution environments capable of protecting sensitive information against side-channel attacks. Remote Attestation protocols based on traditional signature schemes are not secure under side-channel attacks anymore since their secret keys can be leaked. Previously, Key-Insulated Schemes (KIS) have been introduced to mitigate the damage caused by secret key exposure in cryptosystems by breaking the lifetime of secret keys into independent sessions. KIS protect the security of all other sessions if any session keys are compromised, however, provide no security guarantees for a compromised session. We introduce a new cryptographic primitive called One-Time Signature with Secret Key Exposure (OTS-SKE), which ensures no one can forge a valid signature of a new message or nonce even if all secret session keys are leaked. OTS-SKE enables us to sign attestation reports securely under a powerful adversary who can observe all digital states in secure enclaves through side-channel attacks. We also minimize the trusted computing base by introducing a secure co-processor that is only responsible for key generation into the system. Our experiments show that the signing of OTS-SKE is faster than KIS as well as Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) used in Intel SGX.},

  abstract     = {A cryptographic implementation produces very similar power leakages when fed with the same input. Side-channel collision attacks exploit these similarities to establish the relationship between sub-keys and improve the efficiency of key recovery. Benefiting from independence of leakage model, they play an important role in non-profiled setting. However, performance of existing approaches against single collision value is still sub-optimal and optimization is promising. Motivated by this, we first theoretically analyze the mathematical dependency between the number of collisions and the number of encryptions, and propose an efficient side-channel attack named Collision-Paired Correlation Attack (CPCA) to guarantee that the side with fewer samples in a collision is completely paired in low noise scenario. This allows overcoming the inefficient utilization of information in existing works. Moreover, to further employ underlying informativeness, we maximize collision pairs as many as possible. This optimization significantly improves performance of CPCA and thereby extends it to large noise scenarios. Finally, to achieve moderate computational complexity, two equivalent variants of CPCA are investigated to address the potential problem of limited computing resources. Our further theoretical study illustrates that CPCA provides the upper security bound of Correlation-Enhanced Collision Attack (CECA), and experimental results fully verify its superiority.},

  abstract     = {Besides enormous research efforts in the design of Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs), its vulnerabilities are still being exploited using machine learning (ML) based model-building attacks. Due to inherent complicacy in exploring and manually converging to a strong PUF composition, the challenge of building ML-attack resistant PUFs continues. Hence, it becomes imperative to develop an automated framework that can formally assess the learnability of different PUF constructions and compositions to guide the designer to explore resilient PUFs. In this work, we present an automated analysis framework ($\mathtt{PARLE}$-$\mathtt{G}$), to formally represent and evaluate the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learnability of PUF constructions and their compositions. A high-level specification language $\mathtt{PUF}$-$\mathtt{G}$ has been developed to structurally represent any PUF composition comprising a specified set of primitive components and composition operations. The tool takes a PUF design represented in $\mathtt{PUF}$-$\mathtt{G}$ language as input and returns its PAC learnability result, identifying a suitable PAC learning algorithm and the PAC model parameters based on the input PUF design. PUF designs proven to be learnable by $\mathtt{PARLE}$-$\mathtt{G}$ are segregated into different classes based on the asymptotic complexity of their learnability bounds. Such automated analysis helps a designer to make informed design choices, thereby strengthening a PUF construction from the architectural level.},

Existing studies leverage FPGA platforms to characterize RowHammer, which have identified key factors that contribute to RowHammer bit flips, e.g., data pattern. As the FPGA-based studies have removed the interference of the OS and the memory controller, their findings on the identified contributing factors do not always work as reported in a real-world computing system, resulting in negative effects on system-level RowHammer attacks and defenses. In this paper, we carry out a system-level empirical study on factors from both the software side and the DRAM side that contribute to RowHammer. We conduct the study on 33 DRAM modules including both DDR4 and DDR3, with 292 DRAM chips from various vendors. Our experimental results from the software side show that some prior findings about existing factors are inconsistent with our observations, thus not applicable to a real-world system. Also, we contribute to identifying one new factor that effectively affects RowHammer bit flips. Our DRAM-side results identify three types of new contributing factors and indicate that DRAM modules are more vulnerable if they achieve better performance and lower power consumption. Particularly, Intel XMP, intended for improving DRAM performance, might be abused for RowHammer attacks.},

Different countermeasures against these attacks have been published, many of which rely on masking where sensitive information is split into multiple shares. Here, the information is hidden in higher statistical moments of the leakage if processed at the same time (univariate) or in combinations of side-channel information from different points in time (multivariate) if processed sequentially. Test Vector Leakage Assessment (TVLA) is a common evaluation technique to address the growing number of specific attacks. However, the assessment of multivariate leakage requires the evaluation of all possible combinations of sample points, massively slowing down the evaluation and in turn the development of countermeasures due to computational complexity. In this work, we develop and compare techniques to determine clock cycle combinations that leak information in a multivariate setting. We develop an efficient multivariate assessment framework and show how this approach can be used to generate evaluation results that satisfy a desired confidence level. Eventually, we demonstrate the practical relevance of our approach by applying it to two masked implementations of block ciphers.},

This problem becomes more serious when incorporating ORAM and SGX to design oblivious SSE schemes such as POSUP (Hoang et al., 2019) and Oblidb (Eskandarian and Zaharia, 2019) which can defend against inference attacks. The main reason comes from high round communication complexity of ORAM and constrained trusted memory created by SGX. To overcome this performance bottleneck, we propose a set of novel SSE constructions with realistic security/performance trade-offs. Our core idea is to encode the keyword-identifier pairs into a bloom filter to reduce the number of ORAM operations during the search procedure. Specifically, Construction 1 loads the bloom filter into the enclave sequentially, which outperforms about $1.7\times$ when the dataset is large compared with the performance of the baseline that directly combines ORAM and SGX. To further improve the performance of Construction 1, Construction 2 classifies keywords into groups and stores these groups in different bloom filters. By additionally leaking the keywords in search token belonging to which groups, Construction 2 outperforms Construction 1 by $16.5\sim 36.8\times$ and provides an improvement of at least one order over state-of-the-art oblivious protocols.},

One such cyber threat is a hardware Trojan (HT), a malicious modification to an IC. HTs are often identified during the hardware manufacturing process but should be removed earlier in the design process. Machine learning-based HT detection in gate-level netlists is an efficient approach to identifying HTs at the early stage. However, feature-based modeling has limitations in terms of discovering an appropriate set of HT features. We thus propose NHTD-GL in this paper, a novel node-wise HT detection method based on graph learning (GL). Given the formal analysis of the HT features obtained from domain knowledge, NHTD-GL bridges the gap between graph representation learning and feature-based HT detection. The experimental results demonstrate that NHTD-GL achieves 0.998 detection accuracy and 0.921 F1-score and outperforms state-of-the-art node-wise HT detection methods. NHTD-GL extracts HT features without heuristic feature engineering.},

  abstract     = {Muscle force and morphology information offer complementary perspectives for gesture recognition and its applications. Surface Electromyography (sEMG) provides force and electrophysiological information associated with muscles, while A-mode ultrasound (AUS) reveals muscle morphological information. By leveraging these two modalities, more comprehensive muscle motor unit information relevant to gesture recognition can be obtained. In this article, we introduce the adaptive weight classification (AWC) module and its enhanced version with hierarchical classifiers, adaptive weight hierarchical soft voting (AWHSV), to integrate AUS and sEMG into a fused modality. This approach dynamically adjusts the weights of individual and fused features, compensating for lost details during fusion, leading to a richer information representation and significantly improving algorithm robustness in gesture recognition. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves recognition rates that are 0.66%, 2.36%, and 1.30% higher than those of its counterparts using sEMG, AUS, and sEMG-AUS, respectively. Moreover, the method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, confirming its effectiveness in gesture recognition across both single and multiple modalities. This work demonstrates the advantages of the proposed AWHSV method, providing broader application scenarios for gesture recognition.},

  abstract     = {A dynamic event-triggered load frequency control (LFC) is studied for interconnected multiarea power systems (IMAPSs) with stochastic semi-Markov parameters from the perspective of finite-time interval. To facilitate the sudden changes, the underlying semi-Markov process (SMP) is adopted to characterize the random behavior of IMAPSs. A dynamic event-triggered protocol (DETP) is developed to modulate the transmission frequency while maintaining predefined system performance. Owing to complicated grid environment, the hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) is proposed to solve the asynchronization between the system mode and the controller mode, which forms a new asynchronous mechanism to better understand the behavior pattern of the system. The novelty of this article is to construct a suitable asynchronous control strategy to solve the mismatch between the system mode and the controller mode under the framework of IMAPSs. Different from static event-triggered protocol (ETP), the DETP is proposed, in which the threshold parameters can be dynamically adjusted to reduce the waste of communication resources and achieve dynamic performance in limited time. According to the stochastic system theory and the finite-time theory, by constructing a modular dependent random Lyapunov function, sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure the finite-time boundedness of the corresponding system with $H_{\infty }$ performance. Finally, the efficiency is demonstrated through three-area power systems.},

Since then, in order to further streamline the intricacies of controller design, this work is extended to self-triggered cases to alleviate the need for hardware devices to continuously monitor signals.

  abstract     = {To alleviate data distribution under different operating conditions, domain generalization (DG) has been applied in mechanical diagnosis. Still, its effectiveness is limited when unknown fault states appear in the target domain. Consequently, open set DG (OSDG) has emerged to identify unknown classes in unknown domains. However, data collection costs and safety concerns have resulted in a significant class imbalance in OSDG. This imbalance causes the decision boundary to be skewed toward abundant positive classes, ultimately leading to misclassifying unknown states and increasing security risks. Currently, there is a lack of methods to simultaneously address domain shift and class shift in an imbalanced unknown domain. To tackle this issue, this article proposes a multisource domain-class gradient coordination meta-learning (MDGCML) framework, which can learn the generalized boundaries of all tasks by coordinating gradients between interdomains and interclasses. Based on the MDGCML, a joint learning paradigm involving the sharing of parameters between open-set classifiers and closed-set classifiers is constructed to enable quick adaption of the model to unknown domains. The superior performance of the proposed framework has been verified on two datasets.},

Scholars have proposed various effective constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (CMOEAs) for such problems. However, most existing algorithms overlook the differences between different decision variables in influencing the degree of constraint violation and still lack an effective handling mechanism for constraint-sensitive variables. To address this issue, a two-stage cooperation multiobjective evolutionary algorithm guided by constraint-sensitive variables (CV-TCMOEA) is proposed. In the first stage, a relatively simple auxiliary problem with only a few dominant constraints is constructed to approximate the original problem. After obtaining a set of approximate Pareto optimal solutions by dealing with the auxiliary problem, in the second stage, a constraint-sensitive variable-guided multistrategy cooperation search method is developed. In this method, decision variables are divided into two types: 1) constraint-sensitive and 2) constraint-insensitive variables, and a variable-type-guided cooperative individual update strategy is proposed to autonomously select appropriate search strategies for different types of variables. Experimental results on 28 benchmark functions and 10 engineering problems demonstrated the superiority of the CV-TCMOEA over seven state-of-the-art CMOEAs.},

  abstract     = {Subspace clustering has attracted significant interest for its capacity to partition high-dimensional data into multiple subspaces. The current approaches to subspace clustering predominantly revolve around two key aspects: 1) the construction of an effective similarity matrix and 2) the pursuit of sparsity within the projection matrix. However, assessing whether the dimensionality of the projected subspace is the true dimensionality of the data is challenging. Therefore, the clustering performance may decrease when dealing with scenarios such as subspace overlap, insufficient projected dimensions, data noise, etc., since the defined dimensionality of the projected lower-dimensional space may deviate significantly from its true value. In this research, we introduce a novel reweighting strategy, which is applied to projected coordinates for the first time and propose a reweighted subspace clustering model guided by the preservation of the both local and global structural characteristics (RWSC). The projected subspaces are reweighted to augment or suppress the importance of different coordinates, so that data with overlapping subspaces can be better distinguished and the redundant coordinates produced by the predefined number of projected dimensions can be further removed. By introducing reweighting strategies, the bias caused by imprecise dimensionalities in subspace clustering can be alleviated. Moreover, global scatter structure preservation and adaptive local structure learning are integrated into the proposed model, which helps RWSC capture more intrinsic structures and its robustness and applicability can then be improved. Through rigorous experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, the effectiveness and superiority of RWSC are empirically verified.},

  abstract     = {In data stream (DS) learning, the system has to extract knowledge from data generated continuously, usually at high speed and in large volumes, making it impossible to store the entire set of data to be processed in batch mode. Hence, machine learning models must be built incrementally by processing the incoming examples, as data arrive, while updating the model to be compatible with the current data. In fuzzy DS clustering, the model can either absorb incoming data into existing clusters or initiate a new cluster. As the volume of data increases, there is a possibility that the clusters will overlap to the point where it is convenient to merge two or more clusters into one. Then, a cluster comparison measure (CM) should be applied, to decide whether such clusters should be combined, also in an incremental manner. This defines an incremental fusion process based on aggregation functions that can aggregate the incoming inputs without storing all the previous inputs. The objective of this article is to solve the fuzzy DS clustering problem of incrementally comparing fuzzy clusters on a formal basis. First, we formalize and operationalize incremental fusion processes of fuzzy clusters by introducing recursively extendable (RE) aggregation functions, studying construction methods and different classes of such functions. Second, we propose two approaches to compare clusters: 1) similarity and 2) overlapping between clusters, based on RE aggregation functions. Finally, we analyze the effect of those incremental CMs on the online and offline phases of the well-known fuzzy clustering algorithm d-FuzzStream, showing that our new approach outperforms the original algorithm and presents better or comparable performance to other state-of-the-art DS clustering algorithms found in the literature.},

However, fully unifying inspection and production systems to effectively address assembly-related quality issues remains a challenge. This study seeks to close these gaps by introducing collaborative optimization methods to ensure seamless operations. The research is driven by the need for precise control of key assembly parameters, such as placement height, x-offset, y-offset, rotation angle deviations, and blowing durations, all of which are major contributors to defects. To address these challenges, we propose a self-adaptive collaborative optimization (SACO) framework that prioritizes enhancements based on their impact on both quality and efficiency. The SACO framework combines customized Bayesian optimization and particle swarm optimization techniques, allowing for dynamic adjustments to process parameters, guided by real-time data from automatic optical inspection (AOI) systems. The primary goal of this study is to reduce defects and improve efficiency in the SMT assembly process through these targeted improvements. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, demonstrating significant advancements in placement accuracy and overall assembly efficiency. Our findings confirm that the SACO framework provides a robust solution to persistent challenges in SMT production, addressing critical gaps in quality control and process optimization.},

Additionally, fractional differential calculus is based on differentiation and integration of arbitrary fractional order, which can more accurately describe the physical phenomenon model than the traditional integer calculus. Thus, this article proposes a novel fractional-order extended Kalman filter (FOEKF) based on the evolutionary algorithm and deep ensemble learning techniques for the state estimation problem of CPPSs from the fractional-order theory perspective. First, the power system is modeled as a fractional version to describe the physical phenomenon better according to the fractional differential calculus theory. Then, considering the difficulties in determining fractional orders in the fractional-order power system, a deep ensemble learning-based approach is used to design the fitness function and a genetic algorithm is developed to determine these parameters by optimizing the designed objective function. Furthermore, to solve the difficulties in estimating for fractional-order power system by integral extended Kalman filter (EKF), the evolutionary FOEKF (EFOEKF) is presented as the estimator for the designed fractional-order power system. Finally, to improve the performance of EFOEKF under bad datum scenarios caused by cyber-attacks or sudden loads, an enhanced EFOEKF method is developed by using an adapted exponential weighting function. The numerical simulation results show that the proposed EFOEKF is better than EKF and FOEKF on four different IEEE bus systems in terms of the mean absolute error.},

By means of the compressed sensing (CS) theory and a diffusion strategy, we propose a compressed distributed Kalman filter (CDKF). That is, each sensor first compresses the original high-dimensional regression data. Then, the covariance intersection fusion rule is utilized to obtain a distributed Kalman filter (DKF) estimate in the compressed low-dimensional space. Afterward, the original high-dimensional sparse state vector can be well recovered by a reconstruction technique. In terms of stability analysis, one of the main difficulties lies in analyzing the product of nonindependent and nonstationary random matrices in the context of time-varying communication topologies. Relying on the stochastic stability theory, the Markov chain theory, and the CS theory, we establish the upper bound for the estimation error under the compressed cooperative excitation condition, which is much weaker than the traditional uncompressed collective observability conditions used in the existing literature. Finally, we provide a simulation example to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a policy-iteration-based active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) is proposed for uncertain nonlinear systems to achieve real-time output tracking performance, regardless of the specific relative degree of the system. The approach integrates a partial control input generator with a policy-iteration-based reinforcement learning (RL) agent for degree weight adjustment. The partial control input generator includes each ith order partial control input, which is constructed following the ADRC design framework for an ith order system. The RL agent adjusts the degree weights (its actions) to enhance the dominance of the partial control input corresponding to the unknown relative degree through iterative policy refinement. The RL agent is designed to minimize the quadratic reward as the performance index function while enhancing the influence of the partial control input associated with the correct relative degree via the policy iteration procedure. All signals in the closed-loop system (including the time-varying degree weights) ensure semi-global uniformly ultimately boundness using the Lyapunov stability theorem and the affinely quadratically stable property. Consequently, the degree weight adjustments by the RL agent do not affect the closed-loop stability. The proposed method does not require system dynamics, specific relative degree, external disturbances, and other state variable sensing beyond output sensing. The performance of the proposed method was validated via simulations for two different-order uncertain nonlinear systems and experiments using a permanent magnet synchronous motor testbed.},

  abstract     = {The coordination of distributed energy resources (DERs) within virtual power plants (VPPs) is expected to generate significant economic benefits and enhance the operational stability of modern power systems. However, achieving massive coordination of heterogeneous and uncertain DERs remains a challenge in current research. To address this issue, this article proposes a novel bi-level optimization approach based on mean-field reinforcement learning (MFRL) to enable the coordination of massive DERs in VPPs. The problem is decomposed into multiple subproblems: the upper-level subproblem models power dispatch among integrated energy systems (IESs) in response to coordinated demand, while a series of lower-level subproblems determine the operational schemes of DERs within individual IESs. Considering the large decision space, an MFRL algorithm with fast Shapley credit allocation is developed to efficiently solve the upper-level optimization. Meanwhile, the lower-level subproblems are formulated as small-scale mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problems, addressing the difficulties caused by IES heterogeneity in applying mean-field approximation. Simulation results show that the proposed approach significantly improves convergence speed and reduces the global cost of VPP operation, especially in massive-scale scenarios. In test scenarios ranging from 10 to 500 agents, the proposed bi-level optimization approach improves the objective by 4.8%–26.6%, compared to the advanced baseline method.},

The introduction of a communication infrastructure inevitably brings communication threats, such as denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and network induced delays. This article represents the first attempt toward a unified distributed digital predictor-based control scheme for the solution of the secondary voltage restoration problem in islanded MGs, which also involves external unknown disturbances and network vulnerabilities, thus enhancing its resilience and reliability. The novel sampled-data predictive controller revises the conventional model reduction approach to reformulate it in a fully distributed digital way and involves some external disturbances information for prediction performance improvement, even though these perturbations are completely unknown. The main features of the resulting method are: 1) large delays compensation accounting for networked-induced delays and sleeping time interval due to DoS attacks occurrence and 2) unknown disturbance attenuation, usually neglected in the controllers synthesis phase in MGs field. Lyapunov-Krasovskii theory is exploited to analytically prove the exponential stability of the MG voltage, thus leading to linear matrix inequality-based sufficient stability conditions. Numerical and experimental results confirm theoretical derivations.},

  abstract     = {Owing to advancements in deep learning technology, vision transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated impressive performance in various computer vision tasks. Nonetheless, ViTs still face some challenges, such as high computational complexity and the absence of desirable inductive biases. To alleviate these issues, the potential advantages of combining eagle vision with ViTs are explored. A bi-fovea visual interaction (BFVI) structure inspired by the unique physiological and visual characteristics of eagle eyes is introduced. Based on this structural design approach, a novel bi-fovea self-attention (BFSA) mechanism and bi-fovea feedforward network (BFFN) are proposed. These components are employed to mimic the hierarchical and parallel information processing scheme of the biological visual cortex, thereby enabling networks to learn the feature representations of the targets in a coarse-to-fine manner. Furthermore, a bionic eagle vision (BEV) block is designed as the basic building unit based on the BFSA mechanism and the BFFN. By stacking the BEV blocks, a unified and efficient family of pyramid backbone networks called eagle ViTs (EViTs) is developed. Experimental results indicate that the EViTs exhibit highly competitive performance in various computer vision tasks, demonstrating their potential as backbone networks. In terms of computational efficiency and scalability, EViTs show significant advantages compared with other counterparts. The developed code is available at https://github.com/nkusyl/EViT.},

The quality of these contextual representations (or embeddings) is therefore crucial for a meta-RL agent to make effective decisions in unknown environments. Current methods predominantly assume the existence of a single underlying task, but using a single contextual embedding may not be expressive enough to fully capture the broader distribution of task variations that an agent might encounter. Decomposing that information into different representations can allow them to capture more relevant features in context space while applying additional structure that aids downstream exploitation. In this article, we develop global-local embeddings for contextual meta-RL (GLOBEX), an off-policy contextual meta-RL algorithm that decomposes the contextual representation into separate global and local embeddings. The learning process maximizes information retained by the embeddings and utilizes a mutual information constraint to encourage decoupling. Illustrative examples show that our method effectively adapts by identifying global task dynamics and exploiting temporally local signals. In addition, GLOBEX outperforms existing state-of-the-art meta-RL algorithms on standard MuJoCo benchmarks.},

However, their performances are limited given complicated environments, especially when the speed of quadrupedal robots is relatively high. In this work, a newly designed VOT algorithm for a quadrupedal robot based on a Siamese network is introduced. First, a one-stage detector for locating moving objects is designed and applied. Then, position information of moving objects is fed into a newly designed Siamese adaptive network to estimate their scale and aspect ratio. For regressing bounding boxes of a target object, a box adaptive head with an asymmetric convolution (ACM) layer is newly proposed.

To overcome these challenges, an efficacious search method is usually needed to improve the efficiency of searching optimal solution and utilization of data structure used to store nondominated vectors. The originality of this work comes with a creative and novel design of Kriging surrogate model-based simplex crossover operator (KSCO) and Kriging surrogate model-based local search of simplex crossover operator (KLSSCO). KSCO is used to calculate the speed update equation, as well as the coefficients of the equation.

  abstract     = {The goal of few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL) is to learn new concepts from a limited number of novel samples while preserving the knowledge of previously learned classes. The mainstream FSCIL framework begins with training in the base session, after which the feature extractor is frozen to accommodate novel classes. We observed that traditional base-session training approaches often lead to overfitting on challenging samples, which can lead to reduced robustness in the decision boundaries and exacerbate the forgetting phenomenon when introducing incremental data. To address this issue, we proposed the progressive learning strategy (PGLS). First, inspired by curriculum learning, we developed a covariance noise perturbation approach based on the statistical information as a difficulty measure for assessing sample robustness. We then reweighted the samples based on their robustness, initially concentrating on enhancing model stability by prioritizing robust samples and subsequently leveraging weakly robust samples to improve generalization. Second, we predefined forward compatibility for various virtual class augmentation models. Within base class training, we employed a curriculum learning strategy that progressively introduced fewer to more virtual classes in order to mitigate any adverse effects on model performance. This strategy enhances the adaptability of base classes to novel ones and alleviates forgetting problems. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on the CUB200, CIFAR100, and miniImageNet datasets demonstrate the significant advantages of our proposed method over state-of-the-art models.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the problem of ultimately bounded state estimation is investigated for discrete-time multirate singularly perturbed complex networks under the bit rate constraints, where the sensor sampling period is allowed to differ from the updating period of the networks. The facilitation of communication between sensors and the remote estimator through wireless networks, which are subject to bit rate constraints, involves the use of a coding-decoding mechanism. For efficient estimation in the presence of periodic measurements, a specialized impulsive estimation method is developed, which aims to carry out impulsive corrections precisely at the instants when the measurement signal is received by the estimator. By employing the iteration analysis method under the impulsive mechanism, a sufficient condition is established that ensures the exponential boundedness of the estimation error dynamics.

  abstract     = {The innovation of optimal learning control methods is profoundly propelled due to the improvement of the learning ability. In this article, we investigate the synthesis of initialization and acceleration for optimal learning control algorithms. This approach contrasts with traditional methods that concentrate solely on either the improvement of initialization or acceleration. Specifically, we establish a novel relaxed policy iteration (PI) algorithm with self-learning horizon for stochastic optimal control. Notably, by suitably utilizing self-learning horizon, we can directly evaluate inadmissible policies to reduce the initialization burden. Meanwhile, the inadmissible policy can be rapidly optimized with few learning iterations. Then, several critical conclusions of relaxed optimal control are established by discussing algorithm convergence and system stability. Furthermore, to provide the convincing application potentials, a class of unconventional problems is effectively solved by the relaxed PI algorithm, including the dynamics with external noises and nonzero equilibrium. Finally, we present a series of nonlinear benchmarks with practical applications to comprehensively evaluate the performance of relaxed PI. The experimental results obtained from these diverse benchmarks uniformly highlight the effectiveness of self-learning horizon mechanism.},

First, an input saturation constraint based on the UAV dynamic model is investigated in this article, and an adaptive compensating term is developed to handle the input saturation. The DoS attacks considered in this article can interrupt all the communication transmissions of the attacked UAV from neighbors so that the victim is not able to receive any information from neighboring UAVs during DoS attacks. To deal with such a difficult problem, a fixed-time security constraint estimator (FTSCE) is proposed to ensure the stability and security of UAVs during the DoS attacks. Moreover, the unknown state is estimated to reduce the amount of the transferred information. Based on the proposed FTSCE, the relative position and velocity of UAV states are used to design the resilient consensus controller against the DoS attacks. By using the proposed controller, the system stability can be guaranteed according to the Lyapunov stability analysis.

  abstract     = {This article first presents a dual flexible prescribed performance control (DFPPC) approach of input saturated high-order nonlinear systems (IS-HONSs). Compared to the existing PPC approaches of IS-HONSs, under which the performance constraint boundaries (PCBs) are usually fixed and bounded, resulting in a restriction of the initial error in the algorithm implementation; in addition, the coupling relationship between performance constraints and input saturation is usually ignored, resulting in the methods are very fragile when input saturation occurs. By designing the novel tensile model-based PCBs that depend on output and input constraints, the proposed DFPPC method provides sufficient resilience for both the initial conditions and the input saturation, so that the proposed DFPPC method can not only be suitable for multiple types of initial errors by adjusting the parameters, including $e_{1}(0)\in (\underline {\mathcal {B}}(0),\bar {\mathcal {B}}(0))$ , $e_{1}(0)\in (-\infty,\bar {\mathcal {B}}(0))$ , $e_{1}(0)\in (\underline {\mathcal {B}}(0),+\infty)$ and $e_{1}(0)\in (-\infty,\infty)$ , where $\underline {\mathcal {B}}(0)$ , and $\bar {\mathcal {B}}(0)$ denote the initial PCBs; but also can achieve a good balance between input saturation and performance constraints, i.e., when the control input reaches or exceeds the saturation threshold, the PCBs can adaptively extend to avoid the singularity, and when the control input returns to the saturation threshold range, the PCBs are then adaptively restored to the original PCBs. The results show that the proposed DFPPC algorithm guarantees semi-global boundedness for all closed-loop signals, while ensuring that the system output accurately tracks the desired signal, and it consistently maintains the tracking error within the PCBs. The developed algorithm is illustrated by means of simulation instances.},

  abstract     = {Industrial data often consist of continuous variables (CVs) and binary variables (BVs), both of which provide crucial information about process operating conditions. Due to the coupling between industrial systems or equipment, these hybrid variables are usually high-dimensional and highly correlated. However, existing methods generally model hybrid variables directly in the observation space and assume independence between the variables to overcome the curse of dimensionality. Thus, they are ineffective at capturing dependencies among hybrid variables, and the effectiveness of process monitoring will be compromised. To overcome the limitations, this study proposes to seek a unified subspace for hybrid variables using the probabilistic latent variable (LV) model. By introducing a low-dimensional continuous LV, the proposed method can avoid the curse of dimensionality while capturing the dependencies between hybrid variables. Nevertheless, the inference of LV is analytically intractable and thus time-consuming due to the heterogeneity of CVs and BVs. To accelerate offline learning and online inference procedures, this study originally derives an analytical Gaussian distribution to approximate the true posterior distribution of the LV, based on which an efficient expectation-maximization algorithm is developed for parameter estimation. The Gaussian approximation is simultaneously optimized with the latest parameters to achieve a high approximation accuracy. The LV is then estimated by the posterior mean of the Gaussian approximation. By mapping the heterogeneous variables into a unified subspace, the proposed method defines three monitoring statistics, which are physically interpretable and thoroughly evaluate the probability of hybrid variables being normal. The effectiveness of the proposed method in detecting anomalies in CVs and BVs is shown through a numerically simulated case and a real industrial case.},

  abstract     = {Neuroimaging analysis aims to reveal the information-processing mechanisms of the human brain in a noninvasive manner. In the past, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise in capturing the non-Euclidean structure of brain networks. However, existing neuroimaging studies focused primarily on spatial functional connectivity, despite temporal dynamics in complex brain networks. To address this gap, we propose a spatio-temporal interactive graph representation framework (STIGR) for dynamic neuroimaging analysis that encompasses different aspects from classification and regression tasks to interpretation tasks. STIGR leverages a dynamic adaptive-neighbor graph convolution network to capture the interrelationships between spatial and temporal dynamics. To address the limited global scope in graph convolutions, a self-attention module based on Transformers is introduced to extract long-term dependencies. Contrastive learning is used to adaptively contrast similarities between adjacent scanning windows, modeling cross-temporal correlations in dynamic graphs. Extensive experiments on six public neuroimaging datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of STIGR across different platforms, achieving state-of-the-art results in classification and regression tasks. The proposed framework enables the detection of remarkable temporal association patterns between regions of interest based on sequential neuroimaging signals, offering medical professionals a versatile and interpretable tool for exploring task-specific neurological patterns.

  abstract     = {Process variables may exhibit both temporal trends and periodic responses, with their fault propagation pathways manifesting in time-domain and frequency-domain causalities, respectively. However, the differing causal perspectives of time-domain and frequency-domain methods can lead to distinct causalities, posing the causal heterogeneity challenge for root cause diagnosis (RCD). Thereupon, we reveal the mechanism of source consistency in Granger causality (GC), that is, the root cause variable provides the most significant predictive information in both time and frequency domains. Accordingly, we propose a causal source consistency analytics (CSCA) framework that achieves time-frequency synergy. First, we design a nonlinear enhancement module to extract temporal features for causal inference. Second, to extract time-domain and frequency-domain GC, we develop a parallel causality learning module, where a differentiable frequency-domain expansion operator is designed along with a temporal prediction submodule. Meanwhile, a time-frequency entropy constraint is constructed to ensure causal significance by inducing sparsity. Finally, a root cause alignment module is proposed to ensure source consistency. A predictive information quantification algorithm, formulated as an eigenvalue decomposition problem, is designed to locate the root cause. We develop an approximate exponential transformation to convert the eigenvalue decomposition into a differentiable source alignment loss. Thus, source consistency can be ensured during end-to-end inference. The validity of CSCA is illustrated through the Tennessee Eastman process and a gas turbine application. CSCA identified the root causes in both examples correctly. Furthermore, ablation studies validate that CSCA enables the time-domain and frequency-domain models to identify consistent root causes, thereby overcoming causal heterogeneity.},

These complexities render the standard backstepping recursive design scheme inapplicable, as the derivative of the virtual controller does not exist. To address the intermittent output feedback problem, we introduce a novel dynamic backstepping control method. First, we establish a dynamic gain observer using the triggered output signals to reconstruct the unmeasurable state variables. Next, the concept of dynamic gain is introduced through a coordinate transformation, with its derivative employed to offset discontinuous terms, which solves the challenges in recursive backstepping design caused by intermittent output and regulates that the state variable converges asymptotically to the origin in the global sense.

Specifically, a distributed prescribed-time observer is constructed for each agent using event-based communications to estimate the states of the exosystem. The constructed observer operates without requiring prior knowledge of the exosystem dynamics or global information, ensuring that observation errors converge to a small neighborhood around zero within a user-determined time interval. Additionally, the incorporation of the DETM guarantees a positive lower bound on the interexecution intervals, thereby alleviating the communication demands. Building on this observer, neuro-adaptive prescribed-time controllers are derived for each agent, capable of maintaining the system states within a user-defined compact set without the need for prior knowledge of the initial system states. It is demonstrated that the regulated outputs converge to a region arbitrarily tuned by the user within a prescribed time, with all signals remaining bounded and Zeno behavior eliminated.

  abstract     = {Wastewater treatment processes (WWTPs) are operated under multiple operating conditions. Designing an appropriate optimal control strategy based on the identification of operating conditions is crucial for ensuring the safe operation of WWTPs. To effectively deal with the problem of multiple operating conditions in WWTPs, a data-knowledge-driven multiobjective adaptive optimal control (DK-MAOC) strategy is proposed. First, a fuzzy neural network (FNN) is employed as the prediction model to obtain the concentrations of nitrate and total nitrogen. Then, the operating conditions of WWTPs can be determined. Second, an adaptive objective function (AOF) is proposed to dynamically adjust the weights of operating indices to meet the operational requirements of each operating condition. In particular, the AOF integrates operating requirements and tracking errors to simultaneously consider the feasibility of the controller when solving setpoints. Third, due to the differences in data distribution under each operating condition, real-time data during condition changing is insufficient to accurately predict. A data-knowledge-driven model, incorporating operational knowledge into the FNN-based predictive model, is established to predict the future dynamics of WWTPs. Finally, a collaborative gradient descent algorithm is proposed to simultaneously solve for setpoints and control laws. The effectiveness of the proposed DK-MAOC is tested on the Benchmark Simulation Model No. 1. The experimental results indicate that DK-MAOC can effectively avoid the situation of effluent nitrate nitrogen and total nitrogen exceeding the standards while reducing energy consumption of WWTPs. Therefore, the proposed DK-MAOC can guarantee optimal operation of WWTPs.},

  abstract     = {This article studies the secure leader-follower consensus of nonlinear multiagent systems under multimode Denial-of-Service attacks. According to the topology characteristics after attacks, three kinds of different attack modes are introduced. Moreover, the common zero-topology attack is encompassed within the multimode attacks considered in this article. Due to the difficulty of directly obtaining the state of the system in some circumstances, a state observer is designed utilizing localized output information of the MASs to estimate the state. By applying suitable observer-based controller and Lyapunov method, some sufficient conditions are presented to ensure the observer-based secure consensus of the MASs under multimode DoS attacks. Furthermore, the obtained results can be extended to linear MASs under DoS attacks. Finally, two practical examples on power system are provided to demonstrate the validity of the derived theoretical results.},

To this end, this article addresses the problem of temporal logic disturbance rejection control (TLDRC) for a class of nonlinear systems subject to disturbances. Signal temporal logic (STL) specifications are introduced for the representation of complex tasks. A control barrier function (CBF), composed of a monotonic function characterizing the temporal behavior of the system and a predicate function, is constructed to encode the STL specifications. To guarantee robustness against disturbances, generalized proportional integral observers (GPIOs) are introduced for higher-accuracy disturbance estimation. It is shown that by fully exploiting the constructed CBF and the disturbance estimate, the developed TLDRC strategy is able to ensure the STL specifications and compensate undesirable effects caused by unknown disturbances, even if they are fast-time-varying. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.},

Optimal control of the augmented system established on parallel control delivers a solution for nonlinear time-delayed systems. At the cost of the modified $L_{2}$ gain condition, the value function is specified in terms of the state and input delays, transforming the optimal control issue into a minimax task. Then, the critic-actor framework is employed to reconstruct the cost function and control rule while maintaining the persistently exciting (PE) condition so that the online optimal control algorithm is investigated.

Under local communication conditions, a finite-time distributed observer is constructed to estimate the leader state of a flexible manipulator. Fuzzy logic systems are applied to identify unmodeled dynamics. Disturbance observers are designed to estimate mixed perturbations consisting of disturbances and estimation errors. Moreover, the proposed control method can ensure that all signals in the closed-loop system are bounded, the elastic deflection of each flexible manipulator can be suppressed, the angle achieves consensus control, and Zeno behavior is avoided.

  abstract     = {The clustering algorithm has always been a hot spot in machine learning, which has made great progress and been widely used in different scenarios. Due to the characteristics and requirements of some application scenarios, the branch of the balanced clustering algorithm has been developed. The ideal of these algorithms is to obtain clusters containing approximately the same number of samples. However, when there are data points distributed at the boundary of different clusters, resulting in different probabilities of their belonging, hard-partitioned balanced clustering may not be able to handle these boundary data well, thus limiting their performance. Motivated by this, we propose a Fuzzy Min-Cut with Soft Balancing Effects (FCBE) method in this article. Specifically, the FCBE model utilizes fuzzy constraints to simultaneously enhance the ability of the balanced algorithm to capture boundary data members and the advantage of directly obtaining the partitioning results of graph-cut problem without postprocessing. In addition, a sparse regularization is introduced to avoid trivial solutions and maintain the separability of the relationship matrix. Furthermore, the proposed FCBE method can be viewed as a flexibly adjustable generalization pattern that not only has clear interpretability but also can become special cases with clear physical meanings under different parameter values. The feasibility of FCBE has been verified on real datasets.},

One of the innovations of this article is the presentation of an adaptive input range fuzzy logic system (AFLS) with portability and adaptability, offering a novel approach for determining the input range of the FLS. The method effectively resolves the current dilemma of relying on a specific problem and model for determining the FLS input range. In addition, to enhance convergence speed and achieve predefined-time convergence of the fuzzy predefined-time robust zeroing neural network (FPRZNN) model, we introduce a novel segmental predefined-time robust activation function (SPRAF). Furthermore, three key theorems are proposed to prove the stability, convergence, and robustness of the FPRZNN model.

  abstract     = {Multiview anchor graph clustering has been a prominent research area in recent years, leading to the development of several effective and efficient methods. However, three challenges are faced by current multiview anchor graph clustering methods. First, real-world data often exhibit uncertainty and poor discriminability, leading to suboptimal anchor graphs when directly extracted from the original data. Second, most existing methods assume the presence of common information between views and primarily explore it for clustering, thus neglecting view-specific information. Third, further exploration and exploitation of the learned anchor graph to enhance clustering performance remains an open research question. To address these issues, a novel dual anchor graph fuzzy clustering method is proposed in this article. First, a novel matrix factorization-based dual anchor graph learning method is proposed to address the first two issues by extracting highly discriminative hidden representations for each view and subsequently deriving both common and specific anchor graphs from these hidden representations. Then, to address the third issue, a novel anchor graph fuzzy clustering method is developed with cooperative learning to exploit and utilize the common and specific anchor graphs fully. Meanwhile, a fuzzy membership structure preservation mechanism with dual anchor graphs is constructed to enhance clustering performance. Finally, negative Shannon entropy is further introduced to adaptively adjust the view weighing. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

However, these generalizations have a limited application to signals defined on domains with arbitrary geometry.

We introduce a universal concept of a fuzzy partition that includes a kernel representation, a fuzzy partition, and the corresponding F-transform. In addition, we discuss the main properties of this generalized F-transform and characterize the nonlocal Laplace operator in terms of the F-transform.

Second, by introducing the newly designed algorithm, a novel optimal adaptive fuzzy event-triggered strategy is proposed. This mechanism effectively reduces the communication burden and enhances flexibility in handling hybrid cyber-attacks. Third, by employing a new piecewise Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional that incorporates membership functions (MFs), a fuzzy controller with imperfect MFs is designed, where both the MFs and their derivatives are considered.

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose a dynamic event-triggered adaptive prescribed-time output feedback tracking control strategy for nonlinear systems with unknown external disturbances under denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The presence of malicious intermittent DoS attacks makes the output signal and states of the system unavailable, which in turn leads to more difficulty in the design of the controller. To overcome the above difficulty, we construct a novel composite observer based on the attack compensator, whereby the system states can be reconstructed. Moreover, with the help of the time-varying constraint function, the prescribed-time tracking control problem for nonlinear systems is transformed into the constraint problem of tracking error. At the same time, a new dynamic event-triggered adaptive prescribed-time safety fuzzy controller is built and remains applicable in the systems that operate continuously after the predefined time. The adaptive fuzzy safety control method proposed in this article ensures that the tracking error converges to the user-specified region in the predefined time, all signals of the closed-loop system remain bounded under intermittent DoS attacks, and the repeated transmission of samples from the controller to the actuator can be further reduced, generating fewer events and saving communication resources. Finally, the simulation results of the single-link robotic arm demonstrate the rationality and effectiveness of the developed control algorithm.},

  abstract     = {In group decision-making (GDM), traditional consensus models have primarily focused on cardinal consensus. In reality, irrespective of whether the objective of GDM is to select the optimal alternative or to rank alternatives, it is imperative to establish a ranking that garners the utmost assent from all decision-makers (DMs). When preferences are articulated through fuzzy preference relations (FPRs), cardinal information emerges in numerical form, quantifying the degree of preference for alternatives, while ordinal relations are implicitly embedded within pairwise comparisons. To delve into both cardinal and ordinal consensus among DMs, this study introduces two consensus optimization models that strive to minimize adjustments to FPRs while fostering consensus in terms of preference intensity and ranking. To this end, we first propose two ordinal consensus measurement methods: one precisely discerns whether DMs have achieved consensus on the selection of the best alternative, while the other assesses the consistency of different preference rankings, taking into account the importance of positions. Based on these methods, two systems of inequalities are designed to explicitly govern both types of ordinal consensus. Subsequently, two consensus control rules are formulated, tailored to distinct objectives. These rules necessitate not only cardinal consensus among all DMs, but also their alignment in terms of either the selection of the best alternative or the preference ranking. Ultimately, these rules are integrated as constraints into two mixed-integer programming models aimed at minimizing preference adjustments. The proposed models have been applied in a case study, confirming their practicality, with thorough comparative analyses demonstrating their effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Selecting a compact and relevant feature subset for hybrid decision systems is a key task in decision-making. Fuzzy rough set (FRS) is an effective method for this purpose, but its space complexity can be a hindrance when dealing with large data sets. A scalable FRS-based feature subset selection framework, FDM-FMFRS, was proposed earlier. This framework integrates FRS with fuzzy min–max neural network (FMNN) as a preprocessing step to handle large datasets. FMNN model transforms object space into hyperbox space. However, its implementation requires all input variables to be numeric. One way to handle categorical data is to replace them with numerical values, but this method may define an unsuitable metric for the categories. This article presents an extended version of FDM-FMFRS, called Hybrid-FDM-FMFRS, which is applicable to both numeric and categorical variables by incorporating set-valued data for categorical attributes. A weighted set is presented to represent the frequency distribution of distinct categories within the hyperbox, helping to create set-valued data for categorical attributes and providing the proposed approach greater flexibility and broader applications on definite space. A comprehensive comparative analysis is conducted on hybrid benchmark datasets, and it is established that the proposed algorithm obtained relevant reduct while preserving satisfactory classification accuracy in much less computational time. In addition, the proposed approach retains the scalability benefits of FDM-FMRS, allowing it to handle large datasets where the compared algorithms fail to compute reducts.},

A desirable approach is to augment the results with some measure of confidence (credibility) by admitting a granular rather than numeric format of the produced output values of the model. Our focus of this study is on fuzzy Takagi–Sugeno rule-based models whose conclusions are constant. The ultimate objective is to extend such models to the generalized granular structure with the conclusions formed as information granules. We study information granules described by intervals and fuzzy sets as well as probabilistic Gaussian information granules. The original design of the granular model is realized by involving the principle of justifiable granularity. Using this principle, we also show how to determine the equivalence between information granules. The construction of probabilistic information granules of the model is completed with the aid of optimized Gaussian process models. The granular models built in this way constitute a substantial and application-oriented departure from the numeric fuzzy models by offering a comprehensive insight into the quality of the produced results. The experimental studies based on synthetic and publicly available data demonstrate the design process and discuss the quality of the obtained results.},

  abstract     = {Motion planning, considered a fuzzy sequential decision-making problem, encounters significant challenges due to inherent environmental uncertainty. Traditional planning methods that rely on single strategies often struggle in complex scenarios. While fuzzy systems excel at handling uncertainty, high-dimensional continuous spaces require a large number of fuzzy rules, which significantly increases computational complexity. In contrast, humans leverage limited and fuzzy information to address various decision-making scenarios flexibly and efficiently. The concurrent reasoning mechanism in the prefrontal cortex plays a crucial role during this process. Consequently, the brain-inspired model and the concept of multiple fuzzy rules offer a novel perspective for the above issues. Motivated by these insights, this article proposes a brain-inspired motion planning method called harmonized learning with concurrent arbitration (HLCA). Specifically, inspired by the concurrent inference model, a concurrent arbitration module is employed in the planning process to effectively manage the boundary between exploration and exploitation. Furthermore, inspired by the multistrategy processing mechanism, HLCA introduces multistrategy harmonized learning by referring to the mechanism for operating multiple fuzzy rules, allowing the dynamic selection of strategies through a reliability function to enable self-improving learning. Experimental results demonstrate that HLCA outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, highlighting its potential to enhance the planning performance of robots by learning from the human brain.},

  abstract     = {As a low-cost cargo delivery manner, cable-suspended aerial transportation system is highly regarded by researchers. However, existing works seldom consider the relative distance adjustment between the payload and the multirotor, which greatly limits the application scope, such as tunnel traversing or payload releasing. In addition, treating the hook and the payload as a single point mass while ignoring the hook effect results in an inaccurate description of the dynamic model. To address the aforementioned problems, the dynamic model of the variable-length cable-suspended aerial transportation system is established accurately through Lagrange&#39;s equation with consideration of the motion of the multirotor, the payload, and the hook. Subsequently, an adaptive control method is presented through energy-based analysis, and swing angle related fuzzy rules are established to dynamically adjust the control parameters, which can simultaneously achieve multirotor positioning, payload hoisting/lowering, and hook/payload swing suppression. Moreover, the cable length is constrained within a feasible range by an elaborately designed auxiliary control signal. Lyapunov techniques and LaSalle&#39;s invariance theorem are utilized to prove the asymptotic convergence of the closed-loop system. Finally, a series of simulations are conducted to verify the control performance of the designed method.},

In the online control unit, the time-triggered way is first implemented to steer the system state into the TCS quickly, and then in the offline control unit, the involved event-triggered pattern plays its role in conserving resources while ensuring the control performance. Two offline optimization problems (OPs) are presented to design the TCS and the approximate robust one step sets, respectively, and an online OP is given to design the control laws to steer the system state into TCS.

  abstract     = {Fuzzy rule interpolation (FRI) has been successfully applied to address real-world problems where domain knowledge is incomplete, particularly in situations where observations do not directly match existing rules. However, most of the existing research focuses on fuzzy systems based on Mamdani models. Recently, a pioneering approach has been proposed for rule interpolation within Takagi–Sugeno–Kang (TSK) fuzzy models, employing two distinct techniques that cluster neighboring rules to facilitate interpolated outcomes. Although promising, these techniques have been developed through empirical methods, lacking formal representation and theoretical justification. This article formalizes such emerging empirical studies with the aim of strengthening the theoretical foundation of FRI. It introduces the location view of rules and rule bases regarding TSK models, analyzing the influence of individual rules within FRI techniques for such models. Through geometrizing sparse rule bases, comparative investigations of the empirical and theoretical results are carried out. Moreover, geometric projection of the rules is combined with a rule weight adjustment mechanism to reinforce the capability of the formalized FRI techniques. By embedding directional parameters into the rules, the resulting method increases the weighting of critical rules, strengthening the FRI algorithms&#39; performance when many rules may be selected for interpolation. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the theoretical model and the consistency with the existing empirical findings. This highlights the potential and significance of formal studies in guiding algorithmic improvements on FRI with TSK models.},

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has made remarkable achievements in extensive fields, whereas its closed boxnature limited applications in many critical areas. Against this drawback, explainable AI (XAI), has emerged as a focal point of current research. Recently, fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) attract increasing attention in XAI because of their linguistic representation, which can be naturally understood by humans. However, the focus of these works is limited by simply relying on inherent rule-based structures for explanation. Motivated by further exploring, the potential of FLS to overcome the challenges of XAI in terms of comprehensibility, scalability, and transferability, in this work, we propose fuzzy model-agnostic explanation (FMAE) as a post-hoc paradigm to explain the behavior of closed boxmodels. The innovations and contributions of this work provide a unified framework offering four levels of explanation, develop the associated algorithms to present the hidden knowledge behind the closed boxmodel in human-understandable form at different levels of granularity, and create the interface to deliver explanations to users. First, we introduce the hierarchical FMAE framework to formulate explanations into four levels including sample, local, domain, and universe. Second, the learning and explaining algorithms are developed to systematically construct FLS to model the behavior of closed boxmodels in the four levels where downscaling is performed by simplification to facilitate explanations with concise rules and upscaling is performed by the aggregation to integrate explanations at a higher level. Third, the proposed explanation interface unifies two typical forms of expression in XAI by fuzzy rules: the semantic inference explanation revealing the decision mechanism of the closed boxmodel and the feature salience explanation reflecting the attribution and interaction of input features. Simulated user experiments are designed on the comprehensive explanatory metrics. Compared with mainstream methods, the result shows outstanding explanation performance on real-world datasets for both regression and classification tasks.},

  abstract     = {Spacecraft proximity system is susceptible to harsh space environment factors and neglected nonlinearities, which can be presented as multisource disturbances and uncertainties in dynamics model. In this article, a fuzzy logical system (FLS) based state constrained adaptive integral sliding-mode control strategy is proposed to deal with those problems. A nonlinear sliding manifold is utilized to optimize the time-varying tracking errors, which averts integral windup while ensuring the convergence. Moreover, an auxiliary dynamic signal is incorporated into FLS to approach dynamic uncertainties generated by unmodeled dynamics. For the purpose of compensating the adverse influences induced by stochastic noises, several adaptive laws based on the virtual signals about norms of noise intensities are designed. Then, the stability of spacecraft proximity system is proved by Lyapunov function of stochastic system. Numerical simulation results show the boundness of all signals, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.},

Existing studies rarely considered the psychological factors of DMs and the imprecise information of criteria importance when aggregating group opinions. This article proposes a robust MCGDM method that aggregates group opinions incorporating psychological factors of DMs and criteria weights determined by an interval information-based Bayesian hierarchy best worst method. First, a programming model, with an objective of minimizing the difference between the original and adjusted opinions of DMs, is developed to objectively determine the weights of DMs, taking into account the tolerance levels of DMs for opinion adjustments. Additionally, considering the interval preference information of criteria importance, a Bayesian hierarchy best worst method is proposed to infer the probability distribution of criteria weights, in which the criteria weights are regarded as stochastic variables. A numerical example shows that ignoring psychological factors of DMs can lead to biased decisions, while the proposed method providing a probabilistic distribution of alternative rankings forms robust decision results.},

A concise nonlinear mapping is tactfully devised to impose appropriate constraints on full states without reliance on feasibility conditions. Besides, a novel resilient quantitative prescribed performance control (RQPPC) is developed, which incorporates finite-time performance boundaries with input-relevant dynamic boundaries generated by an auxiliary system, being expected to flexibly adapt to input saturation without violating performance constraints. Building upon the RQPPC, the transient and steady-state behaviors of consensus errors can be quantitatively predesigned free from repeated parameter tuning processes. Uncertain nonlinear terms in the converted system are successfully addressed by fuzzy approximation. The superiority and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms are confirmed by simulations with comparisons.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a shared control system model between the human pilot and autopilot for the special issue of carrier-based aircraft landing task. A key point of the shared and cooperative control is that the decision-sharing system depends on the longitudinal safety boundaries for manual/automatic landing. Two strategies of the human pilot are adopted, including capture strategy and tracking strategy. A hidden model tracking control method is utilized to model the autopilot. To address the issue of frequent switching between the human pilot and autopilot caused by relying solely on safety boundaries to allocate control authority, fuzzy control theory is introduced to reduce the workload of the human pilot. The time-domain simulation results show that considering the fuzzy control, the frequency of switching and the flight states have been improved compared with the results without fuzzy control. Nonlinear pilot-induced oscillation metric evaluation results show that the human-automation shared and cooperative control considering the fuzzy control can alleviate the workload of the human pilot. The shared and cooperative control system model has certain significance in ensuring the safety of carrier-based aircraft landing.},

Two similar sets of springs (each set having three springs with graded rigidness) were customized to increase the handle-resistance. The springs were experimentally calibrated to determine individual spring-constant value. The amount of exerted force values during joystick movements were standardized in a cohort of healthy subjects (n = 15). Coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated to determine the variability among healthy subjects. Further, five (n = 5) patients with stroke were enrolled in this pilot study and performed three separate virtual reality sessions using different springs. Task-performance metrics, i.e., time to complete, trajectory smoothness, and relative error, were evaluated for each of the levels. The values of spring-constants as determined experimentally were found to be 1.34 × 103 ± 16.1, 2.23 × 103 ± 29.8, and 6.47 × 103 ± 470.9 N/m for springs with increased rigidity, respectively. The mean force values for different joystick movements were observed to be increasing linearly with increasing spring-rigidity. The calculated CV ≤ 14% indicated the variability in the recorded force values of healthy subjects. Increased task-performance metrics and visual analog scale-fatigue scores for session 2 and 3 as compared to session1, indicated increasing task difficulty at session 2 and 3.},

A low-cost electronic performance and tracking system was developed to gather data on the players.

This article deals with the evolution of the player&#39;s performance from both a physical and mental point of view. An emotional evaluation, based on well-being forms, is carried out and its possible influence on training. Finally, analysis is conducted on the level of health risk.

  abstract     = {Co-representation, which co-represents samples and features, has been widely used in various machine learning tasks, such as document clustering, gene expression analysis, and recommendation systems. It not only reveals the cluster structure of both samples and features, but also reveals the sample–feature correlation. Given a tabular data matrix, co-representation usually exhibits as the co-occurrence structures of rows and columns. However, identifying such structured patterns in complex real-world data can be very challenging. To address this problem, we propose an unsupervised discriminative co-representation learning model based on multidimensional scaling (DCLMDS). The main novelty is that DCLMDS introduces a co-representation learning term to ensure the discriminability between co-occurrence structures. As a result, the co-representation learned by DCLMDS contains richer information of the underlying correlation between samples and features within data. This could subsequently enhance the capacity of machines and systems for processing complex real-world information more proficiently. Furthermore, inspired by the fuzzy set theory, we integrate fuzzy membership degree that can accurately capture the uncertainty within data, thus enabling DCLMDS to learn a more effective co-representation in a soft manner. To evaluate the performance of DCLMDS, we conduct extensive experiments on 18 datasets, and the results demonstrate that DCLMDS can generate both accurate and discriminative co-representation, which well meets our desired outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Recent literature suggests that the surface electromyography (sEMG) signals have nonstationary statistical characteristics, specifically due to the random nature of the covariance. Thus, the suitability of a statistical model for sEMG signals is determined by the choice of an appropriate model for describing the covariance. The purpose of this study is to propose a compound-Gaussian (CG) model for multivariate sEMG signals in which the latent variable of covariance is modeled as a random variable that follows an exponential model. The parameters of the model are estimated using the iterative expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Further, a new dataset, electromyography analysis of human activities database 2 (EMAHA-DB2), is developed. The proposed model is evaluated through both qualitative and quantitative methods. Based on the model fitting analysis on the sEMG signals from EMAHA-DB2, it is found that the proposed CG model fits more closely to the empirical pdf of sEMG signals than the existing models. In addition, statistical analyses are carried out among the models and estimated parameters under different scenarios. The estimate of the exponential model&#39;s rate parameter exhibits a clear relationship with training weights, potentially correlating with underlying motor unit activity. Finally, the average signal power estimates of the channels show distinctive dependency on the training weights, the subject&#39;s training experience, and the type of activity.},

  abstract     = {The research on human-following robot is important for practical applications. It is a hot field of human–machine technology. This article proposes an adaptive recurrent proportional integral differential (PID) control algorithm with self-tuning filter based on vision to address the issue of insufficient recognition accuracy of specific following targets in the presence of occlusion, multiple people, or deformation. It also aims to further improve the control accuracy and immunity of a human-following robot. First, a depth camera-based red green blue (RGB) picture and a depth image are acquired. The person reidentification algorithm and the YOLOv8 algorithm are used to detect and track the targets. The spatial position information of the targets is calculated by the depth image. Additionally, the orientation proportional differential (PD) controller and the speed proportional integral (PI) controller are built. Its foundation is the discrepancy between the relative posture of the user and the robot. In order to minimize sensor data fluctuations and lessen the negative impacts of relative positional instability, a self-tuning filter is developed. To remember the relative postures between the robot and the user in the history window, an adaptive recurrent mechanism is suggested. The controller has the ability to output the control quantity in an adaptive manner based on the current system state. Finally, experiments are conducted to verify the reliability of the proposed method. The experimental findings demonstrate that the visual pedestrian tracking algorithm proposed in this article is highly adaptable. Compared to the traditional PID, fractional-order PID, and virtual spring model, our method demonstrates significant enhancements, reducing the average distance error by 64.29%, 57.14%, and 60.52% in steering scenarios, and by 42.86%, 40.00%, and 40.00% in straight-ahead scenarios, respectively.},

When humans supervise robots, their accountability increases, especially when robot behavior deviates from expectations. To address this, robots may choose a highly constrained plan when monitored and a more optimal one when unobserved. While this behavior is not driven by human-like motives, it stems from robots accommodating diverse supervisors. To optimize monitoring costs while ensuring safety, we model this interaction in a trust-based game-theoretic framework. However, pure-strategy Nash equilibrium often fails to exist in this model. To address this, we introduce the concept of a trust boundary within the mixed strategy space, aiding in the discovery of optimal monitoring strategies. Human studies demonstrate the necessity of optimal strategies and the benefits of our suggested approaches.},

The operators&#39; performances are evaluated through the scores of a self-reported questionnaire (i.e., subjective measurement) and the results of a deep learning-based cognitive workload prediction algorithm that uses physiological and behavioral data (i.e., objective measurement). To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed controller, we conduct an exploratory user experiment with various allocation strategies. The user experiment uses a multihuman multirobot CCTV monitoring task as an example and carry out comprehensive real-world experiments with 32 human subjects for both quantitative measurement and qualitative analysis. Our results demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed controller and highlight the importance of incorporating both subjective and objective measurements of the operators&#39; cognitive workload as well as seeking consent for workload transitions, to enhance the performance of multihuman multirobot teams.},

For this, the selected three-compartment controller fatigue model including a resting recovery parameter was adapted to a dynamic walking task scenario, incorporating a torque–velocity–angle dependency to quantify muscle activity. The model parameters were experimentally verified in a study with six healthy subjects, demonstrating accurate prediction of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) decline with an average mean absolute error of 4.9%MVC. Subsequently, an HiL control mechanism was developed, utilizing ratings of perceived fatigue and state of fatigue values as reference metrics. The presented control approach effectively regulates fatigue levels within a 0%MVC–6%MVC steady-state error range during simulations. Experimental validation confirmed this performance, however, with partly higher steady-state errors mainly due to the restrictions of the exoskeleton&#39;s assistance. This preliminary study provides a promising foundation for future research, demonstrating the potential to manage fatigue effectively in exoskeleton users, offering an improved, personalized experience.},

  abstract     = {Lower-limb active exoskeletons may experience errors in operational settings due to imperfect algorithms, which may impact users&#39; trust in the system and the human-exoskeleton fluency (the coordination of actions between the human and exoskeleton). In this study, we introduced pseudorandom catch trials (errors) in 1.68% of all strides, where an expected exoskeleton torque was not applied for a single stride, to understand the immediate and time-dependent responses to missed actuations. Participants (N = 15) completed a targeted stepping task while walking with a bilateral powered ankle exoskeleton. Human-exoskeleton fluency and trust were inferred from task performance (step accuracy), step characteristics (step length and width), muscle activity, and lower limb joint kinematics. Reductions in ankle plantarflexion during catch trials suggest user adaptation to the exoskeleton. Hip flexion and muscle activity were modulated to mitigate effects of the loss of exoskeleton torque and reduced plantarflexion during catch trials to support task accuracy and maintain step characteristics. Trust was not impacted by this level of error, as there were no significant differences in task performance or gait characteristics over time. Understanding the interactions between human-exoskeleton fluency, task accuracy, and gait strategies will support exoskeleton controller development. Future work will investigate various levels of actuation reliability to understand the transition where performance and trust are affected.},

  abstract     = {The natural forking severely compromises the security and wastes resources of Blockchain. Current analyses of the natural forking are carried out from microscale and macroscale perspectives, each facing challenges in generality and accuracy respectively. This results in dire straits that the forking arising from the network layer cannot be solved within the same layer, and existing defense schemes concentrate on the consensus layer, unfortunately coming at the expense of diminishing decentralized trust. Hence, to overcome these shortcomings, we propose the first reconnaissance-strike solution to the natural forking where the issue is recognized at the network layer and further struck on-site. Specifically, our endeavors encompass 1) analyzing the spatial-temporal transmission dynamics of the main chain. We exert mesoscale perspective by transforming the behavioral analysis of the transmitters (i.e., the nodes) into the movement analysis of the transmitted object (i.e., the main chain) which mitigates following Lévy mobility. Based on this, we quantify the dynamics of long-range leaping and short-range diffusion of the main chain transmission; 2) proposing a cost-effective anti-forking mechanism. This mechanism combats the forking with low cost by configuring logical connections at the network management level, based on the quantitative relationship between Blockchain network topology and the natural forking rate we have derived. Both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments verify that our scheme can maintain the natural forking rate not more than the given threshold in most cases.},

To handle both challenges, the entire space multitask models are employed to decompose the user behavior track into a sequence of exposure $\rightarrow $ click $\rightarrow $ conversion, constructing surrogate learning tasks for CVR estimation. However, these methods suffer from two significant defects: (1) intrinsic estimation bias (IEB), where the CVR estimates are higher than the actual values; (2) false independence prior (FIP), where the causal relationship between clicks and subsequent conversions is potentially overlooked. To overcome these limitations, we develop a model-agnostic framework, namely Entire Space Counterfactual Multitask Model (ESCM2), which incorporates a counterfactual risk minimizer within the entire space multitask framework to regularize CVR estimation. Experiments conducted on large-scale industrial recommendation datasets and an online industrial recommendation service demonstrate that ESCM2 effectively mitigates IEB and FIP defects and substantially enhances recommendation performance.},

To derive the outer bound, we introduce a new lemma tailored for analyzing privacy constraints. Next, as a specific instance of the general distortion measure, we demonstrate that the tight bound for discrete and Gaussian sources is obtained when the eavesdropper has no side information, and the distortion is quantified by the log-loss distortion measure. We further investigate the rate-distortion-leakage region for a scenario where the eavesdropper has side information, and the distortion is quantified by the log-loss distortion measure and provide an outer bound for this case. The derived outer bound differs from the inner bound by only a minor quantity that appears in the constraints associated with the privacy-leakage rates, and these bounds match when the distortion is large.},

  abstract     = {Reconstruction attacks against federated learning (FL) aim to reconstruct users’ samples through users’ uploaded gradients. Local differential privacy (LDP) is regarded as an effective defense against various attacks, including sample reconstruction in FL, where gradients are clipped and perturbed. Existing attacks are ineffective in FL with LDP since clipped and perturbed gradients obliterate most sample information for reconstruction. Besides, existing attacks embed additional sample information into gradients to improve the attack effect and cause gradient expansion, leading to a more severe gradient clipping in FL with LDP. In this paper, we propose a sample reconstruction attack against LDP-based FL with any target models to reconstruct victims’ sensitive samples to illustrate that FL with LDP is not flawless. Considering gradient expansion in reconstruction attacks and noise in LDP, the core of the proposed attack is gradient compression and reconstructed sample denoising. For gradient compression, an inference structure based on sample characteristics is presented to reduce redundant gradients against LDP. For reconstructed sample denoising, we artificially introduce zero gradients to observe noise distribution and scale confidence interval to filter the noise. Theoretical proof guarantees the effectiveness of the proposed attack. Evaluations show that the proposed attack is the only attack that reconstructs victims’ training samples in LDP-based FL and has little impact on the target model’s accuracy. We conclude that LDP-based FL needs further improvements to defend against sample reconstruction attacks effectively.},

However, these instructions, encompassing images and text, are susceptible to both intentional and inadvertent attacks. Despite the critical importance of LVLMs’ robustness against such threats, current research in this area remains limited. To bridge this gap, we introduce B-AVIBench, a framework designed to analyze the robustness of LVLMs when facing various Black-box Adversarial Visual-Instructions (B-AVIs), including four types of image-based B-AVIs, ten types of text-based B-AVIs, and nine types of content bias B-AVIs (such as gender, violence, cultural, and racial biases, among others). We generate 316K B-AVIs encompassing five categories of multimodal capabilities (ten tasks) and content bias. We then conduct a comprehensive evaluation involving 14 open-source LVLMs to assess their performance. B-AVIBench also serves as a convenient tool for practitioners to evaluate the robustness of LVLMs against B-AVIs. Our findings and extensive experimental results shed light on the vulnerabilities of LVLMs, and highlight that inherent biases exist even in advanced closed-source LVLMs like GeminiProVision and GPT-4V. This underscores the importance of enhancing the robustness, security, and fairness of LVLMs. The source code and benchmark are available at https://github.com/zhanghao5201/B-AVIBench.},

  abstract     = {Password-based authentication is widely applied in Internet of Things (IoT). It allows IoT devices to identify users with passwords to resist unauthorized access. However, choices of weak passwords, especially popular ones, might violate users’ privacy and lead to large-scale network attacks. Collection of popular passwords among IoT devices to establish blocklists via a service provider can prevent use of weak passwords. To protect unpopular passwords during collection, existing privacy-preserving schemes rely on expensive cryptographic primitives (e.g., garbled circuits and zero-knowledge proofs), which would impose heavy communication and computation burdens on constrained devices and hinder wide deployment of these schemes. In this paper, we propose EAGER+, an efficient privacy-preserving scheme for weak password collection in IoT against perpetual leakage. EAGER+ is mainly built on secret sharing and symmetric encryption, thereby enabling lightweight computation and communication on IoT devices. In EAGER+, we conceive a password-locked encryption with conditional decryption mechanism to efficiently identify popular passwords, where a password is essentially locked under itself in the encryption to guarantee its security, and the password can be revealed from the ciphertext by the service provider only if a sufficient number of devices exploit it. The mechanism is integrated with a servers-aided password-hardening mechanism to resist offline dictionary guessing attacks. Moreover, EAGER+ uses a key renewal mechanism to periodically update secrets for password hardening on key servers to thwart perpetual leakage towards the secrets. We formally analyze the security of EAGER+, and conduct experimental evaluations to show that EAGER+ is more efficient than existing schemes.},

However, most current PDP schemes are inapplicable to similarity-like data checking with the same attribute, i.e., when there are numerous similar files to be checked by Data Owners (DOs). Some traditional models cannot resist the corrupt auditors who always generate biased challenge information. Besides, a copy-summation attack exists in some schemes, which means the Cloud Server (CS) can bypass the verification by storing the median value instead of initial data via summation operation. To address the issues above, in this work, we propose a keyword searchable PDP scheme for large similar data checking. To achieve searchability, we introduce the notion of a keyword in PDP and design a specific index structure to match the authenticator. The scheme enables all matched files to be auditable and verifiable, while guaranteeing privacy protections. Unlike existing methods, our Third Party Auditor (TPA) checks all similar data containing the same keyword simultaneously. We utilize unpredictable yet verifiable public information on the blockchain to generate challenge information, rather than relying on a centralized TPA. The proposed scheme can resist copy-summation attacks. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme satisfies the security requirements, and our evaluations demonstrate its efficiency.},

Recent advancements have introduced bootstrapping techniques tailored for CKKS, including the EvalMod and EvalRound bootstrapping techniques. These bootstrapping techniques mainly focus on approximate computation of modular reduction functions. However, the approximation of modular functions encounters challenges related to computational efficiency and bootstrapping precision, thus emerging as a major bottleneck in the advancement of bootstrapping techniques. Motivated by these concerns, in this paper, we introduce a novel bootstrapping scheme named EvalComp, which eliminates the need to fit modular functions. Unlike existing approaches, EvalComp constructs a homomorphic rounding function using the Homomorphic Comparison Function (HCF) and thus removes the integer multiples of the modulus $\boldsymbol {q}$ from the ciphertext. For $\boldsymbol {N = {2^{9}}}$ , EvalComp enhances bootstrapping precision by over 11 bits and computational efficiency by 16.7% compared with the latest EvalMod scheme (JM22). Additionally, compared with the EvalRound scheme (KPK22+), our scheme improves bootstrapping precision by 2-3 bits and computational efficiency by 20.2%. According to the bootstrapping performance comparison criterion, the performance of EvalComp achieves 1.80 times that of JM22 and 1.69 times that of KPK22+.},

  abstract     = {Adversarial attacks, particularly targeted transfer-based attacks, can be used to assess the adversarial robustness of large visual-language models (VLMs), allowing for a more thorough examination of potential security flaws before deployment. However, previous transfer-based adversarial attacks incur high costs due to high iteration counts and complex method structure. Furthermore, due to the unnaturalness of adversarial semantics, the generated adversarial examples have low transferability. These issues limit the utility of existing methods for assessing robustness. To address these issues, we propose AdvDiffVLM, which uses diffusion models to generate natural, unrestricted and targeted adversarial examples via score matching. Specifically, AdvDiffVLM uses Adaptive Ensemble Gradient Estimation (AEGE) to modify the score during the diffusion model’s reverse generation process, ensuring that the produced adversarial examples have natural adversarial targeted semantics, which improves their transferability. Simultaneously, to improve the quality of adversarial examples, we use the GradCAM-guided Mask Generation (GCMG) to disperse adversarial semantics throughout the image rather than concentrating them in a single area. Finally, AdvDiffVLM embeds more target semantics into adversarial examples after multiple iterations. Experimental results show that our method generates adversarial examples 5x to 10x faster than state-of-the-art (SOTA) transfer-based adversarial attacks while maintaining higher quality adversarial examples. Furthermore, compared to previous transfer-based adversarial attacks, the adversarial examples generated by our method have better transferability. Notably, AdvDiffVLM can successfully attack a variety of commercial VLMs in a black-box environment, including GPT-4V. The code is available at https://github.com/gq-max/AdvDiffVLM},

  abstract     = {In the modern interconnected world, the popularization of networks and the rapid development of information technology led to the increasing security risks and threats in network systems. The existing intrusion detection system is constantly challenged by various malicious intrusion attacks. Machine learning algorithms have been widely used in intrusion detection. However, the model training requires the support of a sufficient high-quality samples, especially attack traffic data. Network intrusion detection datasets may not be shared between organizations due to data security and some privacy policy concerns. The federated learning framework is an optimal approach to address this issue, in which organizations collaborate to train a global model shared by multiple parties while keeping the data local to the client, guaranteeing the data privacy and security of all parties. However, there is a problem of class imbalance in the network traffic data owned by the organizations, which seriously affects the detection performance of the model and leads to a high consumption of model training time. Therefore, this study proposed a novel federated undersampling learning framework with Gini impurity, namely Fed-UGI. The framework is based on the hash-based block undersampling method to rebalance the client, which can solve the influence of imbalanced training data on the model detection performance and improve the model training efficiency. Moreover, the client weighted aggregation strategy based on Local Gini impurity can further optimize the effect of global model aggregation and reduce the impact of the dispersion degree and information difference in client data on model aggregation. In addition, extensive experiments on intrusion detection datasets show that compared to SOTA methods, the proposed Fed-UGI method has a good detection effect on the three metrics of F1-score, G-mean and AUC, the training time of the model is reduced by 51.76%-92.58%, especially in highly class imbalance situation.},

  abstract     = {Anonymous Payment Channel Hub (PCH), one of the most promising layer-two solutions, settles the scalability issue in blockchain while guaranteeing the unlinkability of transacting parties. However, such developments bring conflicting requirements, i.e., hiding the sender-to-receiver relationships from any third party but opening the relationship to the auditor. Existing works do not support these requirements simultaneously since off-chain transactions are not recorded in the blockchain. Further, the privacy protection strategies hinder auditors from capturing the payment relationships. Thus, it is still a challenge to audit the finance activities of PCH transacting parties. This paper proposes a novel anonymous PCH solution called AuditPCH to achieve privacy and auditability. Concretely, we design a Linkable Randomizable Puzzle scheme for constructing conditional transactions, allowing a sender to pay for a receiver via the hub. As such, AuditPCH, with the new LRP scheme, ensures that 1) payment relationships can be protected from the hub and 2) an auditor with necessary trapdoors can associate the sender and receiver of a payment. We prove the security of AuditPCH under the Global Universal Composability framework. The extensive experimental evaluations on AuditPCH are established to demonstrate its functionality and flexibility.},

  abstract     = {The diverse properties of wireless networks are fulfilled with the assistance of digital twin (DT), which utilizes a virtual model of the physical object (PO) to provide predictions and control decisions. However, the open wireless channels and key leakage of compromised entities (including DT and PO) pose significant security issues, highlighting the need for secure data transmission schemes. Meanwhile, it is impractical to directly apply the existing works and cryptographic primitives to DT-empowered wireless networks (DTWNs) due to the absence of a solution to capture the security requirements comprehensively. Moreover, the essential characteristics for protecting historical data cannot be met. Therefore, this paper proposes a security-enhanced data transmission scheme with fine-grained and flexible revocation by customizing a novel cryptographic primitive named forward-secure puncturable signed encryption (FS-PSE). Our scheme enables confidential data dissemination/acquisition between the physical and virtual space while ensuring authentication of the real-time information and feedback results. In addition, three revocation modes are defined. Based on these modes, the entities can flexibly revoke any decryption-&amp;-signature, decryption, and signature capability in a fine-grained approach, thereby providing security protections for the historically transmitted data even though the entity is compromised. Moreover, our scheme is instantiated with a concrete FS-PSE construction and extended to support outsourced computing to improve efficiency. Finally, the formal security proof and performance evaluation demonstrate the security and practicality of our scheme.},

  abstract     = {Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as an unparalleled machine learning paradigm where multiple edge clients jointly train a global model without sharing the raw data. However, sharing local models or gradients still compromises clients’ privacy and could be susceptible to delivery failures due to unreliable communication links. To address these issues, this paper considers a multi-server FL where E edge clients wish to jointly train the global model with the help of H servers while guaranteeing data privacy and meanwhile combating $s\leq H$ unreliable links per client. We first propose a hybrid coding scheme based on repetition coding and MDS Coding, such that any $T_{s}$ colluding servers cannot deduce any client data besides the aggregated model, and any $T_{e}$ colluding clients remain unaware of honest clients’ data. Furthermore, we propose a Lagrange coding with mask (LCM) to ensure more stringent privacy protection that additionally demands that colluding servers possess no knowledge about either the local or global models. Furthermore, we establish lower bounds for both the uplink and downlink communication loads and theoretically prove that the hybrid scheme and LCM scheme can achieve the optimal uplink communication loads under the first and second threat models, respectively. For the second threat model with no straggling link, the LCM scheme is optimal. These demonstrate the communication efficiency, robustness, and privacy guarantee of our schemes.},

  abstract     = {Due to the rising requirement for data sharing, multi-data owner access control schemes have emerged, where a single data file is jointly owned by multiple data owners. Since the shared files contain information from multiple data owners, it is crucial to revoke malicious users to minimize harm when data leakage occurs. However, current multi-data owner solutions typically rely on a single data owner to encrypt and share data and fail to provide robust user revocation. When revocation is managed by a single entity, it may fail to protect the rights of all data owners and can introduce a single point of failure in multi-data owner settings. On the other hand, if revocation requires the participation of all data owners, user access may fail if some owners are offline or compromised. To address these issues, we propose a robust multi-data owner access control scheme with efficient user revocation. We construct a secret resharing protocol based on secret sharing technology and proposed a multi-data owner access control scheme. Only users who obtain a sufficient number of private keys can decrypt the ciphertext. To achieve multi-owner controlled revocation, we use key splitting to divide the user’s private key into an authorization key and an update key and embed a period into the update keys. During user revocation, the cloud updates the ciphertext and the data user can decrypt the ciphertext without obtaining the update keys of all data owners. The thorough performance analysis shows that the overhead of the proposed scheme is acceptable. Specifically, the proposed scheme takes approximately 0.5 seconds to encrypt, and with preprocessing, this time is reduced to 0.06 seconds, while decryption requires around 0.15 seconds on the Raspberry Pi.},

  abstract     = {Despite the development of spectral sensors and spectral data-driven learning methods which have led to significant advances in face anti-spoofing (FAS), the singular dimensionality of spectral information often results in poor robustness and weak generalization. Polarization, another fundamental property of light, can reveal intrinsic differences between genuine and fake faces with advantaged performance in precision, robustness, and generalizability. In this paper, we propose a facial image translation method from visible light (VIS) to polarization (VPT), capable of generating valuable polarimetric optical characteristics for facial presentation attack detection using VIS spectrum information input only. Specifically, the VPT method adopts a multi-stream network structure, comprising a main network and two branch networks, to translate VIS images into degree of polarization (DoP) images and Stokes polarization parameters ${S}_{1}$ and ${S}_{2}$ . To further improve image translation quality, we introduce a frequency-domain consistency loss as a complement to the existing spatial losses to narrow the gap in the frequency domain. The physical mapping relations for the DoP and Stokes parameters are employed, and the Stokes loss is designed to ensure that the generated polarization modalities conform to objective physical laws. Extensive experiments on the CASIA-Polar and CASIA-SURF datasets demonstrate the superiority of VPT over other baseline methods in terms of polarization image quality and its remarkable performance in the FAS task. This work leverages the inherent physical advantages of polarization information in material discrimination tasks while addressing hardware limitations in polarization image collection, proposing a novel solution for face recognition system security control.},

  abstract     = {The immutability of blockchain has exposed its limitations in adapting to rapidly evolving legal requirements and preventing malicious misuse. To address these issues, transaction-level redactable blockchain solutions based on the policy-based chameleon hash (PCH) have been introduced. These solutions allow users to create transactions and encrypt trapdoors under specific attribute policies. However, current transaction-level rewriting schemes face two security challenges: Firstly, transactions encrypted with the invalid trapdoor are difficult to rewrite; Secondly, due to lacking version detection on transactions, malicious modifiers may rollback the version of the transaction to launch a reversion attack. In this paper, we present a resilient and redactable blockchain (RRB) with 2-level rewriting and transaction version detection. Specifically, we propose a new redactable blockchain structure that supports both transaction-level and block-level rewriting. To tackle the invalid trapdoor problem, we propose two protocols: a fine-grained, controllable transaction-level rewriting protocol and a centrally controlled block-level rewriting protocol. Moreover, for the transaction reversion attack, we design a version detection mechanism for RRB by using an accumulator. Through security analysis and performance evaluation, we demonstrate the security and practicality of our RRB scheme.},

  abstract     = {Anti-spoofing of deepfake or forged speech is an important technique for the security usage of generative artificial intelligence. Beyond binary classification of real and forged speech, method attribution of forged speech is becoming a practical solution of interpretable anti-spoofing strategies. However, existing related methods have poor performance on analyzing speech forgery methods unseen in their training data, which is inefficient in open-world scenarios with emerging new forgery methods. In this paper, Open-World Forged Speech Attribution (OW-FSA) is firstly defined towards the attribution of forged speech on the methods generating it, where the recognized methods are not limited to the seen ones in training data and the properties of the unseen methods should also be depicted adequately. A novel algorithm, Soft-contrastive Pseudo Learning (SPL), is proposed to address the challenges outlined in OW-FSA, which introduces two key innovations: 1) Based on similarities between features at different scales, the proposed similarity-based soft filtering module filters and matches utterances from the same forgery class to enhance the intra-class compactness of features through contrastive learning. 2) The proposed similarity-based soft pseudo-labeling module integrates label-smoothing-like and similarity weighting techniques to mitigate possible errors in pseudo-labeling. Besides, an iterative algorithm based on SPL is proposed to predict the number of unseen classes. Extensive experiments have validated the superiority of the proposed algorithm over other recently proposed methods on the task of OW-FSA with or without the knowledge of the number of unseen classes. Intuitive visualization and ablation studies have also been conducted to illustrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm. The newly defined task OW-FSA and the proposed algorithm SPL in this paper will help advance the research in speech anti-spoofing.},

  abstract     = {The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has gained significant research focus in both academic and medical institutions. Nevertheless, the sensitive data involved in IoMT raises concerns regarding user validation and data privacy. To address these concerns, certificateless signcryption (CLSC) has emerged as a promising solution, offering authenticity, confidentiality, and unforgeability. Unfortunately, most existing CLSC schemes are impractical for IoMT due to their heavy computational and storage requirements. Additionally, these schemes are vulnerable to quantum computing attacks. Therefore, research focusing on designing an efficient post-quantum CLSC scheme is still far-reaching. In this work, we propose PQ-CLSCL, a novel post-quantum CLSC scheme with linkability for IoMT. Our proposed design facilitates secure transmission of medical data between physicians and patients, effectively validating user legitimacy and minimizing the risk of private information leakage. To achieve this, we leverage lattice sampling algorithms and hash functions to generate the partial secret key, then employ the sign-then-encrypt method and design a link label. We also formalize and prove the security of our design, including indistinguishability against chosen-ciphertext attacks (IND-CCA2), existential unforgeability against chosen-message attacks (EU-CMA), and linkability. Finally, through comprehensive performance evaluation, our computation overhead is just 5% of other existing schemes. The evaluation results demonstrate that our solution is practical and efficient.},

  abstract     = {Person re-identification (re-ID) is a research hotspot in the field of intelligent monitoring and security. Domain generalizable (DG) person re-identification transfers the trained model directly to the unseen target domain for testing, which is closer to the practical application than supervised or unsupervised person re-ID. Meta-learning strategy is an effective way to solve the DG problem, nevertheless, existing meta-learning-based DG re-ID methods mainly simulates the test process in a single aspect such as identity or style, while ignoring the completely different person identities and styles in the unseen target domain. As to this problem, we consider a double disentangling from two levels of training strategy and feature learning, and propose a novel dualistic disentangled meta-learning (D $^{\mathbf {2}}$ ML) model. D $^{\mathbf {2}}$ ML is composed of two disentangling stages, one is for learning strategy, which spreads one-stage meta-test into two-stage, including an identity meta-test stage and a style meta-test stage. The other is for feature representation, which decouples the shallow layer features into identity-related features and style-related features. Specifically, we first conduct identity meta-test stage on different person identities of the images, and then employ a feature-level style perturbation module (SPM) based on Fourier spectrum transformation to conduct the style meta-test stage on the image with diversified styles. With these two stages, abundant changes in the unseen domain can be simulated during the meta-test phase. Besides, to learn more identity-related features, a feature disentangling module (FDM) is inserted at each stage of meta-learning and a disentangled triplet loss is developed. Through constraining the relationship between identity-related features and style-related features, the generalization ability of the model can be further improved. Experimental results on four public datasets show that our D $^{\mathbf {2}}$ ML model achieves superior generalization performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Specific emitter identification (SEI) is crucial in the Internet of Everything (IoE). Over the past decade, deep learning (DL) and broad learning (BL)-enabled SEI technologies have emerged. Both DL- and BL-based SEI methods rely on extensive radio frequency (RF) signal samples and corresponding labels, but labeling unknown signals is a considerable overhead and costly task. Consequently, many researchers have begun exploring semi-supervised learning techniques to address the semi-supervised SEI (SS-SEI) problem with limited labeled RF signals. However, existing SS-SEI solutions often prioritize identification performance, leading to high computational overheads and lacking iterability and scalability. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a novel SS-SEI solution, termed deep cloud and broad edge (DCBE). This approach integrates a DL-based SEI method at the cloud server with an updatable BL-based SEI method at the edge node. Initially, several DL-based SEI models are trained using labeled historical data at the cloud server. Meanwhile, an updatable BL-based SEI method is deployed locally on the edge node to identify unlabelled signals. When the DCBE solution is operational, edge nodes capture real-time unlabelled RF signals. The pre-trained DL-based SEI method and the locally BL-based SEI method jointly identify these RF signals. The identification results, along with the new real-time RF signals, are then used to update the weights of the BL-based SEI method at the edge nodes. The DCBE SS-SEI solution is validated using an open-source, large-scale, real-world automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DCBE solution offers significant advantages in terms of SS-SEI performance, reduced computational overhead without GPU dependency, and system robustness in complex environments.},

  abstract     = {Mitigating DDoS attacks poses a significant challenge for cyber security teams within victim organizations, as these attacks directly target service availability. Most DDoS mitigation solutions focus address the direct effects of DDoS attacks, such as service unavailability and network congestion, while the indirect effects, including collateral damage to legitimate users, receive substantially less attention in the present state-of-the-art. To address this gap, we propose a novel defense architecture designed to mitigate collateral damage and ensure service availability for legitimate users even under attack conditions. The proposed approach employs containerization, micro-services architecture, and traffic segmentation to enhance system resilience and fortify security. We send requests for two distinct services, namely an HTTP-based service and an SSH service, in order to analyze the collateral damage caused by the DDoS attack. The proposed architecture classifies incoming HTTP traffic into two categories: “benign traffic” and “suspicious traffic,” determined by the number of requests originating from the same source address. We tested this approach in three different scenarios (S-1, S-2, and S-3). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed architecture effectively isolates suspicious traffic, mitigating its impact on benign services. This ensures the availability of critical services during a DDoS attack while minimizing collateral damage. In scenarios S-1, S-2, and S-3, it maintains service availability at 3%, 67%, and 98%, respectively, highlighting its efficacy in the face of varying levels of DDoS attack intensity. Furthermore, the architecture is extremely effective in reducing the collateral effects on SSH requests during a DDoS attack. In the S-1 scenario, SSH login time was reduced by 25%, 46%, and 27%, respectively. In the S-2 scenario, the reductions were 99%, 53%, and 29%. In the same vein, the system achieved reductions of 4%, 17%, and 99% in the S-3 scenario.},

However, it is known that Bayesian inference can quickly become intractable if the domains of the involved variables are large. In this paper, we focus on this exact problem and propose a novel approach to perform an estimation of the leakage measures when the true knowledge of the privacy mechanism is beyond the reach of the user for a non-Bayesian framework using machine learning. Initially, we adapt the definition of leakage metrics to a non-Bayesian framework and derive their statistical bounds, and afterward, we evaluate the performance of those metrics via various experiments using Neural Networks, Random Forest Classifiers, and Support Vector Machines. We have also evaluated their performance on an image dataset to demonstrate the versatility of the metrics. Finally, we provide a comparative analysis between our proposed metrics and the metrics of the Bayesian framework.},

Extracting surface and internal fingerprints for identity recognition is possible by processing OCT images with layer segmentation and contour extraction. However, due to domain shift effects, OCT fingerprint extraction models often struggle to perform well across different devices. In this paper, a cross-device OCT fingerprint extraction method based on test-time image reconstruction is proposed. This method simultaneously trains layer segmentation and image reconstruction tasks during training. Additionally, a contour classification task is integrated to ensure the continuity and robustness of the contour extraction results. During the testing phase, image reconstruction is performed on test images, and the shared modules are updated to adapt the layer segmentation and contour classification network to the test domain. The result with the minimum inconsistency during the testing phase is selected as the final prediction. Experiments and comparisons are performed in terms of the distance between the ground truth and the extracted contours.},

  abstract     = {Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) is regarded as one of the most promising techniques for managing and regulating Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This technology analyzes the unique electromagnetic signals emitted by wireless devices to enable precise identification and authentication. Most existing RFFI methods focus on RF signals collected in specific scenarios. However, in real-world applications, signals are often collected at different times or from varying deployment locations, leading to differences between the training and testing distributions. The study of RFFI methods under these conditions remains underexplored. To address this gap, this paper introduces a cross-domain RFFI framework centered on adaptive semantic augmentation (ASA). The framework integrates a computationally efficient multi-resolution spectrogram decomposition strategy with a feature-sensitive multi-scale network. The ASA method enhances RFFI accuracy in cross-domain settings by linearly interpolating between two distinct semantic features to create new semantics for further identification. The proposed approach leverages two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform (2D-DWT) to decompose the raw spectrogram into four sub-bands, followed by a multi-scale network to extract critical semantic features for the ASA method. Simulation results show that the proposed ASA method significantly improves Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) identification performance, achieving accuracies of 93.05% and 98.90% on two different cross-domain datasets, respectively, outperforming existing data augmentation (DA) methods. Furthermore, generalizability validation demonstrates that the proposed method performs outstandingly across other Internet of Things (IoT) applications.},

  abstract     = {Model Inversion Attacks (MIAs) pose a certain threat to the data privacy of learning-based systems, as they enable adversaries to reconstruct identifiable features of the training distribution with only query access to the victim model. In the context of deep learning, the primary challenges associated with MIAs are suboptimal attack success rates and the corresponding high computational costs. Prior efforts assumed that the expansive search space caused these limitations, employing generative models to constrain the dimensions of the search space. Despite the initial success of these generative-based solutions, recent experiments have cast doubt on this fundamental assumption, leaving two open questions about the influential factors determining MIA performance and how to manipulate these factors to improve MIAs. To answer these questions, we reframe MIAs from the perspective of information flow. This new formulation allows us to establish a lower bound for the error probability of MIAs, determined by two critical factors: (1) the size of the search space and (2) the mutual information between input and output random variables. Through a detailed analysis of generative-based MIAs within this theoretical framework, we uncover a trade-off between the size of the search space and the generation capability of generative models. Based on the theoretical conclusions, we introduce the Query-Efficient Model Inversion Approach (QE-MIA). By strategically selecting an appropriate search space and introducing additional mutual information, QE-MIA achieves a reduction of $60\%\sim 70\%$ in query overhead while concurrently enhancing the attack success rate by $5\%\sim 25\%$ .},

  abstract     = {The rapid evolution of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has necessitated increased device interactions across various management domains. This entails devices from different domains collaborating on the same production task. This poses significant challenges for the dynamics of cross-domain authentication schemes. Traditional cross-domain authentication schemes struggle to support seamless switching between domains and face difficulties when accommodating devices that join and leave the same domain. Moreover, these schemes suffer from intricate interactions and suboptimal efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a dynamic group signature scheme based on a dynamic accumulator and a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof. We integrated this scheme with blockchain technology to construct an efficient revocation cross-domain authentication scheme. The proposed scheme enables cross-domain anonymous authentication with simple interactions and provides an efficient revocation function for illegal devices. This approach ensures conditional privacy-preserving and enables efficient member joining and exiting through a dynamic accumulator. It effectively addresses the dynamic requirements of devices involved in IIoT production and manufacturing processes. We prove the security of the proposed scheme using a random Oracle model and conduct thorough analyses to verify its resistance against various attacks. Furthermore, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves better performance in terms of computational and communication costs.},

  abstract     = {As person image variations are likely to cause a part misalignment problem, most previous person Re-Identification (ReID) works may adopt local feature partition or additional landmark annotations to acquire aligned person features and boost ReID performance. However, such approaches either only achieve coarse-grained part alignments without considering detailed image variations within each part, or require extra annotated landmarks to train an available pose estimation model. In this work, we propose an effective Discriminable and Reliable Transformer (DRFormer) framework to learn part-aligned person representations with only person identity labels. Specifically, the DRFormer framework consists of Discriminable Feature Transformer (DFT) and Reliable Feature Transformer (RFT) modules, which generate discriminable and reliable high-order features, respectively. For reducing the dimension of high-order features, the DFT module utilizes a Self-Attentive Kronecker Product (SAKP) algorithm to promote the representational capabilities of compressed features via a self-attention strategy. For eliminating the background noise, the RFT module mines the foreground regions to adaptively aggregate foreground features via a Gumbel-Softmax strategy. Moreover, the proposed framework derives from an interpretable motivation and elegantly solves part misalignments without using feature partition or pose estimation. This paper theoretically and experimentally demonstrates the superiority of the proposed DRFormer framework, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various person ReID datasets.},

  abstract     = {The cloud server is a versatile platform for data storage, with users increasingly uploading personal data to public servers to circumvent costly local storage. However, the server is not entirely honest, as it may potentially compromise user data privacy. Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) is a highly flexible cryptographic technique for ensuring access control over encrypted data in cloud storage applications. To prevent unauthorized access, traceability and revocability are two necessary requirements for CP-ABE system. Nevertheless, existing white-box traceable and revocable CP-ABE schemes suffer from several imitations: 1) Whether direct revocation or indirect revocation is applied, neither type of the revocation mode is well compatible with the trace function. 2) Moreover, all of the previous white-box traceable CP-ABE schemes rely on non-static assumptions to prove traceability. Ideally, a scheme provably secure under static complexity assumptions is preferable. To deal with these issues, we propose a novel traceable and server-aided revocable CP-ABE (TSR-ABE) scheme based on static assumptions. Specifically, our revocation mode works well with the trace function, and we prove the adaptive chosen-plaintext attack security and traceability of our scheme via the well-known dual system encryption methodology. Compared with many previous traceable CP-ABE schemes, regardless of whether they support revocation or not, we remove the need to introduce an additional l-SDH assumption to prove the traceability of the scheme. In addition, our scheme is more practical due to its lower private key size, lower decryption costs and lower tracing costs. As a result, we strengthen current research from the perspective of both security and efficiency.},

In general, existing denial-of-service (DoS) attack models typically conduct indiscriminate attacks on data packets, disregarding the significance of the attacked data packets to the system. Note that the measurement data from different sensor nodes possesses varying levels of importance. In light of this, we first propose a novel form of attack from the perspective of attack design, known as a data-importance-aware attack. The importance of data refers to the quantitative impact of the measured values at each sensor node on the stable and safe operation of the entire system. As such, the proposed attack has the awareness to launch attacks against critical sensor nodes, rendering data unable to be transmitted. Then, an attack-node-dependent security controller is devised from the defender’s perspective against the constructed attack, which can effectively resist the impact of attacks and stabilize the system. By employing the Lyapunov functional method, sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system. Finally, the reliability and effectiveness of the node importance-aware attack strategy and control countermeasure are validated by numerical simulation.},

These attacks employ carefully designed strategies to reconstruct victim’s private training data from their shared gradients. However, existing work mainly focuses on attacks and defenses for image-modal data, while the study for text-modal data remains scarce. Furthermore, the performance of the limited attack researches on text-modal data is also unsatisfactory, which can be partially attributed to the finer granularity of text data compared to image. To bridge the existing research gap, we propose a high-fidelity attack method tailored for Transformer-based language models (LMs). In our method, we initially reconstruct the label space of the victim’s training data by leveraging the characteristics of the Transformer architecture. After that, we propose a shallow-to-deep paradigm to facilitate gradient matching, which can significantly improve the attack performance. Furthermore, we develop a weighted surrogate loss that resolves the consistent deviation issue present in current attack researches. A substantial number of experiments on Transformer-based LMs (e.g., Bert and GPT) demonstrate that our attack is competitive and significantly outperforms existing methods. In the final part of this paper, we investigate the influence of the inherent position embedding module within the Transformer architecture on attack performance, and based on the analysis results, we propose a countermeasure to alleviate part of the privacy leakage issue in distributed learning.},

Meanwhile, these rapid developments have raised concerns about the legitimacy of the training process of deep neural networks. To protect the intellectual properties of AI developers, directly examining the training process by accessing the model parameters and training data is often prohibited for verifiers. In response to this challenge, we present zero-knowledge deep learning (zkDL), an efficient zero-knowledge proof for deep learning training. To address the long-standing challenge of verifiable computations of non-linearities in deep learning training, we introduce zkReLU, a specialized proof for the ReLU activation and its backpropagation. zkReLU turns the disadvantage of non-arithmetic relations into an advantage, leading to the creation of FAC4DNN, our specialized arithmetic circuit design for modelling neural networks. This design aggregates the proofs over different layers and training steps, without being constrained by their sequential order in the training process. With our new CUDA implementation that achieves full compatibility with the tensor structures and the aggregated proof design, zkDL enables the generation of complete and sound proofs in less than a second per batch update for an 8-layer neural network with 10M parameters and a batch size of 64, while provably ensuring the privacy of data and model parameters. To our best knowledge, we are not aware of any existing work on zero-knowledge proof of deep learning training that is scalable to million-size networks.},

Existing evaluation metrics, e.g., $L_{p}$ norms or Image Quality Assessment (IQA), fall short of assessing the pixel-level stealthiness of subtle adversarial perturbations since these metrics are primarily designed for traditional distortions. To bridge this gap, we present the first comprehensive study on the subjective and objective assessment of the stealthiness of adversarial perturbations from a visual perspective at a pixel level. Specifically, we propose new subjective assessment criteria for human observers to score adversarial stealthiness in a fine-grained manner. Then, we create a large-scale adversarial example dataset comprising 10586 pairs of clean and adversarial samples encompassing twelve state-of-the-art adversarial attacks. To obtain the subjective scores according to the proposed criterion, we recruit 60 human observers, and each adversarial example is evaluated by at least 15 observers. The mean opinion score of each adversarial example is utilized for labeling. Finally, we develop a three-stage objective scoring model that mimics human scoring habits to predict adversarial perturbation’s stealthiness. Experimental results demonstrate that our objective model exhibits superior consistency with the human visual system, surpassing commonly employed metrics like PSNR and SSIM.},

  abstract     = {We show that a class of optical physical unclonable functions (PUFs) can be efficiently PAC-learned to arbitrary precision with arbitrarily high probability, even in the presence of intentionally injected noise, given access to polynomially many challenge-response pairs, under mild and practical assumptions about the distributions of the noise and challenge vectors. We motivate our analysis by identifying similarities between the integrated version of Pappu’s original optical PUF design and the post-quantum Learning with Errors (LWE) cryptosystem. We derive polynomial bounds for the required number of samples and the computational complexity of a linear regression algorithm, based on size parameters of the PUF, the distributions of the challenge and noise vectors, and the desired accuracy and probability of success of the regression algorithm. We use a similar analysis to that done by Bootle et al. [“LWE without modular reduction and improved side-channel attacks against BLISS,” in Advances in Cryptology – ASIACRYPT 2018], who demonstrated a learning attack on poorly implemented versions of LWE cryptosystems. This extends the results of Rührmair et al. [“Optical PUFs reloaded,” Cryptology ePrint Archive, 2013], who presented a theoretical framework showing that a subset of this class of PUFs is learnable in polynomial time in the absence of injected noise, under the assumption that the optics of the PUF were either linear or had negligible nonlinear effects. (Rührmair et al. also included an experimental validation of this technique, which of course included measurement uncertainty, demonstrating robustness to the presence of natural noise.) We recommend that the design of strong PUFs should be treated as a cryptographic engineering problem in physics, as PUF designs would benefit greatly from basing their physics and security on standard cryptographic assumptions. Finally, we identify future research directions, including suggestions for how to modify an LWE-based optical PUF design to better defend against cryptanalytic attacks.},

  abstract     = {AI-synthesized speech, also known as deepfake speech, has recently raised significant concerns due to the rapid advancement of speech synthesis and speech conversion techniques. Previous works often rely on distinguishing synthesizer artifacts to identify deepfake speech. However, excessive reliance on these specific synthesizer artifacts may result in unsatisfactory performance when addressing speech signals created by unseen synthesizers. In this paper, we propose a robust deepfake speech detection method that employs feature decomposition to learn synthesizer-independent content features as complementary for detection. Specifically, we propose a dual-stream feature decomposition learning strategy that decomposes the learned speech representation using a synthesizer stream and a content stream. The synthesizer stream specializes in learning synthesizer features through supervised training with synthesizer labels. Meanwhile, the content stream focuses on learning synthesizer-independent content features, enabled by a pseudo-labeling-based supervised learning method. This method randomly transforms speech to generate speed and compression labels for training. Additionally, we employ an adversarial learning technique to reduce the synthesizer-related components in the content stream. The final classification is determined by concatenating the synthesizer and content features. To enhance the model’s robustness to different synthesizer characteristics, we further propose a synthesizer feature augmentation strategy that randomly blends the characteristic styles within real and fake audio features and randomly shuffles the synthesizer features with the content features. This strategy effectively enhances the feature diversity and simulates more feature combinations. Experimental results on four deepfake speech benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art robust detection performance across various evaluation scenarios, including cross-method, cross-dataset, and cross-language evaluations.},

  abstract     = {Well-trained deep learning (DL) models are widely recognized as valuable intellectual property (IP) and have been extensively adopted. However, concerns regarding IP infringement emerge when these models are either privately sold to end-users or publicly released online. Unauthorized activities, such as redistributing privately purchased models or exploiting restricted open-source models for commercial gain, pose a significant threat to the interests of model owners. In this paper, we introduce DeepReg, a trustworthy and privacy-friendly regulatory framework designed to address IP infringement within the realm of DL models, thereby nurturing a healthier development ecosystem. DeepReg enables a designated third-party regulator to extract the fingerprint of the original model within a Trusted Execution Environment, as well as to verify suspect models utilizing solely the predicted label without probability. Specifically, we leverage the uniqueness of feature extractors in DL models to craft multiple synthetic inputs for a selected real input. The real input, along with its synthetic inputs, establishes a one-to-many relationship, thereby creating a unique fingerprint for the original model. Furthermore, we propose two distinct methods for suspect detection and piracy judgment. These methods analyze the responses from the model API upon feeding the fingerprint, ensuring a high level of confidence while preventing malicious accusations. Experimental results demonstrate that DeepReg achieves 100% detection accuracy for pirated models, with zero false positives for irrelevant models.},

  abstract     = {The rampant fraudulent activities on Ethereum hinder the healthy development of the blockchain ecosystem, necessitating the reinforcement of regulations. However, multiple imbalances involving account interaction frequencies and interaction types in the Ethereum transaction environment pose significant challenges to data mining-based fraud detection research. To address this, we first propose the concept of meta-interactions to refine interaction behaviors in Ethereum, and based on this, we present a dual self-supervision enhanced Ethereum fraud detection framework, named Meta-IFD. This framework initially introduces a generative self-supervision mechanism to augment the interaction features of accounts, followed by a contrastive self-supervision mechanism to differentiate various behavior patterns, and ultimately characterizes the behavioral representations of accounts and mines potential fraud risks through multi-view interaction feature learning. Extensive experiments on real Ethereum datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our framework in detecting common Ethereum fraud behaviors such as Ponzi schemes and phishing scams. Additionally, the generative module can effectively alleviate the interaction distribution imbalance in Ethereum data, while the contrastive module significantly enhances the framework’s ability to distinguish different behavior patterns.

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) emerged as a paradigm designed to improve data privacy by enabling data to reside at its source, thus embedding privacy as a core consideration in FL architectures, whether centralized or decentralized. Contrasting with recent findings by Pasquini et al., which suggest that decentralized FL does not empirically offer any additional privacy or security benefits over centralized models, our study provides compelling evidence to the contrary. We demonstrate that decentralized FL, when deploying distributed optimization, provides enhanced privacy protection - both theoretically and empirically - compared to centralized approaches. The challenge of quantifying privacy loss through iterative processes has traditionally constrained the theoretical exploration of FL protocols. We overcome this by conducting a pioneering in-depth information-theoretical privacy analysis for both frameworks. Our analysis, considering both eavesdropping and passive adversary models, successfully establishes bounds on privacy leakage. In particular, we show information theoretically that the privacy loss in decentralized FL is upper bounded by the loss in centralized FL. Compared to the centralized case where local gradients of individual participants are directly revealed, a key distinction of optimization-based decentralized FL is that the relevant information includes differences of local gradients over successive iterations and the aggregated sum of different nodes’ gradients over the network. This information complicates the adversary’s attempt to infer private data. To bridge our theoretical insights with practical applications, we present detailed case studies involving logistic regression and deep neural networks. These examples demonstrate that while privacy leakage remains comparable in simpler models, complex models like deep neural networks exhibit lower privacy risks under decentralized FL. Extensive numerical tests further validate that decentralized FL is more resistant to privacy attacks, aligning with our theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {Differentially Private Federated learning (DPFL) applies differential privacy (DP) techniques to preserve clients’ privacy in Federated Learning (FL). Existing methods based on Gaussian Mechanism require the operations of model updates clipping and noise injection, which lead to a serious degradation in model accuracies. Several improved methods are proposed to mitigate the accuracy degradation by decreasing the scale of the injected noise. Different from previous methods, we firstly propose to enhance the model robustness against the DP noise for the accuracy improvement. In this paper, we develop a novel FL scheme with improved model robustness, called FedIMR, which can provide the client-level DP guarantee while maintaining a high model accuracy. We find that the injected noise leads to the fluctuation of loss values in the local training, hindering the model convergence seriously. This motivates us to improve the model robustness for narrowing down the bias of model outputs caused by the noise. The model robustness is evaluated with the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of each layer’s outputs. Two techniques are proposed to improve the output SNR, including the logit vector normalization (LVN) and dynamic clipping threshold (DCT). Specifically, LVN normalizes the logit vertor to make the optimization algorithm keep increasing the model output, which is the signal item of the output SNR. DCT dynamically adjusts the clipping threshold to reduce the noise item of the output SNR. We also provide the privacy analysis and convergence results. Experiments are conducted over three famous datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. Both the theoretical results and empirical experiments confirm that our FedIMR can achieve a better accuracy-privacy tradeoff than previous methods.},

Unfortunately, the guarantees of privacy and authenticity are not always provided in OSNs. Individuals are still facing the challenges of being deceived or exploited. To mitigate these issues, anonymous social networks (ASNs) have emerged as a remedy for OSNs, facilitating individuals to connect with others anonymously and authentically. Despite the existence of numerous and remarkable cryptographic primitives, there are no formal solutions for ASNs except for matchmaking encryption (ME), since ME can simultaneously provide various key functionalities, i.e. bilateral access control, identity anonymity, and message authentication, to address the requirements of ASNs. In this paper, we design a system for ASNs by adopting fuzzy identity-based matchmaking encryption (fuzzy IB-ME), and the proposed scheme in this work is highly efficient. The scheme also realizes adaptive security in generic group model (GGM), which is generally adopted in pairing-based cryptography. The proposed ASNs system offers various advantages compared to the previous solutions, including 1) bilateral access control, 2) enhanced security, 3) high scalability, and 4) high efficiency. In addition to theoretical evaluations, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our scheme’s computational and storage efficiency. These evaluations indicate that our solution outperforms previous solutions and as well as preserves many desired functionalities.},

The advent of 5G/6G technologies has ushered in an era of extensive device connectivity, diverse networks, and complex application scenarios within IoT ecosystems. These advancements necessitate PLA systems that are highly secure, robust, capable of online processing, and adaptable to unknown channel conditions. In this paper, we introduce a novel two-stage PLA framework that synergizes channel prediction with power-delay attributes, ensuring superior performance in mobile and time-varying channel environments. Specifically, our approach employs Sparse Variational Gaussian Processes (SVGP) to accurately model and track real-time channel variations, leveraging historical data for online predictions without incurring significant computational or storage overhead. The second stage of our framework enhances the robustness of the authentication process by incorporating power-delay features, which are inherently resistant to temporal fluctuations, thereby eliminating the need for additional feature extraction in noisy settings. Moreover, our authentication scheme is designed to be distribution-agnostic, utilizing Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) for non-parametric threshold determination in hypothesis testing. Theoretical analysis underpins the generalization capabilities of our proposed method. Simulation results in mobile scenarios reveal that our two-stage PLA framework reduces complexity and significantly improves identity authentication performance, particularly in scenarios with low signal-to-noise ratios.},

While being deployed, digital systems are also subject to a plethora of threats such as power, timing, and electromagnetic (EM) side channel attacks. Many Design-for-Security (DFS) solutions have been proposed to deal with these vulnerabilities, and such solutions (DFS) relays on strategic modifications (e.g., logic locking, side channel resilient masking, and dummy logic insertion) of the digital designs for ensuring a higher level of security. However, most of these DFS strategies lack robust formalism, are often not human-understandable, and require an extensive amount of human expert effort during their development/use. All of these factors make it difficult to keep up with the ever growing number of microelectronic vulnerabilities.

However, the inhomogeneous medium and the open feature of underwater environment make it challenging to accomplish the above task. This paper studies the privacy-preserving localization issue of UASNs with consideration of direct and indirect data threats. To handle the direct data threat, a privacy-preserving localization protocol is designed for sensor nodes, where the mutual information is adopted to acquire the optimal noises added on anchor nodes. With the collected range information from anchor nodes, a ray tracing model is employed for sensor nodes to compensate the range bias caused by straight-line propagation. Then, a differential privacy (DP) based deep learning localization estimator is designed to calculate the positions of sensor nodes, and the perturbations are added to the forward propagation of deep learning framework, such that the indirect data leakage can be avoided. Besides that, the theory analyses including the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB), the privacy budget and the complexity are provided. Main innovations of this paper include: 1) the mutual information-based localization protocol can acquire the optimal noise over the traditional noise-adding mechanisms; 2) the DP-based deep learning estimator can avoid the leakage of training data caused by overfitting in traditional deep learning-based solutions. Finally, simulation and experimental results are both conducted to verify the effectiveness of our approach.},

Based on such assertion, a novel differentially private decentralized primal-dual algorithm named DP-RECAL is proposed to take advantage of operator splitting method and relay communication mechanism to experience less PLF so as to reduce the overall privacy budget. To the best of our knowledge, compared with existing differentially private algorithms, DP-RECAL presents superior privacy performance and communication complexity. In addition, with uncoordinated network-independent stepsizes, we prove the convergence of DP-RECAL for general convex problems and establish a linear convergence rate under the metric subregularity. Evaluation analysis on least squares problem and numerical experiments on real-world datasets verify our theoretical results and demonstrate that DP-RECAL can defend some classical gradient leakage attacks.},

However, the collected measurement datasets in smart grids typically exhibit skewed class distributions and are partially labeled due to the expensive labeling costs. Learning from such non-ideal datasets undoubtedly results in the degenerated detection performance of the data-driven methods. To cope with this issue, we propose an optimal transport (OT)-based framework named DeSSW to promote the utilization of plentiful unlabeled measurements through the self-training technique, which improves the ability to identify FDI attacks by producing distinguishable representations for normal and attacked measurements in the feature space. Specifically, DeSSW consists of a novel re-weighting algorithm and a debiased self-training strategy. The re-weighting algorithm ensures high-confidence unlabeled measurements dominate the self-training procedure, and the debiased self-training strategy mitigates bias accumulation in the iterative self-training procedure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeSSW achieves superior detection performance when facing the combinatorial challenge of partially labeled and class-imbalanced measurements, even if the measurements are noisy.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning-based website fingerprinting (WF) attacks dominate website traffic classification. In the real world, the main challenges limiting their effectiveness are, on the one hand, the difficulty in countering the effect of content updates on the basis of accurate descriptions of page features in traffic representations. On the other hand, the model’s accuracy relies on training numerous samples, requiring constant manual labeling. The key to solving the problem is to find a website traffic representation that can stably and accurately display page features, as well as to perform self-supervised learning that is not reliant on manual labeling. This study introduces the multi-level resource-coherented graph convolutional neural network (MRCGCN), a self-supervised learning-based WF attack. It analyzes website traffic using resources as the basic unit, which are coarser than packets, ensuring the page’s unique resource layout while improving the robustness of the representations. Then, we utilized an echelon-ordered graph kernel function to extract the graph topology as the label for website traffic. Finally, a two-channel graph convolutional neural network is designed for constructing a self-supervised learning-based traffic classifier. We evaluated the WF attacks using real data in both closed- and open-world scenarios. The results demonstrate that the proposed WF attack has superior and more comprehensive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Encryption techniques greatly ensure the confidentiality and integrity of network communications. However, they also allow attackers to conceal malicious activities within encrypted traffic, posing severe cybersecurity challenges. Current detection methods primarily rely on statistics and correlation analysis. However, both statistical features and inter-entity relations can be easily obfuscated. Moreover, issues with low-quality data and fixed feature sets limit the generalizability and adaptability to defend against various evasion techniques. Robustifying encrypted malicious traffic detection in adverse conditions is still an open problem. In this paper, we propose R e T rial , a robust encrypted malicious traffic detection system via discriminative relation incorporation and misleading relation correction. The key motivations behind R e T rial are to accurately leverage the rich relations among flows for contextual analysis, and correct misleading ones for robust threat detection. Specifically, we construct a relational multigraph and develop a tailored Graph Attention Network (GAT) to selectively incorporate contextual information. Then we retrieve multi-order neighborhood similarity graphs as observations for adaptive relation correction. Following an iterative scheme, both detector performance and graph topology mutually optimize. To validate the robustness of R e T rial , we simulate various adverse conditions by randomly dropping packets and greedily injecting perturbation edges. The experimental results show that R e T rial is competitive in ideal condition. Under adverse conditions, though the performances of other state-of-the-art methods degrade significantly, R e T rial consistently exhibits superior performance with a maximum reduction of only 5.88% in F1, highlighting its robustness in threat detection.},

This paper proposes a robust image hashing approach via Weighted Saliency Map (WSM) and Laplacian Eigenmaps (LE) (hereafter WSM-LE approach). An important contribution is the WSM construction via the edge map and the saliency map. As the WSM can indicate the interest regions of image, hash calculation based on WSM can provide robustness of our WSM-LE approach. Another contribution is the low-dimensional feature learning by the LE technique. As the LE technique can effectively learn the internal geometric relationships of image, the extracted low-dimensional features can improve discrimination of our WSM-LE approach. In addition, the low-dimensional features are treated as vectors and the vector distances are used to create a compact and encrypted hash. Numerous experiments and comparisons are conducted to confirm the effectiveness and superiority of our WSM-LE approach. The results indicate that our WSM-LE approach has excellent classification and copy detection performances than some baseline approaches.},

  abstract     = {Due to the increasing trend of performing spamming activities (e.g., Web spam, deceptive reviews, fake followers, etc.) on various online platforms to gain undeserved benefits, spam detection has emerged as a hot research issue. Previous attempts to combat spam mainly employ features related to metadata, user behaviors, or relational ties. These studies have made considerable progress in understanding and filtering spamming campaigns. However, this problem remains far from fully solved. Almost all the proposed features focus on a limited number of observed attributes or explainable phenomena, making it difficult for existing methods to achieve further improvement. To broaden the vision about solving the spam problem and address long-standing challenges (class imbalance and graph incompleteness) in the spam detection area, we propose a new attempt of utilizing signed latent factors to filter fraudulent activities. The spam-contaminated relational datasets of multiple online applications in this scenario are interpreted by the unified signed network. Two competitive and highly dissimilar algorithms of latent factors mining (LFM) models are designed based on multi-relational likelihoods estimation (LFM-MRLE) and signed pairwise ranking (LFM-SPR), respectively. We then explore how to apply the mined latent factors to spam detection tasks. Experiments on real-world datasets of different kinds of Web applications (social media and Web forum) indicate that LFM models outperform state-of-the-art baselines in detecting spamming activities. By specifically manipulating experimental data, the effectiveness of our methods in dealing with incomplete and imbalanced challenges is validated.},

  abstract     = {Data sharing facilitates the integration and in-depth exploration of cross-domain data, thereby fostering innovative research and model development. However, privacy leakage emerges as a critical barrier to the sharing and circulating of such data. Existing privacy-preserving technologies face challenges in handling complex scenarios involving multiple participants due to the following reasons: 1) Divergent privacy permission. Data sharing is constrained by various privacy limitations, necessitating the consideration of privacy permissions across different domains, akin to a cross-border process. 2) High collaboration cost. Collaboration among multiple domains to determine the privacy constraint and sharing ways incur additional costs. 3) Large noise magnitude. Traditional privacy techniques to protect the privacy of a single domain using local differential privacy (LDP) may introduce excessive noise, thereby reducing data utility. Drawing inspiration from the cross-border visa issuance process, we present an innovative framework called PriVisa for enabling privacy-preserving data sharing across different domains. It consists of four key modules to overcome the mentioned challenges: the hybrid pattern, optimized sharing path construction, personalized grouping, and LDP-based perturbation. 1) The hybrid pattern for coordination among organizations, considering authentication, privacy constraints, and sharing methods. 2) The optimized sharing path construction using a privacy constraint hierarchy tree to maximize data utility while adhering to privacy requirements. 3) The feature similarity grouping and perturbing mechanism satisfying LDP to protect privacy and optimize data utility. The theoretical and experimental validation confirms PriVisa’s effectiveness in addressing divergent privacy constraints and promoting data utility in cross-domain data sharing.},

  abstract     = {With the increasing scale and complexity of online activities, accountability, as an after-the-fact mechanism, has become an effective complementary approach to ensure system security. Decades of research have delved into the connotation of accountability. They fail, however, to achieve practical accountability of decryption. This paper seeks to address this gap. We consider the scenario where a client (called encryptor, her) encrypts her data and then chooses a delegate (a.k.a. decryptor, him) that stores data for her. If the decryptor initiates an illegitimate decryption on the encrypted data, there is a non-negligible probability that this behavior will be detected, thereby holding the decryptor accountable for his decryption. We make three contributions. First, we review key definitions of accountability known so far. Based on extensive investigations, we formalize new definitions of accountability specifically targeting the decryption process, denoted as accountable decryption, and discuss the (im)possibilities when capturing this concept. We also define the security goals in correspondence. Second, we present a novel Trusted Execution Environment(TEE)-assisted solution aligning with definitions. Instead of fully trusting TEE, we take a further step, making TEE work in the “trust, but verify” model where we trust TEE and use its service, but empower users (i.e., decryptors) to detect the potentially compromised state of TEEs. Third, we implement a full-fledged system and conduct a series of evaluations. The results demonstrate that our solution is efficient. Even in a scenario involving $300,000$ log entries, the decryption process concludes in approximately 5.5ms, and malicious decryptors can be identified within 69ms.},

  abstract     = {With the recent advances in computer vision, age estimation has significantly improved in overall accuracy. However, owing to the most common methods do not take into account the class imbalance problem in age estimation datasets, they suffer from a large bias in recognizing long-tailed groups. To achieve high-quality imbalanced learning in long-tailed groups, the dominant solution lies in that the feature extractor learns the discriminative features of different groups and the classifier is able to provide appropriate and unbiased margins for different groups by the discriminative features. Therefore, in this novel, we propose an innovative collaborative learning framework (GroupFace) that integrates a multi-hop attention graph convolutional network and a dynamic group-aware margin strategy based on reinforcement learning. Specifically, to extract the discriminative features of different groups, we design an enhanced multi-hop attention graph convolutional network. This network is capable of capturing the interactions of neighboring nodes at different distances, fusing local and global information to model facial deep aging, and exploring diverse representations of different groups. In addition, to further address the class imbalance problem, we design a dynamic group-aware margin strategy based on reinforcement learning to provide appropriate and unbiased margins for different groups. The strategy divides the sample into four age groups and considers identifying the optimum margins for various age groups by employing a Markov decision process. Under the guidance of the agent, the feature representation bias and the classification margin deviation between different groups can be reduced simultaneously, balancing inter-class separability and intra-class proximity. After joint optimization, our architecture achieves excellent performance on several age estimation benchmark datasets. It not only achieves large improvements in overall estimation accuracy but also gains balanced performance in long-tailed group estimation.},

However, malicious actors can exploit these tools to integrate sensitive user information, thereby posing cybersecurity risks. Although many researchers have explored attacking SNA (ASNA) through network modification attacks to protect users, practical feasibility remains challenging. In this study, we propose an effective node injection attack via a dynamic programming framework (DPNIA) to address the problem of modeling and solving ASNA within a limited time and balancing the costs and benefits. DPNIA models ASNA as a problem of maximizing the number of confirmed incorrect correspondent node pairs with greater similarity scores than the pairs between existing nodes, thereby making ASNA solvable. A cross-network evaluation method is employed directly to identify node vulnerabilities, facilitating progressive attacking from easy to difficult. In addition, an optimal injection strategy searching method based on dynamic programming is used to determine which links should be added between the injected and existing nodes, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of the attack at a low cost. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrated that DPNIA consistently and significantly surpasses various baselines when attacking both multiple networks simultaneously and a single network.},

In contrast to these existing heuristic approaches, we propose an optimal adversarial complicity strategy, called collusion attack, which leverages the tight collaboration between an external attacker and an internal spy to tie up into the close colluder, simultaneously enabling the input-&amp;model-corrupted tampering modes and misleading the gait recognizer more powerfully and stealthily for misidentifying the illegitimate Alice as legitimate Bob. Specifically, we formulate a bilevel optimization problem to model such a leader-follower Stackelberg game with sequentially adversarial interaction process between the colluders and gait recognizer. Further, to solve this challenging bilevel problem efficiently, we absorb the Lagrangian dual theory and linearization representation method to reformulate a tractable mixed integer program. Finally, we perform comparison and ablation experiments with the state-of-the-art attack modes on single-&amp;multi-source gait datasets to verify the validity of our collusion strategy in inducing the mistaken identity with great success rate, high confidence, and low cost. Empirical results also shed light on key insights in mitigating the collusion attacks and enhancing the gait recognition robustness to safeguard the identity access applications.},

To explore the interpretability of fingerprint matching, we propose a multi-stage interpretable fingerprint matching network, namely Interpretable Fixed-length Representation for Fingerprint Matching via Vision Transformer (IFViT), which consists of two primary modules. The first module, an interpretable dense registration module, establishes a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based Siamese Network to capture long-range dependencies and the global context in fingerprint pairs. It provides interpretable dense pixel-wise correspondences of feature points for fingerprint alignment and enhances the interpretability in the subsequent matching stage. The second module takes into account both local and global representations of the aligned fingerprint pair to achieve an interpretable fixed-length representation extraction and matching. It employs the ViTs trained in the first module with the additional fully connected layer and retrains them to simultaneously produce the discriminative fixed-length representation and interpretable dense pixel-wise correspondences of feature points. Extensive experimental results on diverse publicly available fingerprint databases demonstrate that the proposed framework not only exhibits superior performance on dense registration and matching but also significantly promotes the interpretability in deep fixed-length representations-based fingerprint matching.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning (DL) enabled semantic communications leverage DL to train encoders and decoders (codecs) to extract and recover semantic information. However, most semantic training datasets contain personal private information. Such concerns call for enormous requirements for specified data erasure from semantic codecs when previous users hope to move their data from the semantic system. Existing machine unlearning solutions remove data contribution from trained models, yet usually in supervised sole model scenarios. These methods are infeasible in semantic communications that often need to jointly train unsupervised encoders and decoders. In this paper, we investigate the unlearning problem in DL-enabled semantic communications and propose a semantic communication unlearning (SCU) scheme to tackle the problem. SCU includes two key components. Firstly, we customize the joint unlearning method for semantic codecs, including the encoder and decoder, by minimizing mutual information between the learned semantic representation and the erased samples. Secondly, to compensate for semantic model utility degradation caused by unlearning, we propose a contrastive compensation method, which considers the erased data as the negative samples and the remaining data as the positive samples to retrain the unlearned semantic models contrastively. Theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results on three representative datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {Existing research has demonstrated that deep neural networks are susceptible to model extraction attacks, where an attacker can construct a substitute model with similar functionality to the victim model by querying the black-box victim model. To counter such attacks, various disruption-based defenses have been proposed. These defenses disrupt the output results of queries before returning them to potential attackers. In this paper, we propose the first defense-penetrating model extraction attack framework, aimed at breaking disruption-based defense methods. Our proposed attack framework comprises two key modules: disruption detection and disruption recovery, which can be integrated into generic model extraction attacks. Specifically, the disruption detection module uses a novel meta-learning-based algorithm to infer the defense strategy employed by the defender, by learning the key differences between the distributions of disrupted and undisrupted query results. Once the defense method is inferred, the disruption recovery module is designed to restore clean query results from the disrupted query results, using a carefully-designed generative model. We conducted extensive experiments on 5 commonly-used datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

  abstract     = {The security in networked systems depends greatly on recognizing and identifying adversarial behaviors. Traditional detection methods target specific categories of attacks and have become inadequate against increasingly stealthy and deceptive attacks that are designed to bypass detection strategically. This work proposes game-theoretical frameworks to recognize and combat such evasive attacks. We focus on extending a fundamental class of statistical-based detection methods based on Neyman-Pearson’s (NP) hypothesis testing formulation. We capture the conflicting relationship between a strategic evasive attacker and an evasion-aware NP detector. By analyzing both the equilibrium behaviors of the attacker and the NP detector, we characterize their performance using Equilibrium Receiver-Operational-Characteristic (EROC) curves. We show that the evasion-aware NP detectors outperform the non-strategic ones by allowing them to take advantage of the attacker’s messages to adaptively modify their decision rules to enhance their success rate in detecting anomalies. In addition, we extend our framework to a sequential setting where the user sends out identically distributed messages. We corroborate the analytical results with a case study of an intrusion detection evasion problem.},

  abstract     = {Due to the successful development of deep image generation technology, visual data forgery detection would play a more important role in social and economic security. Existing forgery detection methods suffer from unsatisfactory generalization ability to determine the authenticity in the unseen domain. In this paper, we propose a novel Attention Consistency Refined masked frequency forgery representation model toward a generalizing face forgery detection algorithm (ACMF). Most forgery technologies always bring in high-frequency aware cues, which make it easy to distinguish source authenticity but difficult to generalize to unseen artifact types. The masked frequency forgery representation module is designed to explore robust forgery cues by randomly discarding high-frequency information. In addition, we find that the forgery saliency map inconsistency through the detection network could affect the generalizability. Thus, the forgery attention consistency is introduced to force detectors to focus on similar attention regions for better generalization ability. Experiment results on several public face forgery datasets (FaceForensic++, DFD, Celeb-DF, WDF and DFDC datasets) demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

However, existing adversarial detection techniques are deficient in localizing video adversarial frames, leading to poor performance on sparse video adversarial attacks. This paper presents an approach for detecting adversarial perturbations in videos based on fusion features derived from the video compression and RGB domain. Our research begins by examining how the introduction of extensive non-natural noise during video adversarial attacks severely disrupts the spatial structure of individual frames and the motion information between frames. This disruption culminates in unnatural variations in the Coding Tree Units (CTU) partitioning during the HEVC video encoding process. Then meticulously mapping the positions and partitioning information of coding units (CU), predictive units (PU), and transformation units (TU) onto specific values and sizes, constituting the video’s Compression Domain Units (CDU) features. Finally, a dual-path network utilizing both the video’s CDU features and the decoded frames RGB features is employed for detecting video adversarial samples. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the performance. The results show that the proposed scheme outperforms or rivals the state-of-the-art methods in video adversarial detection.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful collaborative learning approach that enables client devices to train a joint machine learning model without sharing private data. However, the decentralized nature of FL makes it highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks from multiple sources. There are diverse FL data poisoning and model poisoning attack methods in the literature. Nevertheless, most of them focus only on the attack’s impact and do not consider the attack budget and attack visibility. These factors are essential to effectively comprehend the adversary’s rationale in designing an attack. Hence, our work highlights the significance of considering these factors by providing an attacker perspective in designing an attack with a low budget, low visibility, and high impact. Also, existing attacks that use total neuron replacement and randomly selected neuron replacement approaches only cater to these factors partially. Therefore, we propose a novel federated learning minimal model replacement attack (FL-MMR) that uses optimal transport (OT) for minimal neural alignment between a surrogate poisoned model and the benign model. Later, we optimize the attack budget in a three-fold adaptive fashion by considering critical learning periods and introducing the replacement map. In addition, we comprehensively evaluate our attack under three threat scenarios using three large-scale datasets: GTSRB, CIFAR10, and EMNIST. We observed that our FL-MMR attack drops global accuracy to $\approx 35\%$ less with merely 0.54% total attack budget and lower attack visibility than other attacks. The results confirm that our method aligns closely with the attacker’s viewpoint compared to other methods.},

This framework uses local model accuracy and privacy loss as the constraints to satisfy the user’s personalized requirements. By designing a multi-agent RL, this framework optimizes perturbation policy including perturbation mechanisms and parameters (such as privacy budget and probabilistic relaxation). The goal of each participant is to improve global accuracy and reduce privacy loss, attack success rate, and short-term risk value. Firstly, the framework designs a two-level hierarchical policy selection module to choose the perturbation policy to accelerate learning speed. Secondly, our proposed framework designs a punishment function to evaluate short-term risk and an R-network to estimate long-term risk, which guarantees safe exploration. Thirdly, this framework formulates an improved Boltzmann policy distribution to increase the impact of risk, thus avoiding risky policies that may cause severe privacy leakage or local task failure. We also analyze the convergence performance and provide privacy analysis for both Gaussian and Laplace mechanisms.

  abstract     = {A Bitcoin miner who owns a sufficient amount of mining power can perform selfish mining to increase its relative revenue. Studies have demonstrated that the time-averaged profit of a selfish miner starts to rise once the mining difficulty level gets adjusted in favor of the attacker. Selfish mining profitability lies in the fact that orphan blocks are not incorporated into the current version of Bitcoin’s difficulty adjustment mechanism (DAM). Therefore, it is believed that considering the count of orphan blocks in the DAM can result in complete unprofitability for selfish mining. In this paper, we disprove this belief by providing a formal analysis of the selfish mining time-averaged profit. We present a precise definition of the orphan blocks that can be incorporated into calculating the next epoch’s target and then introduce two modified versions of DAM in which both main-chain blocks and orphan blocks are incorporated. We propose two versions of smart intermittent selfish mining, where the first one dominates the normal intermittent selfish mining, and the second one results in selfish mining profitability under the modified DAMs. Moreover, we present the orphan exclusion attack with the help of which the attacker can stop honest miners from reporting the orphan blocks. Using combinatorial tools, we analyze the profitability of selfish mining accompanied by the orphan exclusion attack under the modified DAMs. Our results show that even when considering orphan blocks in the DAM, selfish mining can still be profitable. However, the level of profitability under the modified DAMs is significantly lower than that observed under the current version of Bitcoin DAM, suggesting that orphan reporting can be an effective countermeasure against a payoff-maximizing selfish miner.},

For the requirements of physical attack, we further constrain the patch in object region and utilize elaborate criteria to evaluate its naturalness to alleviate the distortion when applying the patch in real world.

  abstract     = {Cooperative palmprint recognition, pivotal for civilian and commercial uses, stands as the most essential and broadly demanded branch in biometrics. These applications, often tied to financial transactions, require high accuracy in recognition. Currently, research in palmprint recognition primarily aims to enhance accuracy, with relatively few studies addressing the automatic and flexible palm region of interest (ROI) extraction (PROIE) suitable for complex scenes. Particularly, the intricate conditions of open environment, alongside the constraint of human finger skeletal extension limiting the visibility of Finger Valley Points (FVPs), render conventional FVPs-based PROIE methods ineffective. In response to this challenge, we propose an FVPs-Free Adaptive ROI Detection (FFARD) approach, which utilizes cross-dataset hand shape semantic transfer (CHSST) combined with the constrained palm inscribed circle search, delivering exceptional hand segmentation and precise PROIE. Furthermore, a Recurrent Layer Aggregation-based Neural Network (RLANN) is proposed to learn discriminative feature representation for high recognition accuracy in both open-set and closed-set modes. The Angular Center Proximity Loss (ACPLoss) is designed to enhance intra-class compactness and inter-class discrepancy between learned palmprint features. Overall, the combined FFARD and RLANN methods are proposed to address the challenges of palmprint recognition in open environment, collectively referred to as RDRLA. Experimental results on four palmprint benchmarks HIT-NIST-V1, IITD, MPD and BJTU_PalmV2 show the superiority of the proposed method RDRLA over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) competitors.

  abstract     = {In contrast to prevalent Federated Learning (FL) privacy inference techniques such as generative adversarial networks attacks, membership inference attacks, property inference attacks, and model inversion attacks, we devise an innovative privacy threat: the Data Distribution Decompose Attack on FL, termed Decaf . This attack enables an honest-but-curious FL server to meticulously profile the proportion of each class owned by the victim FL user, divulging sensitive information like local market item distribution and business competitiveness. The crux of Decaf lies in the profound observation that the magnitude of local model gradient changes closely mirrors the underlying data distribution, including the proportion of each class. Decaf addresses two crucial challenges: accurately identify the missing/null class(es) given by any victim user as a premise and then quantify the precise relationship between gradient changes and each remaining non-null class. Notably, Decaf operates stealthily, rendering it entirely passive and undetectable to victim users regarding the infringement of their data distribution privacy. Experimental validation on five benchmark datasets (MNIST, FASHION-MNIST, CIFAR-10, FER-2013, and SkinCancer) employing diverse model architectures, including customized convolutional networks, standardized VGG16, and ResNet18, demonstrates Decaf ’s efficacy. Results indicate its ability to accurately decompose local user data distribution, regardless of whether it is IID or non-IID distributed. Specifically, the dissimilarity measured using $L_{\infty }$ distance between the distribution decomposed by Decaf and ground truth is consistently below 5% when no null classes exist. Moreover, Decaf achieves 100% accuracy in determining any victim user’s null classes, validated through formal proof.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, blockchain anonymity has led to more illicit accounts participating in various money laundering transactions. Existing studies typically detect money laundering transactions, known as AML (Anti-money Laundering), through learning transaction features on transaction graphs of transactional blockchains. However, transaction graphs fail to represent the accounts’ social features within transactional organizations. Account graphs reveal such features well, and detecting illicit accounts on account graphs provides a new perspective on AML. For example, it helps uncover illegal transactions whose transaction features are not distinct in transaction graphs, with a loose assumption that illicit accounts are likely involved in illegal transactions. In this paper, we propose a Social Attention Graph Neural Network ( $\textsf {SGNN}$ ) on account graphs converted from transaction graphs. To detect illicit accounts, $\textsf {SGNN}$ learns the social features on two sub-graphs, a heterogeneous graph and a hypergraph, extracted from the account graph, and fuses these features into account attribute vectors through attention. The experimental results on the Elliptic++ dataset demonstrate $\textsf {SGNN}$ ’s advances. It outperforms the best baseline by 14.18% in precision, 7.37% in F1 score, 0.96% in accuracy, and 0.64% in recall when detecting illicit accounts on account graphs, as well as detects 20.3% more recall of illegal transactions through these illicit accounts than state-of-the-art methods based on transaction graphs when the mappings between illegal transactions and illicit accounts are provided. Moreover, thanks to social features, $\textsf {SGNN}$ has a novel capability that works under many account scales and activity degrees. We release our code on https://github.com/CloudLab-NEU/SGNN .},

In CPS, controllers or control centers typically send continuous commands to actuators. Due to the limited computational and storage resources of CPS devices, existing Message Authentication Code and digital signature algorithms face challenges in terms of being non-interactive, lightweight, and continuous on the actuator side. To address this issue, we propose a lightweight continuous message authentication (LCMA) scheme that ensures the continuity of signatures through a mechanism involving random numbers and incrementing sub-private keys. The multidimensional Bloom filters is designed and used togather with precomputed verification points generated by Key Generation Center to enable non-interactive verification. Additionally, we design a redundancy-free hash tree for CPS to reduce information redundancy. The proposed solution requires only hash operations and Bloom filter queries for verification, achieving sufficient lightweight performance. Finally, we provide a formal security proof for the proposed scheme and simulate it on the ESP32 platform. The results show that the implementation times for signature generation and verification are 0.779 milliseconds and 0.792 milliseconds, respectively. Compared to other non-interactive lightweight message authentication schemes, the proposed LCMA is more suitable for CPS devices.},

  abstract     = {As a widely adopted protocol for anomaly detection in attributed networks, reconstruction error prioritizes comprehensive feature extraction to detect anomalies over interrogating the differential representation between normal and abnormal nodes. Intuitively, in attributed networks, normal nodes and their neighbors often exhibit similarities, whereas abnormal nodes demonstrate behaviors distinct from their neighbors. Hence, normal nodes can be accurately represented through their neighbors and effectively reconstructed. As opposed to normal nodes, abnormal nodes represented by their neighbors may be erroneously reconstructed as normal, resulting in increased reconstruction error. Leveraging from this observation, we propose a novel anomaly detection protocol called Neighbor-aware Mask-Filling Anomaly Detection (NMFAD) for attributed networks, aiming to maximize the variability between original and reconstructed features of abnormal nodes filled with information from their neighbors. Specifically, we utilize random-mask on nodes and integrate them into the backbone Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to map nodes into a latent space. Subsequently, we fill the masked nodes with embeddings from their neighbors and smooth the abnormal nodes closer to the distribution of normal nodes. This optimization improves the likelihood of the decoder to reconstructing abnormal nodes as normal, thereby maximizing the reconstruction error of abnormal nodes. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the existing models, NMFAD exhibits superior performance.in attributed networks.},

  abstract     = {Adversarial training (AT) is widely considered the state-of-the-art technique for improving the robustness of deep neural networks (DNNs) against adversarial examples (AEs). Nevertheless, recent studies have revealed that adversarially trained models are prone to unfairness problems. Recent works in this field usually apply class-wise regularization methods to enhance the fairness of AT. However, this paper discovers that these paradigms can be sub-optimal in improving robust fairness. Specifically, we empirically observe that the AEs that are already robust (referred to as “easy AEs” in this paper) are useless and even harmful in improving robust fairness. To this end, we propose the hard adversarial example mining (HAM) technique which concentrates on mining hard AEs while discarding the easy AEs in AT. Specifically, HAM identifies the easy AEs and hard AEs with a fast adversarial attack method. By discarding the easy AEs and reweighting the hard AEs, the robust fairness of the model can be efficiently and effectively improved. Extensive experimental results on four image classification datasets demonstrate the improvement of HAM in robust fairness and training efficiency compared to several state-of-the-art fair adversarial training methods.

  abstract     = {Byzantine agreement is the most fundamental primitive in distributed computing. All known Byzantine agreement protocols achieve quadratic or sub-quadratic messages and communication. We show that surprisingly, by directly assuming a random leader election oracle (that can be built from the verifiable random function), threshold signatures, and the $1/3$ corruption bound, we can build Linear-BA, a binary agreement (BA) that has linear message complexity, constant expected time complexity, and a normal case that has linear communication. We extend Linear-BA to construct Linear-MBA, a multi-valued Byzantine agreement (MBA) protocol also with $O(n)$ messages and $O(1)$ expected time. Finally, we present Linear-MBA-SV, an MBA protocol with the strong validity property via a no-cost transformation from Linear-MBA. All the protocols above are secure under a static adversary, where a static adversary corrupts a set of replicas at the beginning of the protocol. We go on and show an impossibility result that in the adaptive adversary model (in which the adversary can selectively corrupt the replicas while the protocol is running), one cannot build a Byzantine agreement protocol with $O(n)$ messages and $O(1)$ expected time. Accordingly, we revise our protocol to obtain Byzantine agreement protocols with $O(n)$ messages per round and $O(n)$ time. Our results offer a fresh view of what is needed for linear Byzantine agreement: by examining the “needed” assumptions, one can identify the performance bottlenecks for Byzantine agreement. Meanwhile, all our protocols are efficient, as all the building blocks have efficient instantiations.},

  abstract     = {To achieve fine-grained access control and address the data silos challenge in data sharing, the integration of blockchain with attribute-based encryption emerges as a promising solution. Nowadays, the growing interconnectedness among diverse blockchain applications has spurred the need for efficient cross-chain data sharing. However, existing single-authority attribute-based data sharing schemes are not suitable for such cross-chain scenarios involving multiple attribute authorities. Moreover, the frequent requirement for data owners to process cross-chain data requests significantly hampers practicality. In this context, we introduce a novel multi-authority attribute-based proxy re-encryption scheme that enables ciphertext policy updating and supports secure and efficient cross-chain data sharing. By introducing a proxy, the data owner is empowered to delegate access without leaking any valid information and flexibly sells data across blockchains through cross-chain access policies. Besides, our scheme leverages the relay chain to foster a decentralized and trustworthy ecosystem. The adoption of smart contracts automates the cross-chain data sharing process and ensures equitable distribution of benefits among participants. Additionally, our scheme integrates hybrid encryption with the decentralized data hosting platform, substantially mitigating the on-chain storage burden. Security analysis affirms that our scheme is semantically secure and resistant to collusion attack. Performance analysis and simulation experiments demonstrate the excellent efficiency and practicality of our scheme when conducting cross-chain data sharing.},

In practice, numerous applications and scenarios, especially in the era of blockchains, contain various sources of non-determinism. Meanwhile, it is even sometimes desirable to support non-determinism, and replicas still agree on the execution results. Despite decades of research on BFT, we still lack an efficient and easy-to-deploy solution for BFT with non-determinism—BFT-ND, especially in the asynchronous setting. We revisit the problem of BFT-ND and provide a formal and asynchronous treatment of BFT-ND. In particular, we design and implement Block-ND that insightfully separates the task of agreeing on the order of transactions from the task of agreement on the state: Block-ND allows reusing existing BFT implementations; on top of BFT, we reduce the agreement on the state to multivalued Byzantine agreement (MBA), a somewhat neglected primitive by practical systems. Block-ND is completely asynchronous as long as the underlying BFT is asynchronous. We provide a new MBA construction that is significantly faster than existing MBA constructions. We instantiate Block-ND in both the partially synchronous setting (with PBFT, OSDI 1999) and the purely asynchronous setting (with PACE, CCS 2022). Via a 91-instance WAN deployment on Amazon EC2, we show that Block-ND has only marginal performance degradation compared to conventional BFT.},

  abstract     = {Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC)-oriented Deep Neural Networks (ADNNs) have received much attention in recent years for their wide range of applications. However, they are vulnerable to attacks. Adversarial Examples (AEs) of modulation signals with added weak perturbations can easily fool ADNNs. The study of AEs on AMC, on one side, can enhance the security of wireless communication systems; on the other side, it can provide an effective defence against potential attacks. Nevertheless, most existing attack methods generate AEs with low transferability. In this paper, we propose a Multiscale Discriminative Attack Method (MDAM) for modulated signals. The method strives to alleviate such transferability issue by destroying discriminative features in multi-layer. Specifically, we utilize interpretable class activation maps to distinguish the discriminative regions, ignoring the noise and focusing on the interference of the discriminative features. Beyond that, we propose a multi-layer activation disruption loss to constrain activations in the middle layers. In so doing, the AEs do not erroneously retain deep features of the original signal. We conduct extensive experiments on RadioML datasets and the local area network (LAN) communication dataset we collected to evaluate the effectiveness of MDAM in both white-box and black-box attack scenarios. The results show that MDAM outperforms existing methods.},

Federated learning (FL) has been implemented in an anomaly-based intrusion detection system (NIDS) to detect malicious traffic in IoT devices and counter the threat. However, current FL-based NIDS mainly focuses on global model performance and lacks personalized performance improvement for local data. To address this issue, we propose a novel personalized federated meta-learning intrusion detection approach (PerFLID), which allows multiple participants to personalize their local detection models for local adaptation. PerFLID shifts the goal of the personalized detection task to training a local model suitable for the client’s specific data, rather than a global model. To meet the real-time requirements of NIDS, PerFLID further refines the client selection strategy by clustering the local gradient similarities to find the nodes that contribute the most to the global model per global round. PerFLID can select the nodes that accelerate the convergence of the model, and we theoretically analyze the improvement in the convergence speed of this strategy over the personalized federated learning algorithm. We experimentally evaluate six existing FL-NIDS approaches on three real network traffic datasets and show that our PerFLID approach outperforms all baselines in detecting local adaptation accuracy by 10.11% over the state-of-the-art scheme, accelerating the convergence speed under various parameter combinations.},

Building on our previous research, which demonstrated that micro-signals in CSI, termed micro-CSI, most likely originate from RF circuitry imperfections and can serve as unique RF fingerprints, we develop a new approach to overcome the limitations of our prior signal space-based method. While the signal space-based method is effective in strong line-of-sight (LoS) conditions, we show that it struggles with the complexities of non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios, compromising the robustness of CSI-based RFF. To address this challenge, DeepCRF incorporates a carefully trained convolutional neural network (CNN) with model-inspired data augmentation, supervised contrastive learning, and decision fusion techniques, enhancing its generalization capabilities across unseen channel conditions and resilience against noise. Our evaluations demonstrate that DeepCRF significantly improves device identification accuracy across diverse channels, outperforming both the signal space-based baseline and state-of-the-art neural network-based benchmarks. Notably, it achieves an average identification accuracy of 99.53% among 19 COTS WiFi network interface cards in real-world unseen scenarios using 4 CSI measurements per identification procedure.},

However, partial fingerprints have few matchable features, especially when there are differences in finger pressing posture or image quality, which makes partial fingerprint verification challenging. Most existing methods regard fingerprint position rectification and identity verification as independent tasks, ignoring the coupling relationship between them—relative pose estimation typically relies on paired features as anchors, and authentication accuracy tends to improve with more precise pose alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for joint identity verification and pose alignment of partial fingerprint pairs, aiming to leverage their inherent correlation to improve each other. To achieve this, we present a multi-task CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)-Transformer hybrid network, and design a pre-training task to enhance the feature extraction capability.

  abstract     = {Automatic X-ray prohibited item detection is vital for public safety. Existing deep learning-based methods all assume that the annotations of training X-ray images are correct. However, obtaining correct annotations is extremely hard if not impossible for large-scale X-ray images, where item overlapping is ubiquitous. As a result, X-ray images are easily contaminated with noisy annotations, leading to performance deterioration of existing methods. In this paper, we address the challenging problem of training a robust prohibited item detector under noisy annotations (including both category noise and bounding box noise) from a novel perspective of data augmentation, and propose an effective label-aware mixed patch paste augmentation method (Mix-Paste). Specifically, for each item patch, we mix several item patches with the same category label from different images and replace the original patch in the image with the mixed patch. In this way, the probability of containing the correct prohibited item within the generated image is increased. Meanwhile, the mixing process mimics item overlapping, enabling the model to learn the characteristics of X-ray images. Moreover, we design an item-based large-loss suppression (LLS) strategy to suppress the large losses corresponding to potentially positive predictions of additional items due to the mixing operation. We show the superiority of our method on X-ray datasets under noisy annotations. In addition, we evaluate our method on the noisy MS-COCO dataset to showcase its generalization ability. These results clearly indicate the great potential of data augmentation to handle noise annotations. The source code is released at https://github.com/wscds/Mix-Paste .},

Nevertheless, the introduction of DP incurs significant computational overhead. One promising approach to this challenge is to integrate Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with DP, leveraging the memory-efficient characteristics of PEFT to reduce the substantial memory consumption of DP. Given that fine-tuning aims to quickly adapt pretrained models to downstream tasks, it is crucial to balance privacy protection with model utility to avoid excessive performance compromise. In this paper, we propose a Relevance-based Adaptive Private Fine-Tuning (Rap-FT) framework, the first approach designed to mitigate model utility loss caused by DP perturbations in the PEFT context, and to achieve a balance between differential privacy and model utility. Specifically, we introduce an enhanced layer-wise relevance propagation process to analyze the relevance of trainable parameters, which can be adapted to the three major categories of PEFT methods. Based on the relevance map generated, we partition the parameter space dimensionally, and develop an adaptive gradient perturbation strategy that adjusts the noise addition to mitigate the adverse impacts of perturbations. Extensive experimental evaluations are conducted to demonstrate that our Rap-FT framework can improve the utility of the fine-tuned model compared to the baseline differentially private fine-tuning methods, while maintaining a comparable level of privacy protection.},

  abstract     = {Enlarging input images is a straightforward and effective approach to promote small object detection. However, simple image enlargement is significantly expensive on both computations and GPU memory. In fact, small objects are usually sparsely distributed and locally clustered. Therefore, massive feature extraction computations are wasted on the non-target background area of images. Recent works have tried to pick out target-containing regions using an extra network and perform conventional object detection, but the newly introduced computation limits their final performance. In this paper, we propose to reuse the detector’s backbone to conduct feature-level object-seeking and patch-slicing, which can avoid redundant feature extraction and reduce the computation cost. Incorporating with a sparse detection head, we are able to detect small objects on high-resolution inputs (e.g., 1080P or larger) for superior performance. The resulting Efficient Small Object Detection (ESOD) approach is a generic framework, which can be applied to both CNN- and ViT-based detectors to save the computation and GPU memory costs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our method. In particular, our method consistently surpasses the SOTA detectors by a large margin (e.g., 8% gains on AP) on the representative VisDrone, UAVDT, and TinyPerson datasets.

In this paper, we present a lightweight multi-layer shared Hyper-Adaptive network (HAda), aiming to simultaneously generate adaptive weights for different views and convolutional layers of deep multi-view ConvNets. The adaptability inherent in HAda not only contributes to a substantial reduction in parameter redundancy but also enables the modeling of intricate view-aware and layer-wise information. This capability ensures the maintenance of high performance, ultimately achieving parameter-efficient learning. Specifically, we design a multi-view shared module in HAda to capture information common across views. This module incorporates a shared global gated interpolation strategy, which generates layer-wise gating factors. These factors facilitate adaptive interpolation of global contextual information into the weights. Meanwhile, we put forward a tailored weight-calibrated adapter for each view that facilitates the conveyance of view-specific information. These adapters generate view-adaptive weight scaling calibrators, allowing the selective emphasis of personalized information for each view without introducing excessive parameters. Extensive experiments on six publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In particular, HAda can serve as a flexible plug-in strategy to work well with existing multi-view methods for both image classification and image clustering tasks.},

  abstract     = {In the domain of 3D Human Pose Estimation, which finds widespread daily applications, the requirement for convenient acquisition equipment continues to grow. To satisfy this demand, we focus on a short-baseline binocular setup that offers both portability and a geometric measurement capability that significantly reduces depth ambiguity. However, as the binocular baseline shortens, two serious challenges emerge: first, the robustness of 3D reconstruction against 2D errors deteriorates; second, occlusion reoccurs frequently due to the limited visual differences between two views. To address the first challenge, we propose the Stereo Co-Keypoints Estimation module to improve the view consistency of 2D keypoints and enhance the 3D robustness. In this module, the disparity is utilized to represent the correspondence of binocular 2D points, and the Stereo Volume Feature (SVF) is introduced to contain binocular features across different disparities. Through the regression of SVF, two-view 2D keypoints are simultaneously estimated in a collaborative way which restricts their view consistency. Furthermore, to deal with occlusions, a Pre-trained Pose Transformer module is introduced. Through this module, 3D poses are refined by perceiving pose coherence, a representation of joint correlations. This perception is injected by the Pose Transformer network and learned through a pre-training task that recovers iterative masked joints. Comprehensive experiments on H36M and MHAD datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach in the short-baseline binocular 3D Human Pose Estimation and occlusion handling.},

  abstract     = {Static meshes with texture maps have attracted considerable attention in both industrial manufacturing and academic research, leading to an urgent requirement for effective and robust objective quality evaluation. However, current model-based static mesh quality metrics (i.e., metrics that directly use the raw data of the static mesh to extract features and predict the quality) have obvious limitations: most of them only consider geometry information, while color information is ignored, and they have strict constraints for the meshes’ geometrical topology. Other metrics, such as image-based and point-based metrics, are easily influenced by the prepossessing algorithms, e.g., projection and sampling, hampering their ability to perform at their best. In this paper, we propose Geodesic Patch Similarity (GeodesicPSIM), a novel model-based metric to accurately predict human perception quality for static meshes. After selecting a group keypoints, 1-hop geodesic patches are constructed based on both the reference and distorted meshes cleaned by an effective mesh cleaning algorithm. A two-step patch cropping algorithm and a patch texture mapping module refine the size of 1-hop geodesic patches and build the relationship between the mesh geometry and color information, resulting in the generation of 1-hop textured geodesic patches. Three types of features are extracted to quantify the distortion: patch color smoothness, patch discrete mean curvature, and patch pixel color average and variance. To the best of our knowledge, GeodesicPSIM is the first model-based metric especially designed for static meshes with texture maps. GeodesicPSIM provides state-of-the-art performance in comparison with image-based, point-based, and video-based metrics on a newly created and challenging database. We also prove the robustness of GeodesicPSIM by introducing different settings of hyperparameters. Ablation studies also exhibit the effectiveness of three proposed features and the patch cropping algorithm. The code is available at https://multimedia.tencent.com/resources/GeodesicPSIM .},

  abstract     = {Pyramid Temporal Hierarchy Network (PTH-Net) is a new paradigm for dynamic facial expression recognition, applied directly to raw videos, without face detection and alignment. Unlike the traditional paradigm, which focus only on facial areas and often overlooks valuable information like body movements, PTH-Net preserves more critical information. It does this by distinguishing between backgrounds and human bodies at the feature level, offering greater flexibility as an end-to-end network. Specifically, PTH-Net utilizes a pre-trained backbone to extract multiple general features of video understanding at various temporal frequencies, forming a temporal feature pyramid. It then further expands this temporal hierarchy through differentiated parameter sharing and downsampling, ultimately refining emotional information under the supervision of expression temporal-frequency invariance. Additionally, PTH-Net features an efficient Scalable Semantic Distinction layer that enhances feature discrimination, helping to better identify target expressions versus non-target ones in the video. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that PTH-Net performs excellently in eight challenging benchmarks, with lower computational costs compared to previous methods.

  abstract     = {Image compression distortion can cause performance degradation of machine analysis tasks, therefore recent years have witnessed fast progress in developing deep image compression methods optimized for machine perception. However, the investigation still lacks for saliency segmentation. First, in this paper we propose a deep compression network increasing local signal fidelity of important image pixels for saliency segmentation, which is different from existing methods utilizing the analysis network loss for backward propagation. By this means, these two types of networks can be decoupled to improve the compatibility of proposed compression method for diverse saliency segmentation networks. Second, pixel-level bit weights are modeled with probability distribution in the proposed bit allocation method. The ascending cosine roll-down (ACRD) function allocates bits to those important pixels, which fits the essence that saliency segmentation can be regarded as the pixel-level bi-classification task. Third, the compression network is trained without the help of saliency segmentation, where latent representations are decomposed into base and enhancement channels. Base channels are retained in the whole image, while enhancement channels are utilized only for important pixels, and therefore more bits can benefit saliency segmentation via enhancement channels. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can save an average of 10.34% bitrate compared with the state-of-the-art deep image compression method, where the rate-accuracy (R-A) performances are evaluated on sixteen downstream saliency segmentation networks with five conventional SOD datasets.

We discuss the optimal symplectic matrices selection strategy of the proposed adaptive CMCD through the minimum MSE minimization modeling and solving.

Another spotlight of this paper is to relax the identical-weight constraint in prior studies to study mixed-weight CACs for the first time, for the purpose of increasing the throughput and reducing the access delay of some potential users with higher priority.

Its weighted energy efficiency (WEE) is the ratio of its weighted sum-rate over its sum-power plus a fixed positive overhead. The problem Max-WEE seeks a power assignment maximizing the WEE. Special variants of Max-WEE with unit weights or two users per channel have been extensively studied in the literature. But none of the existing algorithms for those special variants have known bounds on running time, mainly because they follow the general-purposed methods for fractional programming. In this paper, we first derive fundamental properties and closed-form expressions of maximum WEE. Then we devise a simple water-filling algorithm for Max-WEE. Assuming all users are presorted by weight, the water-filling algorithm has linear complexity in the number of channel-user pairs.

We first approximate the problem to a dual bin-packing problem. Secondly, efficient scheduling policies are identified when the age constraints possess special mathematical properties, where the number of channels at most required is analyzed. Optimality conditions of the proposed policies are presented. For general constraints, a two-step grouping algorithm for multi-view (TGAM) is proposed to establish scheduling policies. Under TGAM, the constraints are mapped into a combination of the special constraints. To quickly identify an optimized mapping from a vast solution space, TGAM heuristically groups the regions according to their constraints and then searches for the optimal mapping for each group. Numerical results demonstrate that, compared to a derived lower bound, the proposed TGAM requires only 1.07% more channels. Additionally, the number of regions that can be served by TGAM is significantly larger than the state-of-the art algorithm, given the number of channels.},

In this paper, we consider the general systems where the data placement and output function assignment are arbitrary but pre-set. We propose two coded computing schemes, One-shot Coded Transmission (OSCT) and Few-shot Coded Transmission (FSCT), to reduce the communication load. Both schemes first group the nodes into clusters and divide the transmission of each cluster into multiple rounds, and then design coded transmission in each round to maximize the multicast gain. The key difference between OSCT and FSCT is that the former uses a one-shot transmission where each encoded message can be decoded independently by the intended nodes, while the latter allows each node to jointly decode multiple received symbols to achieve potentially larger multicast gains. Furthermore, based on the lower bound proposed by Yu et al., we derive sufficient conditions for the optimality of OSCT and FSCT, respectively. This not only recovers the existing optimality results but also includes some cases where our schemes are optimal while others are not.},

The proposed binary encoding avoids operations over the real and complex numbers which inherently introduce numerical and rounding errors, thereby enabling accurate distributed encodings of the partial gradients. We then make connections between gradient coding and coded matrix multiplication. Specifically, we show that any gradient coding scheme can be extended to coded matrix multiplication.

  abstract     = {Noiseless private side information does not reduce the download cost in Symmetric Private Information Retrieval (SPIR) unless the client knows all but one file. While this is a pessimistic result, we explore in this paper whether noisy client side information available at the client helps decrease the download cost in the context of SPIR with colluding and replicated servers. Specifically, we assume that the client possesses noisy side information about each stored file, which is obtained by passing each file through one of D possible discrete memoryless test channels. The statistics of the test channels are known by the client and by all the servers, but the mapping $\boldsymbol {\mathcal {M}}$ between the files and the test channels is unknown to the servers. We study this problem under two privacy metrics. Under the first metric, the client wants to preserve the privacy of its file selection and the mapping $\boldsymbol {\mathcal {M}}$ , and the servers want to preserve the privacy of all the non-selected files. Under the second metric, the client is willing to reveal the index of the test channel that is associated with its desired file. For both privacy metrics, we derive the optimal common randomness and download cost. Our setup generalizes SPIR with colluding servers and SPIR with private noiseless side information. Unlike noiseless side information, our results demonstrate that noisy side information can reduce the download cost, even when the client does not have noiseless knowledge of all but one file.},

  abstract     = {We develop a general framework for clustering and distribution matching problems with bandit feedback. We consider a K-armed bandit model where some subset of K arms is partitioned into M groups. Within each group, the random variable associated to each arm follows the same distribution on a finite alphabet. At each time step, the decision maker pulls an arm and observes its outcome from the random variable associated to that arm. Subsequent arm pulls depend on the history of arm pulls and their outcomes. The decision maker has no knowledge of the distributions of the arms or the underlying partitions. The task is to devise an online algorithm to learn the underlying partition of arms with the least number of arm pulls on average and with an error probability not exceeding a pre-determined value $\delta $ . Several existing problems fall under our general framework, including finding M pairs of arms, odd arm identification, and N-ary clustering of K arms belong to our general framework. We derive a non-asymptotic lower bound on the average number of arm pulls for any online algorithm with an error probability not exceeding $\delta $ . Furthermore, we develop a computationally-efficient online algorithm based on the Track-and-Stop method and Frank-Wolfe algorithm, and show that the average number of arm pulls of our algorithm asymptotically matches that of the lower bound. Our refined analysis also uncovers a novel bound on the speed at which the average number of arm pulls of our algorithm converges to the fundamental limit as $\delta $ vanishes.},

The methods, each catering to a different parameter regime, are derived under the general Gaussian model by maximizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the two classes in the projected sample for a binary classification problem. They subsume existing linear projection approaches developed under simplifying assumptions of Gaussian distributions, such as these distributions might share an equal mean or covariance matrix. As a by-product, we establish that the multi-class linear discriminant analysis, a celebrated method for classification and supervised dimension reduction, is provably optimal for maximizing pairwise Kullback-Leibler divergence when the Gaussian populations share an identical covariance matrix. For the case when the Gaussian distributions share an equal mean, we establish conditions under which the optimal subspace remains invariant regardless of how the Kullback-Leibler divergence is defined, despite the asymmetry of the divergence measure itself. Such conditions encompass the classical case of signal plus noise, where both signal and noise have zero mean and arbitrary covariance matrices. Experiments are conducted to validate the proposed solutions, demonstrate their superior performance over existing alternatives, and illustrate the procedure for selecting the appropriate linear projection solution.},

  abstract     = {The advent of large-scale inference has spurred reexamination of conventional statistical thinking. In a series of highly original articles, Efron persuasively illustrated the danger for downstream inference in assuming the veracity of a posited null distribution. In a Gaussian model for n many z-scores with at most $k \lt \frac {n}{2}$ nonnulls, Efron suggests estimating the parameters of an empirical null $N(\theta , \sigma ^{2})$ instead of assuming the theoretical null $N(0, 1)$ . Looking to the robust statistics literature by viewing the nonnulls as outliers is unsatisfactory as the question of optimal rates is still open; even consistency is not known in the regime $k \asymp n$ which is especially relevant to many large-scale inference applications. However, provably rate-optimal robust estimators have been developed in other models (e.g. Huber contamination) which appear quite close to Efron’s proposal. Notably, the impossibility of consistency when $k \asymp n$ in these other models may suggest the same major weakness afflicts Efron’s popularly adopted recommendation. A sound evaluation thus requires a complete understanding of information-theoretic limits. We characterize the regime of k for which consistent estimation is possible, notably without imposing any assumptions at all on the nonnull effects. Unlike in other robust models, it is shown consistent estimation of the location parameter is possible if and only if $\frac {n}{2} {-} k = \omega (\sqrt {n})$ , and of the scale parameter in the entire regime $k \lt \frac {n}{2}$ . Furthermore, we establish sharp minimax rates and show estimators based on the empirical characteristic function are optimal by exploiting the Gaussian character of the data.},

In this work, we formulate domain generalization from a novel probabilistic perspective, ensuring robustness while avoiding overly conservative solutions. Through comprehensive information-theoretic analysis, we provide key insights into the roles of gradient and representation matching in promoting generalization. Our results reveal the complementary relationship between these two components, indicating that existing works focusing solely on either gradient or representation alignment are insufficient to solve the domain generalization problem. In light of these theoretical findings, we introduce IDM to simultaneously align the inter-domain gradients and representations. Integrated with the proposed PDM method for complex distribution matching, IDM achieves superior performance over various baseline methods.},

It can be used to benchmark the performance of statistical estimators, and provides a principled metric for system design and optimization. However, the Bayesian CRB depends on the underlying prior distribution, which is often unknown for many problems of interest. This work introduces a new data-driven estimator for the Bayesian CRB using score matching, i.e., a statistical estimation technique that models the gradient of a probability distribution from a given set of training data. The performance of the proposed estimator is analyzed in both the classical parametric modeling regime and the neural network modeling regime. In both settings, we develop novel non-asymptotic bounds on the score matching error and our Bayesian CRB estimator based on the results from empirical process theory, including classical bounds and recently introduced techniques for characterizing neural networks. We illustrate the performance of the proposed estimator with two application examples: a signal denoising problem and a dynamic phase offset estimation problem with applications in communication systems.},

This appears to contradict traditional statistical wisdom, in which a trade-off between model complexity and fit to the data is essential. We aim to address this discrepancy by adopting a convex optimization and sparse recovery perspective. We consider the training and generalization properties of two-layer ReLU networks with standard weight decay regularization. Under certain regularity assumptions on the data, we show that ReLU networks with an arbitrary number of parameters learn only simple models that explain the data. This is analogous to the recovery of the sparsest linear model in compressed sensing. For ReLU networks and their variants with skip connections or normalization layers, we present isometry conditions that ensure the exact recovery of planted neurons. For randomly generated data, we show the existence of a phase transition in recovering planted neural network models, which is easy to describe: whenever the ratio between the number of samples and the dimension exceeds a numerical threshold, the recovery succeeds with high probability; otherwise, it fails with high probability. Surprisingly, ReLU networks learn simple and sparse models that generalize well even when the labels are noisy. The phase transition phenomenon is confirmed through numerical experiments.},

Any single-copy probabilistic transformation between a pair of states implies that an asymptotic transformation at rate 1 is possible with an exponentially decreasing success probability. However, it is possible that an asymptotic transformation is feasible with nonzero probability, but there is no transformation between any finite number of copies with the same rate, even probabilistically. In such cases it is not known if the optimal success probability decreases exponentially or faster. A fundamental tool for showing the feasibility of an asymptotic transformation is degeneration. Any degeneration gives rise to a sequence of stochastic LOCC transformations from copies of the initial state plus a sublinear number of GHZ states to the same number of copies of the target state. These protocols involve parameters that can be freely chosen, but the choice affects the success probability. In this paper, we characterize an asymptotically optimal choice of the parameters and derive a single-letter expression for the error exponent of the resulting protocol. In particular, this implies an exponential lower bound on the success probability when the stochastic transformation arises from a degeneration.},

  abstract     = {A quantum generalized divergence by definition satisfies the data-processing inequality; as such, the relative decrease in such a divergence under the action of a quantum channel is at most one. This relative decrease is formally known as the contraction coefficient of the channel and the divergence. Interestingly, there exist combinations of channels and divergences for which the contraction coefficient is strictly less than one. Furthermore, understanding the contraction coefficient is fundamental for the study of statistical tasks under privacy constraints. To this end, here we establish upper bounds on contraction coefficients for the hockey-stick divergence under privacy constraints, where privacy is quantified with respect to the quantum local differential privacy (QLDP) framework, and we fully characterize the contraction coefficient for the trace distance under privacy constraints. Using the machinery developed, we also determine an upper bound on the contraction of both the Bures distance and quantum relative entropy relative to the normalized trace distance, under QLDP constraints. Next, we apply our findings to establish bounds on the sample complexity of quantum hypothesis testing under privacy constraints. Furthermore, we study various scenarios in which the sample complexity bounds are tight while providing order-optimal quantum channels that achieve those bounds. Lastly, we show how private quantum channels provide fairness and Holevo information stability in quantum learning settings.},

  abstract     = {A key problem in quantum information science is to determine optimal protocols for the interconversion of entangled states shared between remote parties. While for two parties a large number of results in this direction is available, the multipartite setting still remains a major challenge. In this article, this problem is addressed by extending the resource theory of entanglement for multipartite systems beyond the standard framework of local operations and classical communication. Specifically, we consider transformations capable of introducing a small, controllable increase of entanglement of a state, with the requirement that the increase can be made arbitrarily small. We demonstrate that in this adjusted framework, the transformation rates between multipartite states are fundamentally dictated by the bipartite entanglement entropies of the respective quantum states. Remarkably, this approach allows the reduction of tripartite entanglement to its bipartite analog, indicating that every pure tripartite state can be reversibly synthesized from a suitable number of singlets distributed between pairs of parties.},

  abstract     = {Quantum stabilizer codes often struggle with syndrome errors due to measurement imperfections. Typically, multiple rounds of syndrome extraction are employed to ensure reliable error information. In this paper, we consider phenomenological decoding problems, where data qubit errors may occur between extractions, and each measurement can be faulty. We introduce generalized quantum data-syndrome codes along with a generalized check matrix that integrates both quaternary and binary alphabets to represent diverse error sources. This results in a Tanner graph with mixed variable nodes, enabling the design of belief propagation (BP) decoding algorithms that effectively handle phenomenological errors. Importantly, our BP decoders are applicable to general sparse quantum codes. Through simulations, we achieve an error threshold of more than 3% for quantum memory protected by rotated toric codes, using solely BP without post-processing. Our results indicate that d rounds of syndrome extraction are sufficient for a toric code of distance d. We observe that at high error rates, fewer rounds of syndrome extraction tend to perform better, while more rounds improve performance at lower error rates. Additionally, we propose a method to construct effective redundant stabilizer checks for single-shot error correction. Our simulations show that BP decoding remains highly effective even with a high syndrome error rate.},

  abstract     = {Electromagnetic information theory (EIT) is an emerging interdisciplinary subject that integrates classical Maxwell electromagnetics and Shannon information theory. The goal of EIT is to uncover the information transmission mechanisms from an electromagnetic (EM) perspective in wireless systems. Existing works on EIT are mainly focused on the analysis of EM channel characteristics, degrees-of-freedom, and system capacity. However, these works do not clarify how to integrate EIT knowledge into the design and optimization of wireless systems. To fill in this gap, in this paper, we propose an EIT-based statistical channel model with simplified parameterization. Thanks to the simplified closed-form expression of the EMCF, it can be readily applied to various channel modeling and inference tasks. Specifically, by averaging the solutions of Maxwell’s equations over a tunable von Mises distribution, we obtain a spatio-temporal correlation function (STCF) model of the EM channel, which we name as the EMCF. Furthermore, by tuning the parameters of the EMCF, we propose an EIT-based covariance estimator (EIT-Cov) to accurately capture the channel covariance. Since classical MMSE estimators can exploit prior information contained in the channel covariance matrix, we further propose the EIT-MMSE channel estimator by substituting EMCF for the covariance matrix. Simulation results show that both the proposed EIT-Cov covariance estimator and the EIT-MMSE channel estimator outperform their baseline algorithms, thus proving that EIT is beneficial to wireless communication systems.},

Nevertheless, this assumption fails when messages arrive rapidly and reliability constraints require that the number of channel uses exceed the time between arrivals. In this paper, we consider a broadcast setting in which a transmitter wishes to send two different messages to two receivers over Gaussian channels. Messages have different arrival times and decoding deadlines such that their transmission windows overlap. For this setting, we propose a coding scheme that exploits Marton’s coding strategy. We derive rigorous bounds on the achievable rate regions. Those bounds can be easily employed in point-to-point settings with one or multiple parallel channels. In the point-to-point setting with one or multiple parallel channels, the proposed achievability scheme is consistent with the normal approximation. In the broadcast setting, our scheme agrees with Marton’s strategy for sufficiently large numbers of channel uses and shows significant performance improvements over standard approaches based on time sharing for transmission of short packets.},

Both the encoder and the decoder are aware of the input distribution, which is fixed. However, only the decoder is aware of the actual channel being used. The transform can be used to design a universal code for this scenario. The code is to have vanishing error probability when used over any channel in the set, and achieve the infimal information rate over the set. The setting considered is, in fact, more general: we consider a set of processes with memory. Universal polarization is established for the case where each process in the set: 1) has memory in the form of an underlying hidden Markov state sequence that is aperiodic and irreducible; and 2) satisfies a ‘forgetfulness’ property. Forgetfulness, which we believe to be of independent interest, occurs when two hidden Markov states become approximately independent of each other given a sufficiently long sequence of observations between them. We show that aperiodicity and irreducibility of the underlying Markov chain is not sufficient for forgetfulness, and develop a sufficient condition for a hidden Markov process to be forgetful.},

However, a certain number of the bits in this vector are ‘frozen’, meaning they are fixed at a predetermined value and cannot be altered by the encoder. The decoder, aware of the proportion of frozen bits but not their specific positions, is responsible for deciphering the intended message. We consider a more challenging version of this problem where the decoder does not know also the fraction of frozen bits.

  abstract     = {Bursts of errors are a class of errors that can be found in a variety of applications. A burst of t edits refers to a burst of t deletions, or a burst of t insertions, or a burst of t substitutions. This paper focuses on studying codes that can correct a burst of t edits. Our primary approach involves the use of the tool called weighted-summation VT sketch. The $(t,k)$ -weighted-summation VT sketch of a length-n sequence is defined as the weighted summation of the VT sketch of each row of its $t\times \lceil n/t \rceil $ array representation, with weights in the i-th row set as $k^{i-1}$ for $i=1,2,\ldots,t$ . By employing the weighted-summation VT sketch alongside multiple weight sketches, we introduce a construction for q-ary t-burst-substitution correcting codes with a redundancy of $\log n+O(1)$ , where the logarithm base is 2. Subsequently, we improve the redundancy to address specific types of burst-substitution errors, such as inversion errors, adjacent-block-transposition errors, and absorption errors. Moreover, by utilizing the method developed in the construction of burst-substitution correcting codes and imposing additional run-length-limited constraints, locally-bounded constraints, and strong-locally-balanced constraints, respectively, we introduce three constructions of t-burst-deletion correcting codes, each requiring a redundancy of $\log n+O(\log \log n)$ . Any t-burst-deletion-correcting code is also a t-burst-insertion correcting code, allowing us to intersect the t-burst-substitution-correcting codes and t-burst-deletion-correcting codes designed above to derive three constructions of q-ary t-burst-edit-correcting codes. The first two constructions have a redundancy of $\log n+(t\log q-1)\log \log n+O(1)$ , while the third construction has a redundancy of $\log n+\log \log n+O(1)$ . Most of the proposed codes demonstrate superior performance compared to previous results, with the exception of burst-deletion correcting codes. Furthermore, in cases of single-edit errors (t-burst-edit error with $t=1$ ), the redundancy of the first two constructions of quaternary single-edit correcting codes outperforms the results of Gabrys et al. (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 2023). We also provide efficient encoding and decoding algorithms for our codes to enhance their practical usability.},

  abstract     = {We consider regenerating codes in distributed storage systems where connections between the nodes are constrained by a graph. In this problem, the failed node downloads the information stored at a subset of vertices of the graph for the purpose of recovering the lost data. Compared to the standard setting, regenerating codes on graphs address two additional features. The repair information is moved across the network, and the cost of node repair is determined by the graphical distance from the helper nodes to the failed node. Accordingly, the helpers far away from the failed node may be expected to contribute less data for repair than the nodes in the neighborhood of that node. We analyze regenerating codes with nonuniform download for repair on graphs. Moreover, in the process of repair, the information moved from the helpers to the failed node may be combined through intermediate processing, reducing the repair bandwidth. We derive lower bounds for communication complexity of node repair on graphs, including repair schemes with nonuniform download and intermediate processing, and construct codes that attain these bounds. Additionally, some of the nodes may act as adversaries, introducing errors into the data moved in the network. For repair on graphs in the presence of adversarial nodes, we construct codes that support node repair and error correction in systematic nodes.},

  abstract     = {Low-rank parity-check (LRPC) codes are the rank-metric analogue of low-density parity-check codes and they found important applications in code-based cryptography. In this paper we investigate a sub-family of LRPC codes, which have a parity-check matrix defined over a subspace ${\mathcal {V}}_{\alpha,d}=\langle 1,\alpha, \ldots, \alpha ^{d-1} \rangle _{\mathbb {F}_{q}}\subsetneq \mathbb {F}_{q^{m}} $ , where $\mathbb {F}_{q^{m}}$ is the finite field of $q^{m}$ elements, $\alpha \in \mathbb {F}_{q^{m}}$ is an element not in any proper subfield of $\mathbb {F}_{q^{m}}$ , and d is a positive integer significantly smaller than m. These codes are termed bounded-degree LRPC (BD-LRPC) codes. BD-LRPC codes are the same as the standard LRPC codes of density 2 when the degree $d=2$ , while for degree $d\gt 2$ they constitute a proper subset of LRPC codes of density d. Exploiting the structure of ${\mathcal {V}}_{\alpha,d}$ , the BD-LRPC codes of degree d can uniquely correct errors of rank weight r when $n-k \geq r + u$ for certain $u \geq 1$ , in contrast to the condition $n-k\geq dr$ required for the standard LRPC codes. This underscores the superior decoding capability of the BD-LRPC codes. Moreover, as the code length $n\rightarrow \infty $ , when $n/m\rightarrow 0$ , the BD-LRPC codes with a code rate of $R=k/n$ can be uniquely decodable with radius $\rho =r/n$ approaching the Singleton bound $1-R$ by letting $\epsilon =u/n\rightarrow 0$ ; and when $n/m$ is a constant, the BD-LRPC codes can have unique decoding radius $\rho = 1-R-\epsilon $ for a small $\epsilon $ , allowing for $\rho \gt (1-R)/2$ with properly chosen parameters. This superior decoding capability is theoretically proved for the case $d=2$ and confirmed by experimental results for $d\gt 2$ .},

Some examples are given to show that the Delsarte bound and the Norse bound for covering codes in the Hamming metric do not hold true for covering codes in the pair metric.

Then we prove that there is no perfect linear symbol-pair code with the minimum pair-distance 7 and there is no perfect b-symbol metric code if $b\geq \frac {n+4}{2}$ . Moreover a lot of cyclic and algebraic-geometric codes are proved non-perfect in the b-symbol metric. The covering radius of the Reed-Solomon code in the b-symbol metric is determined.

  abstract     = {Recently, codes for correcting a burst of errors have attracted significant attention. One of the most important reasons is that bursts of errors occur in certain emerging techniques, such as DNA storage. In this paper, we investigate a type of error, called a $(t,s)$ -burst, which deletes t consecutive symbols and inserts s arbitrary symbols at the same coordinate. Note that a $(t,s)$ -burst error can be seen as a generalization of a burst of insertions ( $t=0$ ), a burst of deletions ( $s=0$ ), and a burst of substitutions ( $t=s$ ). Our main contribution is to give explicit constructions of q-ary $(t,s)$ -burst correcting codes with $\log n + O(1)$ bits of redundancy for any given constant non-negative integers t, s, and $q \geq 2$ . These codes have optimal redundancy up to an additive constant. Furthermore, we apply our $(t,s)$ -burst correcting codes to combat other various types of errors and improve the corresponding results. In particular, one of our byproducts is a permutation code capable of correcting a burst of t stable deletions with $\log n + O(1)$ bits of redundancy, which is optimal up to an additive constant.},

  abstract     = {In the binary hypothesis testing problem, it is well known that sequentiality in taking samples eradicates the trade-off between two error exponents, yet implementing the optimal test requires the knowledge of the underlying distributions, say $P_{0}$ and $P_{1}$ . In the scenario where the knowledge of distributions is replaced by empirically observed statistics from the respective distributions, the gain of sequentiality is less understood when subject to universality constraints over all possible $P_{0},P_{1}$ . In this work, the gap is mended by a unified study on sequentiality in the universal binary classification problem, where the universality constraints are set on the expected stopping time as well as the type-I error exponent. The type-I error exponent is required to achieve a pre-set distribution-dependent constraint $\lambda (P_{0},P_{1})$ for all $P_{0},P_{1}$ . Under the proposed framework, different sequential setups are investigated so that fair comparisons can be made with the fixed-length counterpart. By viewing these sequential classification problems as special cases of a general sequential composite hypothesis testing problem, the optimal type-II error exponents are characterized. Specifically, in the general sequential composite hypothesis testing problem subject to universality constraints, upper and lower bounds on the type-II error exponent are proved, and a sufficient condition for which the bounds coincide is given. The results for sequential classification problems are then obtained accordingly. With the characterization of the optimal error exponents, the benefit of sequentiality is shown both analytically and numerically by comparing the sequential and the fixed-length cases in representative examples of type-I exponent constraint $\lambda $ .},

  abstract     = {The source coding problem with encoded side information is considered. A lower bound on the strong converse exponent has been derived by Oohama, but its tightness has not been clarified. In this paper, we derive a tight strong converse exponent. For the special case where the side-information does not exist, we demonstrate that our tight exponent of the Wyner-Ahlswede-Körner (WAK) problem reduces to the known tight expression of that special case while Oohama’s lower bound is strictly loose. The converse part is proved by a judicious use of the change-of-measure argument, which was introduced by Gu and Effros and further developed by Tyagi and Watanabe. A key component of the methodology by Tyagi and Watanabe is the use of soft Markov constraint, which was originally introduced by Oohama, as a penalty term to prove the Markov constraint at the end. A technical innovation of this paper compared to Tyagi and Watanabe is recognizing that the soft Markov constraint is a part of the exponent, rather than a penalty term that should vanish at the end; this recognition enables us to derive the matching achievability bound. In fact, via numerical experiment, we provide evidence that the soft Markov constraint is strictly positive. Compared to Oohama’s derivation of the lower bound, which relies on the single-letterization of a certain moment-generating function, the derivation of our tight exponent only involves manipulations of the Kullback-Leibrer divergence and Shannon entropies. The achievability part is derived by a careful analysis of the type argument; however, unlike the conventional analysis for the achievable rate region, we need to derive the soft Markov constraint in the analysis of the correct probability. Furthermore, we present an application of our derivation of the strong converse exponent to the privacy amplification.},

Specifically, we generalize the threat model for the point-to-point rate-distortion setting of Issa, Wagner and Kamath (T-IT 2020) to the multiterminal successive refinement setting. Under mild conditions that correspond to partial secrecy, we characterize the asymptotically optimal normalized maximal leakage region for both the joint excess-distortion probability (JEP) and the expected distortion reliability constraints. Under JEP, in the achievability part, we propose a type-based coding scheme, analyze the reliability guarantee for JEP and bound the leakage of the information source through compressed messages. In the converse part, by analyzing a guessing scheme of the eavesdropper, we prove the optimality of our achievability result. Under expected distortion, the achievability part is established similarly to the JEP counterpart. The converse proof proceeds by generalizing the corresponding results for the rate-distortion setting of SCS by Schieler and Cuff (T-IT 2014) to the successive refinement setting. Somewhat surprisingly, the normalized maximal leakage regions under both JEP and expected distortion constraints are identical under certain conditions, although JEP appears to be a stronger reliability constraint.},

First, AI control of AVs is realized by constructing a deep Q-network (DQN) with an intelligent driver model, with the control objective maximizing vehicle speed while preventing collisions. Then, a deep explainer for humans is developed via a Shapley additive explanation (SHAP), and a novel positive SHAP method that defines new base values is proposed to explain how individual state features contribute to decisions. Finally, statistical analyses and intuitive explanations are quantified based on SHAP tools to improve clarity.

However, in some unstructured environments, the point cloud registration cannot constrain the poses of the LiDAR due to its sparse geometric features, which leads to the degeneracy of multi-sensor fusion accuracy. To address this problem, we propose a novel real-time approach to sense and compensate for the degeneracy of LiDAR. Firstly, this paper introduces the degeneracy factor with clear meaning, which can measure the degeneracy of LiDAR. Then, the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) clustering method adaptively perceives the degeneracy with better environmental generalization. Finally, the degeneracy perception results are utilized to fuse LiDAR and IMU, thus effectively resisting degeneracy effects. Experiments on our dataset show the method’s high accuracy and robustness and validate our algorithm’s adaptability to different environments and LiDAR scanning modalities.},

  abstract     = {In most of the recent literature about model predictive control (MPC) on vehicles, the finite-time and bipartite control are rarely considered. Although existing MPC methods can be applied to address the separation and rendezvous problem, they may suffer from time wasting and consistency conflicts. The finite-time control facilitates the motion planning by pre-calculating the coverage time horizon, which can avoid the unnecessary time-wasting. The bipartite control can realize the collision avoidance for the multi-vehicle system unless the reference state is zero. Therefore, a finite-time bipartite (FTB) control method for the UAV-USV system based on MPC is proposed. However, in most of the existing UAV-USV systems, the sustainable operating mechanism is not considered as usual. In this paper, to realize the sustainable operating mechanism, an UAV-USV ecosystem is introduced and further improved. Specifically, a battery replacement process is proposed and realized by the MPC method with switching topologies. Considering an UAV-USV system, the UAVs on the USV can help the USV replace the rechargeable batteries. And this process can be realized automatically by the proposed MPC method with switching topologies in a finite time. The recursive feasibility and asymptotic stability of the proposed method are proven. In addition, a series of simulations are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {This study introduces the Metacognitive-Attribution Inspired Reinforcement Learning (MAIRL) approach, designed to address unprotected interactive left turns at intersections—one of the most challenging tasks in autonomous driving. By integrating the Metacognitive Theory and Attribution Theory from the psychology field with reinforcement learning, this study enriches the learning mechanisms of autonomous vehicles with human cognitive processes. Specifically, it applies Metacognitive Theory’s three core elements—Metacognitive Knowledge, Metacognitive Monitoring, and Metacognitive Reflection—to enhance the control framework’s capabilities in skill differentiation, real-time assessment, and adaptive learning for interactive motion planning. Furthermore, inspired by Attribution Theory, it decomposes the reward system in RL algorithms into three components: 1) skill improvement, 2) existing ability, and 3) environmental stochasticity. This framework emulates human learning and behavior adjustment, incorporating a deeper cognitive emulation into reinforcement algorithms to foster a unified cognitive structure and control strategy. Contrastive tests conducted in various intersection scenarios with differing traffic densities demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed controller, which outperformed baseline algorithms in success rates and had lower collision and timeout incidents. This interdisciplinary approach not only enhances the understanding and applicability of RL algorithms but also represents a meaningful step towards modeling advanced human cognitive processes in the field of autonomous driving.},

  abstract     = {Given the critical need for more reliable autonomous driving systems, explainability has become a key focus within the research community. In autonomous driving models, even minor perception differences can significantly influence the decision-making process, and this impact often diverges markedly from human cognition. However, understanding the specific reasons why a model decides to stop or keep forward remains a significant challenge. This paper presents an attribution-guided visualization method aimed at exploring the triggers behind decision shifts, providing clear insights into the underlying “why” and “why not” of such decisions. We propose the cumulative layer fusion attribution method that identifies the parameters most critical to decision-making. These attributions are then used to inform the visualization optimization by applying attribution-guided weights to crucial generation parameters, ensuring that decision changes are driven only by modifications to critical information. Furthermore, we develop an indirect regularization method that increases visualization quality without necessitating additional hyperparameters. Experiments on large datasets demonstrate that our method produces insightful visualization explanations and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.},

This paper proposed a three-stage method for maintenance based on machine learning, which further refined the PM decision-making process. First, a pavement maintenance level model was developed using the PCA and PSO algorithm optimized SVM model. The model was then used to separate pavement maintenance into three categories: daily, PM, and major. Second, the DBSCAN and OPTICS were utilized to further divide the PM requirements finely. In order to implement the scientific decision-making of PM, suitable maintenance procedures were ultimately chosen based on the predominant damage kinds of the pavement units. The results showed that, when compared to the original SVM model, the classification accuracy of the PCA-PSO-SVM model was greatly improved, with total accuracy and accuracy of each class increasing by 10%, 41.7%, 4.6%, and 7.8%, respectively. When clustering the airport pavement performance dataset, OPTICS outperformed the DBSCAN technique.

The main challenge lies in the strong coupling between link scheduling and server selection under the location constraints of VEC. To address this issue, we design a scheduling strategy based on deep reinforcement learning and improve the neural network structure using a branch network approach, reducing complexity by decreasing the number of actions represented in the network’s output layer. Moreover, we introduce an action masking scheme that accelerates the algorithm’s convergence in this system.

  abstract     = {The integration of Electric Vehicles (EVs) into the energynet, the network from power generation to EV charging station, presents a symbiotic relationship with potential benefits for sustainable and efficient transportation. However, the existing research has revealed challenges in maintaining an equilibrium between energy supply and demand, often resulting in underutilization or overutilization of energy networks. Blockchain technology has emerged as a promising solution to enhance transparency and secure decentralized energy distribution; however fails to connect the equilibrium in the presence of uncertainty of demand-supply and/or handling information cascading. In this paper, we introduce TAURITE (sTAckelberg eqUilibRium in blockchaIned energyneT with Evs), a novel blockchain-based energynet framework that explicitly leverages the Stackelberg model for energy flow equilibrium within EV interfaces. TAURITE employs Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium (SPNE) to address demand uncertainty in dynamic vehicular environments. It also tackles information cascades’ impact on energy distribution, demonstrating its ability to maintain equilibrium even in such scenarios. TAURITE introduces a multi-variate polynomial-based key generation process through the smart contract AVTAL and incorporates Proof-of-Energy-Equilibrium (PoEE) as an energy sector consensus mechanism. Experimental results show that TAURITE significantly improves throughput, latency, and energy efficiency, with an average 30% enhancement in these metrics. Notably, TAURITE ensures 100% allocation stability, even in the presence of information cascades, marking a substantial advancement in sustainable and efficient energy management within the evolving energynet-EV ecosystem.},

Then, the prescribed performance-based optimal formation control strategy is developed to guarantee that each vehicle achieves collision-free formation control while maintaining connectivity, as well as the prescribed transient and steady performance on the position tracking errors. Inspired by the prescribed performance control, an improved asymmetric barrier function with prescribed performance is provided to ensure that the yaw angle errors satisfy the prescribed performance constraints. Eventually, theoretical analysis demonstrates that the optimal formation control scheme can produce position tracking errors that converge to a prescribed arbitrarily small region within a prescribed time interval, along with the yaw angle that adheres to the time-varying partial constraints, subject to optimal cost with limited communication ranges and collision avoidance constraints.

  abstract     = {Learning multi-scale feature representations is essential for dense prediction tasks in autonomous driving. Most existing works are based on U-shaped architectures, where high-resolution representations are progressively recovered by connecting different levels of the decoder with low-resolution representations from the encoder. We observed that rich details from low-level representation and high semantic information from high-level representations are not fully utilized in the cross-stage fusion process. Additionally, current architectures often struggle to extract efficient discriminative feature along object boundaries. To address this issue, we propose CSNet, a generic cross-stage subtraction network that extracts spatial and semantic multi-scale representations through guided contextual feature. This approach allows fine-grained features to refine deeper layers, capturing discriminative high-resolution features while filtering out redundant information. Specifically, we introduce a cross-stage subtraction module (CSM), which consists of three sub-modules: 1) a Short Path Unit, focusing on capturing complementary adjacent information; 2) Medium Path Unit for effective middle-stages features aggregation; and 3) Long Path Unit for redundant information masking and long-range context modeling. Additionally, we propose the Semantic Guided Context Reasoning (SGCR) module to reason and model contextual relations between different subtraction units. CSNet demonstrates consistent performance gains across various semantic segmentation datasets. Our model, CSNet-M, achieves 82.2% mIoU on the Camvid dataset, while CSNet-S and CSNet-M attain 79.6% and 80.5% mIoU accuracy, respectively, on the Cityscapes dataset. These results show that the proposed CSNet has the potential for enhancing real-time semantic segmentation in autonomous driving applications, offering improved accuracy and efficiency in diverse urban scenarios.

Most existing methods encode traffic spatial and temporal data separately, and then design a feature fusion module to correlate spatial and temporal features. However, spatial information is often static, and repetitive static spatial encoding leads to waste of resources, especially in large-scale traffic network prediction. In this paper, we propose a dynamic edge interaction encoding method for spatio-temporal features based on inverse Transformer (iTransformer) and Graph Transformer, named iTPGT-former. The dynamic edge interaction process is designed to embed dynamic temporal features into static edges via a convolutional embedding module. To enhance the Graph Transformer, a relative position encoding strategy based on the self-attentive score of the positive definite kernel (PDK) on graphs and a method for graph substructure encoding (GSE) via enumeration of paths are introduced. In the experimental and discussion session, the iTPGT-former is considered for accuracy, parameters, inference speed, and rich ablation experiments are provided based on six publicly available traffic datasets. The results show that iTPGT-former outperforms the baseline model in both traffic flow and traffic speed prediction. The maximum improvement is achieved in the METR-LA 60-min speed prediction task, with 15.2% reduction in Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). In addition, the inference of iTPGT-former is significantly faster than the GCN-based method. Our implementation of the iTPGT-former is available at https://github.com/ouyangnann/iTPGTN-former.},

As a result, vast amounts of Automatic Identification System (AIS) data from global vessels are transmitted to various maritime stakeholders through Maritime IoT systems. AIS data contains a large amount of dynamic and static information that requires effective and intuitive visualization for comprehensive analysis. However, two major deficiencies challenge current visualization models: a lack of consideration for interactions between distant pixels and low efficiency. To address these issues, we developed a large-scale vessel trajectories visualization algorithm, called the Non-local Kernel Density Estimation (NLKDE) algorithm, which incorporates a non-local convolution process. It accurately calculates the density distribution of vessel trajectories by considering correlations between distant pixels. Additionally, we implemented the NLKDE algorithm under a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) framework to enable parallel computing and improve operational efficiency. Comprehensive experiments using multiple vessel trajectory datasets show that the NLKDE algorithm excels in vessel trajectory density visualization tasks, and the GPU-accelerated framework significantly shortens the execution time to achieve real-time results. From both theoretical and practical perspectives, GPU-accelerated NLKDE provides technical support for real-time monitoring of vessel dynamics in complex water areas and contributes to constructing maritime intelligent transportation systems.

The Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) method is then employed to optimize the outcomes produced by the WADRL, thereby mitigating the limitations of both approaches. Firstly, we design an MOVRPTW model to balance the minimization of travel cost and the maximization of customer satisfaction. Subsequently, we present a novel DRL framework that incorporates a transformer-based policy network. This network is composed of an encoder module, a weight embedding module where the weights of the objective functions are incorporated, and a decoder module. NSGA-II is then utilized to optimize the solutions generated by WADRL. Finally, extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing and traditional methods. Due to the numerous constraints in VRPTW, generating initial solutions of the NSGA-II algorithm can be time-consuming. However, using solutions generated by the WADRL as initial solutions for NSGA-II significantly reduces the time required for generating initial solutions. Meanwhile, the NSGA-II algorithm can enhance the quality of solutions generated by WADRL, resulting in solutions with better scalability. Notably, the weight-aware strategy significantly reduces the training time of DRL while achieving better results, enabling a single DRL model to solve the entire multiobjective optimization problem.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates discrete-time sliding mode trajectory tracking control for fully actuated autonomous surface vessels (ASVs) with unknown nonlinear dead-zone and saturation inputs, utilizing a switching dynamic event-triggered mechanism (DETM). Through model integration, a direct relationship between ASV position and control inputs is established, simplifying trajectory tracking strategy design. ASVs face dead-zone and saturation constraints in control inputs, where low input signals may not overcome static friction, hindering maneuverability, and further increases are ineffective once actuators reach maximum thrust. Unlike linear dead-zone and saturation input constraints with known parameters, this paper considers a more realistic scenario of unknown nonlinearity, employing adaptive neural networks to approximate and compensate for the resulting unknown dynamics. Moreover, limited internal communication resources constrain real-time inter-subsystem communication in ASVs, while frequent short-period sampling in stable conditions results in unnecessary energy and computational consumption, collectively degrading trajectory tracking performance. A novel switching DETM is proposed to reduce unnecessary data transmission, which switches triggering conditions based on variations in auxiliary dynamic variables. Meanwhile, the controller output variation is integrated into the event-triggered conditions to enhance tracking control performance. Based on this, a discrete-time sliding mode trajectory tracking controller suitable for large sampling periods is designed. This ensures satisfactory tracking control effectiveness while further reducing unnecessary data transmission frequency and conserving limited communication resources within a larger range of sampling periods. All tracking errors are proven to be controlled within a small vicinity near zero. The numerical simulation results validate the efficacy of the proposed control strategy.},

  abstract     = {Aiming at the problem of low merging efficiency, poor platoon stability, and high collision risk when multiple connected and automated vehicles merge into the same target platoon, we propose a multi-vehicle self-organized cooperative control strategy for platoon formation, which includes vehicle self-organizing formation control and platoon cooperative merging control. The vehicle self-organizing formation control module organizes the merging vehicles within the V2V communication range into multiple local platoons. The dynamic self-adjusting critical interval and a fixed-topology second-order platoon consistency control protocol are proposed to divided the vehicles reasonably and make the states of local platoon vehicles consistent. The merging vehicles merge into the target platoon as a whole in the form of a local platoon, which transforms the complex multi-vehicle merge problem into a platoon cooperative control problem and improves the merging efficiency. The platoon cooperative merging control module adopts a distributed model predictive control (DMPC) theory to design two longitudinal cooperative merging controllers, which control the target platoon to split to create a merging gap and the local platoon to align with this gap longitudinally. The lateral merging controller controls the local platoon change the lane to merge into the target platoon safely and smoothly. Simulation experiments are conducted in typical scenarios, and it is verified that the proposed control strategy can enable multi-vehicles to merge into a platoon efficiently, safely, and stably.},

  abstract     = {3D object detection has aroused increasing interest as a crucial component of autonomous driving systems. While recent works have explored various multi-modal fusion methods to enhance accuracy and robustness, fusing multi-view images and high-definition (HD) maps remains uncharted. Inspired by our previous work, we endeavor to introduce HD maps to camera-based detection, prompting the design of a new framework. To address this, we first analyze the function of HD maps in object detection to understand their benefits and the rationale for their fusion. From this analysis, we identify key disparities in view, semantics, and scale, leading to the development of MIM, a framework for HD Maps Incorporated Multi-view 3D object detection. HD maps are enriched in semantics by sampling unlabeled areas and encoding them into map features. Simultaneously, multi-view images are transformed into features in bird’s-eye view (BEV) using the adopted baseline. These features are then fused using attention mechanisms to align scales. Experiments conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MIM outperforms camera-based methods. Moreover, an in-depth analysis investigates how HD maps impact object detection regarding each semantic layer. The results underscore the operational intricacies of HD maps in perception, setting the stage for future research. Code is available at https://github.com/WHU-xjs/MIM-3D-Det.},

  abstract     = {Safe urban driving is challenging due to the high density of traffic flow and various potential hazards, such as the sudden appearance of unknown objects. Traditional rule-based approaches and imitation learning methods struggle to address the diverse driving scenarios encountered in urban environments. Reinforcement learning (RL), which adapts to a wide range of driving scenarios through continuous interaction with the environment, has demonstrated success in autonomous driving. Making safety decisions when driving in urban environments necessitates a comprehensive perception of the current scene and the ability to predict the evolution of the dynamic scene. In this paper, we present a novel cascade deep reinforcement learning framework, CDRP3, designed to enhance the safety decision-making capabilities of self-driving vehicles in complex scenarios and emergencies. We leverage a multi-modal spatio-temporal perception (MmSTP) module to fuse multi-modal sensor data and introduce temporal perception to capture spatio-temporal information about dynamic driving environments, and a future state prediction (FSP) module to model complex interactions between different traffic participants and explicitly predict their future states. Subsequently, in the PPO-based planning module, we use the comprehensive environmental information obtained from perception and prediction to decode an optimized driving strategy using a lateral and longitudinal separated multi-branch network structure guided by a customized reward function. This approach enables knowledge transfer from the perception and prediction components to planning, and planning-oriented enhancement of safety decision-making capabilities to improve driving safety. Our experiments demonstrate that CDRP3 outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing superior driving safety in complex urban environments.},

  abstract     = {Local trajectory planning (TP) for collision avoidance typically comprises path planning (PP) and velocity planning (VP). Various objectives must be fulfilled in a PP task, and the majority of prior works integrate all objectives into a unified cost function. To prioritize the dominant objectives of each PP stage, we propose to decouple the PP task into two separate subtasks, enabling the logical establishment of subtask-oriented segmented PP methods. First, based on risk evaluation of four vehicle vertices, an improved artificial potential field was established. Second, a novel transit point selection method was applied to decouple the PP task into two segmented subtasks. Then, the optimization problem was converted into a multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) problem and the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method was utilized to obtain two optimal segmented paths. Finally, a velocity planner based on cubic polynomial, in conjunction with a support vector machine-based stability classifier, was designed. The proposed trajectory planner was then verified in six typical driving scenarios, including both simulation and real vehicle studies. Verification results demonstrate that the proposed planner effectively decouples the PP task and achieves a safe, comfortable, efficient, and trackable trajectory.},

  abstract     = {Urban Air Mobility (UAM), powered by flying cars, is poised to revolutionize urban transportation by expanding vehicle travel from the ground to the air. This advancement promises to alleviate congestion and enable faster commutes. However, the fast travel speeds mean vehicles will encounter vastly different environments during a single journey. As a result, onboard learning systems need access to extensive environmental data, leading to high costs in data collection and training. These demands conflict with the limited in-vehicle computing and battery resources. Fortunately, learning model sharing offers a solution. Well-trained local Deep Learning (DL) models can be shared with other vehicles, reducing the need for redundant data collection and training. However, this sharing process relies heavily on efficient vehicular communications in UAM. To address these challenges, this paper leverages the multi-hop Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) technology to improve DL model sharing between distant flying cars. We also employ knowledge distillation to reduce the size of the shared DL models and enable efficient integration of non-identical models at the receiver. Our approach enhances model sharing and onboard learning performance for cars entering new environments.

The purpose of the game is to let the CEVA to determine the real-time electricity trading prices, while the CEVs decide their own real-time service schedules. Case studies assess the feasibility and effectiveness of proposed noncooperative incentive approach, in which the efficient motivation on the CEVs contribute to a high quality V2G services.

Advances in deep learning have led to significant improvements in image object detection. However, existing methods continue to struggle with balancing detection speed and accuracy.

The model’s backbone employs structured reparameterization and lightweight Vision Transformers, using multi-branch and Feed-Forward Network structures to boost informational richness and positional awareness, respectively. The Neck network utilizes the Low-GD structure to enhance the aggregation and integration of multi-scale features, reducing information loss during cross-layer exchanges. We introduce a data augmentation strategy using Stable Diffusion to expand our traffic light dataset in complex weather conditions like fog, rain, and snow, improving model generalization. Our method excels on the YCTL2024 traffic light dataset, achieving a detection speed of 135 FPS and 98.23% accuracy, with only 1.3M model parameters. Testing on the Bosch Small Traffic Lights Dataset confirms the method’s strong generalization capabilities.

  abstract     = {Lane changing presents a dynamic scenario characterized by intricate interactions among vehicles. Within mixed-autonomy traffic environment, modeling a human-like lane-change trajectory enables human drivers to better understand and predict autonomous vehicles’ behaviors, thereby enhancing road safety and travel efficiency. In this study, we achieve human-like interactive lane-change modeling based on a novel framework named Diff-LC. The human-like modeling of LCV behaviors relies on an advanced diffusive planner, and the implemented trajectory is selected based on the recovered LCV reward function learned through Multi-Agent Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning (MA-AIRL). To account for interactions between FVs and LCVs, we further employ a diffusive predictor to forecast future behaviors of FVs conditioned on both historical and planned trajectories. Additionally, we leverage the recovered reward function of FVs to enable controllable prediction of trajectories. In the experimental part, we begin by analyzing the significance of features in the recovered reward functions and then proceed to compare the distinctions between the LCV and the FV. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we compare the diffusive predictor and planner with several state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrate that motions planned by Diff-LC closely reach the intended positions with small displacement errors and exhibit highly similar speed and jerk distributions to those of human drivers. We also conduct a dynamic simulation to evaluate Diff-LC’s performance across different traffic conditions. Finally, we explore customized generation using the Diffusion Posterior Sampling method.

  abstract     = {Human mobility is intricately influenced by urban contexts spatially and temporally, constituting essential domain knowledge in understanding traffic systems. While existing traffic forecasting models primarily rely on raw traffic data and advanced deep learning techniques, incorporating contextual information remains underexplored due to insufficient integration frameworks and the complexity of urban contexts. This study proposes a novel context-aware knowledge graph (CKG) framework to enhance traffic speed forecasting by effectively modeling spatial and temporal contexts. Employing a relation-dependent integration strategy, the framework generates context-aware representations from the spatial and temporal units of CKG to capture spatio-temporal dependencies of urban contexts. A CKG-GNN model, combining the CKG, dual-view multi-head self-attention (MHSA), and graph neural network (GNN), is then designed to predict traffic speed utilizing these context-aware representations. Our experiments demonstrate that CKG’s configuration significantly influences embedding performance, with ComplEx and KG2E emerging as optimal for embedding spatial and temporal units, respectively. The CKG-GNN model establishes a benchmark for 10-120 min predictions, achieving average MAE, MAPE, and RMSE of 3.46±0.01, 14.76±0.09%, and 5.08±0.01, respectively. Compared to the baseline DCRNN model, integrating the spatial unit improves the MAE by 0.04 and the temporal unit by 0.13, while integrating both units further reduces it by 0.18. The dual-view MHSA analysis reveals the crucial role of relation-dependent features from the context-based view and the model’s ability to prioritize recent time slots in prediction from the sequence-based view. Overall, this study underscores the importance of merging context-aware knowledge graphs with graph neural networks to improve traffic forecasting.},

  abstract     = {The increased prevalence of stairs and ramps in urban areas has highlighted the importance of understanding pedestrian dynamics on inclined surfaces. Previous studies indicate that pedestrians exhibit distinct motion characteristics on slopes compared to level ground. While traditional rule-based models used for pedestrian simulation may not accurately capture the complexities of pedestrian behaviour on slopes, this paper presents a Transferable Pedestrian Motion Simulation Network (TPMSN) tailored for accurately modelling pedestrian dynamics on slopes. The TPMSN incorporates five key input features to capture relative position information, neighbour motion states, and trends in pedestrian motion. Through a transferable layer, the network demonstrates versatility in handling crowd simulation tasks across different slope angles. Networks pre-trained with data from pedestrian single-file flow experiments exhibit robust fitting performance, with R-square values ranging from 0.848 to 0.999. Furthermore, transfer learning is applied with experimental data from pedestrian unidirectional flow on slopes. Two independent networks are trained to predict instantaneous velocity vectors. Simulations carried out by the two networks demonstrate promising accuracy and authenticity, which are validated by a mean Average Displacement Error (ATE) of 0.0926 m and reproduction of flow-density fundamental diagrams. Additionally, the networks could capture pedestrian lateral body sway, a crucial aspect of real-life pedestrian behaviour on slopes, as evidenced by lane entropy trends consistent with empirical studies. Overall, the TPMSN offers a successful approach for crowd simulation on slopes. This work contributes to the advancement of crowd simulation techniques in complex terrains, offering valuable implications for urban planning, crowd management and architectural design.},

However, the existing methods about intelligent transportation prediction have the phenomenon of losing some important information in the prediction process. Meanwhile, some redundant features affect the improvement of prediction accuracy. Moreover, the randomness of k-value selection in k-nearest neighbour (KNN) leads to some limitations in the prediction performance of intelligent transportation prediction. To address these challenges, this paper designs a dynamic prediction system of generalized regression neural network (GRNN) with feedback mechanism by virtue of KNN and modified grey wolf optimization algorithm (MGWO), named KNN-MGWO-FMGRNN. Firstly, the discrepancy value between different samples for each feature is calculated and the k nearest samples to a certain sample are taken as the discrepancy result of this sample under this feature. Then, the KNN results are fused with the difference results and combined with the MGWO algorithm to obtain the optimal k-value. Next, the optimal k-value is used to recalculate the difference result and the KNN result to complete the feature subset selection (FSS). Further, the optimal FSS and model learning are completed simultaneously using FMGRNN. Finally, the availability and merits of the established model are affirmed by six real data sets.},

To address trustworthiness issues, this paper introduces Proof of Traffic-Flow Condition (PoTC) consensus. PoTC uses traffic-data-driven grouping to form committees, enhancing scalability and communication efficiency while maintaining fault tolerance. A robust node assessment model provides precise reliability scores for participants. The security of PoTC is validated through theoretical analysis against two adversary models involving Invalid Voting and Traffic-flow Data Tampering, and extensive experiments demonstrate its efficiency and resilience against the interference of malicious nodes.},

An innovative hierarchical information security control (HISC) framework is proposed to solve the estimation problem in a secure and privacy-preserving way and the formation tracking problem for ASVs. The information processing layer of HISC framework focuses on the distributed secure and privacy-preserving estimator (DSPE) algorithm under sampled-data interaction and the local control layer is mainly about the robust neuro-adaptive controller without any model information for the formation of networked ASVs under communication delay.

The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming aiming to minimize operational costs and risks over a day-to-day rolling planning horizon. A two-stage decomposition (TSD) method is proposed to solve this challenging problem. In the first stage, bus maintenance is scheduled on a daily basis. The second stage then optimizes specific bus maintenance and vehicle schedules within each day. With such a problem decomposition, the computational complexity is significantly reduced as the within-day problems become independent. Computational experiments conducted on a real-world bus line demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the TSD method. Compared to a one-step solution method and an algorithm in a similar existing study, the proposed TSD method consumes far less computation time, while delivering high-quality solutions. Moreover, the TSD solution method can be further greatly accelerated if the within-day problems of the second stage are solved in parallel with different computers. The computational results also highlight the benefits of the proposed two-stage optimization approach in enhancing operational cost-efficiency and bus resource utilization.},

In this paper, we first propose to ensure the isolation of VDTs with the assistance of intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) and network slicing (NS), and obtain better update time of the VDTs within limited resources. Specifically, we divide resources for VDTs with different update requirements to ensure the isolation of VDTs and the resources required for update. On the other hand, considering that the communication performance between vehicles and base stations is affected by urban building density, we propose using an intelligent controller to achieve intelligent control of the physical channel by adjusting the phase shift of passive reflective elements to ensure better transmission performance during VDTs updating. Secondly, considering the dynamic variability of vehicles and the environment, we propose an improved deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on the actor-critic framework to allocate communication, computing resources, and adjust the phase shift of the IRS. Finally, a large number of simulation results indicate that our proposed algorithm performs better than the benchmark algorithms.},

Specifically, battery swapping is a novel mode of power supply for EVs. However, the new way of energy supply complicates the action policies of EVs, especially when the number of power supply facilities is limited. To address this issue, this paper proposes a multilevel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method to coordinate the action of EVs within the battery charging and swapping station (BCSS) environment. Firstly, an action-driven simulation framework is developed to simulate the BCSS environment and obtain the EVs’ attributes. Then the multilevel algorithm is proposed to drive the EVs to obtain charging strategies. In the multilevel algorithm, the initial decision for EVs is provided by a DRL-based model. Then the advantage value function is utilized to adjust the initial decision of EVs to meet the constraints of limited charging and swapping equipment. Besides, unlike traditional DRL-based methods, the proposed model is driven by the rewards obtained from EV actions. Finally, extensive experiments have shown that the proposed multilevel DRL-based method has superior performance over existing methods in resolving coordinated battery charging and swapping actions. In particular, the proposed model can provide a suggested and reasonable price range for the practical battery swapping mode operation.},

However, current ISAC research often focuses on overall performance assessment across extended periods, potentially overlooking practical sensing requirements, resulting in degraded or even unstable communication performance. To mitigate these challenges, we propose an Integrated On-Demand Sensing and Communication (IDSAC) mechanism for HSRMNs. IDSAC optimizes train communication energy efficiency (EE) by jointly optimizing target sensing selection and transmit beamforming, while adhering to Age of Information (AoI) constraints and ensuring beam pattern gain for designated targets. To tackle the non-convex mixed-integer programming challenge, we decompose the problem into two parts. First, we employ iterative algorithms using successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) to address the EE problem. Second, we introduce a dynamic control algorithm employing the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty method to manage AoI constraints and sensing selection. Our joint optimization approach achieves optimal EE under dynamic operational constraints typical of high-speed rail systems. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of IDSAC in optimizing ISAC performance, enhancing railway safety and communication efficiency.},

In this paper, we propose a novel flow-based generative method JTE-CFlow for low-light image enhancement, which consists of a joint-attention transformer based conditional encoder (JTE) and a map-wise cross affine coupling flow (CFlow). Specifically, JTE executes short-range and long-range operations by RRDBs (i.e., residual-in-residual dense blocks) and JATs (i.e., joint-attention transformer blocks) in series connection. JAT achieves weak information amplification and information loss restoration of zero-element pixels by the integration of self-attention and specific-attention with sharing the same value vectors, where the query and key vectors of specific-attention are from the zero-map feature of the low-light image. On the other hand, CFlow develops a map-wise cross affine coupling (MCAC) layer to perform cross learning for the flow feature, and a multiplication coupling network (MCN) to learn the transformation parameters of MCAC. JTE-CFlow learns to map the subtraction of outputs of CFlow and JTE (i.e., the residual code) into a standard normal distribution, and the inverse network of CFlow takes the latent feature of the low-light image as its input to infer the enhanced image. Experiments show that JTE-CFlow outperforms most SOTA methods on 7 mainstream low-light datasets with the same architecture, and can be applied to enhance NTM images.

This paper introduces a novel lane-changing method that interactively combines prediction and planning to cope with the complex traffic scenarios. Firstly, a new target vehicle trajectory prediction network based on the hierarchical attention modules is proposed. The initial predictions are fed into a combined sampling and optimization method for selecting an ego vehicle lane changing maneuver. Unlike previous unidirectional frameworks, the selected maneuver is re-entered into the prediction network so that extra ego vehicle planning information can be incorporated to reduce prediction uncertainties. Finally, based on the planning-informed predictions and the selected maneuver, we design a nonlinear model predictive controller to achieve a safe, efficient and comfortable lane change trajectory in the Frenet coordinate. The root mean square errors of the proposed prediction network at the fifth second on the NGSIM and HighD test sets are 3.54 m and 1.18 m, respectively, which both achieve the state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, the results of real traffic data based simulations and real-vehicle experiments highlight the effectiveness of the lane-changing framework.},

In particular, we utilize the complementary integration of deep features from different model structures. We propose a novel fusion framework called FusionReID to unify the strengths of CNNs and Transformers for image-based person ReID. More specifically, we first deploy a Dual-branch Feature Extraction (DFE) to extract features through CNNs and Transformers from a single image. Moreover, we design a novel Dual-attention Mutual Fusion (DMF) to achieve sufficient feature fusions. The DMF comprises Local Refinement Units (LRU) and Heterogenous Transmission Modules (HTM). LRU utilizes depth-separable convolutions to align deep features in channel dimensions and spatial sizes. HTM consists of a Shared Encoding Unit (SEU) and two Mutual Fusion Units (MFU). Through the continuous stacking of HTM, deep features after LRU are repeatedly utilized to generate more discriminative features. Extensive experiments on three public ReID benchmarks demonstrate that our method can attain superior performances than most state-of-the-arts.

In this study, we propose a novel framework to leverage expert priors for proactive-aware decision-making in ambiguous right-of-way, merging Reinforcement Learning (RL) with parameterized modeling. Building upon unprotected-turning interactions from real-world driving datasets, we select typical cases under ambiguous right-of-way as human-expert priors, which are utilized to guide the learning of the RL agent. Then, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), which is governed by interpretable parameters derived from expert priors, introduces human decision updating mechanism into AV strategy. Experimenting with typical driving tasks, our approach achieves balanced safety and efficiency in tackling ambiguities of right-of-way, with superior decision-making performance via the guidance of expert priors when compared with established baselines. Furthermore, the results indicate that the proposed method enables AVs to accelerate the convergence during the interaction by consistent probing and decision updates.},

Double-side cantilever yard cranes (DCYCs) perform stacking and unstacking operations for containers transported by AGVs and ETs. Managing and coordinating the operations of DCYC, AGVs, and ETs, not only improves the operation efficiency of U-ACTs but also helps to promote the development of green ports. This paper addresses the problem of scheduling DCYCs and path planning for AGVs and ETs in the U-ACT. To achieve this, we establish a bi-objective mixed integer programming model to minimize both the makespan and the energy consumption. The model considers conflicts between two DCYCs within each block, ensures workload balance for these DCYCs, optimizes parking slots for AGVs and ETs, and schedules appropriate entry times for AGVs and ETs into the yard to reduce conflicts. To solve this model, we develop an improved multi-objective particle swarm optimization (IMOPSO) algorithm, where a globally optimal heuristic search mechanism and several conflict avoidance strategies to plan conflict-free spatiotemporal paths are introduced to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superiority of the IMOPSO approach in terms of multiple metrics, confirming the effectiveness of the optimized vehicle entry timing strategy, which improves efficiency by 7.33% and yields energy savings by 11.72%. These findings clearly highlight that our model and solution approach can effectively enhance the operational efficiency of DCYCs, AGVs, and ETs, contributing to the overall improvement of container terminal operations.},

It considers a reverse logistics network organized in two capacitated echelons: the first echelon aims to build routes for trucks visiting every node for different strains of pick-up requests under intuitionistic fuzzy multi-demands, and the objective of the second echelon is to ascertain the number and position of cooperation clusters from waste transfer stations to treatment facilities. Due to the complexity of the proposed model, the instances that can be solved to optimality are usually small to medium-sized and face computational difficulties in solving larger instances. To overcome this problem, we fashion a distributed heuristic based on fuzzy bi-means and adaptive large neighborhood segmented search to address this novel model. A refined Shapley model for profit allocation and the best coalition combination is constructed for each participant. Extensive computational findings and a practical case study are conducted to show the efficiency of the proposed model and approach. Several relevant managerial insights are also derived to aid decision-making in waste sorting management.},

  abstract     = {Vision-language tracking is a new rising topic in intelligent transportation systems, particularly significant in autonomous driving and road surveillance. It is a task that aims to combine visual and auxiliary linguistic modalities to co-locate the target object in a video sequence. Currently, multi-modal data scarcity and burdensome modality fusion have become two major factors in limiting the development of vision-language tracking. To tackle the issues, we propose an efficient and effective one-stage vision-language tracking framework (CPIPTrack) that unifies feature extraction and multi-modal fusion by interactive prompt learning. Feature extraction is performed by the high-performance vision-language foundation model CLIP, resulting in the impressive generalization ability inherited from the large-scale model. Modality fusion is simplified to a few lightweight prompts, leading to significant savings in computational resources. Specifically, we design three types of prompts to dynamically learn the layer-wise feature relationships between vision and language, facilitating rich context interactions while enabling the pre-trained CLIP adaptation. In this manner, discriminative target-oriented visual features can be extracted by language and template guidance, which are used for subsequent reasoning. Due to the elimination of extra heavy modality fusion, the proposed CPIPTrack shows high efficiency in both training and inference. CPIPTrack has been extensively evaluated on three benchmark datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that it achieves a good performance-speed balance with an AUC of 66.0% on LaSOT and a runtime of 51.7 FPS on RTX2080 Super.},

  abstract     = {Coordinated ramp metering (CRM) is one effective measure to alleviate urban expressway congestion. Traditional model-based methods generally concentrate on single-bottleneck scenarios, while ignoring the case of multiple bottlenecks. In addition, the fixed-sensor fails to fully capture the dynamic traffic characteristics. The rapid development of traffic detection technology has made available a large amount of automatic vehicle identification (AVI) data, which can record detailed individual trajectories. Taking advantage of the AVI data, CRM can be improved. Besides, multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) and game theory have been proven to be effective for traffic signal control. These methods can address the challenges faced by CRM, such as solving nonlinear and high-dimensional optimization problems. This paper proposes a distributed CRM strategy with multi-bottleneck to minimize the total travel time and balance the multiple on-ramps equity, using the individual trajectory information from AVI data. Firstly, the paper defines road segment units, road segment groups, and bottlenecks. Next, the problem is formulated as a potential game that captures the interaction among multiple bottlenecks. The controllers utilize the MADDPG algorithm to determine the green duration of the on-ramps. Finally, the proposed strategy is tested on a real-world urban expressway in a microsimulation platform SUMO. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed strategy performs better than the baseline methods in eliminating mainline congestion and improving the multiple on-ramps equity. Compared to the no-control scenario, the proposed strategy has improved the performance of the system throughput, average travel time, and average mainline speed by 1.31%, 44.36%, and 115.23%.},

  abstract     = {This study addresses the challenge of retrieving traffic road visibility in the Internet of Video Things (IoVT). The complexity arises from the highly ill-posed inverse problem of estimating road visibility from video frames due to indirect inference, leading to ambiguity and multiple possible solutions. Initially, this study formulates the fog effects on images and discovers that the first and second eigenvalues of the observed image matrix closely approximate those of the airlight component under fog conditions. Based on this important discovery, a four-step framework is proposed for estimating road visibility. The framework includes defining persistent scatterers, formulating a singular value decomposition (SVD)-based method for background and airlight separation, extracting crucial physical features, and designing a hybrid convolutional long short-term memory (LSTM) network for accurate visibility estimation. Specifically, the foundational step defines persistent scatterers in visual scenes, followed by a sophisticated SVD-based method for background and airlight separation. Subsequently, physical features, including eigenvalue-based entropy and persistent scatterer intensity, are computed. The framework concludes with a novel hybrid convolutional LSTM network tailored for traffic road visibility estimation. To validate the methodology, three comparative research methods are introduced: one based on the Koschmieder law, another utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN), and a third employing a deep LSTM approach. Results indicate correlation coefficients of 0.2417, 0.3325, 0.7930, and 0.9484 for the Koschmieder law-based, CNN, deep LSTM, and the proposed method, respectively, when compared to true visibility measurements. Furthermore, the averaged root mean square estimation errors are 6539 m, 9095 m, 1600 m, and 681 m for the Koschmieder law-based, CNN, deep LSTM, and the proposed method, respectively. The data and code for this study are available at https://github.com/Z-H-XU/Benchmark-Visibility to facilitate reproducibility within the research community.},

Due to the complex urban transportation system and the large geographical area of the city, the imbalance between supply and demand becomes a common problem. To solve this problem, many studies have proposed taxi repositioning methods. However, each of two mainstream methods (region-based and taxi-based) has its own advantages and disadvantages. In this paper, we propose the RSTR model, which is a two-layer model that takes advantages of the two mainstream methods. We model the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process and design the optimization objective. To generate more accurate repositioning strategies and improve model training outcomes, we propose a many-to-many scheduling mode and demonstrate its effectiveness. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that RSTR can effectively balance supply and demand and outperform other baseline methods.},

  abstract     = {Object detection in infrared images poses a considerable challenge due to its small-scale targets, low contrast and poor signal-to-clutter ratio, often resulting in a high false alarm rate. To improve the detection accuracy on infrared small targets, we introduce Light-SGMTLM, a lightweight and saliency-guided multi-task learning model. This model integrates saliency detection into the YOLOv5x framework through a parallel multi-task learning structure and employs a joint loss function during training. Such integration significantly alleviates the impact of complex backgrounds and improves the precision of small target localization. Moreover, we have developed a streamlined module, termed SIWD, to create a more agile backbone, which establishes an optimal balance between precision and efficiency, making the model more suitable for situations with limited computational resources. Comprehensive comparative experiments were conducted on six infrared small target datasets, namely, Small-ExtIRShip, Small-SSDD, IHAST, NUAA-SIRST, IRSTD-1k, and IRDST, and we assessed the model’s performance against ten leading target detection models, such as YOLOv7, YOLOv8, DINO, and Relation-DETR. The findings reveal that our method’s unique joint learning architecture, combining saliency and object detection tasks, significantly improves accuracy for infrared small target detection. Notably, it achieved impressive mean average precision (mAP) values of 92.60% and 75.71% on the NUAA-SIRST and IRSTD-1k datasets, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Headway regularity is an essential indicator of transit reliability, directly influencing passenger waiting time and transit service quality. In this paper, we employ multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to develop a Cooperative Transit signal priority strategy with Variable phase for Headway adherence (CTVH) under a multi-intersection network. Each signalized intersection is controlled by an RL agent, which determines the next step’s signal, adapting to real-time traffic dynamics of transits and non-transits and promoting transit headway adherence. The proposed approach considers four critical aspects, i.e., complicated states with multiple conflicting bus requests, rational actions constrained by domain knowledge, comprehensive rewards balancing buses and cars, and a collaborative training scheme among agents. They are correspondingly addressed by proper state representation with estimated bus headway deviations, irrational actions masking, reward functions formulated by general traffic queue and transit headway deviation, and appropriate MARL approach with synchronous action processing. Our method also takes into account the phase transition loss by setting yellow and all-red time. Simulation results compared with the coordinated fixed-time signal (CFT) and bus holding (BH) strategy verify the merits of the proposed method in terms of improvements in transit headway adherence and influence on general traffic. Based on the results, we further discuss the BH method’s limitations due to bus bay length and various holding lines and the CTVH method’s benefits in the three-intersection environment and the entire-line network. The proposed method has a promising application in practice to improve transit reliability.},

  abstract     = {Monocular 3D object detection finds applications in various fields, notably in intelligent driving, due to its cost-effectiveness and ease of deployment. However, its accuracy significantly lags behind LiDAR-based methods, primarily because the monocular depth estimation problem is inherently challenging. While some methods leverage additional information to aid in network training and enhance performance, they are hindered by their reliance on specific datasets. We contend that many components of monocular 3D object detection lack the necessary adaptability, impeding the performance of the detector. In this paper, we propose six adaptive methods addressing issues related to network structure, loss function, and optimizer. These methods specifically target the rigid components within the detector that hinder adaptability. Simultaneously, we provide theoretical insights into the network output and propose two novel regression methods. These methods facilitate more straightforward learning for the network. Importantly, our approach does not depend on supplementary information, allowing for end-to-end training. In comparison with existing methods, our proposed approach demonstrates competitive speed and accuracy. On the KITTI dataset, our method achieves a 17.72% AP3D(IOU =0.7, Car, Moderate), outperforming all previous monocular methods. Additionally, our approach prioritizes speed, achieving a runtime of up to 52 FPS on an RTX 2080Ti GPU, surpassing all previous monocular methods.

  abstract     = {3D object detection by autonomous vehicles is integral to intelligent transportation. Existing systems often compromise essential foreground point features and local spatial interactions through random down-sampling, focusing primarily on local feature extraction. However, this neglects interactions among distant yet significant points, limiting semantic information and detection performance due to inherent point cloud data sparsity. Addressing this, our proposed Geometric Feature Aggregation and Self-Attention in a Multi-Head Transformer (GFA-SMT) architecture leverages Graph Convolutional Networks and multi-channel transformers to enhance weak semantic information of distant sparse objects. GFA-SMT comprises three modules: Distance Suppression for Local Receptive Fields (DsLRF), Geometric Feature Aggregator with Multi-head Self Attention (GFaSA), and Predicted Key-point Weighting and Refinement (PKwR). DsLRF preserves foreground features, GFaSA encodes similar features and aggregates edge features, while PKwR focuses on key-points for enhancing geometric knowledge of distant and sparse objects. Extensive experiments on KITTI, DIARV2X-I and NuScenes datasets show significant enhancements in widely used techniques, resulting in notable increases in average precision (AP) for 3D object detection: 4.08%, 5.56%, and 4.62%, respectively, on the KITTI test dataset.

Exact routes and driving behavior (speed, acceleration, etc.) can be observed, making it possible to analyze and model congestion and emissions on specific road sections. However, these advantages come with drawbacks: Raw GPS data usually only includes timestamps and coordinates and lacks information on trip purpose, transportation mode, and socio-demographics. This is one reason traffic simulation models are still primarily based on conventional travel survey data. Conventional travel surveys suffer from small sample sizes and infrequent updates. To exploit the potential of GPS data, we present a method for detecting trip purposes from raw GPS data of motorized vehicles. In contrast to previous approaches that rely on supervised machine learning and require ground truth data for training, our methodology uses only unsupervised machine learning techniques. This enables the utilization of any GPS datasets, a capability previously unavailable. The proposed method is based on the plausible assumption that especially destination areas can reveal trip purposes. We apply this methodology to analyze 170, 000 trips for Frankfurt / Germany. Initially, we segment the study area into clusters of sub-areas to condense origin and destination information, which we then integrate with other trip-related variables in a multi-phase trajectory clustering process. Our analysis identifies eight distinct trip purposes. These findings are validated by comparing them with results from the national travel survey, demonstrating the plausibility of our proposed methodology.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicles in Intelligent Transportation Systems aim to boost the adaptability performances of complex problem-solving behaviour in the Sim-to-Real self-driving mission. However, the difficulty for Sim2Real adaption is the so-called “catastrophic forgetting” challenge, i.e., the pre-training policy exposes the flaws of the inability to retain previously skill motion when generalizing to the mixed real-world scenario, which affects learning in an inefficient way. This paper could deal with the above challenge by taking advantage of reconfigurable Sim2Real policies from simpler, previously learned sub-tasks, which are superior to those of pre-defined artificial systems. Specifically, a novel reward-oriented hierarchical learning framework based on hierarchical cognitive mechanisms is proposed dedicated to Sim2Real autonomous driving. Such a learning mechanism breaks down the behavior-aware experience into two distinguished types concerning environmental rewards: basic task-agnostic background and dynamic object-specific foreground. It further reveals the intrinsic association between previously learned knowledge and multiple changing events, by utilizing goal-conditioned key skill motion tailored for specific sub-task rewards. Moreover, the reconfigurable Sim2Real rehearsal is developed to boost the efficiency of high-level policies’ generalization ability according to the reuse of the configurable skill motion via mirrored composition. Extensive validation on both simulated and real-world Sim2Real testbench of challenging autonomous driving scenarios outperforms, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed learning mechanism in improving task efficiency and handling stochasticity throughout learning.},

Existing research has focused on traditional graph neural networks, which use predefined graphs and have shared parameters. But intuitive predefined graphs introduce biases into prediction tasks and the fine-grained spatio-temporal information can not be obtained by the parameter sharing model. In this paper, we consider it is crucial to learn node-specific parameters and adaptive graphs with complete edge information. To show this, we design a model based on graph structure that decouples nodes and edges into two modules. Each module extracts temporal and spatial features simultaneously. The adaptive node optimization module is used to learn the specific parameter patterns of all nodes, and the adaptive edge optimization module aims to mine the interdependencies among different nodes.

  abstract     = {In the domain of route planning, the critical concern for travel efficiency has shifted towards optimizing travel time over distance due to the rise in congestion and the dynamic nature of modern road networks. Addressing this shift, we introduce Dynamic Route Optimization with Multi-Category Constraints (DROMC) for Point-of-Interest (POI) visits, which seeks to find the most time-efficient path that satisfies a user-defined list of requirements, considering both the spatial and temporal dimensions. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages a path enumeration algorithm, which iteratively validates the k-fastest paths until all user queries are satisfied, ensuring adherence to time constraints and POI availability. To enhance the algorithm’s efficiency, we employ several key methodologies. First, we adapt the kSP algorithm to account for POI-focused path enumeration. We also introduce a Shared Prefix Tree (SPFT) with binary encoding, which significantly improves the storage and retrieval of path information. Moreover, we integrate a grid-based heuristic for quicker computation and implement strategic pruning methods to circumvent redundant calculations and manage POI business hours effectively. Our extensive experiments on real-world networks demonstrate the algorithm’s superiority in finding more efficient paths in shorter time frames compared to existing methods.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a traffic oscillation mitigation-oriented optimal control framework for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) in a mixed traffic environment where the behavior of human-driven vehicles (HVs) is unknown. The primary objective of this framework is to alleviate traffic oscillations, thereby improving overall traffic flow. To achieve this, we introduce a novel total equilibrium spacing estimation method, incorporating stochastic parameters into a car-following model and quantifying the deviation between the mean and equilibrium spacing. This estimation, integrated with a jam-absorption driving strategy, is embedded into a Model Predictive Control (MPC) model for the objective of mitigating traffic oscillations. The efficacy of the proposed control method is evaluated through two experiments utilizing real vehicle trajectory datasets. The first experiment focuses on a single CAV, exploring the impact of key controller parameters on oscillation mitigation. Results demonstrate the optimal performance of the proposed Oscillation Mitigation-based Model Predictive Control (OM-MPC) model, even with a shorter CAV distance (e.g., 100 m), revealing a positive correlation between CAV distance and suitable preset oscillation duration. The second experiment extends the investigation to multiple stop-and-go shockwaves and varying CAV penetration rates. A comparative analysis of control models, including OM-MPC, regular MPC, and proportional-integral with saturation, is conducted based on velocity mean (VM), road segment congestion index (RI), and vehicle stop times (VST). The findings underscore the effectiveness of the proposed control method in mitigating traffic oscillations and enhancing overall traffic efficiency, establishing it as the optimal choice among the three approaches.},

IRSs are not only used to improve communication channels, but also employed as cooperative intelligent targets to enhance some objects of interest, such as vehicles and pedestrians in an intelligent transportation system. The optimal design objective function is to maximize the radar performance, while keeping the communication rate constant. The measure of radar performance is the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) of the direction of departure (DOD), which is a special capability of a collocated antenna array multiple input multiple output (MIMO) radar. The joint optimization process comprises two steps, namely the passive optimization of IRSs and the active transmit beamforming. Due to the non-convexity of the optimization problem, a solver based on semidefinite relaxation (SDR) is proposed. Simulation experiments show the ability of the proposed optimization algorithm to balance the radar performance and the communication rate.},

This study introduces a novel approach, specifically a dynamic control authority allocation method, for implementing shared control in autonomous vehicles. Unlike conventional mixed-initiative control techniques that blend human and vehicle inputs with weights determined by predefined index, the proposed method utilizes optimization-based techniques to obtain an optimal dynamic allocation for human and vehicle inputs that satisfies safety constraints. Specifically, a convex quadratic programm (QP) is constructed incorporating control barrier functions (CBF) for safety and control Lyapunov functions (CLF) for satisfying automated control objectives. The cost function of the QP is designed such that human weight increases with the magnitude of human input. A smooth control authority transition is obtained by optimizing over the change rate of the weight instead of the weight itself. The proposed method is verified in lane-changing scenarios with human-in-the-loop (HmIL) and hardware-in-the-loop (HdIL) experiments. Results show that the proposed method outperforms index-based control authority allocation method in terms of agility, safety and comfort.},

  abstract     = {Game-theoretic decision making has the potential to bring human-like reasoning skills to autonomous vehicles (AVs), fostering trust between humans and AVs. However, to make these approaches sufficiently practical for real-world use, challenges such as game complexity and incomplete information have to be addressed. Game complexity refers to the difficulties in solving a game-theoretic problem, which include solution existence, algorithm convergence, and scalability. We show in our recent work that a possible solution to overcoming these difficulties is to use potential games. However, constructing a potential game often requires specific cost function designs, limiting their broad use. To address this challenge, we propose to employ a game projection technique in this paper, relaxing the cost function design conditions and making the potential game approach applicable to broader scenarios, even including the ones that cannot be modelled as a potential game. Incomplete information refers to the ego vehicle’s lack of knowledge of other traffic agents’ cost functions. In a driving scenario, deviations of the ego vehicle assumed/estimated others’ cost functions from their actual ones are often inevitable. This necessitate the robustness analysis of a game-theoretic solution. This paper defines the robustness margin of a game solution as the maximum magnitude of cost function deviations that can be accommodated without changing the optimality of the game solution. With this definition, closed-form robustness margins are derived. Numerical studies using highway lane-changing scenarios are reported.},

Performance validations with intensive comparisons to time-triggered methods demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority in terms of tracking accuracy, channel occupancy and control optimality, in addition that extensive application to roundup scenario showcases the proposed ESSC scheme performs feasible extension to wide-range tasks.},

  abstract     = {Panoramic map construction of polar sea ice can provide significant assistance for intelligent navigation and routing planning in polar regions. Traditional methods for panoramic observation and map generation suffer from issues such as limited parallax tolerance, poor stitching robustness, and low mapping accuracy. In this paper, these problems are addressed by a proposed online panoramic method based on multi-perspective image projection and camera pose rectification. The proposed method incorporates a modified inverse projection module that dynamically adapts to the ship’s attitude, thereby stably restoring the sea-ice images into bird’s-eye view (BEV) in real-time. In order to resolve the challenging sea-ice feature alignment under significant parallax, a planar feature registration method is proposed which robustly aligns the features between the projected images. Moreover, a camera pose rectification module is specifically designed for planar projection tasks, which virtually adjusts the camera’s extrinsic parameters for obtaining more precise and high-quality panoramic sea-ice maps. Finally, online construction of global sea-ice field maps is achieved by fusing the local maps during navigation. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other panoramic methods in terms of map accuracy and stitching quality. Additionally, the proposed method is more suitable for downstream tasks, including polar simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and path planning.},

Secondly, an adaptive continuous sliding mode control is designed for height subsystem, in which integral sliding surface is established based on a continuous fast higher-order sliding mode algorithm (CFSMA). Compared with conventional finite-time high-order regulator, CFSMA can drive states to converge faster and adjust respond speed of system conveniently without complicated parameters selection.

We formulate a comprehensive mathematical model of C/T-V BACAP. To solve the problem, we propose an effective memetic algorithm with a heuristic decoding method, named HMA, which comprises three essential components: a three-stage heuristic decoding method, a clustering-based evolutionary strategy, and a target-guided local search operator. The three-stage heuristic decoding method guarantees solution feasibility and high quality through the entire optimization, allowing the following strategies to fully utilize their search capabilities. The clustering-based evolutionary strategy refines the search space and diversifies the promising candidates. Meanwhile, the target-guided local search operator rapidly optimizes the allocation for the challenging vessel. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm delivers excellent performance, especially in handling large-scale instances (up to 60 vessels). Our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art BACAP algorithms by an average margin of 150% in terms of berth offset and waiting time in most problem instances.},

Achieving 6DOF pose estimation in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-denied environments is challenging. The performance of relative 6DOF localization systems based on Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), vision, and inertial data is easily affected by environmental conditions, leading to error accumulation and a significant decrease in estimation accuracy in complex environments. To address this issue, we propose a tightly coupled framework based on nonlinear optimization for vision, LiDAR, inertial, and GNSS raw data. In the experimental section, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization factor model for GNSS data, LiDAR data, and visual data in improving position and orientation estimation accuracy through simulations. Additionally, we use real datasets to compare the proposed algorithm with several existing open-source programs in terms of computational efficiency, pose estimation accuracy, worst-case scenarios, and reliability. The experimental results show that, although the total processing time increases, the position estimation accuracy and orientation estimation accuracy of the proposed fusion algorithm improve by at least 58.0%. Overall, the proposed tightly-coupled algorithm outperforms the existing methods.},

However, how crowds navigate through invisible area between cameras in crowded environments have been overlooked. Moreover, identifying individuals across camera in a crowded environment could be challenging due to cluttered pedestrian appearance and highly uncertain movements. In this paper, we focus on recovering crowd trajectories in the invisible area of sparse camera networks within crowded public environments. We achieve better spatial-temporal feature matching by estimating the most likely travel time between segmented tracklet observations of individuals with elaborate consideration of pedestrian interactions, which reduces the dependence on unreliable appearance features. Subsequently, we recover trajectories for matched tracklets in the invisible area with a high fidelity crowd simulation model. Extensive experiments on two real-world trajectory datasets show that our proposed method is superior to existing spatial-temporal based MOT methods and improves the appearance-based MOT models in terms of association accuracy and trajectory fidelity.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel terrain-adaptive local trajectory planner designed for the autonomous operation of off-road vehicles on deformable terrains. State-of-the-art solutions either do not account for deformable terrains, or do not offer sufficient robustness or computational speed. To bridge this research gap, the paper introduces a novel model predictive control (MPC) formulation. In contrast to the prevailing state-of-the-art approaches that rely exclusively on hard or soft constraints for obstacle avoidance, the present formulation enhances robustness by incorporating both types of constraints. The effectiveness and robustness of the formulation are evaluated through extensive simulations, encompassing a wide range of randomized scenarios, and compared against state-of-the-art methods. Subsequently, the formulation is augmented with an optimal-control-oriented terramechanics model from the literature, explicitly addressing terrain deformation. Additionally, a terrain estimator employing the unscented Kalman filter is utilized to dynamically adjust the sinkage exponent online, resulting in a terrain-adaptive formulation. This formulation is tested on a physical vehicle in real world experiments against a rigid-terrain formulation as the benchmark. The results showcase the superior safety and performance achieved by the proposed formulation, underscoring the critical significance of integrating terramechanics knowledge into the planning process. Specifically, the proposed terrain-adaptive formulation achieves reduced mean absolute sideslip angle, decreased mean absolute yaw rate, shorter time to goal, and a higher success rate, primarily attributed to its enhanced understanding of terramechanics within the planner.},

  abstract     = {Although current Artificial Intelligence (AI) can detect maneuvering intentions, it often overlooks the underlying driving goals that reveal drivers’ genuine requirements. To detect real-time driving goals using AI for providing effective decision aids, this research introduces the Framework of Adaptive Driving (FAD), which considers cognitive activities and action strategies. We have outlined five driving goals to elucidate the connections between Situation Awareness (SA), and intentions. The study involved 31 participants and 573 driving simulation events, during which we collected both eye-tracking and kinetic data. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) identified 8 factors, categorized into SA and maneuver-related factors. Statistical and qualitative analysis follow up to specify the varying requirements among the driving foals defined. Generally, factor ‘Cognitive load’ can reflect cognitive activities, while ‘Saccade on the surroundings’ and ‘Saccade movement’ can indicate action strategies. For the goals where emerging risks are not a concern, ‘Active acceleration’ signifies drivers’ intention to enhance driving efficiency. However, the diverse features in ‘Saccade on the surroundings’ imply varying driving considerations. Goals for routine tasks focus on internal vehicle operations, while goals for driving benefits management highlight adjacent surroundings. Conversely, for goals addressing emerging risks, ‘Deceleration’ prevails. Furthermore, ‘Steering strategy’ implies a preference for steering when SA is adequate. In this context, SA-related factors like ‘Front observation,’ ‘Saccade movement,’ and ‘Cognitive load’ signify efforts to enhance SA under time constraints. However, for the driving goals under extreme urgency, the factor ‘Lateral movement’ replaces ‘Steering strategy’, implying severe steering without adequate SA.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle detection based on remote sensing images is widely used in urban traffic management and disaster rescue. RGB images, which are used more, lead to poor detection performance in low light conditions due to the imaging mechanism. At present, the main solution is to improve the detection performance in low light by fusing with infrared images. However, the current methods often overlook the impact of illumination changes on RGB images, and ignore the important role of high-frequency information for object detection, especially for low-light target detection. In this paper, we propose a Cross-modality and Cross-domain Low-light Detector (CCLDet) for low-light vehicle detection, including three improvements. First, an object illumination-aware module (OIAM) is proposed, which can adjust adaptively the weight of different modalities according to the object illumination intensity in the training phase and enables the detector to adapt to different lighting conditions. Second, we propose a visibility loss, which converts the position deviation into the illumination intensity deviation of each point in the object area. Compared with relying only on semantic information for object localization, the illumination makes the information that can be used for localization more abundant. Third, we design a cross-domain feature fusion module (CDFFM), which can enhance high-frequency features and enrich target information when low-frequency features are lost due to low light pollution. Extensive experiments on three challenging RGB-infrared objects detection datasets demonstrated the mAP and the parameter quantities of CCLDet over popular object detectors.},

To this end, we conducted a naturalistic driver behavior study with ten participants, collecting vehicular data and driver gaze measurements using standard sensors.

The metrological principle is formulated based on an analytical/FE model allowing the correlation of the measured signals to the local curvature deformation of the rail, and then to reconstruct the global track geometry. The effect of spatial sampling on the detection of even short-wave defects is addressed through simulations, as being a crucial trade-off between effectiveness and complexity. Experimental results performed on a first prototype demonstrate an efficient strain transfer with excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions.

By enhancing the perceptual capabilities of the model to accurately anticipate the actions of vulnerable road users, the overall driving experience can be significantly improved, ensuring higher levels of safety. Existing research efforts focusing on the prediction of pedestrians’ crossing intentions have predominantly relied on vision-based deep learning models. However, these models continue to exhibit shortcomings in terms of robustness when faced with adverse weather conditions and domain adaptation challenges. Furthermore, little attention has been given to evaluating the real-time performance of these models. To address these aforementioned limitations, this study introduces an innovative framework for pedestrian crossing intention prediction. The framework incorporates an image enhancement pipeline, which enables the detection and rectification of various defects that may arise during unfavorable weather conditions. Subsequently, a transformer-based network, featuring a self-attention mechanism, is employed to predict the crossing intentions of target pedestrians. This augmentation enhances the model’s resilience and accuracy in classification tasks. Through evaluation on the Joint Attention in Autonomous Driving (JAAD) dataset, our framework attains state-of-the-art performance while maintaining a notably low inference time. Moreover, a deployment environment is established to assess the real-time performance of the model. The results of this evaluation demonstrate that our approach exhibits the shortest model inference time and the lowest end-to-end prediction time, accounting for the processing duration of the selected inputs.},

Therefore, establishing security measures against potential threats through trust assessment and trust authentication has become a key goal. Blockchain has the characteristics of traceability, anonymity, transparency, etc., and can achieve trust authentication for trust assessment. In our work, we propose a lightweight decentralized authentication and trust management scheme for edge AI-enabled CPSs that supports access control on the basis of extended chaotic maps, which meets the privacy and security needs of data transmission in a broader sense. Moreover, we develop a trust model for checking the trustworthiness of data collected by smart devices/sensor nodes. A formal security analysis is executed by utilizing the broadly applicable real-or-random (RoR) model. Our scheme, which is different from previous methods, combines high security with relatively low communication and computational costs. Through an informal security analysis, we verify that our proposal is in compliance with the security requirements and can withstand various forms of attacks. Furthermore, the functionality and performance analysis results indicate that our method is better suited for lightweight validation in CPS networks while providing a higher level of security than other methods.},

  abstract     = {Deep graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have shown promising performance in traffic prediction tasks, but their practical deployment on resource-constrained devices faces challenges. First, few models consider the potential influence of historical and future auxiliary information, such as weather and holidays, on complex traffic patterns. Second, the computational complexity of dynamic graph convolution operations grows quadratically with the number of traffic nodes, limiting model scalability. To address these challenges, this study proposes a deep encoder-decoder model named AIMSAN, which comprises an auxiliary information-aware module (AIM) and a sparse cross-attention-based graph convolutional network (SAN). From historical or future perspectives, AIM prunes multi-attribute auxiliary data into diverse time frames, and embeds them into one tensor. SAN employs a cross-attention mechanism to merge traffic data with historical embedded data in each encoder layer, forming dynamic adjacency matrices. Subsequently, it applies diffusion GCN to capture rich spatial-temporal dynamics from the traffic data. Additionally, AIMSAN utilizes the spatial sparsity of traffic nodes as a mask to mitigate the quadratic computational complexity of SAN, thereby improving overall computational efficiency. In the decoder layer, future embedded data are fused with feed-forward traffic data to generate prediction results. Experimental evaluations on three public traffic datasets demonstrate that AIMSAN achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, while reducing GPU memory consumption by 41.24%, training time by 62.09%, and validation time by 65.17% on average.},

Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated superior decision-making capabilities in dynamic environments compared to rule-based methods. However, it requires considerable training resources due to a lack of innovative DRL component design (e.g., state space and reward) to link observation and action accurately. Its opaque nature may also result in hazardous driving conditions. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid autopilot framework that amalgamates three modules: (i) DRL is employed to build a smart, learnable, and scalable driving policy across various motorway scenarios; (ii) a kinematic-based co-pilot strategy is devised to bolster training efficiency and provide flexible decision-making guidance; and (iii) a rule-based system assesses and determines the final action outputs in real-time between itself and the DRL policy to further enhance safety. Extensive simulations are conducted under different complex motorway scenarios. The results indicate that the proposed framework surpasses the baseline DRL policy in terms of training efficiency, intelligence, safety, and reliability.},

To this end, a time-homogeneous preset-time algorithm is presented to coordinate multiple vehicles within an identical time window, where arrival time delays are used to characterize the arrival time of the vehicles. Consequently, the considered package delivery problem is formulated by two phases: “Active phase” and “Sleeping phase”, over which vehicles use the neighboring information to achieve coordination. For the proposed algorithm, we use Lyapunov based method to derive condition guaranteeing the coordination of vehicles, under a very mild communication topology condition. As an extension, a time-heterogeneous preset-time algorithm is designed. We demonstrate that coordination among vehicles is determined by the maximal preset-time. Built upon this observation, we further show that there is an equivalence between the proposed formulation and the dynamical equation of the interacting vehicles. Finally, a numerical example for a package delivery problem, comprised of two coordination phases, is carried out to illustrate the proposed preset-time coordination formulation, and the time-heterogeneous case is further discussed as well.},

  abstract     = {In urban areas, roads with dedicated cycle lanes play a vital role in cyclist safety. However, accidents can still occur when vehicles cross the cycle lane at intersections. Accidents mostly occur due to failure of the driver to see a cyclist on the cycle lane, particularly when the cyclist is going straight through the intersection, and the vehicle is turning. For safe driving, it is critical that the drivers visually scan the area in the vicinity of the junction and the car, particularly using the wing-mirror, prior to making turns. This paper describes results from a set of test drives using in-vehicle non-invasive eye-tracking and in-vehicle CAN bus sensors to determine driver behaviour. In total, 20 drivers were monitored through 5 different intersections with cycle lanes. The study found that approximately 83% of drivers did not check their wing mirror prior to, or during their turning manoeuvre, potentially putting pedestrian, cyclists, scooter and hoverboard users in danger. An algorithm was developed to analyse driver gaze during the turning manoeuvre to identify cases where they failed to look at the wing mirror. The gaze pattern and gaze concentration on the mirror helps to identify safe and unsafe driving behaviour. This information can then be used to improve Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) to create a safer environment for all road users.},

  abstract     = {Although multimodal transport has been widely developed, the multimodal transport operation system is still not as mature as other single modes of transport. Currently, the optimization of multimodal transport solutions and the allocation of capacity are planned as two separate parts, and the research on customer classification of multimodal transport is insufficient. The current bottleneck in multimodal transportation systems is optimizing multimodal customer classification and transportation solutions. Additionally, such an optimization can significantly improve the system’s overall revenue. Based on the customer classification theory of revenue management, we classified and managed multimodal transport customers and allocated and priced the transportation capacity according to the demand characteristics and price sensitivities of different customers. Furthermore, we considered the impact of transportation scheme planning on the profit of multimodal transport. Accordingly, we developed a joint optimization model for multimodal transport schemes, capacity allocation, and pricing by considering the customer classification. We solved the model using a hybrid particle swarm algorithm and validated it using arithmetic examples. The results indicate that a customer classification strategy can significantly improve the profit of multimodal transport operators when customer demand is unstable, and the total profit of the transportation system is increased by 7%. Moreover, these results suggest combining transportation solution optimization with customer classification can lead to more profitable multimodal revenue management solutions. Thus, our results can guide multimodal operators for systematically dealing with the customer classification problem and optimizing transportation schemes while improving their profits. Moreover, this study offers a reference for decision-making in multimodal operation management.},

  abstract     = {Edge collaboration is expected to effectively relieve the load of base stations and enhance the driving experience of autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, in existing edge collaboration schemes, the frequent information exchange between AVs will consume a significant amount of resources. In addition, the existing schemes ignore the types of services, where services with different types may be combined into a composite service which affects the utility of AVs. To this end, we consider various types of services in autonomous vehicular networks (AVNs) and propose a digital twin (DT)-enabled edge collaboration scheme for composite services. Specifically, we first divide the DTs of service requesters (DT-SRs) into service request groups (SRGs) based on the same basic service requests and propose an architecture to facilitate the edge collaboration between the DTs of the leaders of SRGs (DT-L-SRGs) and the DTs of the service providers (DT-SPs). In this architecture, different service composition forms will result in different resource purchase strategies for DT-L-SRGs and different resource pricing strategies for DT-SPs. Therefore, we model the process of service composition as a coalition game to determine the optimal service composition form for each basic service. In the process of the coalition game, in order to obtain the optimal resource purchase strategy for each DT-L-SRG and the optimal resource pricing strategy for each DT-SP under different coalition structures, the interaction between the DT-L-SRGs and the DT-SPs is formulated as a Stackelberg game. By obtaining the game equilibrium, the optimal strategies of each DT-L-SRG and each DT-SP can be determined to measure the performance of the given coalition structure until a stable and optimal composite service structure is finally formed through multiple rounds of iterations. Compared with traditional schemes, the simulation results demonstrate that our scheme can bring the highest utilities to both the SRs and the SPs.},

  abstract     = {Automated Vehicle (AV) safety is a critical issue and appeals to worldwide focus. To ensure AV safety, AV functions should be tested and evaluated in an enormous number of scenarios. Since such AV testing is time-consuming, scenario filters have been developed to identify safety-critical scenarios and omit ordinary ones. However, the scenarios identified by these filters do not uniquely match the AV function to be tested and are most likely not critical for the AV function. Therefore, an enhanced scenario filter is proposed in this paper. It bears the following features: 1) Automated-driving-function-specific scenario identification; 2) High coverage of critical scenarios; 3) Enhanced identification efficiency by avoiding adopting a surrogate model; 4) High reliability of critical scenario identification. To enable the above features, the proposed filter formulates the identification problem into an optimization problem and solves it with a model-free approach. Experiments have been conducted to evaluate and validate the proposed filter. The results confirm that the proposed filter is able to improve coverage of critical scenarios, efficiency of identification, and reliability of identification compared to the state-of-the-art filter. Specifically, the proposed filter improves coverage by up to 70 percent, efficiency by up to 97 percent, and reliability by up to 22 percent. The results also reveal that the proposed filter shows an increasing advantage for testing AV functions with higher complexity.},

This method is applied to calibrate two car-following control models: linear control and model predictive control (MPC). The method is likelihood-function-free, where the likelihood function is replaced by simulation to approximate the posterior distribution of model parameters. This structure affords flexibility to calibrate posterior joint distributions of complex models, even those without analytical closed forms such as MPC. Two experiments were conducted to evaluate how well the proposed method reproduces: (i) marginal and joint distributions of model parameters, using synthetic data and (ii) vehicle trajectories (acceleration, speed, and position), using field data involving two commercial adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems. The results showed that the ABC method can reproduce marginal and joint distributions reasonably well for the linear controller as well as the non-analytical MPC-based controller, which was previously infeasible. The method can also robustly characterize the commercial ACC behavior at the trajectory level, which suggests that the simple linear controller better describes their behavior.},

  abstract     = {VSLAM is one of the key technologies for indoor mobile robots, used to perceive the surrounding environment, achieve accurate positioning and mapping. However, traditional VSLAM algorithms based on the assumption of a static environment still face certain challenges. The movement, occlusion, and appearance changes of dynamic objects can lead to feature point-matching errors, making data association difficult and causing biases in motion estimation. In order to address this challenge, this paper proposes a dynamic feature point removal method and a closed-loop detection method for high dynamic scenes, aiming to effectively improve the robustness and positioning accuracy in dynamic environments. First, the YOLOv7-tiny object detection network and LK optical flow algorithm are combined to detect the dynamic area, and the adaptive threshold keyframe selection method is adopted to solve the problem of poor quality of keyframe caused by the existing heuristic threshold selection method. Then, this paper proposes a dynamic keyframe sequence creation method based on the angle difference between keyframes, which reduces the workload of loop back detection and accelerates the efficiency of loop back detection in the system. Next, the ParC_NetVLAD image matching algorithm is proposed. In this paper, ConvNeXt-Tiny network is used for feature extraction of images, and ParC-Net network and CBAM attention mechanism are added to the feature extraction network. Finally, NetVLAD is used to cluster the extracted local features to obtain global features that can represent images. Experiments are conducted on public TUM RGB-D datasets and in real-world situations. The proposed algorithm reduces the ATE (Absolute Trajectory Error) by 96.4% and the RPE (Relative Trajectory Error) by 82.8% on average in highly dynamic scenarios. In the Pittsburgh30k dataset, the average accuracy of loop closure detection has been improved by 2.6%.},

  abstract     = {Traffic state prediction, a classical task for traffic management, is a central component of intelligent transport systems to maintain safe and efficient operation. While extensive and intensive research has been conducted on traffic state prediction, most studies have concentrated on enhancing the accuracy of specific traffic state parameters. However, traffic state is a co-evolutionary multivariate time series with various parameters such as flow, velocity, occupancy, etc. At the same time, traffic state data will inevitably be lost during collection. So accurate traffic prediction still faces the following challenges: First, how to deal with the complex missing situations in observational data? Second, how to learn the co-evolutionary relationships between different traffic state parameters while mining the high-dimensional spatio-temporal traffic state patterns? In this paper, we propose a mechanism-data blending-driven co-evolving traffic state parameter prediction method: multi-parameter hybrid tensor deep learning networks (MHT-Net), which consists of a multi-parameter tensor graph convolutional network (MTGCN) and a tensor recurrent neural network (T-RNN). MTGCN implements knowledge embedding of synergistic mechanisms between traffic parameters, ensuring that the road network spatial dependency and the synergistic influence relationship of the parameters can be obtained simultaneously; T-RNN is used to learn high-dimensional temporal features of traffic states. Experiment results on a real-world dataset from Jiangsu province outperform the state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed method and providing an effective tool for traffic state prediction with missing values. A mechanism-data blending driven co-evolving traffic state parameter prediction method, multi-parameters hybrid tensor deep learning networks (MHT-Net) is proposed, which implements knowledge embedding of synergistic mechanisms between traffic parameters and learn the road network spatial dependency and the synergistic influence relationship of the parameters simultaneously.

Although some traditional ground segmentation algorithms are available to remove ground point clouds, they usually suffer from over-segmentation, which leads to a sub-optimal and even worse performance for the downstream 3D detection task. We conduct an in-depth analysis and attribute this phenomenon to the reason that some crucial foreground points attached to the ground (e.g., the wheels of Cars, or the feet of Pedestrians) are directly removed due to over-segmentation. To this end, we propose a new Attached Point Restoring (APR) module to recover these discarded foreground points. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of APR by integrating it into various ground segmentation algorithms to boost the performance or the running time of 3D detection on KITTI and Waymo datasets.

In real life, user behavior usually has a certain directionality, so they may want to obtain the result object that conforms to a specific direction, which is what the direction-constrained query studies. In addition, query time information also plays an important role in location-based query processing. To this end, this paper takes the lead in studying the Time-aware and Direction-constrained Collective Spatial Keyword Query (TDCoSKQ). To facilitate direction-related operations, space objects are organized using the polar coordinate system. Firstly, an efficient space partition method is designed, and on this basis, a new hybrid index structure KRPQT is designed. Based on KRPQT, several pruning strategies are proposed to prune irrelevant regions and objects from the perspective of keyword, time, and direction, and the basic algorithm KRPQB is proposed. To further improve the efficiency of query processing, the possible areas of the result objects are analyzed and shrunk to greatly reduce the number of candidate objects, and three optimization algorithms KRPSW, KRPSW+LFO, and KRPSW+KRPQB are proposed. Then, we discuss how to extend the proposed methods to deal with TDCoSKQ queries with other distance functions and TDCoSKQ queries with weight objects.

  abstract     = {Binocular stereo matching is a crucial task in autonomous driving for accurately estimating the depth information of objects and scenes. This task, however, is challenging due to various ill-posed regions within binocular image pairs, such as repeated textures and weak textures which present complex correspondences between the points. Existing methods extract features from binocular input images mainly by relying on deep convolutional neural networks with a substantial number of convolutional layers, which may incur high memory and computation costs, thus making it hard to deploy in real-world applications. Additionally, previous methods do not consider the correlation between view unary features during the construction of the cost volume, thus leading to inferior results. To address these issues, a novel lightweight binocular-separated feature extraction module is proposed that includes a view-shared multi-dilation fusion module and a view-specific feature extractor. Our method leverages a shallow neural network with a multi-dilation modeling module to provide similar receptive fields as deep neural networks but with fewer parameters and better computational efficiency. Furthermore, we propose incorporating the correlations of view-shared features to dynamically select view-specific features during the construction of the cost volume. Extensive experiments conducted on two public benchmark datasets show that our proposed method outperforms the deep model-based baseline method (i.e., 13.6% improvement on Scene Flow and 2.0% on KITTI 2015) while using 29.7% fewer parameters. Ablation experiments show that our method achieves superior matching performance in weak texture and edge regions. The source code will be made publicly available.},

  abstract     = {Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) aims to reconstruct the reward function from expert demonstrations to facilitate policy learning, and has demonstrated its remarkable success in imitation learning. To promote expert-like behavior, existing IRL methods mainly focus on learning global reward functions to minimize the trajectory difference between the imitator and the expert. However, these global designs are still limited by the redundant noise and error propagation problems, leading to the unsuitable reward assignment and thus downgrading the agent capability in complex multi-stage tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel Curricular Subgoal-based Inverse Reinforcement Learning (CSIRL) framework, that explicitly disentangles one task with several local subgoals to guide agent imitation. Specifically, CSIRL firstly introduces decision uncertainty of the trained agent over expert trajectories to dynamically select specific states as subgoals, which directly determines the exploration boundary of different task stages. To further acquire local reward functions for each stage, we customize a meta-imitation objective based on these curricular subgoals to train an intrinsic reward generator. Experiments on the D4RL and autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed methods yields results superior to the state-of-the-art counterparts, as well as better interpretability. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Plankson/CSIRL.},

  abstract     = {The dynamics simulation of complex railway vehicles requires a dedicated vehicle model, such as multi-body dynamics model. However, the multi-body model is time-consuming in long-distance simulation due to its computational complexity. This issue can be alleviated by using a data-driven vehicle dynamics model due to its effective generalization and computational speed. Firstly, the construction of the physical model of the vehicle system is carried out to obtain the coupling relationship between the components. Secondly, the coupling relationship between the components is embedded into the loss function of the deep neural network as physics-informed constraints. Further, the network parameters satisfying certain physical laws are obtained by minimizing the loss function. Finally, the proposed lightweight 3D convolutional neural network is used to predict the vibration state of the vehicle system. The dynamic response resulting from both the data-driven simulation model and the multi-body simulation model are investigated and compared. The simulation results show that the data-driven dynamics simulation model can accurately predict the vibration state of the vehicle system. The data-driven simulation model has smaller size and faster operation speed, which can be applied to long-distance prediction research of vehicle systems.},

This study proposes a systematic approach for Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)-based vehicle trajectory prediction, leveraging LSTM networks to predict vehicle trajectories and employing Bayesian optimization to automatically search for optimal hyperparameter values related to both the training scheme and LSTM architectures. In the experimental study, a custom vehicle trajectory dataset extracted from roadside LiDAR data, along with the V2X-Seq-TFD dataset, was utilized for network training and testing. The optimal LSTM network obtained through Bayesian optimization was compared against two benchmark models: a handcrafted LSTM network and a Kalman filter with a 2D constant velocity motion model. The results demonstrate that the proposed deep learning-based framework, with robust hyperparameter selection through Bayesian optimization, yields more accurate and consistent prediction performance than the benchmark models.},

A comprehensive human-vehicle system model is built, including vehicle dynamics, the SBW model, and the driver’s arm neuromuscular dynamics model, as a foundation for controller design. An expert driver model based on a multi-layer feed-forward neural network (MLFN) is developed to generate the reference steering angle for haptic assistance design. The individual driver’s arm characteristics are identified and incorporated into the adaptive haptic assistance controller design to generate personalized torque assistance, facilitating a typical driver to achieve the same trajectory-tracking performance as experts. The nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode (NFTSM) is applied to calculate the assistance torque to ensure the fast finite-time convergence and robustness of the system. Simulations and driver-in-the-loop experiments are conducted, with results showing that the proposed haptic assistance controller can help drivers complete the trajectory-tracking task by providing personalized torque assistance while reducing their steering workload.},

AR can considerably improve the driving experience by increasing the driver’s situational awareness. AR can only work if stable and realistic holograms are generated. The process of generating the holograms so that they appear in a specific position in the world is also known as image registration. Since AR devices employ see-through Head-Mounted Displays, realistic image registration requires high-accuracy head tracking. Solutions exist in static environments where state-of-the-art simultaneous localization and mapping algorithms suffice. Vehicles are more challenging. In aerospace, costly optical-inertial tracking systems are regularly employed. This paper focuses instead on low-cost ground vehicles and proposes a solution that does not require aerospace-grade Inertial Measurement Units and is easily integrable on cars. The proposed solution, tested on a racing circuit, is based on passive markers and on the stereoscopic detection of the road plane on which the AR features are anchored.},

  abstract     = {Drowsy driving is one of the greatest threats to road safety, which increases the importance of intelligent systems that can monitor driver drowsiness. Electroencephalogram (EEG)–based monitoring systems have gained attention because EEG is known to directly measure brain activities that reflect the mental state of the driver. However, calibration is necessary before using the system because EEG signals vary between and within subjects. Therefore, generalized EEG-based drowsiness estimation has become challenging. In this paper, we propose an EEG-based driver drowsiness classification framework without the need for calibration, which can be generalized to unseen subjects. We augment the features of unseen domains (i.e., subjects) with a Dirichlet mixup between prototypes of source domains to complement other domain knowledge. The parameter $\boldsymbol {\alpha }$ vector of the Dirichlet distribution adjusts the intensity of the mixup, allowing for diverse enhancement. Furthermore, we utilize an auxiliary batch normalization module for augmented samples to avoid inaccurate estimation by the difference in distribution. The experiments were carried out using two EEG datasets, each measured using different drowsiness indicators, the Karolinska sleepiness scale, and reaction time. In leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, the proposed framework achieved outstanding performance in both datasets, an ${F}1$ -score of 62.69% and 70.33% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 71.73% and 73.80%, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate the potential for practical applications of brain-computer interfaces without calibration.},

  abstract     = {The safety and efficiency of an Autonomous Vehicle (AV) manoeuvre planning heavily depend on the future trajectories of surrounding vehicles. If an AV can predict its surrounding vehicles’ future trajectories, it can make safe and efficient manoeuvre decisions. In this paper, we present a Deep Spatio-Temporal Context-Aware decision Network (DST-CAN) for predictive manoeuvre decisions for AVs on highways. DST-CAN has two main components, namely spatio-temporal context-aware map generator and predictive manoeuvre decisions engine. DST-CAN employ a memory neuron network to predict the future trajectories of its surrounding vehicles. Using look-ahead prediction and past actual trajectories, a spatio-temporal context-aware probability occupancy map is generated. These context-aware maps as input to a decision engine generate a safe and efficient manoeuvre decision. Here, CNN helps extract feature space, and two fully connected network generates longitudinal and lateral manoeuvre decisions. Performance evaluation of DST-CAN has been carried out using two publicly available NGSIM US-101 and I-80 highway datasets. A traffic rule is defined to generate ground truths for these datasets in addition to human decisions. Two DST-CAN models are trained using imitation learning with human driving decisions from actual traffic data and rule-based ground truth decisions. The performances of the DST-CAN models are compared with the state-of-the-art Convolutional Social-LSTM (CS-LSTM) models for manoeuvre prediction. The results clearly indicate that the context-aware maps help DST-CAN to predict the decision accurately over CS-LSTM. Further, an ablation study has been carried out to understand the effect of prediction horizons of performance and a robustness study to understand the near collision scenarios over actual traffic observations. The context-aware map with a 3 second prediction horizon is robust against near collision.},

  abstract     = {Detecting small objects in optical images and videos is a significant challenge in numerous intelligent transportation and autonomous systems. State-of-the-art generic object detection methods fail to accurately localize and identify such small objects (e.g., pedestrians, small vehicles, obstacles). Because small objects occupy only a small area in the input image (e.g., $32 \times 32$ pixels or less), the information extracted from such a small area is not always rich enough to support decision-making. Multidisciplinary strategies are being developed by researchers working at the interface of deep learning and computer vision to enhance the performance of Small Object Detection (SOD). In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of over 160 research papers published between 2017 and 2022 in order to survey this growing subject. This paper summarizes the existing literature and provides a taxonomy that illustrates the broad picture of current research. We further explore methods to boost the performance of small object detection in maritime settings, where enhanced performance is crucial for ensuring safety and managing traffic. Detecting small objects in the maritime environment requires additional considerations and the current survey aims to review the advanced techniques addressing those aspects. In addition, the popular SOD datasets for generic and maritime applications are discussed, and also well-known evaluation metrics for the state-of-the-art methods on some of the datasets are provided.

Traditional supervised learning methods learn features of web attacks with large amounts of high-confidence labeled data, which are extremely expensive in the real world. Pre-trained models offer a novel solution with their ability to learn generic features on large unlabeled datasets. However, designing and deploying a pre-trained model for real-world web attack detection remains challenges. In this paper, we present a pre-trained model for web attack detection, including a pre-processing module, a pre-training module, and a deployment scheme. Our model significantly improves classification performance on several web attack detection datasets. Moreover, we deploy the model in real-world systems and show its potential for industrial applications.},

  abstract     = {Spatiotemporal trajectories are sequences of timestamped locations, which enable a variety of analyses that in turn enable important real-world applications. It is common to map trajectories to vectors, called embeddings, before subsequent analyses. Thus, the qualities of embeddings are very important. Methods for pre-training embeddings, which leverage unlabeled trajectories for training universal embeddings, have shown promising applicability across different tasks, thus attracting considerable interest. However, research progress on this topic faces two key challenges: a lack of a comprehensive overview of existing methods, resulting in several related methods not being well-recognized, and the absence of a unified pipeline, complicating the development of new methods and the analysis of methods. We present UniTE, a survey and a unified pipeline for this domain. In doing so, we present a comprehensive list of existing methods for pre-training trajectory embeddings, which includes methods that either explicitly or implicitly employ pre-training techniques. Further, we present a unified and modular pipeline with publicly available underlying code, simplifying the process of constructing and evaluating methods for pre-training trajectory embeddings. Additionally, we contribute a selection of experimental results using the proposed pipeline on real-world datasets.},

Early works in this domain mainly focus on studying the graph isomorphism recognition ability of GNNs, and recent works try to leverage the properties such as subgraph counting and connectivity learning to characterize the expressive power of GNNs, which are more practical and closer to real-world. However, no survey papers and open-source repositories comprehensively summarize and discuss models in this important direction. To fill the gap, we conduct a first survey for models for enhancing expressive power under different forms of definition.

  abstract     = {The incorporation of target distribution significantly enhances the success of deep clustering. However, most of the related deep clustering methods suffer from two drawbacks: (1) manually-designed target distribution functions with uncertain performance and (2) cluster misassignment accumulation. To address these issues, a Self-Correcting Clustering (Self-CC) framework is proposed. In Self-CC, a robust target distribution solver (RTDS) is designed to automatically predict the target distribution and alleviate the adverse influence of misassignments. Specifically, RTDS divides the high confidence samples selected according to the cluster assignments predicted by a clustering module into labeled samples with correct pseudo labels and unlabeled samples of possible misassignments by modeling its training loss distribution. With the divided data, RTDS can be trained in a semi-supervised way. The critical hyperparameter which controls the semi-supervised training process can be set adaptively by estimating the distribution property of misassignments in the pseudo-label space with the support of a theoretical analysis. The target distribution can be predicted by the well-trained RTDS automatically, optimizing the clustering module and correcting misassignments in the cluster assignments. The clustering module and RTDS mutually promote each other forming a positive feedback loop. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Self-CC.},

These segmented sequence data are characterized by short length, varying local dependencies, and coarse-grained unit states. These characteristics limit the effectiveness of conventional probabilistic graphical models and attention-based or recurrent neural networks in modeling and analyzing segmented sequence data. To address this gap, we introduce a novel generative model for segmented sequences, employing an ensemble of multiple variable-order Markov models (VOMMs) to flexibly represent state transition dependencies. Our approach integrates probabilistic graphical models with neural networks, surpassing the representation capabilities of single high-order or variable-order Markov models. Compared to end-to-end deep learning models, our method offers improved interpretability and reduces overfitting in short segments. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method in two tasks: predicting tennis shot types and forecasting daily action sequences. These applications highlight the broad applicability of our segmented sequence modeling approach across diverse domains.},

  abstract     = {Modern machine learning (ML) models have grown to a scale where training them on a single machine becomes impractical. As a result, there is a growing trend to leverage federated learning (FL) techniques to train large ML models in a distributed and collaborative manner. These models, however, when deployed on new devices, might struggle to generalize well due to domain shifts. In this context, federated domain adaptation (FDA) emerges as a powerful approach to address this challenge. Most existing FDA approaches typically focus on aligning the distributions between source and target domains by minimizing their (e.g., MMD) distance. Such strategies, however, inevitably introduce high communication overheads and can be highly sensitive to network reliability. In this paper, we introduce RF-TCA, an enhancement to the standard Transfer Component Analysis approach that significantly accelerates computation without compromising theoretical and empirical performance. Leveraging the computational advantage of RF-TCA, we further extend it to FDA setting with FedRF-TCA. The proposed FedRF-TCA protocol boasts communication complexity that is independent of the sample size, while maintaining performance that is either comparable to or even surpasses state-of-the-art FDA methods. We present extensive experiments to showcase the superior performance and robustness (to network condition) of FedRF-TCA.},

Graph-based models for detecting malicious domains have shown high performance but are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. To address this issue, we propose RMD-Graph, which is characterized by its ability to resist adversarial attacks and its low dependency on labeled data. A dual denoising module is specifically designed based on two autoencoders to generate the reconstructed graph, where SVD, TOP-k and reconstruction loss are introduced to enhance the denoising capability of autoencoders. Subsequently, residual connections are employed to generate an optimized graph that retains essential information from the original graph. The reconstructed graph and the optimized graph are then utilized as two views for graph contrastive learning, thereby achieving an self-supervised representation learning task without labels. In the downstream malicious domain detection, the denoised node representations are employed for machine learning classification. Extensive experiments are conducted on publicly available DNS datasets, and the results demonstrate that RMD-Graph significantly outperforms known baseline methods, especially in adversarial scenarios.},

Graph structures formed by rich user interactions naturally serve as important clues for identifying fraudsters. While numerous graph neural network-based methods have been proposed, the diverse interactive connections within graphs and the heterophilic connections deliberately established by fraudsters to normal users as camouflage pose new research challenges. In this light, we propose H2IDE (Homophily and Heterophily Identification with Disentangled Embeddings) for accurate fraud detection in multi-relation graphs. H2IDE features in an independence-constrained disentangled representation learning scheme to capture various latent behavioral patterns in graphs, along with a supervised identification task to specifically model the factor-wise heterophilic connections, both of which are proven crucial to fraud detection. We also design a relation-aware attention mechanism for hierarchical and adaptive neighborhood aggregation in H2IDE. Extensive comparative experiments with state-of-the-art baseline methods on two real-world multi-relation graphs and two large-scale homogeneous graphs demonstrate the superiority and scalability of our proposed method and highlight the key role of disentangled representation learning with homophily and heterophily identification.},

State-of-the-art (SOTA) methods learn an adaptive graph from user trajectories and compute POI representations using graph neural networks (GNNs). However, a single graph cannot capture the diverse dependencies among the POIs (e.g., geographical proximity and transition frequency). To tackle this limitation, we propose the Adaptive Graph Contrastive Learning (AGCL) framework. AGCL constructs multiple adaptive graphs, each modeling a kind of POI dependency and producing one POI representation; and the POI representations from different graphs are merged into a multi-facet representation that encodes comprehensive information. To train the POI representations, we tailor a graph-based contrastive learning, which encourages the representations of similar POIs to align and dissimilar POIs to differentiate. Moreover, to learn the sequential regularities of user trajectories, we design an attention mechanism to integrate spatial-temporal information into the POI representations. An explicit spatial-temporal bias is also employed to adjust the predictions for enhanced accuracy. We compare AGCL with 10 state-of-the-art baselines on 3 datasets. The results show that AGCL outperforms all baselines and achieves an improvement of 10.14% over the best performing baseline in average accuracy.},

First, labeled network data, which are required for training most GNNs, are expensive to obtain. Second, existing methods are sub-optimal in preserving comprehensive topological information, including structural and positional information. Finally, most GNN approaches ignore the rich node content information. To address these challenges, we propose a self-supervised Network-to-Network framework (Net2Net) to learn semantically meaningful node representations. Our framework employs a pretext task of node position prediction (PosPredict) to effectively fuse the topological and content knowledge into low-dimensional embeddings for every node in a semi-supervised manner. Specifically, we regard a network as node content and position networks, where Net2Net aims to learn the mapping between them. We utilize a multi-layer recursively composable encoder to integrate the content and topological knowledge into the egocentric network node embeddings. Furthermore, we design a cross-modal decoder to map the egocentric node embeddings into their node position identities (PosIDs) in the node position network. Extensive experiments on eight diverse networks demonstrate the superiority of Net2Net over comparable methods.},

We propose a new optimization problem, Revenue Maximization of Multi-Grade Product(RMMGP), to simultaneously determine pricing, seed selection, and coupon distribution for multi-grade products with both promotional and competitive relationships between grades in order to maximize revenue through viral marketing. We prove the hardness and inapproximability of RMMGP and show that the revenue function is not monotone or submodular. To solve RMMGP, we design an approximation algorithm, namely Data-Dependent Revenue Maximization (DDRM), and propose the Pricing-Seeding-Coupon allocation (PriSCa) algorithm, which uses the concepts of Worth Receiving Probability, Pricing-Promotion Alternating Framework, and Independent/Holistic Customer-Grade Determinant sets. Our experiments on real social networks, using valuation distributions from Amazon.com, demonstrate that PriSCa and DDRM achieve on average 1.5 times higher revenue than state-of-the-art approaches. Additionally, PriSCa is efficient and scalable on large datasets.},

Additionally, they use ordinary graphs to model one-to-one item correlations in the current session and fail to leverage other sessions to learn richer higher-order item correlations. To address these issues, a multi-behavior hypergraph contrastive learning model for session-based recommendations is proposed. This model represents all the sessions as global hypergraphs according to two types of behavior sequences. It employs contrastive learning to obtain global item embeddings, which are further aggregated to generate a global session representation that captures higher-order correlations of items from all session perspectives. A novel local heterogeneous hypergraph is designed for the current session to capture higher-order correlations between items with different behaviors in the current session, thus enhancing the local session representation. Additionally, a novel self-supervised signal is created by constructing a multi-behavior line graph, enhancing the global session representation. Finally, the local session representation, global session representation, and global item embedding are used to learn the predicted interaction probability of each item. Extensive experiments are conducted on three real datasets, and the results demonstrate that the proposed model significantly improves recommendation accuracy.},

MimoSketch consists of an algorithm design and a policy to schedule items to nodes. MimoSketch&#39;s algorithm applies random counting to preserve a mathematically proven unbiasedness property, which makes it friendly to the aggregate query on multiple nodes; its memory layout is dynamically adaptive to the runtime item size distribution, which maximizes the estimation accuracy by storing more items. MimoSketch&#39;s scheduling policy balances items among nodes, avoiding nodes being overloaded or underloaded, which improves the overall mining accuracy.

  abstract     = {Maximizing Influence (Max-Inf) query is a fundamental operation in spatial data management. This query returns an optimal site from a candidate set to maximize its influence. Existing work commonly focuses on outdoor spaces. In practice, however, people spend up to 87% of their daily life inside indoor spaces. The outdoor techniques fall short in indoor spaces due to the complicated topology of indoor spaces. In this paper, we formulate two indoor Max-Inf queries: Top-$k$&lt;mml:math xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;mml:mi&gt;k&lt;/mml:mi&gt;&lt;/mml:math&gt; Probabilistic Influence Query (T$k$&lt;mml:math xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;mml:mi&gt;k&lt;/mml:mi&gt;&lt;/mml:math&gt;PI) and Collective-$k$&lt;mml:math xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;mml:mi&gt;k&lt;/mml:mi&gt;&lt;/mml:math&gt; Probabilistic Influence Query (C$k$&lt;mml:math xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;mml:mi&gt;k&lt;/mml:mi&gt;&lt;/mml:math&gt;PI) taking probability and mobility factors into consideration. We propose a novel spatial index, IT-tree, which utilizes the properties of indoor venues to facilitate the indoor distance computation, and then applies a trie to further organize the trajectories with similar check-in partitions together, based on their sketch information. This structure is simple but highly effective in pruning the trajectory search space. To process T$k$PI efficiently, we devise subtree pruning and progressive pruning techniques to delicately filter out unnecessary trajectories based on probability bounds and the monotonicity of influence probability. For C$k$PI queries, which is a submodular NP-hard problem, three approximation algorithms are provided with different strategies of computing marginal influence value during the search. Through extensive experiments on several real indoor venues, we demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Geo-Indistinguishability (GI) is a powerful privacy model that can effectively protect location information by limiting the ability of an attacker to infer a user&#39;s true location. In real life, locations usually have different sensitive levels in terms of privacy; for example, shopping malls might be low-sensitive while home addresses might be high-sensitive for users. But the GI model does not consider the various sensitive levels of locations, and implements the same perturbation on all locations to meet the highest privacy requirement. This would cause overprotection of low-sensitive locations and reduce data utility. To strike a good balance between privacy and utility, in this paper, we propose a novel privacy notion, termed Location-Discriminative Geo-Indistinguishability (LDGI), which takes into account different sensitive levels of location privacy. With LDGI model, we then develop a perturbation scheme called EM-LDGI based on the exponential mechanism, and an advance scheme MinQL to further enhance data utility. To improve the efficiency of the proposed schemes, we design a scheme MinQL-S with the assistance of the spanner graph, at the cost of a slight utility degradation. We theoretically analyze that the proposed schemes satisfy LDGI and evaluate their performance by extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets. The comparison with GI mechanisms demonstrates the advantages of the LDGI model.},

  abstract     = {Causal feature selection has recently received increasing attention in machine learning and data mining, especially in the era of Big Data. Existing causal feature selection algorithms select unique causal features of the single class label as the optimal feature subset. However, a single class label usually has multiple classes, and it is unreasonable to select the same causal features for different classes of a single class label. To address this problem, we employ the class-specific mutual information to evaluate the causal information carried by each class of the single class label, and theoretically analyze the unique relationship between each class and the causal features. Based on this, a Label-aware Causal Feature Selection algorithm (LaCFS) is proposed to identifies the causal features for each class of the class label. Specifically, LaCFS uses the pairwise comparisons of class-specific mutual information and the size of class-specific mutual information values from the perspective of each class, and follows a divide-and-conquer framework to find causal features. The correctness and application condition of LaCFS are theoretically proved, and extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency and superiority of LaCFS compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {Hyperbolic space based collaborative filtering has emerged as a popular topic in recommender systems. Compared to the euclidean space, hyperbolic space is more suitable to the tree-like structures in the user-item interactions and can achieve better recommender performance. Although some works have been devoted to this popular topic and made some progresses, they use tangent space as an approximation of hyperbolic space to implement model. Despite the effectiveness, such methods fail to fully exploit the advantages of hyperbolic space and still suffer from the data sparsity issue, which severely limits the recommender performance. To tackle these problems, we refer to the self-supervised learning technique and novelly propose a Hyperbolic Graph Contrastive Learning (HyperCL) framework. Specifically, our framework encodes the augmentation views from both the tangent space and the hyperbolic space, and construct the contrast pairs based on their corresponding learned node representations. Our model not only leverages the geometric advantages of both sides but also achieves seamless information transmission between the two spaces. Extensive experimental results on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model is highly competitive and outperforms leading baselines by considerable margins. Further experiments validate the robustness and the superiority of contrastive learning paradigm.},

Advertisers employ strategic bidding to optimize their advertising impact while adhering to various financial constraints, such as the return-on-investment (ROI) and cost-per-click (CPC). Primarily focusing on bidding with fixed budget constraints, traditional approaches cannot effectively manage the dynamic budget allocation problem where the goal is to achieve global optimization of bidding performance across multiple channels with a shared budget. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for multi-channel bidding optimization. In this framework, the top-level strategy applies a CPC constrained diffusion model to dynamically allocate budgets among the channels according to their distinct features and complex interdependencies, while the bottom-level strategy adopts a state-action decoupled actor-critic method to address the problem of extrapolation errors in offline learning caused by out-of-distribution actions and a context-based meta-channel knowledge learning method to improve the state representation capability of the policy based on the shared knowledge among different channels. Comprehensive experiments conducted on a large scale real-world industrial dataset from the Meituan ad bidding platform demonstrate that our method achieves a state-of-the-art performance.},

  abstract     = {Privacy concerns in recommender systems are potentially addressed due to constitutional and commercial requirements. Centralized recommendation models are susceptible to poisoning attacks, which threaten their integrity. In this context, federated learning has emerged as an optimal solution to privacy concerns. However, recent investigations proved that Federated Recommender Systems (FedRS) are also vulnerable to model poisoning attacks. Existing attack possibilities highlighted in academic literature require a large fraction of Byzantine clients to effectively influence the training process, which is unrealistic for practical systems with millions of users. Additionally, most attack models neglected the role of the defense mechanism running at the aggregation server. To this end, we propose a novel undetectable hidden attack strategy (HidAttack) for FedRS, aiming to raise the exposure ratio of targeted items with minimum Byzantine clients. To achieve this goal, we construct a cluster of baseline attacks, on top of which a bandit model is designed that intelligently infers effective poisoned gradients. It ensures a diverse pattern of poisoned gradients and therefore, Byzantine clients cannot be distinguished from benign clients by the defense mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that: 1) our attack model significantly increases the target item&#39;s exposure rate covertly without compromising the recommendation accuracy and 2) the current defenses are insufficient, emphasizing the need for better security improvements against our model poisoning attack to FedRS.},

To address this issue, we introduce a novel neural-symbolic model for entity linking, which is inspired by the symbol-manipulation mechanism in human brains. Specifically, we abstract diverse features into unified variables, then combine them using neural operators to capture diverse relevance requirements, and finally aggregate relevance scores through voting. We conduct experiments on eleven benchmark datasets with different types of text, and the results show that our method outperforms nearly all baselines.

In this study, we propose a fuzzy rough sets-based multi-scale outlier detection method to identify various types of outliers. Specifically, a novel fuzzy rough sets-based method that integrates relative fuzzy granule density is first introduced to improve the capability of detecting local outliers. Then, a multi-scale view generation method based on granular-ball computing is proposed to collaboratively identify group outliers at different levels of granularity. Moreover, reliable outliers and inliers determined by the three-way decision are used to train a weighted support vector machine to further improve the performance of outlier detection. The proposed method innovatively transforms unsupervised outlier detection into a semi-supervised classification problem and for the first time explores the fuzzy rough sets-based outlier detection from the perspective of multi-scale granular balls, allowing for high adaptability to different types of outliers. Extensive experiments carried out on both artificial and UCI datasets demonstrate that the proposed outlier detection method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, improving the results by at least 8.48% in terms of the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUROC) index.},

  abstract     = {Class imbalance learning is a challenging task in machine learning applications. To balance training data, traditional class imbalance learning approaches, such as class resampling or reweighting, are commonly applied in the literature. However, these methods can have significant limitations, particularly in the presence of noisy data, missing values, or when applied to advanced learning paradigms like semi-supervised or federated learning. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel and theoretically-ensured latent Feature Rectification method for clAss iMbalance lEarning (FRAME). The proposed FRAME can automatically learn multiple centroids for each class in the latent space and then perform class balancing. Unlike data-level methods, FRAME balances feature in the latent space rather than the original space. Compared to algorithm-level methods, FRAME can distinguish different classes based on distance without the need to adjust the learning algorithms. Through latent feature rectification, FRAME can effectively mitigate contaminated noises/missing values without worrying about structural variations in the data. In order to accommodate a wider range of applications, this paper extends FRAME to the following three main learning paradigms: fully-supervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and federated learning. Extensive experiments on 10 binary-class datasets demonstrate that our FRAME can achieve competitive performance than the state-of-the-art methods and its robustness to noises/missing values.},

  abstract     = {Pre-training GNNs to extract transferable knowledge and apply it to downstream tasks has become the de facto standard of graph representation learning. Recent works focused on designing self-supervised pre-training tasks to extract useful and universal transferable knowledge from large-scale unlabeled data. However, they have to face an inevitable question: traditional pre-training strategies that aim at extracting useful information about pre-training tasks, may not extract all useful information about the downstream task. In this paper, we reexamine the pre-training process within traditional pre-training and fine-tuning frameworks from the perspective of Information Bottleneck (IB) and confirm that the forgetting phenomenon in pre-training phase may cause detrimental effects on downstream tasks. Therefore, we propose a novel Delayed Bottlenecking Pre-training (DBP) framework which maintains as much as possible mutual information between latent representations and training data during pre-training phase by suppressing the compression operation and delays the compression operation to fine-tuning phase to make sure the compression can be guided with labeled fine-tuning data and downstream tasks. To achieve this, we design two information control objectives that can be directly optimized and further integrate them into the actual model design. Extensive experiments on both chemistry and biology domains demonstrate the effectiveness of DBP.},

  abstract     = {Conversational recommendation is one system that can extract the user&#39;s preferences and recommend suitable items in a similar way to human-like responses. Existing methods often use the feature extraction combined with the Transformer model to extract user preferences and make recommendations. However, these methods have two limitations. First, they do not consider the order in which entities appear, thus affecting the extraction of user preferences. Second, the generated responses lack diversity that affects the users’ experience to the system. To this end, we propose a conversational recommendation model with User Entity focus and Multi-Granularity latent variable enhancement (UEMG). In UEMG, we design a novel neural network that utilizes Bi-GRU to capture the appearing orders of entities in dialogues, and leverages Transformer to capture the global dependencies of entities, and then combines them to extract user preferences. For the second issue, to improve the diversity of dialogue generation, we propose a multi-granularity latent variable mechanism, which can extract more entities from the context information and the knowledge graphs, respectively. We conducted extensive experiments on publicly available dialogue generation datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to current state-of-the-art methods, UEMG achieves 9.7% improvements in recommendation performance and 23% improvements in dialogue generation.},

Counting the colorful star motif can help to analyze the structural properties of real-life colorful graphs, model higher-order clustering, and accelerate the mining of the densest subgraph exhibiting $h$-clique characteristics in graphs. In this manuscript, we introduce the concept of colorful $h$-star in a colored graph and proposes two higher-order cohesive subgraph models, namely colorful $h$-star core and colorful $h$-star truss. We show that the colorful $h$-stars can be counted and updated very efficiently using a novel dynamic programming (DP) algorithm. Based on the proposed DP algorithm, we develop a colorful $h$-star core decomposition algorithm which takes $O(h m)$ time, $O(h n+m)$ space; and a colorful $h$-star truss decomposition algorithm which takes $O(h m^{1.5})$ time, $O(hm)$ space, where $m$ and $n$ denote the number of edges and nodes of the graph respectively. Moreover, we also propose a graph reduction technique based on our colorful $h$-star core model to accelerate the computation of the approximation algorithm for $ h$-clique densest subgraph mining. The results of comprehensive experiments on 11 large real-world datasets demonstrate the efficiency, scalability and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

While recent research has delved into adversarial attacks on static knowledge graph models, the exploration of more practical temporal knowledge graphs has been largely overlooked. To fill this gap, we present the Adaptive Temporal Perturbation Framework (ATPF), a novel adversarial attack framework aimed at probing the robustness of temporal knowledge graph (TKG) models. The general idea of ATPF is to inject perturbations into the victim model input to undermine the prediction. First, we propose the Temporal Perturbation Prioritization (TPP) algorithm, which identifies the optimal time sequence for perturbation injection before initiating attacks. Subsequently, we design the Rank-Based Edge Manipulation (RBEM) algorithm, enabling the generation of both edge addition and removal perturbations under black-box setting. With ATPF, we present two adversarial attack methods: the stringent ATPF-hard and the more lenient ATPF-soft, each imposing different perturbation constraints. Our experimental evaluations on the link prediction task for TKGs demonstrate the superior attack performance of our methods compared to baseline methods. Furthermore, we find that strategically placing a single perturbation often suffices to successfully compromise a target link.},

To address this issue, we propose a novel method called the anchor guided unsupervised domain adaptation method (AGDA). We minimize distribution divergence in a latent feature subspace using the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) criterion. Unlike existing unsupervised domain adaptation methods, we introduce anchor points in the original space and impose domains data to the same anchor points rather than center points to further reduce the domain difference. We optimize the anchor-based graph in the subspace to obtain discriminative transformation matrices. This enables our model to perform better on non-Gaussian distribution than methods focusing on global structure. Furthermore, the sparse anchor-based graph reduces time complexity compared to the fully connected graph, enabling exploration of local structure. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on various benchmark datasets.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we develop a family of Aligned Entropic Graph Kernels (AEGK) for graph classification. We commence by performing the Continuous-time Quantum Walk (CTQW) on each graph structure, and compute the Averaged Mixing Matrix (AMM) to describe how the CTQW visits all vertices from a starting vertex. More specifically, we show how this AMM matrix allows us to compute a quantum Shannon entropy of each vertex for either un-attributed or attributed graphs. For pairwise graphs, the proposed AEGK kernels are defined by computing the kernel-based similarity between the quantum Shannon entropies of their pairwise aligned vertices. The analysis of theoretical properties reveals that the proposed AEGK kernels cannot only address the shortcoming of neglecting the structural correspondence information between graphs arising in most existing R-convolution graph kernels, but also overcome the problems of neglecting the structural differences and vertex-attributed information arising in existing vertex-based matching kernels. Moreover, unlike most existing classical graph kernels that only focus on the global or local structural information of graphs, the proposed AEGK kernels can simultaneously capture both global and local structural characteristics through the quantum Shannon entropies, reflecting more precise kernel-based similarity measures between pairwise graphs. The above theoretical properties explain the effectiveness of the proposed AEGK kernels. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed kernels can outperform state-of-the-art graph kernels and deep learning models for graph classification.},

  abstract     = {Multi-Modal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs), comprising relational triples and related multi-modal data (e.g., text and images), usually suffer from the problems of low coverage and incompleteness. To mitigate this, existing studies introduce a fundamental MMKG fusion task, i.e., Multi-Modal Entity Alignment (MMEA) that identifies equivalent entities across multiple MMKGs. Despite MMEA’s significant advancements, effectively integrating MMKGs remains challenging, mainly stemming from two core limitations: 1) entity ambiguity, where real-world entities across different MMKGs may possess multiple corresponding counterparts or alternative identities; and 2) severe noise within multi-modal data. To tackle these limitations, a new task MMER (Multi-Modal Entity Resolution), which expands the scope of MMEA to encompass entity ambiguity, is introduced. To tackle this task effectively, we develop a novel model ADMH-ER (Adaptive Denoising Multi-modal Hybrid for Entity Resolution) that incorporates several crucial modules: 1) multi-modal knowledge encoders, which are crafted to obtain entity representations based on multi-modal data sources; 2) an adaptive denoising multi-modal hybrid module that is designed to tackle challenges including noise interference, multi-modal heterogeneity, and semantic irrelevance across modalities; and 3) a hierarchical multi-objective learning strategy, which is proposed to ensure diverse convergence capabilities among different learning objectives.

Numerous methods for change point detection in dynamic graphs have been developed, but no systematic review exists.

This work introduces an interactive business game that enables learning in an engaging and practical way to prepare learners to become the entrepreneurs of tomorrow. Our business game is intended to increase learners’ self-assessed skills and self-confidence by at least one point on the five-point Likert scale. The game is embedded into a didactic framework accompanied by a lecture and discussion part where learners manage their bike rental business and self-reflect on their decisions. The game scenario allows the players to guide their business through three growth stages: survival, growth, and expansion. In this study, 151 high school students participated in the evaluation across all stages. They assessed their knowledge in a pretest and a posttest and judged the developed game on its ease of use. The learners’ sustainable entrepreneurship knowledge and skills improved significantly. This study thus confirms the mixed approach as a viable teaching tool for this area of expertise. Furthermore, a holistic didactic framework with an introduction to the game and subsequent debriefing contributes to the success of the business game too. A sign test and bootstrapping with confidence intervals constituted a simple means of statistically quantifying the learners’ improvement.},

This paper outlines a novel approach to extracting detailed app usage information by analyzing electromagnetic (EM) signals emitted from mobile devices during app-related tasks. The proposed system, MagSpy, recovers user privacy information from magnetometer readings that do not require access permissions. This EM leakage becomes complex when multiple apps are used simultaneously and is subject to interference from geomagnetic signals generated by device movement. To address these challenges, MagSpy employs multiple techniques to extract and identify signals related to app usage. Specifically, the geomagnetic offset signal is canceled using accelerometer and gyroscope sensor data, and a Cascade-LSTM algorithm is used to classify apps and in-app services. MagSpy also uses CWT-based peak detection and a Random Forest classifier to detect PIN inputs. A prototype system was evaluated on over 50 popular mobile apps with 30 devices. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate the efficacy of MagSpy in identifying in-app services (96% accuracy), apps (93.5% accuracy), and extracting PIN input information (96% top-3 accuracy).},

However, the decoupling of uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) in FD-RAN makes the existing feedback mechanism ineffective. To this end, we propose an end-to-end data-driven MIMO solution without the conventional channel feedback procedure. Data-driven MIMO can alleviate the drawbacks of feedback including overheads and delay, and can provide customized precoding design for different BSs based on their historical channel data. It essentially learns a mapping from geolocation to MIMO transmission parameters. We first present a codebook-based approach, which selects transmission parameters from the statistics of discrete channel state information (CSI) values and utilizes nearest neighbor interpolation for spatial inference. We further present a non-codebook-based approach, which 1) derives the optimal precoder from the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the channel; 2) utilizes variational autoencoder (VAE) to select the representative precoder from the latent Gaussian representations; and 3) exploits Gaussian process regression (GPR) to predict unknown precoders in the space domain. Extensive simulations are performed on a link-level 5G simulator using realistic ray-tracing channel data. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of data-driven MIMO, showcasing its potential for application in FD-RAN and 6G.},

This makes DRAM PUFs ideal for use in resource-constrained environments such as Internet of Things (IoT) networks. However, current DRAM PUF implementations often either disrupt host system functions or produce unreliable responses due to environmental sensitivity. In this paper, we present EPUF, a novel approach to extracting random and unique features from DRAM cells to generate reliable PUF responses. We leverage bitmap images of binary DRAM values and their entropy features to enhance the robustness of our PUF. Through extensive real-world experiments, we demonstrate that EPUF is approximately 1.7 times faster than existing solutions, achieves 100% reliability, produces features with 47.79% uniqueness, and supports a substantial set of Challenge-Response Pairs (CRPs). These capabilities make EPUF a powerful tool for DRAM PUF-based authentication. Based on EPUF, we then propose a lightweight authentication protocol that not only offers superior security features but also surpasses state-of-the-art authentication schemes in terms of communication overhead and computational efficiency.},

This paper proposes a new adversarial architecture, referred to as Adversarial Graph Attention Network (AGAT), which deliberately instigates fairness attacks with an aim to bias the learning process across the FL. The proposed AGAT is developed to synthesize malicious, biasing model updates, where the minimum of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the user&#39;s model update and the global model is maximized. Due to a limited set of labeled input-output biasing data samples, a surrogate model is created, which presents the behavior of a complex malicious model update. Moreover, a graph autoencoder (GAE) is designed within the AGAT architecture, which is trained together with sub-gradient descent to reconstruct manipulatively the correlations of the model updates, and maximize the reconstruction loss while keeping the malicious, biasing model updates undetectable. The proposed AGAT attack is implemented in PyTorch, showing experimentally that AGAT successfully increases the minimum value of KL divergence of benign model updates by 60.9% and bypasses the detection of existing defense models.

  abstract     = {Intelligent transportation systems demand efficient resource allocation and task offloading to ensure low-latency, high-bandwidth vehicular services. The dynamic nature of vehicular environments, characterized by high mobility and extensive interactions among vehicles, necessitates considering time-varying statistical regularities, especially in scenarios with sharp variations. Despite the widespread use of traditional reinforcement learning for resource allocation, its limitations in generalization and interpretability are evident. To overcome these challenges, we propose an Intelligence-based Reinforcement Learning (IRL) algorithm. This algorithm utilizes active inference to infer the real world and maintain an internal model by minimizing free energy. Enhancing the efficiency of active inference, we incorporate prior knowledge as macro guidance, ensuring more accurate and efficient training. By constructing an intelligence-based model, we eliminate the need for designing reward functions, aligning better with human thinking, and providing a method to reflect the learning, information transmission and intelligence accumulation processes. This approach also allows for quantifying intelligence to a certain extent. Considering the dynamic and uncertain nature of vehicular scenarios, we apply the IRL algorithm to environments with constantly changing parameters. Extensive simulations confirm the effectiveness of IRL, significantly improving the generalization and interpretability of intelligent models in vehicular networks.},

  abstract     = {Symbiotic radio (SR), combining the advantages of cognitive radio and ambient backscatter communication (AmBC), stands as a promising solution for spectrum-and-energy-efficient wireless communications. In an SR network, backscatter devices (BDs) share the spectrum resources with the primary transmitter (PT) by utilizing the incident radio frequency (RF) signal from PT for uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) transmission. The primary receiver (PR) decodes the signals of PT and BDs via the successive interference cancellation (SIC) technique. Our goal is to establish a long-term commensalistic relationship between PT and BDs. We address the problem of maximizing the long-term average sum rate of BDs while ensuring a minimum average rate for the PT by optimizing the power reflection coefficients of the BDs. We explicitly consider practical constraints such as the required power difference among signals for SIC decoding and the unknown future channel state information (CSI). We prove the NP-hardness of the offline version of the problem and subsequently employ the Lyapunov optimization technique to convert the original problem into a series of sub-problems in each individual time slot that can be solved in an online manner without relying on future CSI. We then utilize the successive convex optimization (SCO) technique to solve the non-convex sub-problems. Extensive simulations validate that our proposed Lyapunov-SCO algorithm achieves superior performance in terms of the average sum rate of BDs while ensuring PT’s required average rate. In addition, we provide discussions on extending the proposed solution to SR networks with multiple PT-PR pairs, high-mobility BDs, and enhancing fairness among BDs.},

In this paper, we present a two-step approach to organizing the most robust IoT topology. First, we propose a novel robustness metric denoted as $I$, which is based on network motifs and is specifically designed to sensitively analyze the dynamic changes in topology resulting from node failures. Second, we introduce a Distributed duAl-layer collaborative competition optimization strategy based on Motif density (DAiMo). This strategy significantly expands the search space for optimal solutions and facilitates the identification of the optimal IoT topology. We utilize the motif density concept in the collaborative optimization process to efficiently search for the optimal topology. To support our approach, extensive mathematical proofs are provided to demonstrate the advantages of the metric $I$ in effectively perceiving changes in IoT topology and to establish the convergence of the DAiMo algorithm. Finally, we conduct comprehensive performance evaluations of DAiMo and investigate the influence of network motifs on the resilience and reliability of IoT topologies. Experimental results clearly indicate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art topology optimization methods in terms of enhancing network robustness.},

  abstract     = {Small-cell mobile edge computing (SE-MEC) networks amalgamate the virtues of MEC and small-cell networks, enhancing data processing capabilities of user devices (UDs). Nevertheless, time-varying wireless channels, dynamic UD requirements, and severe interference among UDs make it difficult to fully exploit the limited network resources and stably provide computing services for UDs. Therefore, efficient task offloading and resource allocation (TORA) is essential. Moreover, since multiple small cells are deployed, decentralized TORA schemes are preferred in practice. Thus, this paper aims to design distributed adaptive TORA schemes for SE-MEC networks. In pursuit of an eco-friendly design, an optimization problem is formulated to minimize the total energy consumption (TEC) of UDs subject to delay constraints. To effectively deal with network&#39;s dynamic characteristics, the reinforce learning framework is applied, where the TEC minimization problem is first modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), and then an efficient multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO)-based scheme is presented to solve it. In the presented scheme, each small-cell base station (SBS) serves as an agent and is capable of making TORA decisions only with its own local information. To promote collaboration among multiple agents, a global reward function is designed. A state normalization mechanism is also introduced into the presented scheme for enhancing learning performance. Simulation results show that although the proposed MAPPO-based scheme works in a distributed manner, it achieves very similar performance to the centralized one. In addition, it is demonstrated that the state normalization mechanism has a significant effect on reducing TEC.},

  abstract     = {As a promising vehicular communication technology, Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) is expected to ensure the safety and convenience of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) by providing global road information. However, it is difficult to obtain global road information in practical scenarios since there will still be many vehicles on the road without onboard units (OBUs) in the near future. Specifically, although C-V2X vehicles have sensors that can perceive their surroundings and broadcast their perceived information to the C-V2X system, their line-of-sight (LoS) is limited and obscured by the environment, such as other vehicles and terrain. Besides, vehicles without OBUs cannot share their perceived information. These two problems cause extensive areas with unperceived information in the C-V2X system, and whether vehicles are in these areas is unknown. Thus, extending the perceivable range of the limited scenario for C-V2X applications that require global road information is necessary. To this end, this paper pioneers investigating the scenario inpainting task problem in C-V2X. To solve this challenging problem, we propose an effiCient trAffic Scenario inpainTing (CAST) solution consisting of a generative architecture and knowledge distillation, simultaneously considering the inpainting precision and computation efficiency. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of CAST in terms of Precise Inpaint Rate (PIR), Rough Inpaint Rate (RIR), Lane-Level Inpaint Rate (LLIR), and Inpaint Confidence Error (ICE), paving the way for novel solutions for the inpainting problem in more complex road scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) is an efficient distributed learning method that facilitates collaborative model training among multiple edge devices (or clients). However, current research always assumes that clients have access to ground-truth data for training, which is unrealistic in practice because of a lack of expertise. Semi-supervised federated learning (SSFL) has been proposed in many existing works to address this problem, which always adopts a fixed model architecture for training, bringing two main problems with varying amounts of pseudo-labeled data. First, the shallow model cannot have the capability to fit the increasing pseudo-labeled data, leading to poor training performance. Second, the large model suffers from an overfitting problem when exploiting a few labeled data samples in SSFL, and also requires tremendous resource (e.g., computation and communication) costs. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel framework, called star, which adopts progressive training to enhance model training in SSFL. Specifically, star gradually increases the model depth through adding the sub-module (e.g., one or several layers) from a shallow model, and performs pseudo-labeling for unlabeled data with a specialized confidence threshold simultaneously. Then, we propose an efficient algorithm to determine the appropriate model depth for each client with varied resource budgets and the proper confidence threshold for pseudo-labeling in SSFL. The experimental results demonstrate the high effectiveness of STAR. For instance, star can reduce the bandwidth consumption by about 40%, and achieve an average accuracy improvement of around 9.8% compared with the baselines, on CIFAR10.},

  abstract     = {Generally, Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent updates its policy by repetitively interacting with the environment, contingent on the received rewards to observed states and undertaken actions. However, the environmental disturbance, commonly leading to noisy observations (e.g., rewards and states), could significantly shape the performance of agent. Furthermore, the learning performance of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is more susceptible to noise due to the interference among intelligent agents. Therefore, it becomes imperative to revolutionize the design of MARL, so as to capably ameliorate the annoying impact of noisy rewards. In this paper, we propose a novel decomposition-based multi-agent distributional RL method by approximating the globally shared noisy reward by a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and decomposing it into the combination of individual distributional local rewards, with which each agent can be updated locally through distributional RL. Moreover, a Diffusion Model (DM) is leveraged for reward generation in order to mitigate the issue of costly interaction expenditure for learning distributions. Furthermore, the monotonicity of the reward distribution decomposition is theoretically validated under nonnegative weights and increasing distortion risk function, while the design of the loss function is carefully calibrated to avoid decomposition ambiguity. We also verify the effectiveness of the proposed method through extensive simulation experiments with noisy rewards. Besides, different risk-sensitive policies are evaluated in order to demonstrate the superiority of distributional RL in different MARL tasks.},

  abstract     = {The unpredictability of the wireless channel has been used as a natural source of randomness to build physical-layer security primitives for shared key generation, authentication, access control, proximity verification, and other security properties. Compared to pseudo-random generators, it has the potential to achieve information-theoretic security. In sub-6 GHz frequencies, the randomness is harvested from the small-scale fading effects of RF signal propagation in rich scattering environments. However, the RF propagation characteristics follow sparse models with clustered paths when devices operate in millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands (5G and Next-Generation networks, Wi-Fi in 60GHz). Millimeter-wave transmissions are typically directional to increase the gain and combat high signal attenuation, leading to stable and more predictable channels. In this paper, we first demonstrate that state-of-the-art methods relying on channel state information or received signal strength measurements fail to produce high randomness. Accounting for the unique features of mmWave propagation, we propose a novel randomness extraction mechanism that exploits the random timing of channel blockage to harvest random bits. Compared with the prior art in CSI-based and context-based randomness extraction, our protocol remains secure against passive and active Man-in-the-Middle adversaries co-located with the legitimate devices. We demonstrate the security properties of our method in a 28 GHz mmWave testbed in an indoor setting.},

The simulation results indicate that the proposed method performs almost consistently with traditional heuristic algorithms, with only 20% of the time consumption of the latter, and the number of pseudo packet loss also decreases to the original 10–20%.},

  abstract     = {Radio frequency identification (RFID) system has been extensively employed to track missing items by affixing them with RFID tags. Many practical applications require to efficiently identify missing events for a specific subset of system tags (called key tags) due to their elevated importance. Existing methods primarily aim to identify all tags, which makes it challenging to specifically identify key tags because of interference from other non-key tags (called ordinary tags). In light of this, several key tag identification methods follow a two-step scheme that filters ordinary tags first and then identifies key tags. Nevertheless, this wastes too much time on tag filtering, resulting in low time efficiency. This paper presents a novel missing key tag identification protocol with two creative designs to gain high efficiency. First, we develop a novel verification technique that can rapidly determine the presence or absence of key tags amid the scenarios with both key tags and ordinary ones. By combining the ON-OFF Keying modulation, we could verify multiple key tags in a single slot, thereby reducing the total slots required. Second, we design a new selection technique that efficiently selects the unverified key tags for further verification, while filtering out the verified key tags and irrelevant ordinary tags to avoid redundant data transmission. Additionally, we present an enhancement protocol that leverages a preselection technique to avoid collecting useless tag responses, further boosting efficiency. We carry out rigorous theoretical analysis to optimize the performance of the proposed protocols. Both simulations and practical experiments demonstrate that our method is markedly superior to state-of-the-art solutions.},

However, these edge devices are not immune to malicious attacks. Federated learning (FL), while protecting privacy of decentralized data through secure aggregation, struggles to trace adversaries and lacks optimization for heterogeneity. We discover that FL augmented with Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) can improve resilience against backdoor attacks while compatible with secure aggregation. Based on this, we propose a federated neural architecture search (NAS) framwork named SLNAS. The architecture of SLNAS is built on three pivotal components: a server-side search space generation method that employs an evolutionary algorithm with dual encodings, a federated NAS process based on DARTS, and client-side architecture tuning that utilizes Gumbel softmax combined with knowledge distillation. To validate robustness, we adapt a framework that includes backdoor attacks based on trigger optimization, data poisoning, and model poisoning, targeting both model weights and architecture parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SLNAS not only effectively counters advanced backdoor attacks but also handles heterogeneity, outperforming defense baselines across a wide range of backdoor attack scenarios.},

In particular, low earth orbit (LEO) satellites have become a critical component of satellite communication networks. The emergence of LEO satellites has brought about new computational resources known as the LEO satellite edge, enabling ground users (GU) to offload computing tasks to the resource-rich LEO satellite edge. However, existing LEO satellite computational offloading solutions primarily focus on optimizing system performance, neglecting the potential issue of malicious satellite attacks during task offloading. In this paper, we propose the deployment of LEO satellite edge in an integrated satellite-terrestrial networks (ISTN) structure to support security-sensitive computing task offloading. We model the task allocation and offloading order problem as a joint optimization problem to minimize task offloading delay, energy consumption, and the number of attacks while satisfying reliability constraints. To achieve this objective, we model the task offloading process as a Markov decision process (MDP) and propose a security-sensitive task offloading strategy optimization algorithm based on proximal policy optimization (PPO). Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm significantly outperforms other benchmark methods in terms of performance.},

  abstract     = {Mobile Crowdsensing (MCS) has emerged as a promising sensing paradigm for accomplishing large-scale tasks by leveraging ubiquitously distributed mobile workers. Due to the variability in sensory data provided by different workers, identifying truth values from them has garnered wide attention. However, existing truth discovery schemes either offer limited privacy protection or incur high participation costs and lower data aggregation quality due to malicious workers. In this paper, we propose an Efficient and Trusted Bilateral Privacy-preserving Truth Discovery scheme (ETBP-TD) to obtain high-quality truth values while preventing privacy leakage from both workers and the data requester. Specifically, a matrix encryption-based protocol is introduced to the whole truth discovery process, which keeps locations and data related to tasks and workers secret from other entries. Additionally, trust-based worker recruitment and trust update mechanisms are first integrated within a privacy-preserving truth discovery scheme to enhance truth value accuracy and reduce unnecessary participation costs. Our theoretical analyses on the security and regret of ETBP-TD, along with extensive simulations on real-world datasets, demonstrate that ETBP-TD effectively preserves workers’ and tasks’ privacy while reducing the estimated error by up to 84.40% and participation cost by 54.72%.},

Introducing source location privacy technologies inevitably increase the energy consumption of nodes, while they are widely deployed in available studies, resulting in massive energy wastage. Therefore, an adaptive scheme for protecting source location privacy (APSLP) in UASNs is proposed. The APSLP scheme first analyzes the possible locations of the adversary by trust method. Then, considering the lagging nature of the trust method, which means that the adversary may not stay in locations given by trust method, a hidden Markov-based backtracking method is proposed and location privacy methods are functioned according to the backtracking result. The simulation shows that even though the security level of the APSLP scheme is not the largest, the efficiency is the highest, approximately an increase of 69.1$\%$ and 10.3$\%$ compared with two comparison algorithms, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Minimizing the decoding delay, the completion time, or the delivery time of instantly decodable network coding (IDNC) can all be approximated to a maximum weight clique (MWC) problem, which is well known to be NP hard. Due to its good tradeoff between performance and computational complexity, a heuristic approach named as maximum weight vertex (MWV) search is widely employed to select MWC for IDNC. However, in MWV, when there are few coding connection edges among the adjacent vertices of a vertex, its modified vertex weight cannot well reflect the weight of the MWC containing the vertex, which leads to incorrect selection of MWC. This paper proposes a new method to calculate the modified weight of a vertex by summing the weights of the vertices in the approximate maximum weight path (A-MWP) generated by this vertex. Since the vertices in an A-MWP can form a maximal clique, the proposed modified vertex weight may well indicate the weight of the MWC containing the vertex. The proposed algorithm has the same computational complexity as the MWV algorithm. Simulation results show that when employing any of the three performance metrics of IDNC, our proposed algorithm can achieve better system performance than the MWV algorithm.},

In this paper, we present IFNet, a novel deep unfolding network that combines the strengths of signal processing models and deep neural networks to achieve robust imaging and focusing for handheld mmWave systems. We first formulate the handheld imaging model by integrating multiple priors about mmWave images and handheld phase errors. Furthermore, we transform the optimization processes into an iterative network structure for improved and efficient imaging performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IFNet effectively compensates for handheld phase errors and recovers high-fidelity images from severely distorted signals. In comparison with existing methods, IFNet can achieve at least 11.89 dB improvement in average peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and 64.91% improvement in average structural similarity index measure (SSIM) on a real-world dataset.},

UORA supports multi-user transmission via two methods, where users transmit either fixed-size or variable-size aggregated MAC protocol data units. However, three critical issues arise. 1 Existing studies only focus on the fixed-size method with low practicality, and overlook the impact of traffic load which leads to inaccurate evaluation of the network performance. 2 The variable-size method has never been studied due to a complex scenario, where user frames append padding bits to fulfill the transmission opportunity constraint. 3 In realistic networks, the variable-size method sacrifices throughput to achieve high practicality and low latency. To address the first two issues, we proposed two novel models based on queueing theory that accurately capture the impact of these transmission methods and various parameters (e.g., the traffic load and padding bits) on throughput, packet loss rate, and latency. To address Issue 3, we design a Dynamic Selection Algorithm of Transmission Methods (DSATM), which dynamically switches between the two transmission methods to enhance practicality, maximize throughput, and minimize latency. Finally, we conducted extensive simulations to verify the accuracy of our models and DSATM.},

However, the primary challenges of AIGC services provisioning in wireless networks lie in unstable channels, limited bandwidth resources, and unevenly distributed computational resources. To this end, this paper proposes a semantic communication (SemCom)-empowered AIGC (SemAIGC) generation and transmission framework, where only semantic information of the content rather than all the binary bits should be generated and transmitted by using SemCom. Specifically, SemAIGC integrates diffusion models within the semantic encoder and decoder to design a workload-adjustable transceiver thereby allowing adjustment of computational resource utilization in edge and local. In addition, a resource-aware workload trade-off (ROOT) scheme is devised to intelligently make workload adaptation decisions for the transceiver, thus efficiently generating, transmitting, and fine-tuning content as per dynamic wireless channel conditions and service requirements. Simulations verify the superiority of our proposed SemAIGC framework in terms of latency and content quality compared to conventional approaches.},

In such cases, short-time age-of-information (ST-AoI) is more crucial than long-term average AoI, because instantaneous high ST-AoI could lead to system failures even if the long-term average AoI is low. In this paper, we propose an adaptive sampling control (ASC) scheme to ensure a low ST-AoI outage probability, defined as the probability of the average AoI in each control cycle, i.e., over a limited number of packets, exceeding a given threshold. This ASC scheme does not rely on an explicit statistical model for the non-stationary traffic behaviors. It establishes a dynamic linearization data model with a pseudo-partial derivative (PPD) parameter to capture the unknown and non-stationary traffic statistics. By estimating the PPD parameter in each control cycle, ASC can determine the sampling rates to ensure an extremely low ST-AoI outage probability. Both numerical simulation and real-world experiment show that the proposed ASC scheme significantly outperforms existing methods, reducing the ST-AoI outage probability almost by half.},

An effective satellite-ground interconnection design can result in a stable constellation topology for LMCNs. A naïve solution is accessing the satellite with the longest remaining service time (LRST), which is widely used in previous designs. The Coordinated Satellite-Ground Interconnecting (CSGI), the state-of-the-art algorithm, coordinates the establishment of ground-satellite links (GSLs). Compared with existing solutions, it reduces latency by 19% and jitter by 70% on average. However, CSGI only supports the scenario where terminals access only one satellite, and cannot fully utilize the multi-access capabilities of terminals. Additionally, CSGI&#39;s high computational complexity poses deployment challenges. To overcome these problems, we propose the Classification-based Longest Remaining Service Time (C-LRST) algorithm. C-LRST supports the actual scenario with multi-access capabilities. It adds optional paths during routing with low computational complexity, improving end-to-end communications quality. We conduct our 1000 s simulation from Brazil to Lithuania on the open-source platform Hypatia. Experiment results show that compared with CSGI, C-LRST reduces the latency and increases the throughput by approximately 60% and 40%, respectively.

  abstract     = {The demand for mobile video streaming has seen a substantial surge in recent years. However, current platforms heavily depend on network capacity to ensure the delivery of high-quality video streams. The emergence of neural-enhanced video streaming presents a promising solution to address this challenge by leveraging client-side computation, thereby reducing bandwidth consumption. Nonetheless, deploying advanced super-resolution (SR) models on mobile devices is hindered by the computational demands of existing SR models. In this paper, we propose REM, a novel neural-enhanced mobile video streaming framework. REM utilizes a customized lookup table to facilitate real-time neural-enhanced video streaming on mobile devices. Initially, we conduct a series of measurements to identify abundant macroblock redundancies across frames in a video stream. Subsequently, we introduce a dynamic macroblock selection algorithm that prioritizes important macroblocks for neural enhancement. The SR-enhanced results are stored in the lookup table and efficiently reused to meet real-time requirements and minimize resource overhead. By considering macroblock-level characteristics of the video frames, the lookup table enables efficient and fast processing. Additionally, we design a lightweight macroblock-aware SR module to expedite inference. Finally, we perform extensive experiments on various mobile devices. The results demonstrate that REM enhances overall processing throughput by up to 10.2 times and reduces power consumption by up to 58.6% compared to state-of-the-art methods. Consequently, this leads to a 38.06% improvement in the quality of experience for mobile users.},

However, CFEL faces critical challenges arising from dynamic and heterogeneous device properties, which slow down the convergence and increase resource consumption. This paper proposes a heterogeneity-aware CFEL scheme called Heterogeneity-Aware Cooperative Edge-based Federated Averaging (HCEF) that aims to maximize the model accuracy while minimizing the training time and energy consumption via adaptive computation and communication compression in CFEL. By theoretically analyzing how local update frequency and gradient compression affect the convergence error bound in CFEL, we develop an efficient online control algorithm for HCEF to dynamically determine local update frequencies and compression ratios for heterogeneous devices. Experimental results show that compared with prior schemes, the proposed HCEF scheme can maintain higher model accuracy while reducing training latency and improving energy efficiency simultaneously.},

To address the load balancing problem, this paper proposes a dynamic optimization framework for mobile communication networks inspired by the average consensus in multi-agent systems. In this framework, all antennas cooperatively optimize their CPICH (Common Pilot Channel) transmit power in real-time to balance their busy-degrees. Then, the coverage area of each antenna would change accordingly, and we call this framework a “breathing” mobile communication network. To solve this optimization problem, two algorithms named BDBA (Busy-degree Dynamic Balancing Algorithm) and BFDBA (Busy-degree Fast Dynamic Balancing Algorithm) are proposed. Moreover, a fast network coverage calculation method is introduced, by which each antenna&#39;s minimum CPICH transmit power is determined under the premise of meeting the network coverage requirements. Besides, we present the theoretical analysis of the two proposed algorithms’ performance, which prove that all antennas’ busy-degrees will reach consensus under certain assumptions. Furthermore, simulations carried out on three large datasets demonstrate that our cooperative optimization can significantly reduce the unbalance among antennas as well as the proportion of over-busy antennas.},

  abstract     = {Accurate object detection with on-board LiDAR sensors is crucial for ensuring driving safety of Connected Automated Vehicles (CAVs), especially at accident black spots with more occlusions. Fortunately, road-side infrastructure equipped with traffic cameras is usually available at these places, offers an extensive field of view and encounters fewer occlusions, and thus can provide sustained assistance to CAVs to improve their object detection performance. However, vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) cooperative object detection is quite challenging due to modality heterogeneity, agent heterogeneity, and bandwidth limitations. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose V2I-Coop, an accurate object detection approach with V2I cross-modality cooperation for CAVs to improve perception performance at accident black spots. In V2I-Coop, first, we extract bird-eye-view (BEV) features from both multi-view 2D images and 3D point clouds, which facilitates the feature fusion of different modalities. Next, the most valuable features from the images are adaptively selected according to available bandwidth and then transmitted to CAVs. Then, a cross-modality feature fusion algorithm is adopted at CAVs to mitigate the modality difference and improve the feature fusion efficiency. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that V2I-Coop significantly improves the 3D object detection performance of CAVs at accident black spots.},

While the threat of backdoor attacks is well-studied in the image domain, few works have explored this threat in the context of RF signals. In this paper, we thoroughly analyze the susceptibility of DNN-based RF fingerprinting to backdoor attacks, focusing on a more practical scenario where attackers lack access to control model gradients and training processes. We propose leveraging explainable machine learning techniques and autoencoders to guide the selection of trigger positions and values, allowing for the creation of effective backdoor triggers in a model-agnostic manner. To comprehensively evaluate this backdoor attack, we employ four diverse datasets with two protocols (Wi-Fi and LoRa) across various DNN architectures. Given that RF signals are often transformed into the frequency or time-frequency domains, this study also assesses attack efficacy in the time-frequency domain. Furthermore, we experiment with potential detection and defense methods, demonstrating the difficulty of fully safeguarding against our proposed backdoor attack. Additionally, we consider the attack performance in the domain shift case.},

  abstract     = {The rise of mobile devices with abundant sensor data and computing power has driven the trend of federated learning (FL) on them. Personalized FL (PFL) aims to train tailored models for each device, addressing data heterogeneity from diverse user behaviors and preferences. However, due to dynamic mobile environments, PFL faces challenges in test-time data shifts, i.e., variations between training and testing. While this issue is well studied in generic deep learning through model generalization or adaptation, this issue remains less explored in PFL, where models often overfit local data. To address this, we introduce ${\sf ClassTer}$, a shift-robust PFL framework. We observe that class-wise clustering of clients in cluster-based PFL (CFL) can avoid class-specific biases by decoupling the training of classes. Thus, we propose a paradigm shift from traditional client-wise clustering to class-wise clustering, which allows effective aggregation of cluster models into a generalized one via knowledge distillation. Additionally, we extend ClassTer to asynchronous mobile clients to optimize wall clock time by leveraging critical learning periods and both intra- and inter-device scheduling. Experiments show that compared to status quo approaches, ${\sf ClassTer}$ achieves a reduction of up to 91% in convergence time, and an improvement of up to 50.45% in accuracy.},

The RF-SN captures radio energy from a mobile radio transmitter for sensing and communication, which offers a cost-effective solution for consistent in-situ perception. To optimize the system performance across various situations, we’ve explored both active and passive communication methods. For the active RF-SN, we implement a specialized control circuit enabling the node to transmit data through ZigBee protocol at low incident power. For the passive RF-SN, radio energy is not only for power but also as a carrier signal, with data conveyed by modulating the amplitude of the backscattered radio wave. To address the challenge of significant attenuation of the backscattering signal in concrete, we utilize a square chirp-based modulation scheme for passive communication. This scheme allows the receiver to successfully decode the data even under a negative signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) condition. Performance modeling and optimization for both active and passive RF-SNs are provided in this study. The experimental results verify that an active RF-SN embedded in concrete at a depth of 13.5 cm can be effectively powered by a 915 MHz mobile radio transmitter with an effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) of 32.5 dBm. This setup allows the RF-SN to send over 1 kB of data within 10 seconds, with an additional 1.7 kilobytes every 1.6 seconds of extra charging. For the passive RF-SN buried at the same depth, continuous data transmission at a rate of 224 bps with a 3% bit error rate (BER) is achieved when the EIRP of the transmitter is 23.6 dBm.},

Existing studies often overlook the synergy among these strategies, impacting their overall effectiveness. Furthermore, the focus on content pre-caching overlooks task caching’s critical role in addressing high computational demands with limited UAV resources. This research aims to jointly optimize UAV trajectories and task management strategies, including offloading, caching, and migration. Utilizing the Lyapunov optimization framework, we break down the complex optimization problem into manageable subproblems: UAV placement, user-UAV association, task offloading, scheduling, and bandwidth allocation, addressed iteratively using the Block Coordinate Descent method. Specifically, the scheduling subproblem is transformed into a non-convex quadratically constrained quadratic programming problem, managed effectively through semidefinite relaxation and a probabilistic mapping approach. Our simulations show that this integrated approach significantly boosts system throughput and reduces execution times compared to conventional methods.

  abstract     = {Massive MIMO technology offers a promising solution for supporting the simultaneous connectivity of a large number of ultra high-density massive IoT devices. However, due to limited resources, effective channel estimation becomes a challenge. One approach is to reuse the orthogonal reference signal (ORS) in a repetitive manner, while another option is to employ random non-orthogonal reference signals (NORS) for distributed massive IoT devices. In order to enhance performance in the face of high RS congestion from massive IoT devices, the strategic utilization of several critical resources becomes imperative. In this paper, we delve into the methodology of resource management to effectively address the severe high-density scenario of massive IoT devices. Specifically, we examine the system bandwidth, which proves particularly advantageous in bandwidth-limited environments. Exploiting the spatial domain, we leverage the distinctive features of massive MIMO to enable simultaneous parallel transmission by increasing the number of service antennas at the base station (BS). Furthermore, we explore the potential benefits of sectorization, a technique that involves dividing a circular cell into multiple sectors, thereby reducing RS congestion. Nevertheless, it is crucial to acknowledge that increasing these resources may entail certain trade-offs and could potentially have adverse effects on overall system performance. To gain comprehensive insights, we conduct a thorough performance analysis under various scenarios, aiming to identify key characteristics that can facilitate the optimal operation of massive MIMO in high-density IoT environments.

To address this challenge, Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) has emerged as a solution, offering computing services for DNN-based tasks through resource pooling via Vehicle-to-Vehicle/Infrastructure (V2V/V2I) communications. In this paper, we formulate the problem of joint DNN partitioning, task offloading, and resource allocation in VEC as a dynamic long-term optimization. Our objective is to minimize the DNN-based task completion time while guaranteeing the system stability over time. To this end, we first leverage a Lyapunov optimization technique to decouple the original long-term optimization with stability constraints into a per-slot deterministic problem. Afterwards, we propose a Multi-Agent Diffusion-based Deep Reinforcement Learning (MAD2RL) algorithm, incorporating the innovative use of diffusion models to determine the optimal DNN partitioning and task offloading decisions. Furthermore, we integrate convex optimization techniques into MAD2RL as a subroutine to allocate computation resources, enhancing the learning efficiency.

ToF estimation, however, is a challenging task due to the complexity of multipath effect. In this paper, we propose a phase difference based method for ToF estimation and uncover the potential of signal cancellation to mitigate the impact of multipath and noise on phase differences among subcarriers. To separate the moving target path from the complex multipath for ToF estimation, we suggest employing specific elimination methods tailored to the characteristics of different signal components. For dynamic multipath, we observe that when a given subcarrier propagates along two paths to the receiver, with path lengths differing by half a wavelength, the phase difference introduced by these two paths cancels each other out. Therefore, we propose two metrics to identify signals that satisfy this condition, utilizing both frequency diversity and spatial diversity. Additionally, we propose leveraging time diversity to eliminate the static multipath component and reduce the impact of noise. We implemented the methods with off-the-shelf WiFi devices and achieved mean errors of 15.36 cm and 21.05 cm for distance estimation in outdoor and indoor scenarios, outperforming state-of-the-art ToF estimation method by 50% error reduction.},

Specifically, the defenders formulate the defense as a functional minimization problem (which cannot be directly solved by numerical optimization algorithms because its decision variable is a set of functions), resisting data poisoning attacks by deleting data shared by identified malicious workers through the log-likelihood ratio test. To obtain a current defense strategy, the decision variable of the problem is relaxed into the coefficients of basis-based linear combinations through the variable-basis approximation, and then solved using the simulated annealing genetic algorithm. Correspondingly, the attackers formulate their attack strategy as a bi-level maximization problem (which is an NP-hard problem), biasing crowdsensing results as much as possible while remaining undetected. Since the attackers can know the defense strategy, they may bypass the defenders by constraining the expected log-likelihood ratio test. Additionally, the attackers can evade truth discovery methods deployed in crowdsensing using DP noise. To determine a current attack strategy, the bi-level problem is decomposed into upper-level and lower-level sub-problems, wherein the upper-level sub-problem is solved by the variational methods, and then these sub-problems are alternately optimized. Finally, we propose a local minimax points calculating algorithm to obtain an equilibrium point in the defenders-attackers game, thereby finding an optimal defense strategy to resist the powerful data poisoning attack. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets show that the proposed game-based defense approach can effectively defend powerful and covert attackers.},

  abstract     = {Prior studies on traditional centralized clouds independently optimizing static resource utilization and dynamic bandwidth cost are not applicable to edge scenarios, where edge sites are interconnected by wide area networks (WAN) rather than local area networks (LAN) as within clouds. Due to the lack of knowledge about the actual status of public edge platforms and real-world edge datasets, existing influential literature on edge scenarios demonstrates significant disparities in optimization objectives and perspectives. To bridge this gap, we collaborate with a public edge platform and perform a comprehensive measurement, which reveals limitations of the status quo VM scheduling schemes and potential opportunities for improvement. However, resolving VM scheduling considering static resource utilization, dynamic bandwidth cost, and end users’ QoE in a cost-efficient manner faces several challenges, including coupled objectives, exponentially increased complexity, and spatiotemporal dynamics. To address the above challenges, in this work, we propose a holistic online framework that integrates combinatorial bandit-based VM migration and seasonality-aware VM request allocation at two distinct time granularities. Large-scale experiments based on a real-world dataset confirm that our online framework achieves near-offline bandwidth cost and resource utilization while significantly lowering time consumption.},

Our co-design exploits synergies among these components, resulting in joint throughput and range performance that pushes the known envelope. We prototype ${\sf Mighty}$ on PCB board and conduct extensive field studies both indoors and outdoors. The power efficiency of ${\sf Mighty}$ is about 16.6 nJ/bit. A head-to-head comparison with a DJI Mini2 drone&#39;s default video streaming system shows that ${\sf Mighty}$ achieves similar throughput at a drone-to-controller distance of up to 150 meters, with 34–55× improvement of power efficiency than WiFi-based video streaming solutions.},

However, due to the sensitivity of the trajectory data, sharing it in plaintext could lead to privacy risks, especially in operations like contact queries. Thus, achieving secure and efficient contact queries based on the trajectory data in the cloud is a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving contact query processing over trajectory data in mobile cloud computing. The projection-based secure trajectory encoding is designed to convert trajectories into secure codes such that the comparison between the distance of two moving objects and the contact distance threshold is transformed into a problem of secure code matching. Adopting the secure code matching method, a baseline privacy-preserving contact query processing is proposed. To improve the query accuracy and efficiency, an amplification factor, an HTG-index and a filter table are designed for query processing optimization, based on which an enhanced privacy-preserving contact query processing is proposed. The game stimulation-based security analysis and experimental results show that the proposed query scheme is secure and performs well in query accuracy and efficiency.},

Considering usage of multiple devices and privacy preservation, anonymous single-sign-on (ASSO) is a feasible solution for authentication. ASSO allows a user to access multiple devices with one token issued by the transferor and prevents the transferor from identifying the user. We also observe that in the scenario of IoT-based sharing economy, the token should (i) support attributes since a device should be available only to users with specific attributes (e.g., age) and (ii) avoid incurring significant communication/computation overhead as IoT devices are resource-constrained. In this paper, we proposed PILOT, a privacy-preserving single-sign-on with fine-grained access control for IoT devices. When a user attempts to access a device, he/she requests a token from the transferor. The token is actually a blind signature that cannot be tracked, and contains the user’s attributes which facilitate fine-grained access control on the device. Besides, the token consists of only four group elements and verification of the token involves only several exponentiation operations. This renders PILOT superior in terms of communication/computation overhead and suitable for IoT devices.},

  abstract     = {Fueled by Metaverse, 360° video streaming has seen tremendous growth in the past years. However, our measurement reveals that current 360° streaming systems suffer from a dilemma that severely limits QoE. On the one hand, viewport prediction requires the shortest possible prediction distance for high predicting accuracy; On the other hand, video transmission requires more buffered data to compensate for bandwidth fluctuations otherwise substantial playback rebuffering would be incurred. There is so far no existing method that can break this dilemma so the QoE optimization for 360° video streaming was naturally bottlenecked. This work is the first attempt to tackle this challenge by developing QUTA – a novel learning-based streaming system. Specifically, according to our measurement, three kinds of internal streaming parameters have significant impacts on the prediction distance, namely, download pause, data rate threshold, and playback rate. On top of this, we design a new long-term-planning (LTP) continuous control deep reinforcement learning method that tunes the parameters dynamically based on the network condition and the streaming context. Extensive evaluations based on real system prototypes show that QUTA not only improves the prediction accuracy and QoE performance by up to 68.4% but also exhibits strong temporal and spatial robustness.},

However, state-of-the-art SFL schemes neglect the effects of heterogeneity in the clients’ computation and communication performance as well as the computation time for the tasks offloaded to the cloud server. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained parallelization framework, called PipeSFL, to accelerate SFL on heterogeneous clients. PipeSFL is based on two key novel ideas. First, we design a server-side priority scheduling mechanism to minimize per-iteration time. Second, we propose a hybrid training mode to reduce per-round time, which employs asynchronous training within rounds and synchronous training between rounds. We theoretically prove the optimality of the proposed priority scheduling mechanism within one round and analyze the total time per round for PipeSFL, SFL and SL. We implement PipeSFL on PyTorch. Extensive experiments on seven 64-client clusters with different heterogeneity demonstrate that at training speed, PipeSFL achieves up to 1.65x and 1.93x speedup compared to EPSL and SFL, respectively. At energy consumption, PipeSFL saves up to 30.8% and 43.4% of the energy consumed within each training round compared to EPSL and SFL, respectively.},

Chaining VNFs together allows traffic to be directed through the network as required. However, existing algorithms for traffic steering and routing path computation in SFC suffer from many challenges, including complexity, lack of scalability, and low time efficiency. This paper focuses on addressing the challenges associated with VNF placement and SFC chaining in SDN/NFV-enabled networks. Our objective is to identify an optimal solution for VNF placement that maximizes the utilization of network resources. We formulate the problem as a Binary Integer Programming (BIP) model to accomplish this. Additionally, we propose a novel algorithm called DeepSelector, which incorporates deep learning techniques and an intelligent node selection network to determine the optimal placement of VNFs for SFC requests. Through performance evaluation, we demonstrate that DeepSelector achieves high network resource utilization and offers efficient VNF placement computation, significantly improving overall network performance.},

To maintain high throughput, its architecture needs to be augmented by adding relays. However, how to place relays at appropriate sites poses two challenges: 1) there lacks a theory to capture the relationship between a certain change of network architecture and its throughput gain; 2) selecting the best sites for relays is a complicated combinatorial problem. To tackle the first challenge, this paper first establishes a clique-based bottleneck theory, through which a clique-based bottleneck structure of a given network architecture is constructed to determine the network throughput. Based on this bottleneck structure, clique gradients are then computed to quantify the impact of each clique on the overall network throughput. With the clique-based bottleneck theory, the second challenge is resolved by embedding clique gradients into a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) scheme. Specifically, the DRL actions are masked such that only the relay sites that match the highest clique gradients are selected. This DRL-based relay placement (DeepRP) scheme is evaluated via extensive simulations, and performance results show that it can boost network throughput by more than 50%, which is $\text{10.4} \!-\! \text{32.1}\% $ higher than those of baseline schemes.},

  abstract     = {The traditional recommendation system provides web services by modeling user behavior characteristics, which also faces the risk of leaking user privacy. To mitigate the rising concern on privacy leakage in recommender systems, federated learning (FL) based recommendation has received tremendous attention, which can preserve data privacy by conducting local model training on clients. However, devices (e.g., mobile phones) used by clients in a recommender system may have limited capacity for computation and communication, which can severely deteriorate FL training efficiency. Besides, offloading local training tasks to the cloud can lead to privacy leakage and excessive pressure to the cloud. To overcome this deficiency, we propose a novel federated cloud-edge recommendation framework, which is called FCER, by offloading local training tasks to powerful and trusted edge servers. The challenge of FCER lies in the heterogeneity of edge servers, which makes the parameter server (PS) deployed in the cloud face difficulty in judiciously selecting edge servers for model training. To address this challenge, we divide the FCER framework into two stages. In the first pre-training stage, edge servers expose their data statistical features protected by local differential privacy (LDP) to the PS so that edge servers can be grouped into clusters. In the second training stage, FCER activates a single cluster in each communication round, ensuring that edge servers with statistical homogenization are not repeatedly involved in FL. The PS only selects a certain number of edge servers with the highest data quality in each cluster for FL. Effective metrics are proposed to dynamically evaluate the data quality of each edge server. Convergence rate analysis is conducted to show the convergence of recommendation algorithms in FCER. We also perform extensive experiments to demonstrate that FCER remarkably outperforms competitive baselines by $3.85\%-9.14\%$ on HR@10 and $1.46\%-11.77\%$ on NDCG@10.},

  abstract     = {Neural network models have become integral to Internet of Things (IoT) systems, with applications spanning from industrial automation to critical infrastructure management. Despite their prevalence, the deployment of these models within IoT systems introduces distinctive security vulnerabilities. In particular, adversaries may execute model poisoning attacks, which aim to alter the decision-making processes of embedded models, leading to erroneous outcomes. Existing model poisoning attacks necessitate access to extensive auxiliary datasets, such as the training dataset itself or one with same distribution. These requirements often render such attacks impractical in IoT contexts, given the constrained storage and computational resources of IoT devices. This paper proposes the first model poisoning attack against interpreters without auxiliary datasets to manipulate the model’s behavior. We evaluate the attack on three real-world datasets, and results indicate that this attack can successfully coerce the targeted interpreters to produce outcomes aligned with an adversary’s intentions, while maintaining nearly indistinguishable performance from the original model, thereby ensuring its stealthiness. Furthermore, beyond directly affected interpreters, our experiments reveal that four additional interpreters coupled to the poisoned model are indirectly influenced, underscoring the attack’s transferability.},

Our in-depth study finds that Channel Activity Detection (CAD) in a narrow band can indicate the channel activities of wide bands because they have the same slope in the time-frequency domain. Based on this finding, we design a cross-channel scanning mechanism that infers the channel occupancy states of all the overlapping channels by the distribution of CAD results. We elaborately select and adjust the CAD settings to enhance the distribution features and design a pattern correction method to cope with distribution distortions. We also design a CAD scheduler to deal with the low duty-cycle LoRa operations. We implement ${\sf LoRadar}$ on commercial LoRa platforms and evaluate its performance in the indoor testbed and two outdoor deployed networks. The experimental results show that ${\sf LoRadar}$ can achieve a detection accuracy of 0.99 and reduce the acquisition overhead by up to 90%, compared to the traversal-based methods.},

  abstract     = {mmWave-based activity recognition technology has attracted widespread attention as it provides the ability of device-free, ubiquitous and accurate sensing. Recognition of human activities intrinsically demands to be real-time and continuous, but the state of the arts is still far limited with the capacity in this regard. The main obstacle lies in activity sequence segmentation, i.e., locating the boundaries between consecutive activities in an activity sequence. This is a daunting task, due to the unclear activity boundaries and the variable activity duration. In this paper, we propose ZuMa, the first mmWave-based approach to real-time continuous activity recognition. When resorting to a machine learning model for activity recognition, our insight is that the recognition confidence of the recognition model is highly correlated to the accuracy of activity sequence segmentation, so that the former can be utilized as a feedback metric to finely adjust the segmentation boundaries. Based on this insight, ZuMa is a coarse-to-fine grained approach, which includes the fast coarse-grained activity chunk extraction and the find-grained explicit segmentation adjustment and recognition. We have implemented ZuMa with the commercial mmWave radar and evaluated its performance under various settings. The results demonstrate that ZuMa achieves an average recognition error of 12.67%, which is 65.08% and 71.87% lower than that of the two baseline methods. The average recognition delay of ZuMa is only 1.86 s.},

  abstract     = {Internet access in rural areas should be improved to support digital inclusion and 5G services. Due to the high deployment costs of fiber optics in these areas, Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) has become a preferable alternative. Additionally, the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) can facilitate the interoperability of FWA elements, allowing some FWA functions to be deployed at the edge cloud. However, deploying edge clouds in rural areas can increase network and energy costs. To address these challenges, we propose a closed-loop system assisted by a Digital Twin (DT) to automate energy-aware O-RAN based FWA resource management in rural areas. We consider the FWA and edge cloud as the Physical Twin (PT) and design a closed-loop that distributes radio resources to edge cloud instances for scheduling. We develop another closed-loop for intra-slice resource allocation to houses. We design an energy model that integrates radio resource allocation and formulate ultra-small and small-timescale optimizations for the PT to maximize slice requirement satisfaction while minimizing energy costs. We then design a reinforcement learning approach and successive convex approximation to address the formulated problems. We present a DT that replicates the PT by incorporating solution experiences into future states. The results show that our approach efficiently uses radio and energy resources.},

However, the diversity of users’ viewing patterns and Quality of Experience (QoE) preferences has not been fully addressed yet by existing neural adaptive approaches for viewport prediction and bitrate selection. Their performance can significantly deteriorate when users’ actual viewing patterns and QoE preferences differ considerably from those observed during the training phase, resulting in poor generalization. In this paper, we propose MANSY, a novel streaming system that embraces user diversity to improve generalization. Specifically, to accommodate users’ diverse viewing patterns, we design a Transformer-based viewport prediction model with an efficient multi-viewport trajectory input output architecture based on implicit ensemble learning. Besides, we for the first time combine the advanced representation learning and deep reinforcement learning to train the bitrate selection model to maximize diverse QoE objectives, enabling the model to generalize across users with diverse preferences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MANSY outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in viewport prediction accuracy and QoE improvement on both trained and unseen viewing patterns and QoE preferences, achieving better generalization.},

  abstract     = {Contactless device-free wireless sensing has recently attracted significant interest due to its potential to support a wide range of immersive human-machine interactive applications using ubiquitously available radio frequency (RF) signals. Traditional approaches focus on developing a single global model based on a combined dataset collected from different locations. However, wireless signals are known to be location and environment specific. Thus, a global model results in inconsistent and unreliable sensing results. It is also unrealistic to construct individual models for all the possible locations and environmental scenarios. Motivated by the observation that signals recorded at different locations are closely related to a set of physical-layer semantic features, in this paper we propose SANSee, a semantic-aware networking-based framework for distributed wireless sensing. SANSee allows models constructed in one or a limited number of locations to be transferred to new locations without requiring any locally labeled data or model training. SANSee is built on the concept of physical-layer semantic-aware network (pSAN), which characterizes the semantic similarity and the correlations of sensed data across different locations. A pSAN-based zero-shot transfer learning solution is introduced to allow receivers in new locations to obtain location-specific models by directly aggregating the models trained by other receivers. We theoretically prove that models obtained by SANSee can approach the locally optimal models. Experimental results based on real-world datasets are used to verify that the accuracy of the transferred models obtained by SANSee matches that of the models trained by the locally labeled data based on supervised learning approaches.},

Enterprises upload encrypted spatial data to the mobile cloud to save local storage and computation costs. However, the existing secure Geometric Range Search (GRS) solutions are inefficient in terms of building, updating index structure and querying processes. Moreover, the index structures of existing GRS schemes based on Order Preserving Encryption (OPE) leak location order, which may lead to reconstruction attacks. To solve these issues, we first propose an efficient and secure GRS scheme using Radix-Tree, namely GRSRT-I. Specifically, we construct an index structure based on Radix-tree to achieve efficient search and update, then use homomorphic encryption NTRU to resist chosen-plaintext attack, finally design a dual-server architecture to alleviate the burdens on mobile users caused by multiple rounds of interactions. Furthermore, we propose an enhanced scheme, GRSRT-II, by combining Order-Revealing Encryption and OPE, which greatly improves the search efficiency while slightly reducing the security. We formally prove the security of our proposed schemes, and conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that GRSRT-I can improve the query efficiency by up to at least 1.5 times when compared with previous solutions and GRSRT-II can achieve a higher level of search efficiency.},

However, these systems could be infiltrated by the adversary and the video streams would be modified or replaced, i.e., under the video forgery attack. The prevalence of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and the emergence of Deepfake-like techniques severely emphasize the vulnerability of video surveillance systems under such attacks. To secure existing surveillance systems, in this paper we propose a vision-WiFi cross-modal video forgery detection system, namely WiSil. Leveraging a theoretical model based on the principle of signal propagation, WiSil constructs wave front information of the object in the monitoring area from WiFi signals. With a well-designed deep learning network, WiSil further recovers silhouettes from the wave front information. Based on a Siamese network-based semantic feature extractor, WiSil can eventually determine whether a frame is manipulated by comparing the semantic feature vectors extracted from the video’s silhouette with those extracted from the WiFi’s silhouette. We enhance the basic version of WiSil Fang et al. 2023 by developing a model compression method and a forgery trace localization method. Extensive experiments show that WiSil achieves 95%$+$ accuracy in detecting tampered frames.},

  abstract     = {Mobile edge computing (MEC), along with device-to-device (D2D) assisted MEC (D-MEC), are promising technologies that could improve the quality-of-experience for mobile devices (MDs) by offloading their tasks to edge servers or nearby idle MDs. There is a popular trend to develop distributed task offloading algorithms using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), whose adoption of central critics during training makes the offloading still size-sensitive. Therefore, this paper proposes a Size-Insensitive Task Offloading (SITOff) algorithm for D-MEC based on fully-distributed offloading without maintaining any central venue. Specifically, taking advantage of the inherent graph-like structure of D-MEC, SITOff adopts graphs to represent MDs’ states and relationships and form each MD&#39;s local knowledge about D-MEC through graph computation. Furthermore, considering the limitation of local knowledge in performing whole performance-oriented offloading, each MD utilizes D2D-transmitting to exchange knowledge with its neighbors and form a comprehensive knowledge about D-MEC to enhance the coordination of distributed offloading. Additionally, regarding the different impacts of neighbors’ knowledge, each MD leverages attention mechanisms to selectively learn its neighbors’ knowledge during knowledge-exchange. Extensive experimental results show the superiority of SITOff over state-of-the-art MARL-based offloading algorithms in D-MEC with various MDs, and the easy collaboration of SITOff with curriculum-learning for large-scale D-MEC offloading.},

Most existing methods use reverse engineering to derive the required transmission payload, generating a waveform that the target device can successfully demodulate. However, traditional approaches have certain limitations, including reliance on specific reverse engineering algorithms or the need for manual parameter tuning to reduce emulation distortion. In this work, we present NNCTC, a framework for achieving physical layer cross-technology communication through explainable neural networks, incorporating relevant knowledge from the wireless communication physical layer into the neural network models. We first convert the various signal processing components within the CTC process into neural network models, then build a training framework for the CTC encoder-decoder structure to achieve CTC. NNCTC significantly reduces the complexity of CTC by automatically deriving CTC payloads through training. We demonstrate how NNCTC implements CTC in WiFi systems using OFDM and CCK modulation. On WiFi systems using OFDM modulation, NNCTC outperforms the WEBee and WIDE designs in terms of error performance, achieving an average packet reception ratio (PRR) of 92.3% and an average symbol error rate (SER) as low as 1.3%. In WiFi systems using OFDM modulation, the highest PRR can reach up to 99%.},

The model segmentation without user mobility has been investigated in detail in previous studies. However, in most EI use cases, the end devices are mobile. Few studies have been conducted on this topic. These works still have many issues, such as ignoring the energy consumption of mobile device, inappropriate network assumption, and low effectiveness on adapting user mobility, etc. Therefore, to address the disadvantages of model segmentation and resource allocation in previous studies, we propose mobility and cost aware model segmentation and resource allocation algorithm for accelerating the inference at edge (MCSA). Specifically, in the scenario without user mobility, the loop iteration gradient descent (Li-GD) algorithm is provided. When the mobile user has a large model inference task that needs to be calculated, it will take the energy consumption of mobile user, the communication and computing resource renting cost, and the inference delay into account to find the optimal model segmentation and resource allocation strategy. In the scenario with user mobility, the mobility aware Li-GD (MLi-GD) algorithm is proposed to calculate the optimal strategy. Then, the properties of the proposed algorithms are investigated, including convergence, complexity, and approximation ratio.

Our study adopts the stochastic hybrid systems (SHS) methodology to thoroughly assess the system’s performance. We explore various queueing disciplines, including Last-Come-First-Serve (LCFS) with work-conservative and LCFS with probabilistic routing, to accurately quantify AoI and Peak AoI (PAoI) metrics. We have used the Proactive Obsolete Packet Management (POPMAN) approach to identify and discard obsolete packets proactively, thus enhancing server processing efficiency and ensuring orderly packet reception. We also investigate the following parameters, such as the probability of preemption of packets, the probability of packets getting obsolete, the probability of informative packets, and optimal splitting probabilities. Results show an improvement in both AoI and PAoI within the LCFS with work-conservative queueing system with the integration of the POPMAN method. Furthermore, LCFS with probabilistic routing using the POPMAN approach performs similarly to conventional methods. In all the queueing systems studied, as the arrival rate $\lambda \to \infty$, the average AoI and PAoI approach $1/(\mu _{1}+\mu _{2})$. For c servers, they approach $1/(\mu _{1}+\mu _{2}+\cdots +\mu _{c})$.},

Recent studies have explored cross-modal methods to reduce the need for large training datasets in behavior recognition, but they typically rely on open-source datasets that closely align with the target domain, limiting flexibility and complicating data collection. In this paper, we propose ${\sf Img2Acoustic}$, a novel cross-modal acoustic-based HGR approach that leverages models trained on open-source image datasets (i.e., EMNIST, Omniglot) to effectively recognize custom gestures detected via acoustic signals.

  abstract     = {With the convenient design and prolific functionalities, wireless earbuds are fast penetrating in our daily life and taking over the place of traditional wired earphones. The sensing capabilities of wireless earbuds have attracted great interests of researchers on exploring them as a new interface for human-computer interactions. However, due to its extremely compact size, the interaction on the body of the earbuds is limited and not convenient. In this paper, we propose Ui-Ear, a new on-face gesture recognition system to enrich interaction maneuvers for wireless earbuds. Ui-Ear exploits the sensing capability of Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) to extend the interaction to the skin of the face near ears. The accelerometer and gyroscope in IMUs perceive dynamic vibration signals induced by on-face touching and moving, which brings rich maneuverability. Since IMUs are provided on most of the budget and high-end wireless earbuds, we believe that Ui-Ear has great potential to be adopted pervasively. To demonstrate the feasibility of the system, we define seven different on-face gestures and design an end-to-end learning approach based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for classifying different gestures. To further improve the generalization capability of the system, adversarial learning mechanism is incorporated in the offline training process to suppress the user-specific features while enhancing gesture-related features. We recruit 20 participants and collect a realworld datasets in a common office environment to evaluate the recognition accuracy. The extensive evaluations show that the average recognition accuracy of Ui-Ear is over 95% and 82.3% in the user-dependent and user-independent tasks, respectively. Moreover, we also show that the pre-trained model (learned from user-independent task) can be fine-tuned with only few training samples of the target user to achieve relatively high recognition accuracy (up to 95%). At last, we implement the personalization and recognition components of Ui-Ear on an off-the-shelf Android smartphone to evaluate its system overhead. The results demonstrate Ui-Ear can achieve real-time response while only brings trivial energy consumption on smartphones.},

  abstract     = {The accurate prediction of required resources in terms of storage, computing and bandwidth is essential for 5G to host diverse services. The existing efforts illustrate that it is more promising to efficiently predict the unknown required resources with a third-order tensor compared to the 2D-matrix-based solutions. However, most of them fail to leverage the inherent features hidden in network traffic like temporal stability and service correlation to build a third-order tensor for the multi-dimensional required resource prediction in an intelligent manner, incurring coarse-grained prediction accuracy. Furthermore, it is difficult to build a third-order tensor with rate-varied measurements in 5G due to different lengths of measurement time slots. To address these issues, we propose an Accurate Prediction of Multi-Dimensional Required Resources (APMR) approach in 5G via Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning (FDRL). We first confirm the resource requests originated from different Base Stations (BSs) at varied measurement rates have similar features in service and time domains, but cannot directly form a series of regular tensors. Built on these observations, we reshape these measurement data to form a series of standard third-order tensors with the same size, which include many elements obtained from measurements and some unknown elements needed to be inferred. In order to obtain accurately predicted results, the FDRL-based tensor factorization approach is introduced to intelligently utilize multiple specific iteration rules for local model learning, and the accuracy-aware and latency-based depreciation strategies are exploited to aggregate local models for resource prediction. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that APMR can accurately predict the multi-dimensional required resources compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {The effectiveness of WiFi-based localization systems heavily relies on the spatial accuracy of WiFi AP. In real-world scenarios, factors such as AP rotation and irregular antenna tilt contribute significantly to inaccuracies, surpassing the impact of imprecise AP location and antenna separation. In this paper, we propose Anteumbler, a non-invasive, accurate, and efficient system for measuring the orientation of each antenna in physical space. By leveraging the fact that maximum received power occurs when a Tx-Rx antenna pair is perfectly aligned, we build a spatial angle model capable of determining antennas’ orientations without prior knowledge. However, achieving comprehensive coverage across the spatial angle necessitates extensive sampling points. To enhance efficiency, we exploit the orthogonality of antenna directivity and polarization, and adopt an iterative algorithm, thereby reducing the number of sampling points by several orders of magnitude. Additionally, to attain the required antenna orientation accuracy, we mitigate the influence of propagation distance using a dual plane intersection model while filtering out ambient noise. Our real-world experiments, covering six antenna types, two antenna layouts, two antenna separations ($\lambda /2$ and $\lambda$ ), and three AP heights, demonstrate that Anteumbler achieves median errors below $\text{6}^\circ$ for both elevation and azimuth angles, and exhibits robustness in NLoS and dynamic environments. Moreover, when integrated into the reverse localization system, Anteumbler deployed over LocAP reduces antenna separation error by $10 \,\mathrm{mm}$, while for user localization system, its integration over SpotFi reduces user localization error by more than $1 \,\mathrm{m}$.},

  abstract     = {Backscatter sensing has emerged as a significant technology within the Internet of Things (IoT), prompting extensive research interest. This paper presents LoMu, the first long-range multi-target backscatter sensing system designed for low-cost tags operating under ambient LoRa. LoMuintroduces an orthogonal sensing model that processes backscatter signals from multiple tags to extract motion information. The design addresses several practical challenges, including near-far interference among multiple tags, phase offsets from unsynchronized transceivers, and phase errors due to frequency drift in low-cost tags. To overcome these issues, we propose a conjugate-based energy concentration method to extract high-quality signals and a Hamming-window-based method to mitigate the near-far problem. Additionally, we exploit the relationship between excitation and backscatter signals to synchronize the transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) and combine double sidebands of backscatter signals to eliminate tag frequency drift. Furthermore, a novel joint estimation algorithm is introduced to exploit both amplitude and phase information in target signals, enhancing frequency sensing results and robustness. Our implementation and extensive experiments demonstrate that LoMucan accurately sense up to 35 tags simultaneously and achieve an average frequency sensing error of 0.5% at a range of 400 meters, which is $4\times$ the range of the state-of-the-art.},

  abstract     = {Incorrect brushing methods normally lead to poor oral hygiene, and result in severe oral diseases and complications. While effective brushing can address this issue, individuals often struggle with incorrect brushing, like aggressive brushing, insufficient brushing, and missing brushing. To break this stalemate, in this paper, we proposed LiT, a toothbrushing monitoring system to assess the brushing status on 16 surfaces using the Bass technique. LiT utilizes commercial LED toothbrushes’ blue LEDs as transmitters, and incorporates only two low-cost photodetectors as receivers on the toothbrush head. It is challenging to determine optimal deployment positions and minimize photodetectors number to establish the light transmission channel in oral cavity. To address these challenges, we established mathematical models within the oral cavity based on the two photodetectors’ deployment to theoretically validate the feasibility and prove robustness. Furthermore, we designed a comprehensive framework to fight against the implementation challenges including brushing action separation, light interference on the outer surfaces of front teeth, toothpaste diversity, user variations, brushing hand variability, and incorrect brushings. Experimental results demonstrate that LiT achieves a highly accurate surface recognition rate of 95.3%, an estimated error for brushing duration of 6.1%, and incorrect brushing detection accuracy of 96.9%. Furthermore, LiT retains stable capability under a variety of circumstances, such as various lighting conditions, user movement, toothpaste diversity, and left and right-handed users.},

Simultaneously, we aim to maximize overall user satisfaction throughout the entire flight duration. More specifically, we propose a pick-up and delivery of AAV (PDU) framework to address this problem and this framework consists of two parts. First, a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm is used to obtain the pick-up and delivery (P&amp;D) order of parcels. On the basis of obtaining the P&amp;D order through SA, we further use deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize the flight trajectory of the AAV to ensure the expected communication quality between the AAV and GBSs. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms, we design three baseline strategies for comparison, and also investigate the effect of using the PDU framework with different weights. Finally, numerical results show that the performance of PDU strategy is improved by about 5%-30% compared with other strategies in solving the performance tradeoff of AAV energy consumption, communication quality, and user satisfaction.},

CCT characterizes the average duration between two consecutive successful transmissions of a user, during which all other users successfully accessed the channel at least once. In contrast to existing short-term fairness measures, CCT provides more comprehensive insight into the transient dynamics of communication networks, with a particular focus on users’ delays and jitter. To validate the efficacy of our approach, we analytically characterize the CCTs for two classical communication protocols: slotted Aloha and CSMA/CA. The analysis demonstrates that CSMA/CA exhibits superior short-term fairness over slotted Aloha. Beyond its role as a measurement metric, CCT has broader implications as a guiding principle for the design of future communication networks by emphasizing factors like fairness, delay, and jitter in short-term behaviors.},

We initially formulate the computation offloading problem with the system delay as Delay Markov Decision Processes (DMDPs), and then transform them into the equivalent standard Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). To solve the optimization problem effectively, we employ a double deep Q-network (DDQN) method, enhancing it with an augmented state space to better handle the unique challenges posed by system delays.

  abstract     = {Mobile CrowdSensing (MCS) has emerged as a popular paradigm to engage mobile users in collaborative sensing tasks. However, its performance is hindered by its limited spatiotemporal range and the cost of data collection. An effective strategy is to integrate Sparse MCS with data completion, allowing for unsensed data inference. However, when confronted with situations where sensed data is excessively sparse, data inference results may be unsatisfactory due to several challenges including: 1) uneven data distribution, 2) complex spatiotemporal correlation, and 3) the presence of inference noise. To address these challenges, we propose a model named Spatiotemporal Evolutionary Inference (STEI) that achieves accurate inference of unsensed data in Sparse MCS. Specifically, we complete the unsensed data by uncovering strong local correlations in the data and gradually evolving those correlations to the global situation. In each evolution step, we thoroughly consider the impact of spatiotemporal consistency and difference. To minimize the interference of noise during the evolution process, we design an adaptive coefficient to enhance the dependence on sensed data. Finally, to validate the effectiveness of STEI, we conduct extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments using three popular datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach excels in accurately inferring data, particularly in situations where the distribution of data is notably uneven.},

In this paper, considering the limited cache capacity, unknown popularity distribution and non-stationary user demands, we address this problem by jointly optimizing content caching and routing with the objective of minimizing transmission cost. By optimizing the routing with the route-to-least cost-cache policy, the content caching process is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP), aiming to maximize caching reward. However, the optimization problem consists of multiple nodes selecting caching contents, which leads to the combinatorial increase of the number of action dimensions with the number of possible actions. To handle this curse of dimensionality, we propose an intelligent caching algorithm by embedding action branching architecture into a dueling double deep Q-network (D3QN) to optimize caching decisions, and thus the agent at the controller can adaptively learn and track the underlying dynamics. Considering the independence of each branch, a marginal gain-based replacement rule is proposed to satisfy cache capacity constraint. Our simulation results show that compared with the prior art, the caching reward and hit rate of the proposed algorithm are increased by 35.3% and 33.6% respectively on average.},

In this paper, we explore the possibility of privacy budget recycling and propose a novel ChainDP framework enabling users to carry out data aggregation sequentially to recycle the privacy budget. We establish a sequential game to model the user interactions in our framework. We theoretically show the mathematical nature of the sequential game, solve its Nash Equilibrium, and design an incentive mechanism with provable economic properties. To alleviate potential privacy collusion attacks, we further derive a differentially privacy-guaranteed protocol to avoid holistic exposure. Our numerical simulation validates the effectiveness of ChainDP, showing that it can significantly save privacy budget as well as lower estimation error compared to the traditional LDP mechanism.},

  abstract     = {Recently, a large number of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites have been launched and deployed successfully in space. Due to multimodal sensors equipped by the LEO satellites, they serve not only for communications but also for various machine learning applications. However, a ground station (GS) may be incapable of downloading such a large volume of raw sensing data for centralized model training due to the limited contact time with LEO satellites (e.g. 5 minutes). Therefore, federated learning (FL) has emerged as the promising solution to address this problem via on-device training. Unfortunately, enabling FL on LEO satellites still face three critical challenges: i) heterogeneous computing and memory capabilities, ii) limited downlink/uplink rate, and iii) model staleness. To this end, we propose FedSN as a general FL framework to tackle the above challenges. Specifically, we first present a novel sub-structure scheme to enable heterogeneous local model training considering different computing, memory, and communication constraints on LEO satellites. Additionally, we propose a pseudo-synchronous model aggregation strategy to dynamically schedule model aggregation for compensating model staleness. Extensive experiments with real-world satellite data demonstrate that FedSN framework achieves higher accuracy, lower computing, and communication overhead than the state-of-the-art benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {Network utility maximization (NUM) is a fundamental framework for optimizing next-generation networks. However, self-interested agents with private information pose challenges due to potential system manipulation. To address these challenges, the literature on economic mechanism design has emerged. Existing mechanisms are not suited for large-scale networks due to their complexity, high implementation costs, and difficulty to adapt to dynamic settings. This paper proposes a large-scale mechanism design framework that mitigates these limitations. As the number of agents $I$ approaches infinity, their incentive to misreport decreases rapidly at a rate of $\mathcal {O}(1/I^{2})$. We introduce a superimposable framework applicable to any NUM algorithm without modifications, reducing implementation costs. In the dynamic setting, the large-scale mechanism design framework introduces the decomposability of the problem, enabling agents to align their own interests with the objectives of the dynamic NUM problem. This alignment helps overcome the additional, more stringent incentive constraints encountered in dynamic settings. Extending our results to dynamic settings, we present the design of a Dynamic Large-Scale mechanism with desirable properties and the corresponding Dynamic Superimposable Large-Scale mechanism. Our numerical experiments validate the fact that our proposed schemes are approximately $I$ times faster than the seminal VCG mechanism.},

To ensure a satisfactory user experience, we recognize the importance of considering information uncertainty in resource allocation. Therefore, we explore information uncertainty in edge computing-enabled networks, especially within the complex environment of resource coupling. However, existing methods lack a comprehensive and robust solution for coordinating wireless, transport, and computing resource under this information uncertainty. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a joint optimization of access point (AP) selection, computing node association, and traffic engineering, aiming to maximize network utility under the uncertain conditions of wireless status and application QoS requirements. The constraints under these uncertainties are modeled as chance constraints, complicating the problem&#39;s solvability. We adopt the Bernstein approximation to establish convex conservative approximations of the chance constraints. Given the problem&#39;s substantial size and computational complexity, the alternating direction method of multipliers is employed to solve the approximated problem in a distributed manner. We further derive the closed solutions of the corresponding sub-problems. Extensive simulations validate the superiority of our proposed scheme, demonstrating its ability to achieve a good trade-off between meeting user requirements and optimizing resource utilization.},

  abstract     = {In this golden age of multimedia, realistic content is in high demand with users seeking more immersive and interactive experiences. As a result, new image modalities for 3D representations have emerged in recent years, among which point clouds have deserved especial attention. Naturally, with this increase in demand, efficient storage and transmission became a must, with standardization groups such as MPEG and JPEG entering the scene, as it happened before with other types of visual media. In a surprising development, JPEG issued a Call for Proposals on point cloud coding targeting exclusively learning-based solutions, in parallel to a similar call for image coding. This is a natural consequence of the growing popularity of deep learning, which due to its excellent performances is currently dominant in the multimedia processing field, including coding. This article presents the coding solution selected by JPEG as the best-performing response to the Call for Proposals and adopted as the first version of the JPEG Pleno Point Cloud Coding Verification Model, in practice the first step for developing a standard. The proposed solution offers a novel joint geometry and color approach for point cloud coding, in which a single deep learning model processes both geometry and color simultaneously. To maximize the RD performance for a large range of point clouds, the proposed solution uses down-sampling and learning-based super-resolution as pre- and post-processing steps. Compared to the MPEG point cloud coding standards, the proposed coding solution comfortably outperforms G-PCC, for both geometry, color, and joint quality metrics.},

  abstract     = {Keypoint detection and descriptor matching are two vital steps in the 3D feature extraction framework, but they are difficult to learn in an end-to-end fashion due to their inherent discreteness. To tackle the non-differentiable operations, we formulate feature extraction as a decision-making problem: the network is treated as a policy pool that can make probabilistic estimations for keypoint selection and feature matching, supervised by maximizing a reward expectation of actions. In this way, we propose a novel end-to-end training paradigm of 3D feature extraction based on the stochastic policy gradient method, named Reinforced Detectors and Descriptors (RDD). Firstly, we propose a local-to-global probabilistic keypoint selection module that formulates the sampling probabilities of keypoints in a local-and-global mechanism to yield sparse and accurate keypoints. Secondly, we regard feature matching as an optimal transport problem and an efficient Sinkhorn method is leveraged to solve the optimal matching probabilities. In particular, we carefully design a reward function and derive gradients of probabilistic actions, thus overcoming the discreteness and providing reinforced supervision signals. Since our reward function is calculated from sampled keypoints rather than from randomly sampled points as in existing methods, the gap between training and inference is bridged. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach exceeds the quality of state-of-the-art methods and shows strong generalization ability. Remarkably, our approach can achieve significantly higher Registration Recall than other advanced methods when aligning scenes with a small number of keypoints, due to our highly accurate and repeatable detector.},

  abstract     = {This article develops a Scalable Point Cloud Attribute Compression solution, termed ScalablePCAC. In a two-layer example, ScalablePCAC uses the standard G-PCC at the base layer to directly encode the thumbnail point cloud that is downscaled from the original input, and a learning-based model at the enhancement layer to compress and restore the full-resolution input point cloud conditioned on the base layer reconstruction. As such, the base layer provides a coarse reconstruction of the input point cloud and the enhancement layer further improves the quality. We then adopt a cross-layer rate allocation strategy that flexibly determines the resolution downscaling factor, the quantization parameter of the base layer, and the quality controlling factor of the enhancement layer to adapt the bitrate of the two layers for approximately optimal Rate-Distortion (R-D) performance. We conduct extensive experiments on popular point clouds following the MPEG common test conditions. Results demonstrate that the proposed ScalablePCAC achieves $&amp;gt;$10% BD-BR reduction against the latest G-PCC version 22 (TMC13v22) on the Y component; it also significantly outperforms existing learning-based solutions for point cloud attribute compression, e.g., compared with a recent work showing state-of-the-art performance, it achieves $&amp;gt;$20% BD-BR reduction.},

With the snap increase in the amount and breadth of related research in deep learning for graphs, many important works come in the form of graphs representing the point clouds. In this paper, we present a sampling adaptive graph convolutional network that combines the powerful representation ability of random walk subgraph searching and the essential success of the Fisher vector. Extending from those existing graph representation learning or embedding methods with multi-hop neighbor random searching, we sample multi-scale walk fields by using a steerable exploration-exploitation second order random walk, which endows our model with the most flexibility compared with the original first order random walk. To encode each-scale walk field consisting of several walk paths, specifically, we characterize these paths of walk field by Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) so as to better analogize the standard CNNs on Euclidean modality. Each Gaussian component implicitly defines a direction and all of them properly encode the spatial layout of walk fields after the gradient projecting to the space of Gaussian parameters, i.e. the Fisher vectors. Thereby, we introduce and name our deep graph convolutional network as PointFisher. Comprehensive evaluations on several public datasets well demonstrate the superiority of our proposed learning method over other state-of-the-arts for point cloud classification and segmentation.},

Second, a classification global permutation approach is designed to encrypt the undivided run/size, value (RSV)-based AC groups to achieve larger changes in the block-feature values. Third, to reduce file size expansion while maintaining format compatibility, the DC coefficients are rotated based on the mapped DC differences in the same category, and the nonzero AC coefficients are mapped in the same category. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is superior to existing schemes in terms of security. Notably, the average change rate of block-feature values is increased by at least 20%.

However, existing methods still struggle to achieve complex task objectives while ensuring policy safety during learning and execution phases for black-box systems. To address these challenges, we develop data-driven safe policy optimization (D2SPO), a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based policy improvement method that jointly learns a control barrier function (CBF) for system safety and a linear temporal logic (LTL) guided RL algorithm for complex task objectives. Unlike many existing works that assume known system dynamics, by carefully constructing the data sets and redesigning the loss functions of D2SPO, a provably safe CBF is learned for black-box dynamical systems, which continuously evolves for improved system safety as RL interacts with the environment. To deal with complex task objectives, we take advantage of the capability of LTL in representing the task progress and develop LTL-guided RL policy for efficient completion of various tasks with LTL objectives. Extensive numerical and experimental studies demonstrate that D2SPO outperforms most state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines and can achieve over 95% safety rate and nearly 100% task completion rates.

By constructing a signal fusion bottleneck (SFB), CDSiT can implicitly fuse and classify signal features with complementary structures in different domains.

We focus on the decoder part and show that $\Omega ((Dn/d)^{1/2})$ and $O(\sqrt {Dn})$ nodes are required to transform $n$ vectors in $d$ -dimensional binary space to $D$ - dimensional binary space. We also show that the width can be reduced if we allow small errors, where the error is defined as the average of the Hamming distance between each vector input to the encoder part and the resulting vector output by the decoder.},

  abstract     = {In clustering fields, the deep graph models generally utilize the graph neural network to extract the deep embeddings and aggregate them according to the data structure. The optimization procedure can be divided into two individual stages, optimizing the neural network with gradient descent and generating the aggregation with a machine learning-based algorithm. Hence, it means that clustering results cannot guide the optimization of graph neural networks. Besides, since the aggregating stage involves complicated matrix computation such as decomposition, it brings a high computational burden. To address these issues, a unified deep graph clustering (UDGC) model via online mutual learning is proposed in this brief. Specifically, it maps the data into the deep embedding subspace and extracts the deep graph representation to explore the latent topological knowledge of the nodes. In the deep subspace, the model aggregates the embeddings and generates the clustering assignments via the local preserving loss. More importantly, we train a neural layer to fit the clustering results and design an online mutual learning strategy to optimize the whole model, which can not only output the clustering assignments end-to-end but also reduce the computation complexity. Extensive experiments support the superiority of our model.},

  abstract     = {Communication overhead has become one of the major bottlenecks in the distributed training of modern deep neural networks. With such consideration, various quantization-based stochastic gradient descent (SGD) solvers have been proposed and widely adopted, among which SignSGD with majority vote shows a promising direction because of its communication efficiency and robustness against Byzantine attackers. However, SignSGD fails to converge in the presence of data heterogeneity, which is commonly observed in the emerging federated learning (FL) paradigm. In this article, a sufficient condition for the convergence of the sign-based gradient descent method is derived, based on which a novel magnitude-driven stochastic-sign-based gradient compressor is proposed to address the non-convergence issue of SignSGD. The convergence of the proposed method is established in the presence of arbitrary data heterogeneity. The Byzantine resilience of sign-based gradient descent methods is quantified, and the error-feedback mechanism is further incorporated to boost the learning performance. Experimental results on the MNIST dataset, the CIFAR-10 dataset, and the Tiny-ImageNet dataset corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {Recently, memory-based networks have achieved promising performance for video object segmentation (VOS). However, existing methods still suffer from unsatisfactory segmentation accuracy and inferior efficiency. The reasons are mainly twofold: 1) during memory construction, the inflexible memory storage mechanism results in a weak discriminative ability for similar appearances in complex scenarios, leading to video-level temporal redundancy, and 2) during memory reading, matching robustness and memory retrieval accuracy decrease as the number of video frames increases. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive sparse memory network (ASM) that efficiently and effectively performs VOS by sparsely leveraging previous guidance while attending to key information. Specifically, we design an adaptive sparse memory constructor (ASMC) to adaptively memorize informative past frames according to dynamic temporal changes in video frames. Furthermore, we introduce an attentive local memory reader (ALMR) to quickly retrieve relevant information using a subset of memory, thereby reducing frame-level redundant computation and noise in a simpler and more convenient manner. To prevent key features from being discarded by the subset of memory, we further propose a novel attentive local feature aggregation (ALFA) module, which preserves useful cues by selectively aggregating discriminative spatial dependence from adjacent frames, thereby effectively increasing the receptive field of each memory frame. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance with real-time speed on six popular VOS benchmarks. Furthermore, our ASM can be applied to existing memory-based methods as generic plugins to achieve significant performance improvements. More importantly, our method exhibits robustness in handling sparse videos with low frame rates.},

Motivated to address these challenges, this work develops shielded planning guided policy optimization (SPPO), a new model-based safe RL method that augments policy optimization algorithms with path planning and shielding mechanism. In particular, SPPO is equipped with shielded planning for guided exploration and efficient data collection via model predictive path integral (MPPI), along with an advantage-based shielding rule to keep the above processes safe. Based on the collected safe data, a task-oriented parameter optimization (TOPO) method is used for policy improvement, as well as the observation-independent latent dynamics enhancement. In addition, SPPO provides explicit theoretical guarantees, i.e., clear theoretical bounds for training safety, deployment safety, and the learned policy performance. Experiments demonstrate that SPPO outperforms baselines in terms of policy performance, learning efficiency, and safety performance during training.},

  abstract     = {Multiview clustering (MVC) has gained significant attention as it enables the partitioning of samples into their respective categories through unsupervised learning. However, there are a few issues as follows: 1) many existing deep clustering methods use the same latent features to achieve the conflict objectives, namely, reconstruction and view consistency. The reconstruction objective aims to preserve view-specific features for each individual view, while the view-consistency objective strives to obtain common features across all views; 2) some deep embedded clustering (DEC) approaches adopt view-wise fusion to obtain consensus feature representation. However, these approaches overlook the correlation between samples, making it challenging to derive discriminative consensus representations; and 3) many methods use contrastive learning (CL) to align the view’s representations; however, they do not take into account cluster information during the construction of sample pairs, which can lead to the presence of false negative pairs. To address these issues, we propose a novel multiview representation learning network, called anchor-sharing and clusterwise CL (CwCL) network for multiview representation learning. Specifically, we separate view-specific learning and view-common learning into different network branches, which addresses the conflict between reconstruction and consistency. Second, we design an anchor-sharing feature aggregation (ASFA) module, which learns the sharing anchors from different batch data samples, establishes the bipartite relationship between anchors and samples, and further leverages it to improve the samples’ representations. This module enhances the discriminative power of the common representation from different samples. Third, we design CwCL module, which incorporates the learned transition probability into CL, allowing us to focus on minimizing the similarity between representations from negative pairs with a low transition probability. It alleviates the conflict in previous sample-level contrastive alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art performance.},

However, these works usually apply clustering algorithms, such as $K$ -means, to split the training set and obtain the clustering results independent of label correlation. The structures (e.g., low rank and manifold) learned on such clusters may not efficiently capture label correlation. To solve this problem, we put forward a novel LDL method called LDL by partitioning label distribution manifold (LDL-PLDM). First, it jointly bipartitions the training set and learns the label distribution manifold to model label correlation. Second, it recurses until the reconstruction error of learning the label distribution manifold cannot be reduced. LDL-PLDM achieves label-correlation-related partition results, on which the learned label distribution manifold can better capture label correlation. We conduct extensive experiments to justify that LDL-PLDM statistically outperforms state-of-the-art LDL methods.},

  abstract     = {Partial multilabel learning (PML) addresses the issue of noisy supervision, which contains an overcomplete set of candidate labels for each instance with only a valid subset of training data. Using label enhancement techniques, researchers have computed the probability of a label being ground truth. However, enhancing labels in the noisy label space makes it impossible for the existing partial multilabel label enhancement methods to achieve satisfactory results. Besides, few methods simultaneously involve the ambiguity problem, the feature space’s redundancy, and the model’s efficiency in PML. To address these issues, this article presents a novel joint partial multilabel framework using broad learning systems (namely BLS-PML) with three innovative mechanisms: 1) a trustworthy label space is reconstructed through a novel label enhancement method to avoid the bias caused by noisy labels; 2) a low-dimensional feature space is obtained by a confidence-based dimensionality reduction method to reduce the effect of redundancy in the feature space; and 3) a noise-tolerant BLS is proposed by adding a dimensionality reduction layer and a trustworthy label layer to deal with PML problem. We evaluated it on six real-world and seven synthetic datasets, using eight state-of-the-art partial multilabel algorithms as baselines and six evaluation metrics. Out of 144 experimental scenarios, our method significantly outperforms the baselines by about 80%, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in handling partial multilabel tasks.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of modern industry and the increasing prominence of artificial intelligence, data-driven process monitoring methods have gained significant popularity in industrial systems. Traditional static monitoring models struggle to represent the new modes that arise in industrial production processes due to changes in production environments and operating conditions. Retraining these models to address the changes often leads to high computational complexity. To address this issue, we propose a multimode process monitoring method based on element-aware lifelong dictionary learning (EaLDL). This method initially treats dictionary elements as fundamental units and measures the global importance of dictionary elements from the perspective of the multimode global learning process. Subsequently, to ensure that the dictionary can represent new modes without losing the representation capability of historical modes during the updating process, we construct a novel surrogate loss to impose constraints on the update of dictionary elements. This constraint enables the continuous updating of the dictionary learning (DL) method to accommodate new modes without compromising the representation of previous modes. Finally, to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we perform comprehensive experiments on numerical simulations as well as an industrial process. A comparison is made with several advanced process monitoring methods to assess its performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves a favorable balance between learning new modes and retaining the memory of historical modes. Moreover, the proposed method exhibits insensitivity to initial points, delivering satisfactory results under various initial conditions.},

In recent years, numerous studies have centered on leveraging deep neural networks to estimate the label transition matrix for individual instances within the context of instance-dependent noise. However, these methods suffer from low search efficiency due to the large space of feasible solutions. Behind this drawback, we have explored that the real murderer lies in the invalid class transitions, that is, the actual transition probability between certain classes is zero but is estimated to have a certain value. To mask the invalid class transitions, we introduced a human-cognition-assisted method with structural information from human cognition. Specifically, we introduce a structured transition matrix network (STMN) designed with an adversarial learning process to balance instance features and prior information from human cognition. The proposed method offers two advantages: 1) better estimation effectiveness is obtained by sparing the transition matrix and 2) better estimation accuracy is obtained with the assistance of human cognition. By exploiting these two advantages, our method parametrically estimates a sparse label transition matrix, effectively converting noisy labels into true labels. The efficiency and superiority of our proposed method are substantiated through comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods on three synthetic datasets and a real-world dataset.

In many industrial practices, RUL prediction algorithms are deployed on edge devices for real-time response. However, the high computational cost of deep learning models makes it difficult to meet the requirements of edge intelligence. In this article, a lightweight group transformer with multihierarchy time-series reduction (GT-MRNet) is proposed to alleviate this problem. Different from most existing RUL methods computing all time series, GT-MRNet can adaptively select necessary time steps to compute the RUL. First, a lightweight group transformer is constructed to extract features by employing group linear transformation with significantly fewer parameters. Then, a time-series reduction strategy is proposed to adaptively filter out unimportant time steps at each layer. Finally, a multihierarchy learning mechanism is developed to further stabilize the performance of time-series reduction. Extensive experimental results on the real-world condition datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly reduce up to 74.7% parameters and 91.8% computation cost without sacrificing accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Incomplete multiview clustering (IMVC) has received extensive attention in recent years. However, existing works still have several shortcomings: 1) some works ignore the correlation of sample pairs in the global structural distribution; 2) many methods are computational expensive, thus cannot be applicable to the large-scale incomplete data clustering tasks; and 3) some methods ignore the refinement of the bipartite graph structure. To address the above issues, we propose a novel anchor graph network for IMVC, which includes a generative model and a similarity metric network. Concretely, the method uses a generative model to construct bipartite graphs, which can mine latent global structure distributions of sample pairs. Later, we use graph convolution network (GCN) with the constructed bipartite graphs to learn the structural embeddings. Notably, the introduction of bipartite graphs can greatly reduce the computational complexity and thus enable our model to handle large-scale data. Unlike previous works based on bipartite graph, our method employs bipartite graphs to guide the learning process in GCNs. In addition, an innovative adaptive learning strategy that can construct robust bipartite graphs is incorporated into our method. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves the comparable or superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.},

In order to reduce the amount of data transmission and develop ETMs for continuous-time and discrete-time delayed nonlinear systems (NSs) simultaneously, this article investigates quasi-synchronization (QS) of NSs on time scales based on a novel ETM, which is designed according to the convergence rate instead of measurement errors of the addressed systems. First, a novel ETM is designed under known nonlinear dynamics, and it is demonstrated that QS with given convergence rate and error level can be achieved under matrix inequality criteria. Second, if the nonlinear functions are unknown, we adapt our ETM to handle this special case. Not only QS but also complete synchronization with given convergence rate can be achieved under the ETMs. If the constructed Lyapunov functions passes through 0, the designed ETM will keep it at the origin. In this case, finite-time synchronization is achieved. Third, under the designed ETMs, it is proved that Zeno behavior can be excluded. At last, four numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the feasibility and the advantage of the designed ETMs in this article.},

Furthermore, the implementation of the encoding–decoding mechanism in the communication network aims to accommodate the limited bandwidth. The objective of this study is to propose a set-membership estimation algorithm that accurately estimates the state of the ANN without being influenced by the unknown input while accounting for the SR and the encoding–decoding mechanism.

The PTANN model incorporates a novel adaptive parameter and activation function, enabling it to achieve strongly predefined-time convergence. Unlike traditional time-varying parameters that increase over time, the adaptive parameter is proportional to the error norm, thereby better allocating computational resources and improving efficiency. To further enhance efficiency, the ET-PTANN model combines an event trigger with the evolution formula, resulting in the adjustment of step size and reduction of computation frequency compared to the PTANN model. By conducting mathematical derivations, the article derives the upper bound of convergence time for the proposed neural network models and determines the minimum execution interval for the event trigger. A simulation example demonstrates that the PTANN and ET-PTANN models outperform other related neural network models in terms of computational efficiency and convergence rate. Finally, the practicality of the PTANN and ET-PTANN models is demonstrated through their application for mobile sound source localization.},

  abstract     = {Deep multiview clustering (MVC) is to learn and utilize the rich relations across different views to enhance the clustering performance under a human-designed deep network. However, most existing deep MVCs meet two challenges. First, most current deep contrastive MVCs usually select the same instance across views as positive pairs and the remaining instances as negative pairs, which always leads to inaccurate contrastive learning (CL). Second, most deep MVCs only consider learning feature or cluster correlations across views, failing to explore the dual correlations. To tackle the above challenges, in this article, we propose a novel deep MVC framework by pseudo-label guided CL and dual correlation learning. Specifically, a novel pseudo-label guided CL mechanism is designed by using the pseudo-labels in each iteration to help removing false negative sample pairs, so that the CL for the feature distribution alignment can be more accurate, thus benefiting the discriminative feature learning. Different from most deep MVCs learning only one kind of correlation, we investigate both the feature and cluster correlations among views to discover the rich and comprehensive relations. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over many state-of-the-art compared deep MVCs.

  abstract     = {Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) aims to distinguish between the background and anomalies in a scene, which has been widely adopted in various applications. Deep neural network (DNN)-based methods have emerged as the predominant solution, wherein the standard paradigm is to discern the background and anomalies based on the error of self-supervised hyperspectral image (HSI) reconstruction. However, current DNN-based methods cannot guarantee correspondence between the background, anomalies, and reconstruction error, which limits the performance of HAD. In this article, we propose a novel gated transformer network for HAD (GT-HAD). Our key observation is that the spatial–spectral similarity in HSI can effectively distinguish between the background and anomalies, which aligns with the fundamental definition of HAD. Consequently, we develop GT-HAD to exploit the spatial–spectral similarity during HSI reconstruction. GT-HAD consists of two distinct branches that model the features of the background and anomalies, respectively, with content similarity as constraints. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive gating unit to regulate the activation states of these two branches based on a content-matching method (CMM). Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of GT-HAD. The original code is publicly available at https://github.com/jeline0110/ GT-HAD, along with a comprehensive benchmark of state-of-the-art HAD methods.},

In this article, we propose a fractional tensor recurrent model, where the tensor degree $p$ is extended from the discrete domain to the continuous domain, so it is effectively learnable from various datasets. Theoretically, we prove that a large degree $p$ is essential to achieve the long memory effect in a tensor recurrent model, yet it could lead to unstable dynamical behaviors. Hence, our new model, named fractional tensor recurrent unit (fTRU), is expected to seek the saddle point between long memory property and model stability during the training.

Among all the proposed methods, self-supervised learning (SSL) methods, which effectively extract the hidden essential inductive patterns relying only on the support sets, have achieved promising performance. However, the existing SSL methods simply cut down connections between high-frequency and long-tail relations, which ignores the fact, i.e., the two kinds of information could be highly related to each other. Specifically, we observe that relations with similar contextual meanings, called aliasing relations (ARs), may have similar attributes. In other words, the ARs of the target long-tail relation could be in high-frequency, and leveraging such attributes can largely improve the reasoning performance. Based on the interesting observation above, we proposed a novel Self-supervised learning model by leveraging Aliasing Relations to assist FS-KGR, termed SARF. Specifically, we propose a graph neural network (GNN)-based AR-assist module to encode the ARs. Besides, we further provide two fusion strategies, i.e., simple summation and learnable fusion, to fuse the generated representations, which contain extra abundant information underlying the ARs, into the self-supervised reasoning backbone for performance enhancement. Extensive experiments on three few-shot benchmarks demonstrate that SARF achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared with other methods in most cases.},

  abstract     = {The human brain is a highly complex neurological system that has been the subject of continuous exploration by scientists. With the help of modern neuroimaging techniques, there has been significant progress made in brain disorder analysis. There is an increasing interest about utilizing artificial intelligence techniques to improve the efficiency of disorder diagnosis in recent years. However, these methods rely only on neuroimaging data for disorder diagnosis and do not explore the pathogenic mechanism behind the disorder or provide an interpretable result toward the diagnosis decision. Furthermore, the scarcity of medical data limits the performance of existing methods. As the hot application of graph neural networks (GNNs) in molecular graphs and drug discovery due to its strong graph-structured data learning ability, whether GNNs can also play a huge role in the field of brain disorder analysis. Thus, in this work, we innovatively model brain neuroimaging data into graph-structured data and propose knowledge distillation (KD) guided brain subgraph neural networks to extract discriminative subgraphs between patient and healthy brain graphs to explain which brain regions and abnormal functional connectivities cause the disorder. Specifically, we introduce the KD technique to transfer the knowledge of pretrained teacher model to guide brain subgraph neural networks training and alleviate the problem of insufficient training data. And these discriminative subgraphs are conducive to learn better brain graph-level representations for disorder prediction. We conduct abundant experiments on two functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets, i.e., Parkinson’s disease (PD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and experimental results well demonstrate the superiority of our method over other brain graph analysis methods for disorder prediction accuracy. The interpretable experimental results given by our method are consistent with corresponding medical research, which is encouraging to provide a potential for deeper brain disorder study.},

  abstract     = {Learning discriminative representation with limited training samples is emerging as an important yet challenging visual categorization task. While prior work has shown that incorporating self-supervised learning can improve performance, we found that the direct use of canonical metric in a Lie group is theoretically incorrect. In this article, we prove that a valid optimization measurement should be a canonical metric on Lie algebra. Based on the theoretical finding, this article introduces a novel self-supervised Lie algebra network (SLA-Net) representation learning framework. Via minimizing canonical metric distance between target and predicted Lie algebra representation within a computationally convenient vector space, SLA-Net avoids computing nontrivial geodesic (locally length-minimizing curve) metric on a manifold (curved space). By simultaneously optimizing a single set of parameters shared by self-supervised learning and supervised classification, the proposed SLA-Net gains improved generalization capability. Comprehensive evaluation results on eight public datasets show the effectiveness of SLA-Net for visual categorization with limited samples.},

  abstract     = {To obtain smoother kinematic control of minimum motion, a novel snap-layer minimum motion scheme, otherwise known as the minimum motion planning and control (MMPC) scheme for redundant robot arms, is proposed for the first time in this study. With the primary task of tracking planned paths and the consideration of satisfying five-layer physical limits, the snap-layer MMPC problem is transformed into a quadratic programming (QP) problem. Five-layer physical limits include angle-layer, velocity-layer, acceleration-layer, jerk-layer, and snap-layer limits, which are all considered and then transformed into a unified-layer bounded constraint through Zhang neural dynamics (ZND) equivalency. Furthermore, the snap-layer performance index and equation constraint are derived by utilizing the ZND formula. Therefore, the proposed snap-layer MMPC scheme is formulated as a standard QP that can avoid the potential physical damage of redundant robot arms. The snap-layer projection neural dynamics (PND) solver is presented and used to acquire the neural solution of the QP. Simulation results on a 6-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) planar redundant robot arm are presented to substantiate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed snap-layer MMPC scheme by comparing it with the jerk-layer MMPC scheme and the minimum snap norm (MSN) scheme.},

  abstract     = {Attribute graphs are a crucial data structure for graph communities. However, the presence of redundancy and noise in the attribute graph can impair the aggregation effect of integrating two different heterogeneous distributions of attribute and structural features, resulting in inconsistent and distorted data that ultimately compromises the accuracy and reliability of attribute graph learning. For instance, redundant or irrelevant attributes can result in overfitting, while noisy attributes can lead to underfitting. Similarly, redundant or noisy structural features can affect the accuracy of graph representations, making it challenging to distinguish between different nodes or communities. To address these issues, we propose the embedded fusion graph auto-encoder framework for self-supervised learning (SSL), which leverages multitask learning to fuse node features across different tasks to reduce redundancy. The embedding fusion graph auto-encoder (EFGAE) framework comprises two phases: pretraining (PT) and downstream task learning (DTL). During the PT phase, EFGAE uses a graph auto-encoder (GAE) based on adversarial contrastive learning to learn structural and attribute embeddings separately and then fuses these embeddings to obtain a representation of the entire graph. During the DTL phase, we introduce an adaptive graph convolutional network (AGCN), which is applied to graph neural network (GNN) classifiers to enhance recognition for downstream tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques in terms of accuracy, generalization ability, and robustness.},

In this article, we propose a novel approach based on multitask learning (MTL) for solving multiple NPEs. The solution procedure is outlined as follows. First, we model each NPE as a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using neurodynamic optimization. Second, for each ODE system, we use a physics-informed neural network (PINN) as the solution. Third, we use a multibranch MTL framework, where each branch corresponds to a PINN model. This allows us to solve multiple NPEs in parallel by training a single neural network model. Experimental results show that our approach has superior computational performance, especially when the number of NPEs to be solved is large.},

Specifically, the equivalence between HJBE and MF-HJBE is first bridged from the perspective of the uniqueness of the solution of the HJBE. Furthermore, it is proven that once the solution of MF-HJBE exists, its corresponding control input renders the system asymptotically stable and optimizes the cost function. To solve the MF-HJBE, the two agents composing the synergetic learning (SL) system, the critic agent and the actor agent, can evolve in real-time using only the system state data. By building an experience reply (ER)-based learning rule, it is proven that when the critic agent evolves toward the optimal cost function, the actor agent not only evolves toward the optimal control, but also guarantees the asymptotic stability of the system. Finally, simulations of the F16 aircraft system and the Van der Pol oscillator are conducted and the results support the feasibility of the developed SLA.},

Although several existing unsupervised GSL has achieved superior performance in different graph analytical tasks, how to utilize the popular graph masked autoencoder to sufficiently acquire effective supervision information from the data itself for improving the effectiveness of learned graph structure has been not effectively explored so far. To tackle the above issue, we present a multilevel contrastive graph masked autoencoder (MCGMAE) for unsupervised GSL. Specifically, we first introduce a graph masked autoencoder with the dual feature masking strategy to reconstruct the same input graph-structured data under the original structure generated by the data itself and learned graph-structure scenarios, respectively. And then, the inter- and intra-class contrastive loss is introduced to maximize the mutual information in feature and graph-structure reconstruction levels simultaneously. More importantly, the above inter- and intra-class contrastive loss is also applied to the graph encoder module for further strengthening their agreement at the feature-encoder level. In comparison to the existing unsupervised GSL, our proposed MCGMAE can effectively improve the training robustness of the unsupervised GSL via different-level supervision information from the data itself. Extensive experiments on three graph analytical tasks and eight datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed MCGMAE.},

  abstract     = {Continual learning (CL) aims at studying how to learn new knowledge continuously from data streams without catastrophically forgetting the previous knowledge. One of the key problems is catastrophic forgetting, that is, the performance of the model on previous tasks declines significantly after learning the subsequent task. Several studies addressed it by replaying samples stored in the buffer when training new tasks. However, the data imbalance between old and new task samples results in two serious problems: information suppression and weak feature discriminability. The former refers to the information in the sufficient new task samples suppressing that in the old task samples, which is harmful to maintaining the knowledge since the biased output worsens the consistency of the same sample’s output at different moments. The latter refers to the feature representation being biased to the new task, which lacks discrimination to distinguish both old and new tasks. To this end, we build an imbalance mitigation for CL (IMCL) framework that incorporates a decoupled knowledge distillation (DKD) approach and a dual enhanced contrastive learning (DECL) approach to tackle both problems. Specifically, the DKD approach alleviates the suppression of the new task on the old tasks by decoupling the model output probability during the replay stage, which better maintains the knowledge of old tasks. The DECL approach enhances both low- and high-level features and fuses the enhanced features to construct contrastive loss to effectively distinguish different tasks. Extensive experiments on three popular datasets show that our method achieves promising performance under task incremental learning (Task-IL), class incremental learning (Class-IL), and domain incremental learning (Domain-IL) settings.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a novel module called middle spectrum grouped convolution (MSGC) for efficient deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) with the mechanism of grouped convolution. It explores the broad “middle spectrum” area between channel pruning and conventional grouped convolution. Compared with channel pruning, MSGC can retain most of the information from the input feature maps due to the group mechanism; compared with grouped convolution, MSGC benefits from the learnability, the core of channel pruning, for constructing its group topology, leading to better channel division. The middle spectrum area is unfolded along four dimensions: groupwise, layerwise, samplewise, and attentionwise, making it possible to reveal more powerful and interpretable structures. As a result, the proposed module acts as a booster that can reduce the computational cost of the host backbones for general image recognition with even improved predictive accuracy. For example, in the experiments on the ImageNet dataset for image classification, MSGC can reduce the multiply–accumulates (MACs) of ResNet-18 and ResNet-50 by half but still increase the Top-1 accuracy by more than 1%. With a 35% reduction of MACs, MSGC can also increase the Top-1 accuracy of the MobileNetV2 backbone. Results on the MS COCO dataset for object detection show similar observations.

Extensive results on both simulation and real-world datasets show that strong duality holds, the dual network does not depend on initialization and optimizer, and enables faster convergence than the state-of-the-art two-layer network.

  abstract     = {Model compression methods are being developed to bridge the gap between the massive scale of neural networks and the limited hardware resources on edge devices. Since most real-world applications deployed on resource-limited hardware platforms typically have multiple hardware constraints simultaneously, most existing model compression approaches that only consider optimizing one single hardware objective are ineffective. In this article, we propose an automated pruning method called multi-constrained model compression (MCMC) that allows for the optimization of multiple hardware targets, such as latency, floating point operations (FLOPs), and memory usage, while minimizing the impact on accuracy. Specifically, we propose an improved multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) algorithm, the one-stage envelope deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm, to determine the pruning strategy for neural networks. Our improved one-stage envelope DDPG algorithm reduces exploration time and offers greater flexibility in adjusting target priorities, enhancing its suitability for pruning tasks. For instance, on the visual geometry group (VGG)-16 network, our method achieved an 80% reduction in FLOPs, a $2.31\times $ reduction in memory usage, and a $1.92\times $ acceleration, with an accuracy improvement of 0.09% compared with the baseline. For larger datasets, such as ImageNet, we reduced FLOPs by 50% for MobileNet-V1, resulting in a $4.7\times $ faster speed and $1.48\times $ memory compression, while maintaining the same accuracy. When applied to edge devices, such as JETSON XAVIER NX, our method resulted in a 71% reduction in FLOPs for MobileNet-V1, leading to a $1.63\times $ faster speed, $1.64\times $ memory compression, and an accuracy improvement.},

Neural decoding aims to reconstruct the original stimuli that trigger neural responses. With the recent upsurge of artificial intelligence, neural decoding provides an insightful perspective for designing novel algorithms of brain–machine interface. For humans, vision is the dominant contributor to the interaction between the external environment and the brain. In this study, utilizing the retinal neural spike data collected over multi trials with visual stimuli of two movies with different levels of scene complexity, we used a neural network decoder to quantify the decoded visual stimuli with six different metrics for image quality assessment establishing comprehensive inspection of decoding. With the detailed and systematical study of the effect and single and multiple trials of data, different noise in spikes, and blurred images, our results provide an in-depth investigation of decoding dynamical visual scenes using retinal spikes. These results provide insights into the neural coding of visual scenes and services as a guideline for designing next-generation decoding algorithms of neuroprosthesis and other devices of brain–machine interface.},

  abstract     = {There are hundreds of high- and low-altitude earth observation satellites that asynchronously capture massive-scale aerial photographs every day. Generally, high-altitude satellites take low-resolution (LR) aerial pictures, each covering a considerably large area. In contrast, low-altitude satellites capture high-resolution (HR) aerial photos, each depicting a relatively small area. Accurately discovering the semantics of LR aerial photos is an indispensable technique in computer vision. Nevertheless, it is also a challenging task due to: 1) the difficulty to characterize human hierarchical visual perception and 2) the intolerable human resources to label sufficient training data. To handle these problems, a novel cross-resolution perceptual knowledge propagation (CPKP) framework is proposed, focusing on adapting the visual perceptual experiences deeply learned from HR aerial photos to categorize LR ones. Specifically, by mimicking the human vision system, a novel low-rank model is designed to decompose each LR aerial photo into multiple visually/semantically salient foreground regions coupled with the background nonsalient regions. This model can: 1) produce a gaze-shifting path (GSP) simulating human gaze behavior and 2) engineer the deep feature for each GSP. Afterward, a kernel-induced feature selection (FS) algorithm is formulated to obtain a succinct set of deep GSP features discriminative across LR and HR aerial photos. Based on the selected features, the labels from LR and HR aerial photos are collaboratively utilized to train a linear classifier for categorizing LR ones. It is worth emphasizing that, such a CPKP mechanism can effectively optimize the linear classifier training, as labels of HR aerial photos are acquired more conveniently in practice. Comprehensive visualization results and comparative study have validated the superiority of our approach.},

Unlike the previous image-to-image transfer approaches, text-guided stylization progress provides users with a more precise and intuitive way to express the desired style. However, the huge discrepancy between cross-modal inputs/outputs makes it challenging to conduct text-driven image stylization in a typical feed-forward CNN pipeline. In this article, we present DiffStyler, a dual diffusion processing architecture to control the balance between the content and style of the diffused results. The cross-modal style information can be easily integrated as guidance during the diffusion process step-by-step. Furthermore, we propose a content image-based learnable noise on which the reverse denoising process is based, enabling the stylization results to better preserve the structure information of the content image. We validate the proposed DiffStyler beyond the baseline methods through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments. The code is available at https://github.com/haha-lisa/Diffstyler.},

  abstract     = {Point cloud-based 3-D object detection is a significant and critical issue in numerous applications. While most existing methods attempt to capitalize on the geometric characteristics of point clouds, they neglect the internal semantic properties of point and the consistency between the semantic and geometric clues. We introduce a semantic consistency (SC) mechanism for 3-D object detection in this article, by reasoning about the semantic relations between 3-D object boxes and its internal points. This mechanism is based on a natural principle: the semantic category of a 3-D bounding box should be consistent with the categories of all points within the box. Driven by the SC mechanism, we propose a novel SC network (SCNet) to detect 3-D objects from point clouds. Specifically, the SCNet is composed of a feature extraction module, a detection decision module, and a semantic segmentation module. In inference, the feature extraction and the detection decision modules are used to detect 3-D objects. In training, the semantic segmentation module is jointly trained with the other two modules to produce more robust and applicable model parameters. The performance is greatly boosted through reasoning about the relations between the output 3-D object boxes and segmented points. The proposed SC mechanism is model-agnostic and can be integrated into other base 3-D object detection models. We test the proposed model on three challenging indoor and outdoor benchmark datasets: ScanNetV2, SUN RGB-D, and KITTI. Furthermore, to validate the universality of the SC mechanism, we implement it in three different 3-D object detectors. The experiments show that the performance is impressively improved and the extensive ablation studies also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) makes it possible for multiple clients to collaboratively train a machine-learning model through communicating models instead of data, reducing privacy risk. Thus, FL is more suitable for processing data security and privacy for intelligent systems and applications. Unfortunately, there are several challenges in FL, such as the low training accuracy for nonindependent and identically distributed (non-IID) data and the high cost of computation and communication. Considering these, we propose a novel FL framework named dynamic sparse federated contrastive learning (DSFedCon). DSFedCon combines FL with dynamic sparse (DSR) training of network pruning and contrastive learning to improve model performance and reduce computation costs and communication costs. We analyze DSFedCon from the perspective of accuracy, communication, and security, demonstrating it is communication-efficient and safe. To give a practical evaluation for non-IID data training, we perform experiments and comparisons on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets with different parameters of Dirichlet distribution. Results indicate that DSFedCon can get higher accuracy and better communication cost than other state-of-the-art methods in these two datasets. More precisely, we show that DSFedCon has a 4.67-time speedup of communication rounds in MNIST, a 7.5-time speedup of communication rounds in CIFAR-10, and an 18.33-time speedup of communication rounds in CIFAR-100 dataset while achieving the same training accuracy.},

Extensive CIFAR-10/100 experiments on the different VGG, ResNet, WideResNet, ViT architectures, and optimizers show a negative correlation between the dataset-distraction stability and generalizability. With the distraction stability, we decompose the learning process on the training set $\mathcal {S}$ into multiple learning processes on the subsets of $\mathcal {S}$ drawn from simpler distributions, i.e., distributions of smaller intrinsic dimensions (IDs), and furthermore, a tighter generalization bound is derived.

  abstract     = {Time-series anomaly detection is a critical task with significant impact as it serves a pivotal role in the field of data mining and quality management. Current anomaly detection methods are typically based on reconstruction or forecasting algorithms, as these methods have the capability to learn compressed data representations and model time dependencies. However, most methods rely on learning normal distribution patterns, which can be difficult to achieve in real-world engineering applications. Furthermore, real-world time-series data is highly imbalanced, with a severe lack of representative samples for anomalous data, which can lead to model learning failure. In this article, we propose a novel end-to-end unsupervised framework called the parallel-attention transformer (PAFormer), which discriminates anomalies by modeling both the global characteristics and local patterns of time series. Specifically, we construct parallel-attention (PA), which includes two core modules: the global enhanced representation module (GERM) and the local perception module (LPM). GERM consists of two pattern units and a normalization module, with attention weights that indicate the relationship of each data point to the whole series (global). Due to the rarity of anomalous points, they have strong associations with adjacent data points. LPM is composed of a learnable Laplace kernel function that learns the neighborhood relevancies through the distributional properties of the kernel function (local). We employ the PA to learn the global-local distributional differences for each data point, which enables us to discriminate anomalies. Finally, we propose a two-stage adversarial loss to optimize the model. We conduct experiments on five public benchmark datasets (real-world datasets) and one synthetic dataset. The results show that PAFormer outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.},

  abstract     = {Our brains extract durable, generalizable knowledge from transient experiences of the world. Artificial neural networks come nowhere close to this ability. When tasked with learning to classify objects by training on nonrepeating video frames in temporal order (online stream learning), models that learn well from shuffled datasets catastrophically forget old knowledge upon learning new stimuli. We propose a new continual learning algorithm, compositional replay using memory blocks (CRUMB), which mitigates forgetting by replaying feature maps reconstructed by combining generic parts. CRUMB concatenates trainable and reusable “memory block” vectors to compositionally reconstruct feature map tensors in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Storing the indices of memory blocks used to reconstruct new stimuli enables memories of the stimuli to be replayed during later tasks. This reconstruction mechanism also primes the neural network to minimize catastrophic forgetting by biasing it toward attending to information about object shapes more than information about image textures and stabilizes the network during stream learning by providing a shared feature-level basis for all training examples. These properties allow CRUMB to outperform an otherwise identical algorithm that stores and replays raw images while occupying only 3.6% as much memory. We stress-tested CRUMB alongside 13 competing methods on seven challenging datasets. To address the limited number of existing online stream learning datasets, we introduce two new benchmarks by adapting existing datasets for stream learning. With only 3.7%–4.1% as much memory and 15%–43% as much runtime, CRUMB mitigates catastrophic forgetting more effectively than the state-of-the-art.

To address this issue, existing methods adjust their balance by directly tuning their coefficients. However, these methods suffer from a tradeoff uncertainty, i.e., nondynamic regulation over iterations and inflexible hyperparameters for learning tasks. Accordingly, we make the first attempt to introduce an evolutionary VAE (eVAE), building on the variational information bottleneck (VIB) theory and integrative evolutionary neural learning. eVAE integrates a variational genetic algorithm (VGA) into VAE with variational evolutionary operators, including variational mutation (V-mutation), crossover, and evolution. Its training mechanism synergistically and dynamically addresses and updates the learning tradeoff uncertainty in the evidence lower bound (ELBO) without additional constraints and hyperparameter tuning. Furthermore, eVAE presents an evolutionary paradigm to tune critical factors of VAEs and addresses the premature convergence and random search problem in integrating evolutionary optimization into deep learning. Experiments show that eVAE addresses the KL-vanishing problem for text generation with low reconstruction loss, generates all the disentangled factors with sharp images, and improves image generation quality. eVAE achieves better disentanglement, generation performance, and generation–inference balance than its competitors.

  abstract     = {Recently, the massive growth of IoT devices and Internet data, which are widely used in many applications, including industry and healthcare, has dramatically increased the amount of free unlabeled data collected. However, this unlabeled data is useless if we want to learn supervised machine learning models. The expensive and time-consuming cost of labeling makes the problem even more challenging. Here, the active learning (AL) technique provides a solution by labeling small but highly informative and representative data, which guarantees a high degree of generalizability over space and improves classification performance with data we have never seen before. The task is more difficult when the active learner has no predefined knowledge, such as initial training data, and when the obtained data is incomplete (i.e., contains missing values). In previous studies, the missing data should first be imputed. Then, the active learner selects from the available unlabeled data, regardless of whether the points were originally observed or imputed. However, selecting inaccurate imputed data points would negatively affect the active learner and prevent it from selecting informative and/or representative points, thus reducing the overall classification performance of the prediction models. This motivated us to introduce a novel query selection strategy that accounts for imputation uncertainty when querying new points. For this purpose, we first introduce a novel multiple imputation method that considers feature importance in selecting the most promising feature groups for missing value estimation. This multiple imputation method provides the ability to quantify the imputation uncertainty of each imputed data point. Furthermore, in each of the two phases of the proposed active learner (exploration and exploitation), imputation uncertainty is taken into account to reduce the probability of selecting points with high imputation uncertainty. We tested the effectiveness of the proposed active learner on different binary and multiclass datasets with different missing rates.},

Recently, the deformable alignment-based VSR methods are becoming increasingly popular. In these methods, the features extracted from video are aligned to eliminate the motion error targeting high super-resolution (SR) quality. However, these methods often suffer from misalignment and the lack of enough temporal information to compose HR frames, which accordingly induce artifacts in the SR result. In this article, we design a deep VSR network (DVSRNet) based on the proposed progressive deformable alignment (PDA) module and temporal-sparse enhancement (TSE) module. Specifically, the PDA module is designed to accurately align features and to eliminate artifacts via the bidirectional information propagation. The TSE module is constructed to further eliminate artifacts and to generate clear details for the HR frame. In addition, we construct a lightweight deep optical flow network (OFNet) to obtain the bidirectional optical flows for the implementation of the PDA module. Moreover, two new loss functions are designed for our proposed method. The first one is adopted in OFNet and the second one is constructed to guarantee the generation of sharp and clear details for the HR frames.

  abstract     = {With the development of various applications, such as recommendation systems and social network analysis, graph data have been ubiquitous in the real world. However, graphs usually suffer from being absent during data collection due to copyright restrictions or privacy-protecting policies. The graph absence could be roughly grouped into attribute-incomplete and attribute-missing cases. Specifically, attribute-incomplete indicates that a portion of the attribute vectors of all nodes are incomplete, while attribute-missing indicates that all attribute vectors of partial nodes are missing. Although various graph imputation methods have been proposed, none of them is custom-designed for a common situation where both types of graph absence exist simultaneously. To fill this gap, we develop a novel graph imputation network termed revisiting initializing then refining (RITR), where both attribute-incomplete and attribute-missing samples are completed under the guidance of a novel initializing-then-refining imputation criterion. Specifically, to complete attribute-incomplete samples, we first initialize the incomplete attributes using Gaussian noise before network learning, and then introduce a structure-attribute consistency constraint to refine incomplete values by approximating a structure-attribute correlation matrix to a high-order structure matrix. To complete attribute-missing samples, we first adopt structure embeddings of attribute-missing samples as the embedding initialization, and then refine these initial values by adaptively aggregating the reliable information of attribute-incomplete samples according to a dynamic affinity structure. To the best of our knowledge, this newly designed method is the first end-to-end unsupervised framework dedicated to handling hybrid-absent graphs. Extensive experiments on six datasets have verified that our methods consistently outperform the existing state-of-the-art competitors. Our source code is available at https://github.com/WxTu/RITR.},

  abstract     = {Vision transformer (ViT) and its variants have achieved remarkable success in various tasks. The key characteristic of these ViT models is to adopt different aggregation strategies of spatial patch information within the artificial neural networks (ANNs). However, there is still a key lack of unified representation of different ViT architectures for systematic understanding and assessment of model representation performance. Moreover, how those well-performing ViT ANNs are similar to real biological neural networks (BNNs) is largely unexplored. To answer these fundamental questions, we, for the first time, propose a unified and biologically plausible relational graph representation of ViT models. Specifically, the proposed relational graph representation consists of two key subgraphs: an aggregation graph and an affine graph. The former considers ViT tokens as nodes and describes their spatial interaction, while the latter regards network channels as nodes and reflects the information communication between channels. Using this unified relational graph representation, we found that: 1) model performance was closely related to graph measures; 2) the proposed relational graph representation of ViT has high similarity with real BNNs; and 3) there was a further improvement in model performance when training with a superior model to constrain the aggregation graph.},

  abstract     = {The success of multiview raw data mining relies on the integrity of attributes. However, each view faces various noises and collection failures, which leads to a condition that attributes are only partially available. To make matters worse, the attributes in multiview raw data are composed of multiple forms, which makes it more difficult to explore the structure of the data especially in multiview clustering task. Due to the missing data in some views, the clustering task on incomplete multiview data confronts the following challenges, namely: 1) mining the topology of missing data in multiview is an urgent problem to be solved; 2) most approaches do not calibrate the complemented representations with common information of multiple views; and 3) we discover that the cluster distributions obtained from incomplete views have a cluster distribution unaligned problem (CDUP) in the latent space. To solve the above issues, we propose a deep clustering framework based on subgraph propagation and contrastive calibration (SPCC) for incomplete multiview raw data. First, the global structural graph is reconstructed by propagating the subgraphs generated by the complete data of each view. Then, the missing views are completed and calibrated under the guidance of the global structural graph and contrast learning between views. In the latent space, we assume that different views have a common cluster representation in the same dimension. However, in the unsupervised condition, the fact that the cluster distributions of different views do not correspond affects the information completion process to use information from other views. Finally, the complemented cluster distributions for different views are aligned by contrastive learning (CL), thus solving the CDUP in the latent space. Our method achieves advanced performance on six benchmarks, which validates the effectiveness and superiority of our SPCC.},

  abstract     = {Acquiring big-size datasets to raise the performance of deep models has become one of the most critical problems in representation learning (RL) techniques, which is the core potential of the emerging paradigm of federated learning (FL). However, most current FL models concentrate on seeking an identical model for isolated clients and thus fail to make full use of the data specificity between clients. To enhance the classification performance of each client, this study introduces the FDRL, a federated discriminative RL model, by partitioning the data features of each client into a global subspace and a local subspace. More specifically, FDRL learns the global representation for federated communication between those isolated clients, which is to capture common features from all protected datasets via model sharing, and local representations for personalization in each client, which is to preserve specific features of clients via model differentiating. Toward this goal, FDRL in each client trains a shared submodel for federated communication and, meanwhile, a not-shared submodel for locality preservation, in which the two models partition client-feature space by maximizing their differences, followed by a linear model fed with combined features for image classification. The proposed model is implemented with neural networks and optimized in an iterative manner between the server of computing the global model and the clients of learning the local classifiers. Thanks to the powerful capability of local feature preservation, FDRL leads to more discriminative data representations than the compared FL models. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that our FDRL benefits from the subspace partition and achieves better performance on federated image classification than the state-of-the-art FL models.},

  abstract     = {Spiking neural networks (SNNs) operating with asynchronous discrete events show higher energy efficiency with sparse computation. A popular approach for implementing deep SNNs is artificial neural network (ANN)–SNN conversion combining both efficient training of ANNs and efficient inference of SNNs. However, the accuracy loss is usually nonnegligible, especially under few time steps, which restricts the applications of SNN on latency-sensitive edge devices greatly. In this article, we first identify that such performance degradation stems from the misrepresentation of the negative or overflow residual membrane potential in SNNs. Inspired by this, we decompose the conversion error into three parts: quantization error, clipping error, and residual membrane potential representation error. With such insights, we propose a two-stage conversion algorithm to minimize those errors, respectively. In addition, we show that each stage achieves significant performance gains in a complementary manner. By evaluating on challenging datasets including CIFAR- 10, CIFAR- 100, and ImageNet, the proposed method demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy, latency, and energy preservation. Furthermore, our method is evaluated using a more challenging object detection task, revealing notable gains in regression performance under ultralow latency, when compared with existing spike-based detection algorithms.

However, existing transformer models usually overlook the vital edge information, which is a major issue restricting the further improvement of SOD accuracy. To this end, we propose a novel edge-aware RGB-D SOD transformer, called EM-Trans, which explicitly models the edge information in a dual-band decomposition framework. Specifically, we employ two parallel decoder networks to learn the high-frequency edge and low-frequency body features from the low- and high-level features extracted from a two-steam multimodal backbone network, respectively. Next, we propose a cross-attention complementarity exploration module to enrich the edge/body features by exploiting the multimodal complementarity information. The refined features are then fed into our proposed color-hint guided fusion module for enhancing the depth feature and fusing the multimodal features. Finally, the resulting features are fused using our deeply supervised progressive fusion module, which progressively integrates edge and body features for predicting saliency maps. Our model explicitly considers the edge information for accurate RGB-D SOD, overcoming the limitations of existing methods and effectively improving the performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that EM-Trans is an effective RGB-D SOD framework that outperforms the current state-of-the-art models, both quantitatively and qualitatively. A further extension to RGB-T SOD demonstrates the promising potential of our model in various kinds of multimodal SOD tasks.},

  abstract     = {Transformers have astounding representational power but typically consume considerable computation which is quadratic with image resolution. The prevailing Swin transformer reduces computational costs through a local window strategy. However, this strategy inevitably causes two drawbacks: 1) the local window-based self-attention (WSA) hinders global dependency modeling capability and 2) recent studies point out that local windows impair robustness. To overcome these challenges, we pursue a preferable trade-off between computational cost and performance. Accordingly, we propose a novel factorization self-attention (FaSA) mechanism that enjoys both the advantages of local window cost and long-range dependency modeling capability. By factorizing the conventional attention matrix into sparse subattention matrices, FaSA captures long-range dependencies, while aggregating mixed-grained information at a computational cost equivalent to the local WSA. Leveraging FaSA, we present the factorization vision transformer (FaViT) with a hierarchical structure. FaViT achieves high performance and robustness, with linear computational complexity concerning input image spatial resolution. Extensive experiments have shown FaViT’s advanced performance in classification and downstream tasks. Furthermore, it also exhibits strong model robustness to corrupted and biased data and hence demonstrates benefits in favor of practical applications. In comparison to the baseline model Swin-T, our FaViT-B2 significantly improves classification accuracy by 1% and robustness by 7%, while reducing model parameters by 14%.

  abstract     = {In clinical practice, computed tomography (CT) is an important noninvasive inspection technology to provide patients’ anatomical information. However, its potential radiation risk is an unavoidable problem that raises people’s concerns. Recently, deep learning (DL)-based methods have achieved promising results in CT reconstruction, but these methods usually require the centralized collection of large amounts of data for training from specific scanning protocols, which leads to serious domain shift and privacy concerns. To relieve these problems, in this article, we propose a hypernetwork-based physics-driven personalized federated learning method (HyperFed) for CT imaging. The basic assumption of the proposed HyperFed is that the optimization problem for each domain can be divided into two subproblems: local data adaption and global CT imaging problems, which are implemented by an institution-specific physics-driven hypernetwork and a global-sharing imaging network, respectively. Learning stable and effective invariant features from different data distributions is the main purpose of global-sharing imaging network. Inspired by the physical process of CT imaging, we carefully design physics-driven hypernetwork for each domain to obtain hyperparameters from specific physical scanning protocol to condition the global-sharing imaging network, so that we can achieve personalized local CT reconstruction. Experiments show that HyperFed achieves competitive performance in comparison with several other state-of-the-art methods. It is believed as a promising direction to improve CT imaging quality and personalize the needs of different institutions or scanners without data sharing.

  abstract     = {This article presents a novel distributed flocking control method for large-scale multiagent systems (LS-MASs) operating in uncertain environments. When dealing with a massive number of flocking agents in uncertain environments, existing flocking methods encounter the problem of communication complexity and “Curse of dimensionality” caused by the exponential growth of agent interactions while solving PDE-based optimal flocking control for large-scale systems. The mean field game (MFG) method addresses this issue by transforming interactions among all agents into the interaction of each individual agent with average effects represented by a probability density function (pdf) of other agents. However, relying solely on a pdf term to consider other agents’ states can result in inefficient flocking performance due to the absence of a proficient coordination mechanism encompassing all agents involved in flocking. To overcome these difficulties and achieve the desired flocking performance for LS-MASs, the agents are decomposed into a finite number of subgroups. Each subgroup comprises a leader and followers, and a hybrid game theory is developed to manage both inter- and intragroup interactions. The method incorporates a cooperative game that links leaders from different groups to formulate distributed flocking control, a Stackelberg game that teams up leaders and followers within the same group to extend collective flocking behavior, and an MFG for followers to address the challenges of LS-MASs. Furthermore, to achieve distributed adaptive flocking using the hybrid game structure, we propose a hierarchical actor–critic-mass-based reinforcement learning technique. This approach incorporates a multiactor–critic method for leaders and an actor–critic-mass algorithm for followers, enabling adaptive flocking control in a distributed manner for large-scale agents. Finally, numerical simulation including comparison study and Lyapunov analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the developed method.},

  abstract     = {Stance detection on social media aims to identify if an individual is in support of or against a specific target. Most existing stance detection approaches primarily rely on modeling the contextual semantic information in sentences and neglect to explore the pragmatics dependency information of words, thus degrading performance. Although several single-task learning methods have been proposed to capture richer semantic representation information, they still suffer from semantic sparsity problems caused by short texts on social media. This article proposes a novel multigraph sparse interaction network (MG-SIN) by using multitask learning (MTL) to identify the stances and classify the sentiment polarities of tweets simultaneously. Our basic idea is to explore the pragmatics dependency relationship between tasks at the word level by constructing two types of heterogeneous graphs, including task-specific and task-related graphs (tr-graphs), to boost the learning of task-specific representations. A graph-aware module is proposed to adaptively facilitate information sharing between tasks via a novel sparse interaction mechanism among heterogeneous graphs. Through experiments on two real-world datasets, compared with the state-of-the-art baselines, the extensive results exhibit that MG-SIN achieves competitive improvements of up to 2.1% and 2.42% for the stance detection task, and 5.26% and 3.93% for the sentiment analysis task, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Few-shot classification aims to adapt classifiers trained on base classes to novel classes with a few shots. However, the limited amount of training data is often inadequate to represent the intraclass variations in novel classes. This can result in biased estimation of the feature distribution, which in turn results in inaccurate decision boundaries, especially when the support data are outliers. To address this issue, we propose a feature enhancement method called CORrelation-guided feature Enrichment that generates improved features for novel classes using weak supervision from the base classes. The proposed CORrelation-guided feature Enhancement (CORE) method utilizes an autoencoder (AE) architecture but incorporates classification information into its latent space. This design allows the CORE to generate more discriminative features while discarding irrelevant content information. After being trained on base classes, CORE’s generative ability can be transferred to novel classes that are similar to those in the base classes. By using these generative features, we can reduce the estimation bias of the class distribution, which makes few-shot learning (FSL) less sensitive to the selection of support data. Our method is generic and flexible and can be used with any feature extractor and classifier. It can be easily integrated into existing FSL approaches. Experiments with different backbones and classifiers show that our proposed method consistently outperforms existing methods on various widely used benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {Real-time semantic segmentation plays an important role in auto vehicles. However, most real-time small object segmentation methods fail to obtain satisfactory performance on small objects, such as cars and sign symbols, since the large objects usually tend to devote more to the segmentation result. To solve this issue, we propose an efficient and effective architecture, termed small objects segmentation network (SOSNet), to improve the segmentation performance of small objects. The SOSNet works from two perspectives: methodology and data. Specifically, with the former, we propose a dual-branch hierarchical decoder (DBHD) which is viewed as a small-object sensitive segmentation head. The DBHD consists of a top segmentation head that predicts whether the pixels belong to a small object class and a bottom one that estimates the pixel class. In this situation, the latent correlation among small objects can be fully explored. With the latter, we propose a small object example mining (SOEM) algorithm for balancing examples between small objects and large objects automatically. The core idea of the proposed SOEM is that most of the hard examples on small-object classes are reserved for training while most of the easy examples on large-object classes are banned. Experiments on three commonly used datasets show that the proposed SOSNet architecture greatly improves the accuracy compared to the existing real-time semantic segmentation methods while keeping efficiency.

  abstract     = {Blind face restoration (BFR) aims to recover high-quality (HQ) face images from low-quality (LQ) ones and usually resorts to facial priors for improving restoration performance. However, current methods still suffer from two major difficulties: 1) how to derive a powerful network architecture without extensive hand tuning and 2) how to capture complementary information from multiple facial priors in one network to improve restoration performance. To this end, we propose a face restoration searching network (FRSNet) to adaptively search the suitable feature extraction architecture within our specified search space, which can directly contribute to the restoration quality. On the basis of FRSNet, we further design our multiple facial prior searching network (MFPSNet) with a multiprior learning scheme. MFPSNet optimally extracts information from diverse facial priors and fuses the information into image features, ensuring that both external guidance and internal features are reserved. In this way, MFPSNet takes full advantage of semantic-level (parsing maps), geometric-level (facial heat maps), reference-level (facial dictionaries), and pixel-level (degraded images) information and, thus, generates faithful and realistic images. Quantitative and qualitative experiments show that the MFPSNet performs favorably on both synthetic and real-world datasets against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) BFR methods.

  abstract     = {Although federated learning (FL) has achieved outstanding results in privacy-preserved distributed learning, the setting of model homogeneity among clients restricts its wide application in practice. This article investigates a more general case, namely, model-heterogeneous FL (M-hete FL), where client models are independently designed and can be structurally heterogeneous. M-hete FL faces new challenges in collaborative learning because the parameters of heterogeneous models could not be directly aggregated. In this article, we propose a novel allosteric feature collaboration (AlFeCo) method, which interchanges knowledge across clients and collaboratively updates heterogeneous models on the server. Specifically, an allosteric feature generator is developed to reveal task-relevant information from multiple client models. The revealed information is stored in the client-shared and client-specific codes. We exchange client-specific codes across clients to facilitate knowledge interchange and generate allosteric features that are dimensionally variable for model updates. To promote information communication between different clients, a dual-path (model–model and model–prediction) communication mechanism is designed to supervise the collaborative model updates using the allosteric features. Client models are fully communicated through the knowledge interchange between models and between models and predictions. We further provide theoretical evidence and convergence analysis to support the effectiveness of AlFeCo in M-hete FL. The experimental results show that the proposed AlFeCo method not only performs well on classical FL benchmarks but also is effective in model-heterogeneous federated antispoofing.

  abstract     = {In this work, we seek to learn multiple mainstream vision tasks concurrently using a unified network, which is storage-efficient as numerous networks with task-shared parameters can be implanted into a single consolidated network. Our framework, vision transformer (ViT)-MVT, built on a plain and nonhierarchical ViT, incorporates numerous visual tasks into a modest supernet and optimizes them jointly across various dataset domains. For the design of ViT-MVT, we augment the ViT with a multihead self-attention (MHSE) to offer complementary cues in the channel and spatial dimension, as well as a local perception unit (LPU) and locality feed-forward network (locality FFN) for information exchange in the local region, thus endowing ViT-MVT with the ability to effectively optimize multiple tasks. Besides, we construct a search space comprising potential architectures with a broad spectrum of model sizes to offer various optimum candidates for diverse tasks. After that, we design a layer-adaptive sharing technique that automatically determines whether each layer of the transformer block is shared or not for all tasks, enabling ViT-MVT to obtain task-shared parameters for a reduction of storage and task-specific parameters to learn task-related features such that boosting performance. Finally, we introduce a joint-task evolutionary search algorithm to discover an optimal backbone for all tasks under total model size constraint, which challenges the conventional wisdom that visual tasks are typically supplied with backbone networks developed for image classification. Extensive experiments reveal that ViT-MVT delivers exceptional performances for multiple visual tasks over state-of-the-art methods while necessitating considerably fewer total storage costs. We further demonstrate that once ViT-MVT has been trained, ViT-MVT is capable of incremental learning when generalized to new tasks while retaining identical performances for trained tasks.

First, a masked sequence attention learning (MSAL) module is conducted to promote the inherent robustness of HSI analysis systems along spectral channel. Then, we develop a graph convolutional network (GCN) with learnable graph structure to establish global pixel-wise combinations. In this way, the attack effect would be dispersed by all the related pixels among each combination, and a better defense performance is achievable in spatial aspect. Finally, to improve the defense transferability and address the problem of limited labeled samples, MSSA employs spectra reconstruction as a pretext task and fits the datasets in a self-supervised manner. Comprehensive experiments over three benchmarks verify the effectiveness of MSSA in comparison with the state-of-the-art hyperspectral classification methods and representative adversarial defense strategies.},

  abstract     = {Fusion-based hyperspectral image (HSI) super-resolution has become increasingly prevalent for its capability to integrate high-frequency spatial information from the paired high-resolution (HR) RGB reference (Ref-RGB) image. However, most of the existing methods either heavily rely on the accurate alignment between low-resolution (LR) HSIs and RGB images or can only deal with simulated unaligned RGB images generated by rigid geometric transformations, which weakens their effectiveness for real scenes. In this article, we explore the fusion-based HSI super-resolution with real Ref-RGB images that have both rigid and nonrigid misalignments. To properly address the limitations of existing methods for unaligned reference images, we propose an HSI fusion network (HSIFN) with heterogeneous feature extractions, multistage feature alignments, and attentive feature fusion. Specifically, our network first transforms the input HSI and RGB images into two sets of multiscale features with an HSI encoder and an RGB encoder, respectively. The features of Ref-RGB images are then processed by a multistage alignment module to explicitly align the features of Ref-RGB with the LR HSI. Finally, the aligned features of Ref-RGB are further adjusted by an adaptive attention module to focus more on discriminative regions before sending them to the fusion decoder to generate the reconstructed HR HSI. Additionally, we collect a real-world HSI fusion dataset, consisting of paired HSI and unaligned Ref-RGB, to support the evaluation of the proposed model for real scenes. Extensive experiments are conducted on both simulated and our real-world datasets, and it shows that our method obtains a clear improvement over existing single-image and fusion-based super-resolution methods on quantitative assessment as well as visual comparison.

USNRT is computationally friendly, because very few leaf nodes are sufficient and pruning is unnecessary. Furthermore, an ensemble version can be easily constructed to estimate the total uncertainty, including the aleatory and epistemic. On extensive UCI datasets, USNRT or its ensemble shows superior performance compared to some recent popular methods for quantifying uncertainty with variances.

However, deep networks prefer modeling distributions of the dominant domains instead of all domains, which is known as domain bias. In this study, we propose a simple-yet-effective modulating domain-specific knowledge network (MDKNet) to handle the domain bias issue in multidomain crowd counting. MDKNet is achieved by employing the idea of “modulating,” enabling deep network balancing and modeling different distributions of diverse datasets with little bias. Specifically, we propose an instance-specific batch normalization (IsBN) module, which serves as a base modulator to refine the information flow to be adaptive to domain distributions. To precisely modulating the domain-specific information, the domain-guided virtual classifier (DVC) is then introduced to learn a domain-separable latent space. This space is employed as an input guidance for the IsBN modulator, such that the mixture distributions of multiple datasets can be well treated. Extensive experiments performed on popular benchmarks, including Shanghai-tech A/B, QNRF, and NWPU validate the superiority of MDKNet in tackling multidomain crowd counting and the effectiveness for multidomain learning.

  abstract     = {As an effective alternative to deep neural networks, broad learning system (BLS) has attracted more attention due to its efficient and outstanding performance and shorter training process in classification and regression tasks. Nevertheless, the performance of BLS will not continue to increase, but even decrease, as the number of nodes reaches the saturation point and continues to increase. In addition, the previous research on neural networks usually ignored the reason for the good generalization of neural networks. To solve these problems, this article first proposes the Extreme Fuzzy BLS (E-FBLS), a novel cascaded fuzzy BLS, in which multiple fuzzy BLS blocks are grouped or cascaded together. Moreover, the original data is input to each FBLS block rather than the previous blocks. In addition, we use residual learning to illustrate the effectiveness of E-FBLS. From the frequency domain perspective, we also discover the existence of the frequency principle in E-FBLS, which can provide good interpretability for the generalization of the neural network. Experimental results on classical classification and regression datasets show that the accuracy of the proposed E-FBLS is superior to traditional BLS in handling classification and regression tasks. The accuracy improves when the number of blocks increases to some extent. Moreover, we verify the frequency principle of E-FBLS that E-FBLS can obtain the low-frequency components quickly, while the high-frequency components are gradually adjusted as the number of FBLS blocks increases.},

  abstract     = {The expressive power of neural networks describes the ability to represent or approximate complex functions. The number of linear regions is the standard and most natural measure of expressive power. However, a major challenge in utilizing the number of linear regions as a measure of expressive power is the exponential gap between the theoretical upper and lower bounds, which becomes more pronounced as the neural network capacity increases. In this article, we aim to derive a sharp upper bound on piecewise linear neural networks (PLNNs) to bridge this gap. Specifically, we first establish the relationship between tropical polynomials and PLNNs. In the unexpanded tropical polynomials form, we make the proposition that hyperplanes are not all in the general positions, thereby reducing the number of intersecting hyperplanes. We propose a rank-based approach and present the empirical analysis that this approach outperforms previous Zaslavsky’s theorem-based methods. In the expanded tropical polynomials form, accounting for limitations in weight initialization and model computational precision, we raise the concept that the values range of each term is bounded. We propose a precision-based approach that transforms the approximate exponential growth of the number of linear regions into polynomial growth with width, which is effective at larger layer widths. Finally, we compare the number of linear regions that can be represented by each hidden layer in both forms and derive a sharp upper bound for PLNNs. Empirical analysis and experimental results provide compelling evidence for the efficacy and feasibility of this sharp upper bound on both simulated experiments and real datasets.},

  abstract     = {Transfer learning is one of the popular methods to solve the problem of insufficient data in subject-specific electroencephalogram (EEG) recognition tasks. However, most existing approaches ignore the difference between subjects and transfer the same feature representations from source domain to different target domains, resulting in poor transfer performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel subject-specific EEG recognition method named deep multiview module adaption transfer (DMV-MAT) network. First, we design a universal deep multiview (DMV) network to generate different types of discriminative features from multiple perspectives, which improves the generalization performance by extensive feature sets. Second, module adaption transfer (MAT) is designed to evaluate each module by the feature distributions of source and target samples, which can generate an optimal weight sharing strategy for each target subject and promote the model to learn domain-invariant and domain-specific features simultaneously. We conduct extensive experiments in two EEG recognition tasks, i.e., motor imagery (MI) and seizure prediction, on four datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves promising performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods, indicating a feasible solution for subject-specific EEG recognition tasks.

  abstract     = {Next-generation sequencing (NGS) genomic data offer valuable high-throughput genomic information for computational applications in medicine. Using genomic data to identify disease-associated genes to estimate cancer mortality risk remains challenging regarding to computational efficiency and risk integration. For determining mortality-related genes, we propose an information fusion system based on a fuzzy system to fuse the numerous deep-learning-based risk scores, consider the significance of features related to time-varying effects and risk stratifications, and interpret the directional relationship and interaction between outcome and predictors. Fuzzy rules were implemented to integrate the considerations mentioned above by merging all the risk score models to achieve advanced risk estimation. The genomic data of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed computational approach. The results indicated that the proposed computational approach exhibited optimal ability to identify mortality risk-related genes in HNSCC patients. The results also suggest that HNSCC mortality is associated with cancer inflammatory response, the interleukin-17A signaling pathway, stellate cell activation, and the extracellular-regulated protein kinase five signaling pathway, which might offer new therapeutic targets HNSCC through immunologic or antiangiogenic mechanisms. The proposed information fusion system can promote the determination of high-risk genes related to cancer mortality.

  abstract     = {With the help of special neuromorphic hardware, spiking neural networks (SNNs) are expected to realize artificial intelligence (AI) with less energy consumption. It provides a promising energy-efficient way for realistic control tasks by combining SNNs with deep reinforcement learning (DRL). In this article, we focus on the task where the agent needs to learn multidimensional deterministic policies to control, which is very common in real scenarios. Recently, the surrogate gradient method has been utilized for training multilayer SNNs, which allows SNNs to achieve comparable performance with the corresponding deep networks in this task. Most existing spike-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods take the firing rate as the output of SNNs, and convert it to represent continuous action space (i.e., the deterministic policy) through a fully connected (FC) layer. However, the decimal characteristic of the firing rate brings the floating-point matrix operations to the FC layer, making the whole SNN unable to deploy on the neuromorphic hardware directly. To develop a fully spiking actor network (SAN) without any floating-point matrix operations, we draw inspiration from the nonspiking interneurons found in insects and employ the membrane voltage of the nonspiking neurons to represent the action. Before the nonspiking neurons, multiple population neurons are introduced to decode different dimensions of actions. Since each population is used to decode a dimension of action, we argue that the neurons in each population should be connected in time domain and space domain. Hence, the intralayer connections are used in output populations to enhance the representation capacity. This mechanism exists extensively in animals and has been demonstrated effectively. Finally, we propose a fully SAN with intralayer connections (ILC-SAN). Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art performance on continuous control tasks from OpenAI gym. Moreover, we estimate the theoretical energy consumption when deploying ILC-SAN on neuromorphic chips to illustrate its high energy efficiency.},

For gradation clarity, our framework is specified as four-follow contents. First, multistep feedback-like control causality is drawn from time series analysis, and Takens’ theorem provides theoretical support from steady-state property. Second, control problem is reconstructed as games, while performance and robustness partition the game into temporal nonzero-sum subgames and spatial zero-sum ones, respectively. Next, multistep reinforcement learning (RL) is designed to solve robust predictive control without system model. Convergence is proven through bounds analysis of oscillatory value functions, and properties of receding horizon are derived from time consistency. Finally, data-driven implementation is given with function approximation, and neural networks are chosen to approximate value functions and feedback-like causality. Weights are estimated with least squares errors. Numerical results verify the effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Networks found with neural architecture search (NAS) achieve the state-of-the-art performance in a variety of tasks, out-performing human-designed networks. However, most NAS methods heavily rely on human-defined assumptions that constrain the search: architecture’s outer skeletons, number of layers, parameter heuristics, and search spaces. In addition, common search spaces consist of repeatable modules (cells) instead of fully exploring the architecture’s search space by designing entire architectures (macro-search). Imposing such constraints requires deep human expertise and restricts the search to predefined settings. In this article, we propose less constrained macro-neural architecture search (LCMNAS), a method that pushes NAS to less constrained search spaces by performing macro-search without relying on predefined heuristics or bounded search spaces. LCMNAS introduces three components for the NAS pipeline: 1) a method that leverages information about well-known architectures to autonomously generate complex search spaces based on weighted directed graphs (WDGs) with hidden properties; 2) an evolutionary search strategy that generates complete architectures from scratch; and 3) a mixed-performance estimation approach that combines information about architectures at the initialization stage and lower fidelity estimates to infer their trainability and capacity to model complex functions. We present experiments in 14 different datasets showing that LCMNAS is capable of generating both cell and macro-based architectures with minimal GPU computation and state-of-the-art results. Moreover, we conduct extensive studies on the importance of different NAS components in both cell and macro-based settings.

  abstract     = {Accurate uncertainty quantification is necessary to enhance the reliability of deep learning (DL) models in real-world applications. In the case of regression tasks, prediction intervals (PIs) should be provided along with the deterministic predictions of DL models. Such PIs are useful or “high-quality (HQ)” as long as they are sufficiently narrow and capture most of the probability density. In this article, we present a method to learn PIs for regression-based neural networks (NNs) automatically in addition to the conventional target predictions. In particular, we train two companion NNs: one that uses one output, the target estimate, and another that uses two outputs, the upper and lower bounds of the corresponding PI. Our main contribution is the design of a novel loss function for the PI-generation network that takes into account the output of the target-estimation network and has two optimization objectives: minimizing the mean PI width and ensuring the PI integrity using constraints that maximize the PI probability coverage implicitly. Furthermore, we introduce a self-adaptive coefficient that balances both objectives within the loss function, which alleviates the task of fine-tuning. Experiments using a synthetic dataset, eight benchmark datasets, and a real-world crop yield prediction dataset showed that our method was able to maintain a nominal probability coverage and produce significantly narrower PIs without detriment to its target estimation accuracy when compared to those PIs generated by three state-of-the-art neural-network-based methods. In other words, our method was shown to produce higher quality PIs.},

  abstract     = {Wireless sensor network (WSN) is an emerging and promising developing area in the intelligent sensing field. Due to various factors like sudden sensors breakdown or saving energy by deliberately shutting down partial nodes, there are always massive missing entries in the collected sensing data from WSNs. Low-rank matrix approximation (LRMA) is a typical and effective approach for pattern analysis and missing data recovery in WSNs. However, existing LRMA-based approaches ignore the adverse effects of outliers inevitably mixed with collected data, which may dramatically degrade their recovery accuracy. To address this issue, this article innovatively proposes a latent feature analysis (LFA) based spatiotemporal signal recovery (STSR) model, named LFA-STSR. Its main idea is twofold: 1) incorporating the spatiotemporal correlation into an LFA model as the regularization constraint to improve its recovery accuracy and 2) aggregating the $L_{1}$ -norm into the loss part of an LFA model to improve its robustness to outliers. As such, LFA-STSR can accurately recover missing data based on partially observed data mixed with outliers in WSNs. To evaluate the proposed LFA-STSR model, extensive experiments have been conducted on four real-world WSNs datasets. The results demonstrate that LFA-STSR significantly outperforms the related six state-of-the-art models in terms of both recovery accuracy and robustness to outliers.},

Previous studies have attempted to address this problem by designing balanced regularizers or utilizing conventional clustering methods. However, these methods often rely solely on classic methods, which limits their performance and primarily focuses on low-dimensional data. Although neural networks exhibit effective performance on high-dimensional datasets, they struggle to effectively leverage prior knowledge for clustering with a balanced tendency. To overcome the above limitations, we propose deep semisupervised balanced clustering, which simultaneously learns clustering and generates balance-favorable representations. Our model is based on the autoencoder paradigm incorporating a semisupervised module. Specifically, we introduce a balance-oriented clustering loss and incorporate pairwise constraints into the penalty term as a pluggable module using the Lagrangian multiplier method. Theoretically, we ensure that the proposed model maintains a balanced orientation and provides a comprehensive optimization process. Empirically, we conducted extensive experiments on four datasets to demonstrate significant improvements in clustering performance and balanced measurements.

Most existing studies have considered task dependencies while neglecting the prior dependencies of labels among different tasks. Therefore, how to make better use of the information on the relation dependencies among tasks and labels becomes a crucial issue. To this end, we transform the text classification problem into a node classification framework based on graph reasoning and supervised contrastive learning (SCL) techniques, named GraSCL. Specifically, we first design a graph reasoning network to model the potential dependency structures and facilitate relational learning under various graph topologies. Then, we introduce the SCL method for the LJP task to further leverage the label relation on the graph. To accommodate the node classification settings, we extend the traditional SCL method to novel variants for SCL at the node level, which allows the GraSCL framework to be trained efficiently even with small batches. Furthermore, to recognize the importance of hard negative samples in contrastive learning, we introduce a simple yet effective technique called online hard negative mining (OHNM) to enhance our SCL approach. This technique complements our SCL method and enables us to control the number and complexity of negative samples, leading to further improvements in the model’s performance. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on two well-known benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness and rationality of our proposed SCL approach as compared to the state-of-the-art competitors.},

While recent works have demonstrated that the Vision Transformer (ViT) has achieved good results when training from clean data, its applications to PLL remain limited and challenging. To address this issue, we rethink the relationship between instances and object queries to propose K-means cross-attention transformer for PLL (KMT-PLL), which can continuously learn cluster centers and be used for downstream disambiguation tasks. More specifically, K-means cross-attention as a clustering process can effectively learn the cluster centers to represent label classes. The purpose of this operation is to make the similarity between instances and labels measurable, which can effectively detect noise labels. Furthermore, we propose a new corrected cross entropy formulation, which can assign weights to candidate labels according to the instance-to-label relevance to guide the training of the instance classifier. As the training goes on, the ground-truth label is progressively identified, and the refined labels and cluster centers in turn help to improve the classifier. Simulation results demonstrate the advantage of the KMT-PLL and its suitability for PLL.},

The framework has a distributed and decoupled design at the cyber-layer and the physical layer. A resilient control Lyapunov function-quadratic programming (RCLF-QP)-based observer is first proposed to achieve secure reference state estimation under DoS attacks at the cyber-layer. Based on deep reinforcement learning (RL) and control barrier function (CBF), a safety-critical formation controller is designed at the physical layer to ensure safe collaborations between uncertain agents in dynamic environments. The framework is applied to autonomous vehicles for area scanning formations with barriers in environments. The comparative experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can effectively improve the resilience and robustness of the system.},

We present an inexact sequential quadratic programming framework for recurrent neural network learning (iSQPRL) for solving the identification stage of the POMDP, in which the true system is approximated by a recurrent neural network (RNN) with dynamically consistent overshooting (DCRNN). We formulate the learning problem as a constrained optimization problem and study the quadratic programming (QP) subproblem with a convergence analysis under a restarted Krylov-subspace iterative scheme that implicitly exploits the structure of the associated Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) subsystem. In the control stage, where a feedforward neural network (FNN) controller is designed on top of the RNN model, we adapt a generalized Gauss–Newton (GGN) algorithm that exploits useful approximations to the curvature terms of the training data and selects its mini-batch step size using a known property of some regularization function. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

This study presents two deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms for solving the Nash equilibrium of differential games. Both algorithms are built upon the distributed distributional deep deterministic policy gradient (D4PG) algorithm, which is a one-sided learning method. We modified it to a two-sided adversarial learning method. The first is D4PG for games (D4P2G), which directly applies an adversarial play framework based on the D4PG. A simultaneous policy gradient descent (SPGD) method is employed to optimize the policies of the players with conflicting objectives. The second is the distributional deep deterministic symplectic policy gradient (D4SPG) algorithm, which is our main contribution. More specifically, it newly designs a minimax learning framework that combines the critics of the two players and proposes a symplectic policy gradient adjustment method to find a better policy gradient. Simulations show that both algorithms converge to the Nash equilibrium in most cases, but D4SPG can learn the Nash equilibrium more accurately and efficiently, especially in Hamiltonian games. Moreover, it can handle games with complex dynamics, which is challenging for traditional methods.},

The difficulty lies in the design of graph pooling and we propose a mirror-connected design with two crucial problems: parameter reduction problem and complex gradient backpropagation problem. To deal with the former problem, we propose the notion of squared singular value pooling (SSVP) and prove that the representation power of SSVP followed by a fully connected layer with nonnegative weights is exactly equivalent to that of a mirror-connected layer. To resolve the latter problem, we provide an alternative feasible method to solve singular values of complex embeddings with a theoretical guarantee. Finally, we propose a mixture of pooling strategies in which first-order statistics information is employed to enrich the last low-dimensional representation.

However, a fundamental challenge, which arises from the inherently entangled nature of hierarchical policies, has not been understood well, consequently compromising the training stability and exploration efficiency of HRL. In this article, we propose a novel HRL algorithm, high-level model approximation (HLMA), presenting both theoretical foundations and practical implementations. In HLMA, a Planner constructs an innovative high-level dynamic model to predict the $k$ -step transition of the Controller in a subtask. This allows for the estimation of the evolving performance of the Controller. At low level, we leverage the initial state of each subtask, transforming absolute states into relative deviations by a designed operator as Controller input. This approach facilitates the reuse of subtask domain knowledge, enhancing data efficiency. With this designed structure, we establish the local convergence of each component within HLMA and subsequently derive regret bounds to ensure global convergence. Abundant experiments conducted on complex locomotion and navigation tasks demonstrate that HLMA surpasses other state-of-the-art single-level RL and HRL algorithms in terms of sample efficiency and asymptotic performance. In addition, thorough ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each component of HLMA.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a semi-supervised contrastive capsule transformer method with feature-based knowledge distillation (KD) that simplifies the existing semisupervised learning (SSL) techniques for wearable human activity recognition (HAR), called CapMatch. CapMatch gracefully hybridizes supervised learning and unsupervised learning to extract rich representations from input data. In unsupervised learning, CapMatch leverages the pseudolabeling, contrastive learning (CL), and feature-based KD techniques to construct similarity learning on lower and higher level semantic information extracted from two augmentation versions of the data, “weak” and “timecut,” to recognize the relationships among the obtained features of classes in the unlabeled data. CapMatch combines the outputs of the weak- and timecut-augmented models to form pseudolabeling and thus CL. Meanwhile, CapMatch uses the feature-based KD to transfer knowledge from the intermediate layers of the weak-augmented model to those of the timecut-augmented model. To effectively capture both local and global patterns of HAR data, we design a capsule transformer network consisting of four capsule-based transformer blocks and one routing layer. Experimental results show that compared with a number of state-of-the-art semi-supervised and supervised algorithms, the proposed CapMatch achieves decent performance on three commonly used HAR datasets, namely, HAPT, WISDM, and UCI_HAR. With only 10% of data labeled, CapMatch achieves $F_{1}$ values of higher than 85.00% on these datasets, outperforming 14 semi-supervised algorithms. When the proportion of labeled data reaches 30%, CapMatch obtains $F_{1}$ values of no lower than 88.00% on the datasets above, which is better than several classical supervised algorithms, e.g., decision tree and $k$ -nearest neighbor (KNN).},

  abstract     = {Anomaly detection, the task of differentiating abnormal data points from normal ones, presents a significant challenge in the realm of machine learning. Numerous strategies have been proposed to tackle this task, with classification-based methods, specifically those utilizing a self-supervised approach via random affine transformations (RATs), demonstrating remarkable performance on both image and non-image data. However, these methods encounter a notable bottleneck, the overlap of constructed labeled datasets across categories, which hampers the subsequent classifiers’ ability to detect anomalies. Consequently, the creation of an effective data distribution becomes the pivotal factor for success. In this article, we introduce a model called “self-supervised forest (sForest),” which leverages the random Fourier transform (RFT) and random orthogonal rotations to craft a controlled data distribution. Our model utilizes the RFT to map input data into a new feature space. With this transformed data, we create a self-labeled training dataset using random orthogonal rotations. We theoretically prove that the data distribution formulated by our methodology is more stable compared to one derived from RATs. We then use the self-labeled dataset in a random forest (RF) classifier to distinguish between normal and anomalous data points. Comprehensive experiments conducted on both real and artificial datasets illustrate that sForest outperforms other anomaly detection methods, including distance-based, kernel-based, forest-based, and network-based benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the tensor nuclear norm (TNN)-based tensor robust principle component analysis (TRPCA) has achieved impressive performance in multidimensional data processing. The underlying assumption in TNN is the low-rankness of frontal slices of the tensor in the transformed domain (e.g., Fourier domain). However, the low-rankness assumption is usually violative for real-world multidimensional data (e.g., video and image) due to their intrinsically nonlinear structure. How to effectively and efficiently exploit the intrinsic structure of multidimensional data remains a challenge. In this article, we first suggest a kernelized TNN (KTNN) by leveraging the nonlinear kernel mapping in the transform domain, which faithfully captures the intrinsic structure (i.e., implicit low-rankness) of multidimensional data and is computed at a lower cost by introducing kernel trick. Armed with KTNN, we propose a tensor robust kernel PCA (TRKPCA) model for handling multidimensional data, which decomposes the observed tensor into an implicit low-rank component and a sparse component. To tackle the nonlinear and nonconvex model, we develop an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm. Extensive experiments on real-world applications collectively verify that TRKPCA achieves superiority over the state-of-the-art RPCA methods.},

Specifically, the higher-layer capsule pose is achieved by an identity mapping on the adjacently lower-layer capsule pose. Such simple residual pose routing has two advantages: 1) reducing the routing computation complexity and 2) avoiding gradient vanishing due to its residual learning framework. On top of that, we explicitly reformulate the capsule layers by building a residual pose block. Stacking multiple such blocks results in a deep residual CapsNets (ResCaps) with a ResNet-like architecture. Results on MNIST, AffNIST, SmallNORB, and CIFAR-10/100 show the effectiveness of ResCaps for image classification. Furthermore, we successfully extend our residual pose routing to large-scale real-world applications, including 3-D object reconstruction and classification, and 2-D saliency dense prediction.

Recently, deep-learning-based change detection methods have shown remarkable performance, but the acquirement of labeled data is extremely expensive and time-consuming. It is intuitive to learn changes from the scene with sufficient labeled data and adapting them into an unlabeled new scene. However, the nonnegligible domain shift between different scenes leads to inevitable performance degradation. In this article, a cycle-refined multidecision joint alignment network (CMJAN) is proposed for unsupervised domain adaptive hyperspectral change detection, which realizes progressive alignment of the data distributions between the source and target domains with cycle-refined high-confidence labeled samples. There are two key characteristics: 1) progressively mitigate the distribution discrepancy to learn domain-invariant difference feature representation and 2) update the high-confidence training samples of the target domain in a cycle manner. The benefit is that the domain shift between the source and target domains is progressively alleviated to promote change detection performance on the target domain in an unsupervised manner. Experimental results on different datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve better performance than the state-of-the-art change detection methods.},

  abstract     = {Since digital spiking signals can carry rich information and propagate with low computational consumption, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have received great attention from neuroscientists and are regarded as the future development object of neural networks. However, generating the appropriate spiking signals remains challenging, which is related to the dynamics property of neurons. Most existing studies imitate the biological neurons based on the correlation of synaptic input and output, but these models have only one time constant, thus ignoring the structural differentiation and versatility in biological neurons. In this article, we propose the reconstruction of adaptive leaky integrate-and-fire (R-ALIF) neuron to perform complex behaviors similar to real neurons. First, a synaptic cleft time constant is introduced into the membrane voltage charging equation to distinguish the leakage degree between the neuron membrane and the synaptic cleft, which can expand the representation space of spiking neurons to facilitate SNNs to obtain better information expression way. Second, R-ALIF constructs a voltage threshold adjustment equation to balance the firing rate of output signals. Third, three time constants are transformed into learnable parameters, enabling the adaptive adjustment of dynamics equation and enhancing the information expression ability of SNNs. Fourth, the computational graph of R-ALIF is optimized to improve the performance of SNNs. Moreover, we adopt a temporal dropout (TemDrop) method to solve the overfitting problem in SNNs and propose a data augmentation method for neuromorphic datasets. Finally, we evaluate our method on CIFAR10-DVS, ASL-DVS, and CIFAR-100, and achieve top1 accuracy of 81.0%, 99.8%, and 67.83%, respectively, with few time steps. We believe that our method will further promote the development of SNNs trained by spatiotemporal backpropagation (STBP).},

Parallel to the development of technology, human standards, and surroundings should also improve equally. This study is developed based on the possibility of timely delivery of urgent medical requests in emergency situations. Using UAVs for delivering urgent medical requests will be very effective due to their flexible maneuverability and low costs. However, off-the-shelf UAVs suffer from limited payload capacity and battery constraints. In addition, urgent requests may be requested at an uncertain time, and delivering in a short time may be crucial. To address this issue, we proposed a novel framework that considers the limitations of the UAVs and dynamically requested packages. These previously unknown packages have source–destination pairs and delivery time intervals. Furthermore, we utilize deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms, deep Q-network (DQN), proximal policy optimization (PPO), and advantage actor–critic (A2C) to overcome this unknown environment and requests. The comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the PPO algorithm has a faster and more stable training performance than the other DRL algorithms in two different environmental setups. Also, we implemented an extension version of a Brute-force (BF) algorithm, assuming that all requests and environments are known in advance. The PPO algorithm performs very close to the success rate of the BF algorithm.},

  abstract     = {A key challenge for machine intelligence is to learn new visual concepts without forgetting the previously acquired knowledge. Continual learning (CL) is aimed toward addressing this challenge. However, there still exists a gap between CL and human learning. In particular, humans are able to continually learn from the samples associated with known or unknown labels in their daily lives, whereas existing CL and semi-supervised CL (SSCL) methods assume that the training samples are associated with known labels. Specifically, we are interested in two questions: 1) how to utilize unrelated unlabeled data for the SSCL task and 2) how unlabeled data affect learning and catastrophic forgetting in the CL task. To explore these issues, we formulate a new SSCL method, which can be generically applied to existing CL models. Furthermore, we propose a novel gradient learner to learn from labeled data to predict gradients on unlabeled data. In this way, the unlabeled data can fit into the supervised CL framework. We extensively evaluate the proposed method on mainstream CL methods, adversarial CL (ACL), and semi-supervised learning (SSL) tasks. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on classification accuracy and backward transfer (BWT) in the CL setting while achieving the desired performance on classification accuracy in the SSL setting. This implies that the unlabeled images can enhance the generalizability of CL models on the predictive ability of unseen data and significantly alleviate catastrophic forgetting.

  abstract     = {With the increasing demand for data privacy, federated learning (FL) has gained popularity for various applications. Most existing FL works focus on the classification task, overlooking those scenarios where anomaly detection may also require privacy-preserving. Traditional anomaly detection algorithms cannot be directly applied to the FL setting due to false and missing detection issues. Moreover, with common aggregation methods used in FL (e.g., averaging model parameters), the global model cannot keep the capacities of local models in discriminating anomalies deviating from local distributions, which further degrades the performance. For the aforementioned challenges, we propose Federated Anomaly Detection with Noisy Global Density Estimation, and Self-supervised Ensemble Distillation (FADngs). Specifically, FADngs aligns the knowledge of data distributions from each client by sharing processed density functions. Besides, FADngs trains local models in an improved contrastive learning way that learns more discriminative representations specific for anomaly detection based on the shared density functions. Furthermore, FADngs aggregates capacities by ensemble distillation, which distills the knowledge learned from different distributions to the global model. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art federated anomaly detection methods. We also empirically show that the shared density function is privacy-preserving. The code for the proposed method is provided for research purposes https://github.com/kanade00/Federated_Anomaly_detection.},

  abstract     = {In multi-instance nonparallel plane learning (NPL), the training set is comprised of bags of instances and the nonparallel planes are trained to classify the bags. Most of the existing multi-instance NPL methods are proposed based on a twin support vector machine (TWSVM). Similar to TWSVM, they use only a single plane to generalize the data occurrence of one class and do not sufficiently consider the boundary information, which may lead to the limitation of their classification accuracy. In this article, we propose a multi-instance nonparallel tube learning (MINTL) method. Distinguished from the existing multi-instance NPL methods, MINTL embeds the boundary information into the classifier by learning a large-margin-based $\epsilon $ -tube for each class, such that the boundary information can be incorporated into refining the classifier and further improving the performance. Specifically, given a $K$ -class multi-instance dataset, MINTL seeks $K~\epsilon $ -tubes, one for each class. In multi-instance learning, each positive bag contains at least one positive instance. To build up the $\epsilon _{k}$ -tube of class $k$ , we require that each bag of class $k$ should have at least one instance included in the $\epsilon _{k}$ -tube. Moreover, except for one instance included in the $\epsilon _{k}$ -tube, the remaining instances in the positive bag may include positive instances or irrelevant instances, and their labels are unavailable. A large margin constraint is presented to assign the remaining instances either inside the $\epsilon _{k}$ -tube or outside the $\epsilon _{k}$ -tube with a large margin. Substantial experiments on real-world datasets have shown that MINTL obtains significantly better classification accuracy than the existing multi-instance NPL methods.},

While there has been substantial progress in SNN research, artificial SNNs still lack many capabilities of their biological counterparts. In biological neural systems, memory is a key component that enables the retention of information over a huge range of temporal scales, ranging from hundreds of milliseconds up to years. While Hebbian plasticity is believed to play a pivotal role in biological memory, it has so far been analyzed mostly in the context of pattern completion and unsupervised learning in artificial and SNNs. Here, we propose that Hebbian plasticity is fundamental for computations in biological and artificial spiking neural systems. We introduce a novel memory-augmented SNN architecture that is enriched by Hebbian synaptic plasticity. We show that Hebbian enrichment renders SNNs surprisingly versatile in terms of their computational as well as learning capabilities. It improves their abilities for out-of-distribution generalization, one-shot learning, cross-modal generative association, language processing, and reward-based learning. This suggests that powerful cognitive neuromorphic systems can be built based on this principle.},

  abstract     = {Active domain adaptation (ADA), which enormously improves the performance of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) at the expense of annotating limited target data, has attracted a surge of interest. However, in real-world applications, the source data in conventional ADA are not always accessible due to data privacy and security issues. To alleviate this dilemma, we introduce a more practical and challenging setting, dubbed as source-free ADA (SFADA), where one can select a small quota of target samples for label query to assist the model learning, but labeled source data are unavailable. Therefore, how to query the most informative target samples and mitigate the domain gap without the aid of source data are two key challenges in SFADA. To address SFADA, we propose a unified method SQAdapt via augmentation-based ${S}$ ample ${Q}$ uery and progressive model Adapt ation. In specific, an active selection module (ASM) is built for target label query, which exploits data augmentation to select the most informative target samples with high predictive sensitivity and uncertainty. Then, we further introduce a classifier adaptation module (CAM) to leverage both the labeled and unlabeled target data for progressively calibrating the classifier weights. Meanwhile, the source-like target samples with low selection scores are taken as source surrogates to realize the distribution alignment in the source-free scenario by the proposed distribution alignment module (DAM). Moreover, as a general active label query method, SQAdapt can be easily integrated into other source-free UDA (SFUDA) methods, and improve their performance. Comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks have shown that SQAdapt can achieve superior performance and even surpass most of the ADA methods.},

  abstract     = {Managing heterogeneous datasets that vary in complexity, size, and similarity in continual learning presents a significant challenge. Task-agnostic continual learning is necessary to address this challenge, as datasets with varying similarity pose difficulties in distinguishing task boundaries. Conventional task-agnostic continual learning practices typically rely on rehearsal or regularization techniques. However, rehearsal methods may struggle with varying dataset sizes and regulating the importance of old and new data due to rigid buffer sizes. Meanwhile, regularization methods apply generic constraints to promote generalization but can hinder performance when dealing with dissimilar datasets lacking shared features, necessitating a more adaptive approach. In this article, we propose a novel adaptive continual learning (AdaptCL) method to tackle heterogeneity in sequential datasets. AdaptCL employs fine-grained data-driven pruning to adapt to variations in data complexity and dataset size. It also utilizes task-agnostic parameter isolation to mitigate the impact of varying degrees of catastrophic forgetting caused by differences in data similarity. Through a two-pronged case study approach, we evaluate AdaptCL on both datasets of MNIST variants and DomainNet, as well as datasets from different domains. The latter include both large-scale, diverse binary-class datasets and few-shot, multiclass datasets. Across all these scenarios, AdaptCL consistently exhibits robust performance, demonstrating its flexibility and general applicability in handling heterogeneous datasets.},

However, this hierarchical relationship modeling is computationally expensive, which has limited the wider use of CapsNet despite its potential advantages. The current state of CapsNet models primarily focuses on comparing their performance with capsule baselines, falling short of achieving the same level of proficiency as deep convolutional neural network (CNN) variants in intricate tasks. To address this limitation, we present an efficient approach for learning capsules that surpasses canonical baseline models and even demonstrates superior performance compared with high-performing convolution models. Our contribution can be outlined in two aspects: first, we introduce a group of subcapsules onto which an input vector is projected. Subsequently, we present the hybrid Gromov–Wasserstein (HGW) framework, which initially quantifies the dissimilarity between the input and the components modeled by the subcapsules, followed by determining their alignment degree through optimal transport (OT). This innovative mechanism capitalizes on new insights into defining alignment between the input and subcapsules, based on the similarity of their respective component distributions. This approach enhances CapsNets’ capacity to learn from intricate, high-dimensional data while retaining their interpretability and hierarchical structure. Our proposed model offers two distinct advantages: 1) its lightweight nature facilitates the application of capsules to more intricate vision tasks, including object detection; and 2) it outperforms baseline approaches in these demanding tasks. Our empirical findings illustrate that HGW capsules (HGWCapsules) exhibit enhanced robustness against affine transformations, scale effectively to larger datasets, and surpass CNN and CapsNet models across various vision tasks.},

However, they utilize the 3D sparse convolution (spconv) layers with fixed receptive fields, such as voxel-based detectors, and inherit the fixed sphere radius from point-based methods for generating the features of keypoints, which make them weak in adaptively modeling various geometrical deformations and sizes of real objects. To tackle this issue, we propose a shape-adaptive set abstraction network (SASAN) for point-voxel 3D object detection. First, the proposal and offset generation module is adopted to learn the coordinates and confidences of 3D proposals and shape-adaptive offsets of the certain number of offset points for each voxel. Meanwhile, an extra offset supervision task is employed to guide the learning of shifting values of offset points, aiming at motivating the predicted offsets to preferably adapt to the various shapes of objects. Then, the shape-adaptive set abstraction module is proposed to extract multiscale keypoints features by grouping the neighboring offset points’ features, as well as features learned from adjacent raw points and the 2-D bird-view map. Finally, the region of interest (RoI)-grid proposal refinement module is used to aggregate the keypoints features for further proposal refinement and confidence prediction. Extensive experiments on the competitive KITTI 3D detection benchmark demonstrate that the proposed SASAN gains superior performance as compared with state-of-the-art methods.},

Recently, block-wise NAS has been proposed to alleviate deep coupling problem between architectures and weights existed in the well-known weight-sharing NAS, by training the huge weight-sharing supernet block-wisely. However, the existing block-wise NAS methods, which resort to either supervised distillation or self-supervised contrastive learning scheme to enable block-wise optimization, take massive computational cost. To be specific, the former introduces an external high-capacity teacher model, while the latter involves supernet-scale momentum model and requires a long training schedule. Considering this, in this work, we propose a resource-friendly deeply supervised block-wise NAS (DBNAS) method. In the proposed DBNAS, we construct a lightweight deeply-supervised module after each block to enable a simple supervised learning scheme and leverage ground-truth labels to indirectly supervise optimization of each block progressively. Besides, the deeply-supervised module is specifically designed as structural and functional condensation of the supernet, which establishes global awareness for progressive block-wise optimization and helps search for promising architectures. Experimental results show that the DBNAS method only takes less than 1 GPU day to search out promising architectures on the ImageNet dataset with less GPU memory footprint than the other block-wise NAS works. The best-performing model among the searched DBNAS family achieves 75.6% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, which is competitive with the state-of-the-art NAS models. Moreover, our DBNAS family models also achieve good transfer performance on CIFAR-10/100, as well as two downstream tasks: object detection and semantic segmentation.},

  abstract     = {Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) attracts a lot of research interest and drives widespread applications, where only anomaly-free samples are available for training. Some UAD applications intend to locate the anomalous regions further even without any anomaly information. Although the absence of anomalous samples and annotations deteriorates the UAD performance, an inconspicuous, yet powerful statistics model, the normalizing flows, is appropriate for anomaly detection (AD) and localization in an unsupervised fashion. The flow-based probabilistic models, only trained on anomaly-free data, can efficiently distinguish unpredictable anomalies by assigning them much lower likelihoods than normal data. Nevertheless, the size variation of unpredictable anomalies introduces another inconvenience to the flow-based methods for high-precision AD and localization. To generalize the anomaly size variation, we propose a novel multiscale flow-based framework (MSFlow) composed of asymmetrical parallel flows followed by a fusion flow to exchange multiscale perceptions. Moreover, different multiscale aggregation strategies are adopted for image-wise AD and pixel-wise anomaly localization according to the discrepancy between them. The proposed MSFlow is evaluated on three AD datasets, significantly outperforming existing methods. Notably, on the challenging MVTec AD benchmark, our MSFlow achieves a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) with a detection AUORC score of up to 99.7%, localization AUCROC score of 98.8% and PRO score of 97.1%.},

  abstract     = {We propose two novel transferability metrics fast optimal transport-based conditional entropy (F-OTCE) and joint correspondence OTCE (JC-OTCE) to evaluate how much the source model (task) can benefit the learning of the target task and to learn more generalizable representations for cross-domain cross-task transfer learning. Unlike the original OTCE metric that requires evaluating the empirical transferability on auxiliary tasks, our metrics are auxiliary-free such that they can be computed much more efficiently. Specifically, F-OTCE estimates transferability by first solving an optimal transport (OT) problem between source and target distributions and then uses the optimal coupling to compute the negative conditional entropy (NCE) between the source and target labels. It can also serve as an objective function to enhance downstream transfer learning tasks including model finetuning and domain generalization (DG). Meanwhile, JC-OTCE improves the transferability accuracy of F-OTCE by including label distances in the OT problem, though it incurs additional computation costs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that F-OTCE and JC-OTCE outperform state-of-the-art auxiliary-free metrics by 21.1% and 25.8%, respectively, in correlation coefficient with the ground-truth transfer accuracy. By eliminating the training cost of auxiliary tasks, the two metrics reduce the total computation time of the previous method from 43 min to 9.32 and 10.78 s, respectively, for a pair of tasks. When applied in the model finetuning and DG tasks, F-OTCE shows significant improvements in the transfer accuracy in few-shot classification experiments, with up to 4.41% and 2.34% accuracy gains, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning methods have achieved impressive performance in compressed video quality enhancement tasks. However, these methods rely excessively on practical experience by manually designing the network structure and do not fully exploit the potential of the feature information contained in the video sequences, i.e., not taking full advantage of the multiscale similarity of the compressed artifact information and not seriously considering the impact of the partition boundaries in the compressed video on the overall video quality. In this article, we propose a novel Mixed Difference Equation inspired Transformer (MDEformer) for compressed video quality enhancement, which provides a relatively reliable principle to guide the network design and yields a new insight into the interpretable transformer. Specifically, drawing on the graphical concept of the mixed difference equation (MDE), we utilize multiple cross-layer cross-attention aggregation (CCA) modules to establish long-range dependencies between encoders and decoders of the transformer, where partition boundary smoothing (PBS) modules are inserted as feedforward networks. The CCA module can make full use of the multiscale similarity of compression artifacts to effectively remove compression artifacts, and recover the texture and detail information of the frame. The PBS module leverages the sensitivity of smoothing convolution to partition boundaries to eliminate the impact of partition boundaries on the quality of compressed video and improve its overall quality, while not having too much impacts on non-boundary pixels. Extensive experiments on the MFQE 2.0 dataset demonstrate that the proposed MDEformer can eliminate compression artifacts for improving the quality of the compressed video, and surpasses the state-of-the-arts (SOTAs) in terms of both objective metrics and visual quality.},

In recent studies, many methods are designed using large margin distribution machine (LDM), which combines margin distribution with support vector machine (SVM), such that a better performance can be achieved. However, these methods are usually proposed based on single-view data and ignore the connection between different views. In this article, we propose a new multiview margin distribution model, called MVLDM, which constructs both multiview margin mean and variance. Besides, a framework is proposed to achieve multiview learning (MVL). MVLDM provides a new way to explore the utilization of complementary information in MVL from the perspective of margin distribution and satisfies both the consistency principle and the complementarity principle. In the theoretical analysis, we used Rademacher complexity theory to analyze the consistency error bound and generalization error bound of the MVLDM. In the experiments, we constructed a new performance metric, the view consistency rate (VCR), for the characteristics of multiview data. The effectiveness of MVLDM was evaluated using both VCR and other traditional performance metrics. The experimental results show that MVLDM is superior to other benchmark methods.},

First, an adaptive event-based control protocol is designed, where the event-based neural network (NN) scheme is developed to compensate for uncertain model dynamics. Upon the designed control protocol, an interleaved periodic event-triggered mechanism (IPETM) is subsequently proposed to achieve the communication objective. Unlike the common continuous event-triggered methods and periodic event-triggered methods, in which multiple nodes are allowed to trigger their events at the same time, the proposed IPETM ensures that USVs detect their events at different times to avoid the simultaneous event triggering of different nodes. By this virtue, traffic jamming in common wireless environments can be prevented, such that potential communication delays and faults are naturally avoided. In addition, the event detecting instants of the presented IPETM are also discrete and periodic, such that it can be performed under low-computational frequencies. Through Lyapunov-based analysis, it is verified that all closed-loop signals can converge to an arbitrary small compact set with exponential convergence rates. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed control scheme.},

  abstract     = {We propose an Information bottleneck (IB) for Goal representation learning (InfoGoal), a self-supervised method for generalizable goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL). Goal-conditioned RL learns a policy from reward signals to predict actions for reaching desired goals. However, the policy would overfit the task-irrelevant information contained in the goal and may be falsely or ineffectively generalized to reach other goals. A goal representation containing sufficient task-relevant information and minimum task-irrelevant information is guaranteed to reduce generalization errors. However, in goal-conditioned RL, it is difficult to balance the tradeoff between task-relevant information and task-irrelevant information because of the sparse and delayed learning signals, i.e., reward signals, and the inevitable task-relevant information sacrifice caused by information compression. Our InfoGoal learns a minimum and sufficient goal representation with dense and immediate self-supervised learning signals. Meanwhile, InfoGoal adaptively adjusts the weight of information minimization to achieve maximum information compression with a reasonable sacrifice of task-relevant information. Consequently, InfoGoal enables policy to generate a targeted trajectory toward states where the desired goal can be found with high probability and broadly explores those states. We conduct experiments on both simulated and real-world tasks, and our method significantly outperforms baseline methods in terms of policy optimality and the success rate of reaching unseen test goals.

  abstract     = {Despite the rapid progress of neuromorphic computing, inadequate capacity and insufficient representation power of spiking neural networks (SNNs) severely restrict their application scope in practice. Residual learning and shortcuts have been evidenced as an important approach for training deep neural networks, but rarely did previous work assessed their applicability to the specifics of SNNs. In this article, we first identify that this negligence leads to impeded information flow and the accompanying degradation problem in a spiking version of vanilla ResNet. To address this issue, we propose a novel SNN-oriented residual architecture termed MS-ResNet, which establishes membrane-based shortcut pathways, and further proves that the gradient norm equality can be achieved in MS-ResNet by introducing block dynamical isometry theory, which ensures the network can be well-behaved in a depth-insensitive way. Thus, we are able to significantly extend the depth of directly trained SNNs, e.g., up to 482 layers on CIFAR-10 and 104 layers on ImageNet, without observing any slight degradation problem. To validate the effectiveness of MS-ResNet, experiments on both frame-based and neuromorphic datasets are conducted. MS-ResNet104 achieves a superior result of 76.02% accuracy on ImageNet, which is the highest to the best of our knowledge in the domain of directly trained SNNs. Great energy efficiency is also observed, with an average of only one spike per neuron needed to classify an input sample. We believe our powerful and scalable models will provide strong support for further exploration of SNNs.},

  abstract     = {Video motion magnification is the task of making subtle minute motions visible. Many times subtle motion occurs while being invisible to the naked eye, e.g., slight deformations in muscles of an athlete, small vibrations in the objects, microexpression, and chest movement while breathing. Magnification of such small motions has resulted in various applications like posture deformities detection, microexpression recognition, and studying the structural properties. State-of-the-art (SOTA) methods have fixed computational complexity, which makes them less suitable for applications requiring different time constraints, e.g., real-time respiratory rate measurement and microexpression classification. To solve this problem, we propose a knowledge distillation-based latency aware-differentiable architecture search (KL-DNAS) method for video motion magnification. To reduce memory requirements and to improve denoising characteristics, we use a teacher network to search the network by parts using knowledge distillation (KD). Furthermore, search among different receptive fields and multifeature connections are applied for individual layers. Also, a novel latency loss is proposed to jointly optimize the target latency constraint and output quality. We are able to find $2.8 \times $ smaller model than the SOTA method and better motion magnification with lesser distortions. https://github.com/jasdeep-singh-007/KL-DNAS.},

  abstract     = {We focus on learning the zero-constraint-violation safe policy in model-free reinforcement learning (RL). Existing model-free RL studies mostly use the posterior penalty to penalize dangerous actions, which means they must experience the danger to learn from the danger. Therefore, they cannot learn a zero-violation safe policy even after convergence. To handle this problem, we leverage the safety-oriented energy functions to learn zero-constraint-violation safe policies and propose the safe set actor-critic (SSAC) algorithm. The energy function is designed to increase rapidly for potentially dangerous actions, locating the safe set on the action space. Therefore, we can identify the dangerous actions prior to taking them and achieve zero-constraint violation. Our major contributions are twofold. First, we use the data-driven methods to learn the energy function, which releases the requirement of known dynamics. Second, we formulate a constrained RL problem to solve the zero-violation policies. We prove that our Lagrangian-based constrained RL solutions converge to the constrained optimal zero-violation policies theoretically. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on the complex simulation environments and a hardware-in-loop (HIL) experiment with a real autonomous vehicle controller. Experimental results suggest that the converged policies in all environments achieve zero-constraint violation and comparable performance with model-based baseline.},

To this end, we propose a flexible resource scheduling (FRES) framework by employing a novel deep progressive reinforcement learning that includes the following innovations. First, a novel multitask agent is presented to deal with the mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. The multitask agent has two output heads designed for different tasks, in which a classified head is employed to make offloading decisions with integer variables while a fitting head is applied to solve resource allocation with continuous variables. Second, a progressive scheduler is introduced to adapt the agent to the varying number of UAVs by progressively adjusting a part of neurons in the agent. This structure can naturally accumulate experiences and be immune to catastrophic forgetting. Finally, a light taboo search (LTS) is introduced to enhance the global search of the FRES. The numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the FRES framework, which can make real-time and optimal resource scheduling even in dynamic MEC systems.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we investigate the utilization of deep approximate policy iteration (DAPI) in estimating the optimal action-value function $Q^{\ast}$ within the context of reinforcement learning, employing rectified linear unit (ReLU) ResNet as the underlying framework. The iterative process of DAPI incorporates the minimax average Bellman error minimization principle. It employs ReLU ResNet to estimate the fixed point of the Bellman equation, which is aligned with the estimated greedy policy. Through error propagation, we derive nonasymptotic error bounds between $Q^{\ast}$ and the estimated $Q$ function induced by the output greedy policy in DAPI. To effectively control the Bellman residual error, we address both the statistical and approximation errors associated with the $\alpha $ -mixing dependent data derived from Markov decision processes, using the techniques of empirical process and deep approximation theory, respectively. Furthermore, we present a novel generalization bound for ReLU ResNet in the presence of dependent data, as well as an approximation bound for ReLU ResNet within the Hölder class. Notably, this approximation bound contributes to a significant improvement in the dependence on the ambient dimension, transitioning from an exponential relationship to a polynomial one. The derived nonasymptotic error bounds explicitly depend on factors such as the sample size, the ambient dimension (in polynomial terms), and the width and depth of the neural networks. Consequently, these bounds serve as valuable theoretical guidelines for appropriately setting the hyperparameters, thereby enabling the achievement of the desired convergence rate during the training process of DAPI.},

  abstract     = {Spiking neural networks (SNNs) mimic their biological counterparts more closely than their predecessors and are considered the third generation of artificial neural networks. It has been proven that networks of spiking neurons have a higher computational capacity and lower power requirements than sigmoidal neural networks. This article introduces a new type of SNN that draws inspiration and incorporates concepts from neuronal assemblies in the human brain. The proposed network, termed as class-dependent neuronal activation-based SNN (CDNA-SNN), assigns each neuron learnable values known as CDNAs which indicate the neuron’s average relative spiking activity in response to samples from different classes. A new learning algorithm that categorizes the neurons into different class assemblies based on their CDNAs is also presented. These neuronal assemblies are trained via a novel training method based on spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) to have high activity for their associated class and low firing rate for other classes. Also, using CDNAs, a new type of STDP that controls the amount of plasticity based on the assemblies of pre- and postsynaptic neurons is proposed. The performance of CDNA-SNN is evaluated on five datasets from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository, as well as Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) and Fashion MNIST, using nested cross-validation (N-CV) for hyperparameter optimization. Our results show that CDNA-SNN significantly outperforms synaptic weight association training (SWAT) ( $p &amp;lt; 0.0005$ ) and SpikeProp ( $p &amp;lt; 0.05$ ) on 3/5 and self-regulating evolving spiking neural (SRESN) ( $p &amp;lt; 0.05$ ) on 2/5 UCI datasets while using the significantly lower number of trainable parameters. Furthermore, compared to other supervised, fully connected SNNs, the proposed SNN reaches the best performance for Fashion MNIST and comparable performance for MNIST and neuromorphic-MNIST (N-MNIST), also utilizing much less (1%–35%) parameters.},

To reduce computation time and storage requirement, this article presents two matrix-form recurrent neural networks (RNNs), one continuous-time model and another discrete-time model, for solving matrix-variable optimization problems with linear constraints. The two proposed matrix-form RNNs have low complexity and are suitable for parallel implementation in terms of matrix state space. The proposed continuous-time matrix-form RNN can significantly generalize existing continuous-time vector-form RNN. The proposed discrete-time matrix-form RNN can be effectively used in blind image restoration, where the storage requirement and computational cost are largely reduced. Theoretically, the two proposed matrix-form RNNs are guaranteed to be globally convergent to the optimal solution under mild conditions. Computed results show that the proposed matrix-form RNN-based algorithm is superior to related vector-form RNN and matrix-form RNN-based algorithms, in terms of computation time.},

Accurate normal estimation for the noisy point cloud makes a crucial contribution to the success of various applications. However, the existing normal estimation wisdoms strive to meet a conflicting goal of simultaneously performing normal filtering and preserving surface features, which inevitably leads to inaccurate estimation results. We propose a normal estimation neural network (Norest-Net), which regards normal filtering and feature preservation as two separate tasks, so that each one is specialized rather than traded off. For full noise removal, we present a normal filtering network (NF-Net) branch by learning from the noisy height map descriptor (HMD) of each point to the ground-truth (GT) point normal; for surface feature recovery, we construct a normal refinement network (NR-Net) branch by learning from the bilaterally defiltered point normal descriptor (B-DPND) to the GT point normal. Moreover, NR-Net is detachable to be incorporated into the existing normal estimation methods to boost their performances. Norest-Net shows clear improvements over the state of the arts in both feature preservation and noise robustness on synthetic and real-world captured point clouds.},

Multiple cooperative estimators are deployed for environment learning process, which is helpful to improving the search performance and robustness against noisy measurements. The number of estimators used in COAL-DCEE is much smaller than that of the particles required for Bayesian estimation in information-theoretic approaches. Consequently, the computational load is significantly reduced. As an important feature of this study, the convergence and performance of COAL-DCEE are established in relation to the characteristics of sensor noises and turbulence disturbances. Numerical and experimental studies have been carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

However, these state-of-the-art methods mainly suffer from three shortcomings: 1) incomprehensive optimization; 2) low-order and unidimensional attention; and 3) repeated generation. In this article, we propose a hybrid reinforced medical report generation method with m-linear attention and repetition penalty mechanism (HReMRG-MR) to overcome these problems. Specifically, a hybrid reward with different weights is employed to remedy the limitations of single-metric-based rewards, and a local optimal weight search algorithm is proposed to significantly reduce the complexity of searching the weights of the rewards from exponential to linear. Furthermore, we use m-linear attention modules to learn multidimensional high-order feature interactions and to achieve multimodal reasoning, while a new repetition penalty is proposed to apply penalties to repeated terms adaptively during the model’s training process. Extensive experimental studies on two public benchmark datasets show that HReMRG-MR greatly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of all metrics. The effectiveness and necessity of all components in HReMRG-MR are also proved by ablation studies. Additional experiments are further conducted and the results demonstrate that our proposed local optimal weight search algorithm can significantly reduce the search time while maintaining superior medical report generation performances.},

Further, on the feature storage based on the matrix method, we compress the feature storage space of the candidate POIs.

Previous approaches directly generate the photo-sketch in a global view, they always suffer from the low quality of sketches and complex photograph variations, leading to unnatural and low-fidelity results. In this article, we propose a novel semantic-driven generative adversarial network to address the above issues, cooperating with graph representation learning. Considering that human faces have distinct spatial structures, we first inject class-wise semantic layouts into the generator to provide style-based spatial information for synthesized face photographs and sketches. In addition, to enhance the authenticity of details in generated faces, we construct two types of representational graphs via semantic parsing maps upon input faces, dubbed the intraclass semantic graph (IASG) and the interclass structure graph (IRSG). Specifically, the IASG effectively models the intraclass semantic correlations of each facial semantic component, thus producing realistic facial details. To preserve the generated faces being more structure-coordinated, the IRSG models interclass structural relations among every facial component by graph representation learning. To further enhance the perceptual quality of synthesized images, we present a biphasic interactive cycle training strategy by fully taking advantage of the multilevel feature consistency between the photograph and sketch. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors on the CUHK Face Sketch (CUFS) and CUHK Face Sketch FERET (CUFSF) datasets.},

However, model selection for semi-supervised models is still a key open problem. Existing methods for semi-supervised models to search for the optimal parameter values are usually computationally demanding, especially those ones with grid search. To address this challenging problem, in this article, we first propose solution paths of S3VM (SPS3VM), which can track the solutions of the nonconvex S3VM with respect to the hyperparameters. Specifically, we apply incremental and decremental learning methods to update the solution and let it satisfy the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions. Based on the SPS3VM and the piecewise linearity of model function, we can find the model with the minimum cross-validation (CV) error for the entire range of candidate hyperparameters by computing the error path of S3VM. Our SPS3VM is the first solution path algorithm for nonconvex optimization problem of semi-supervised learning models. We also provide the finite convergence analysis and computational complexity of SPS3VM. Experimental results on a variety of benchmark datasets not only verify that our SPS3VM can globally search the hyperparameters (regularization and ramp loss parameters) but also show a huge reduction of computational time while retaining similar or slightly better generalization performance compared with the grid search approach.},

In this survey, we define the concept of KADL and introduce its three major tasks, i.e., knowledge identification, knowledge representation, and knowledge integration. Different from existing surveys that are focused on a specific type of knowledge, we provide a broad and complete taxonomy of domain knowledge and its representations. Based on our taxonomy, we provide a systematic review of existing techniques, different from existing works that survey integration approaches agnostic to the taxonomy of knowledge.

However, the causes of adversarial vulnerability in CNNs remain unknown. To address this issue, we propose a unique cross-scale analytical approach from a statistical physics perspective. It reveals that the huge amount of nonlinear effects inherent in CNNs is the fundamental cause for the formation and evolution of system vulnerability. Vulnerability is spontaneously formed on the macroscopic level after the symmetry of the system is broken through the nonlinear interaction between microscopic state order parameters. We develop a cascade failure algorithm, visualizing how micro perturbations on neurons’ activation can cascade and influence macro decision paths. Our empirical results demonstrate the interplay between microlevel activation maps and macrolevel decision-making and provide a statistical physics perspective to understand the causality behind CNN vulnerability. Our work will help subsequent research to improve the adversarial robustness of CNNs.},

  abstract     = {Evaluation of intervention in a multiagent system, for example, when humans should intervene in autonomous driving systems and when a player should pass to teammates for a good shot, is challenging in various engineering and scientific fields. Estimating the individual treatment effect (ITE) using counterfactual long-term prediction is practical to evaluate such interventions. However, most of the conventional frameworks did not consider the time-varying complex structure of multiagent relationships and covariate counterfactual prediction. This may lead to erroneous assessments of ITE and difficulty in interpretation. Here, we propose an interpretable, counterfactual recurrent network in multiagent systems to estimate the effect of the intervention. Our model leverages graph variational recurrent neural networks (GVRNNs) and theory-based computation with domain knowledge for the ITE estimation framework based on long-term prediction of multiagent covariates and outcomes, which can confirm the circumstances under which the intervention is effective. On simulated models of an automated vehicle and biological agents with time-varying confounders, we show that our methods achieved lower estimation errors in counterfactual covariates and the most effective treatment timing than the baselines. Furthermore, using real basketball data, our methods performed realistic counterfactual predictions and evaluated the counterfactual passes in shot scenarios.},

To further enhance prediction performance, the output from the final intermediate layer is fed through a feed-forward neural network architecture for final prediction. We derive an upper bound of the disparity between the generalization error and the empirical error and demonstrate that it converges to zero.

  abstract     = {The high cost of acquiring and annotating samples has made the “few-shot” learning problem of prime importance. Existing works mainly focus on improving performance on clean data and overlook robustness concerns on the data perturbed with adversarial noise. Recently, a few efforts have been made to combine the few-shot problem with the robustness objective using sophisticated meta-learning techniques. These methods rely on the generation of adversarial samples in every episode of training, which further adds to the computational burden. To avoid such time-consuming and complicated procedures, we propose a simple but effective alternative that does not require any adversarial samples. Inspired by the cognitive decision-making process in humans, we enforce high-level feature matching between the base class data and their corresponding low-frequency samples in the pretraining stage via self distillation. The model is then fine-tuned on the samples of novel classes where we additionally improve the discriminability of low-frequency query set features via cosine similarity. On a one-shot setting of the CIFAR-FS dataset, our method yields a massive improvement of 60.55% and 62.05% in adversarial accuracy on the projected gradient descent (PGD) and state-of-the-art auto attack, respectively, with a minor drop in clean accuracy compared to the baseline. Moreover, our method only takes $1.69\times $ of the standard training time while being $\approx 5\times $ faster than thestate-of-the-art adversarial meta-learning methods.

  abstract     = {Recently, machine/deep learning techniques are achieving remarkable success in a variety of intelligent control and management systems, promising to change the future of artificial intelligence (AI) scenarios. However, they still suffer from some intractable difficulty or limitations for model training, such as the out-of-distribution (OOD) issue, in modern smart manufacturing or intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). In this study, we newly design and introduce a deep generative model framework, which seamlessly incorporates the information theoretic learning (ITL) and causal representation learning (CRL) in a dual-generative adversarial network (Dual-GAN) architecture, aiming to enhance the robust OOD generalization in modern machine learning (ML) paradigms. In particular, an ITL- and CRL-enhanced Dual-GAN (ITCRL-DGAN) model is presented, which includes an autoencoder with CRL (AE-CRL) structure to aid the dual-adversarial training with causality-inspired feature representations and a Dual-GAN structure to improve the data augmentation in both feature and data levels. Following a newly designed feature separation strategy, a causal graph is built and improved based on the information theory, which can enhance the causally related factors among the separated core features and further enrich the feature representation with the counterfactual features via interventions based on the refined causal relationships. The ITL is incorporated to improve the extraction of low-dimensional feature representations and learn the optimized causal representations based on the idea of “information flow.” A dual-adversarial training mechanism is then developed, which not only enables the generator to expand the boundary of feature distribution in accordance with the optimized feature representation from AE-CRL, but also allows the discriminator to further verify and improve the quality of the augmented data for OOD generalization. Experiment and evaluation results based on an open-source dataset demonstrate the outstanding learning efficiency and classification performance of our proposed model for robust OOD generalization in modern smart applications compared with three baseline methods.},

  abstract     = {The matrix-based Rényi’s entropy (MBRE) has recently been introduced as a substitute for the original Rényi’s entropy that could be directly obtained from data samples, avoiding the expensive intermediate step of density estimation. Despite its remarkable success in a broad of information-related tasks, the computational cost of MBRE, however, becomes a bottleneck for large-scale applications. The challenge, when facing sequential data, is further amplified due to the requirement of large-scale eigenvalue decomposition on multiple dense kernel matrices constructed by sliding windows in the region of interest, resulting in $O(mn^{3})$ overall time complexity, where $m$ and $n$ denote the number and the size of windows, respectively. To overcome this issue, we adopt the static MBRE estimator together with a variance reduction criterion to develop randomized approximations for the target entropy, leading to high accuracy with substantially lower query complexity by utilizing the historical estimation results. Specifically, assuming that the changes of adjacent sliding windows are bounded by $\beta \ll 1$ , which is a trivial case in domains, e.g., time-series analysis, we lower the complexity by a factor of $\sqrt {\beta }$ . Polynomial approximation techniques are further adopted to support arbitrary $\alpha $ orders. In general, our algorithms achieve $O(mn^{2}\sqrt {\beta }st)$ total computational complexity, where $s, t \ll n$ denote the number of vector queries and the polynomial degrees, respectively. Theoretical upper and lower bounds are established in terms of the convergence rate for both $s$ and $t$ , and large-scale experiments on both simulation and real-world data are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our algorithms. The results show that our methods achieve promising speedup with only a trivial loss in performance.},

  abstract     = {Computerized tomography (CT) is a clinically primary technique to differentiate benign-malignant pulmonary nodules for lung cancer diagnosis. Early classification of pulmonary nodules is essential to slow down the degenerative process and reduce mortality. The interactive paradigm assisted by neural networks is considered to be an effective means for early lung cancer screening in large populations. However, some inherent characteristics of pulmonary nodules in high-resolution CT images, e.g., diverse shapes and sparse distribution over the lung fields, have been inducing inaccurate results. On the other hand, most existing methods with neural networks are dissatisfactory from a lack of transparency. In order to overcome these obstacles, a united framework is proposed, including the classification and feature visualization stages, to learn distinctive features and provide visual results. Specifically, a bilateral scheme is employed to synchronously extract and aggregate global-local features in the classification stage, where the global branch is constructed to perceive deep-level features and the local branch is built to focus on the refined details. Furthermore, an encoder is built to generate some features, and a decoder is constructed to simulate decision behavior, followed by the information bottleneck viewpoint to optimize the objective. Extensive experiments are performed to evaluate our framework on two publicly available datasets, namely, 1) the Lung Image Database Consortium and Image Database Resource Initiative (LIDC-IDRI) and 2) the Lung and Colon Histopathological Image Dataset (LC25000). For instance, our framework achieves 92.98% accuracy and presents additional visualizations on the LIDC. The experiment results show that our framework can obtain outstanding performance and is effective to facilitate explainability. It also demonstrates that this united framework is a serviceable tool and further has the scalability to be introduced into clinical research.},

  abstract     = {As a recent noticeable topic, domain generalization aims to learn a generalizable model on multiple source domains, which is expected to perform well on unseen test domains. Great efforts have been made to learn domain-invariant features by aligning distributions across domains. However, existing works are often designed based on some relaxed conditions which are generally hard to satisfy and fail to realize the desired joint distribution alignment. In this article, we propose a novel domain generalization method, which originates from an intuitive idea that a domain-invariant classifier can be learned by minimizing the Kullback–Leibler (KL)-divergence between posterior distributions from different domains. To enhance the generalizability of the learned classifier, we formalize the optimization objective as an expectation computed on the ground-truth marginal distribution. Nevertheless, it also presents two obvious deficiencies, one of which is the side-effect of entropy increase in KL-divergence and the other is the unavailability of ground-truth marginal distributions. For the former, we introduce a term named maximum in-domain likelihood to maintain the discrimination of the learned domain-invariant representation space. For the latter, we approximate the ground-truth marginal distribution with source domains under a reasonable convex hull assumption. Finally, a constrained maximum cross-domain likelihood (CMCL) optimization problem is deduced, by solving which the joint distributions are naturally aligned. An alternating optimization strategy is carefully designed to approximately solve this optimization problem. Extensive experiments on four standard benchmark datasets, i.e., Digits-DG, PACS, Office-Home, and miniDomainNet, highlight the superior performance of our method.},

In this article, we take the first step in this direction by precisely characterizing the robustness of adversarial training in binary linear classification. Specifically, we consider the high-dimensional regime where the model dimension grows with the size of the training set at a constant ratio. Our results provide exact asymptotics for both standard and adversarial test errors under general $\ell _{q}$ -norm bounded perturbations ( $q \ge 1$ ) in both discriminative binary models and generative Gaussian-mixture models with correlated features. We use our sharp error formulae to explain how the adversarial and standard errors depend upon the over-parameterization ratio, the data model, and the attack budget. Finally, by comparing with the robust Bayes estimator, our sharp asymptotics allow us to study the fundamental limits of adversarial training.},

To alleviate this problem, we propose a robust classification method, named SAM with the correntropy-induced loss (CSAM), by integrating the correntropy-induced loss (C-loss), the data-dependent hypothesis space, and the weighted $\ell _{q,1}$ -norm regularizer ( $q\geq 1$ ) into additive machines. In theory, the generalization error bound is estimated via a novel error decomposition and the concentration estimation techniques, which shows that the convergence rate $\mathcal {O}(n^{-1/4})$ can be achieved under proper parameter conditions. In addition, the theoretical guarantee on variable selection consistency is analyzed. Experimental evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets consistently validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {The bagging method has received much application and attention in recent years due to its good performance and simple framework. It has facilitated the advanced random forest method and accuracy-diversity ensemble theory. Bagging is an ensemble method based on simple random sampling (SRS) method with replacement. However, SRS is the most foundation sampling method in the field of statistics, where exists some other advanced sampling methods for probability density estimation. In imbalanced ensemble learning, down-sampling, over-sampling, and SMOTE methods have been proposed for generating base training set. However, these methods aim at changing the underlying distribution of data rather than simulating it better. The ranked set sampling (RSS) method uses auxiliary information to get more effective samples. The purpose of this article is to propose a bagging ensemble method based on RSS, which uses the ordering of objects related to the class to obtain more effective training sets. To explain its performance, we give a generalization bound of ensemble from the perspective of posterior probability estimation and Fisher information. On the basis of RSS sample having a higher Fisher information than SRS sample, the presented bound theoretically explains the better performance of RSS-Bagging. The experiments on 12 benchmark datasets demonstrate that RSS-Bagging statistically performs better than SRS-Bagging when the base classifiers are multinomial logistic regression (MLR) and support vector machine (SVM).},

  abstract     = {As a complex neural network system, the brain regions and genes collaborate to effectively store and transmit information. We abstract the collaboration correlations as the brain region gene community network (BG-CN) and present a new deep learning approach, such as the community graph convolutional neural network (Com-GCN), for investigating the transmission of information within and between communities. The results can be used for diagnosing and extracting causal factors for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). First, an affinity aggregation model for BG-CN is developed to describe intercommunity and intracommunity information transmission. Second, we design the Com-GCN architecture with intercommunity convolution and intracommunity convolution operations based on the affinity aggregation model. Through sufficient experimental validation on the AD neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) dataset, the design of Com-GCN matches the physiological mechanism better and improves the interpretability and classification performance. Furthermore, Com-GCN can identify lesioned brain regions and disease-causing genes, which may assist precision medicine and drug design in AD and serve as a valuable reference for other neurological disorders.},

Delving into deeper factors that affect the fairness of DNNs is paramount and serves as the foundation for mitigating model biases. However, current methods are limited in accurately predicting DNN biases, relying solely on the number of training samples and lacking more precise measurement tools. Here, we establish a geometric perspective for analyzing the fairness of DNNs, comprehensively exploring how DNNs internally shape the intrinsic geometric characteristics of datasets—the intrinsic dimensions (IDs) of perceptual manifolds, and the impact of IDs on the fairness of DNNs. Based on multiple findings, we propose Intrinsic Dimension Regularization (IDR), which enhances the fairness and performance of models by promoting the learning of concise and ID-balanced class perceptual manifolds. In various image recognition benchmark tests, IDR significantly mitigates model bias while improving its performance.},

  abstract     = {Text-to-image generation (TTI) refers to the usage of models that could process text input and generate high fidelity images based on text descriptions. Text-to-image generation using neural networks could be traced back to the emergence of Generative Adversial Network (GAN), followed by the autoregressive Transformer. Diffusion models are one prominent type of generative model used for the generation of images through the systematic introduction of noises with repeating steps. As an effect of the impressive results of diffusion models on image synthesis, it has been cemented as the major image decoder used by text-to-image models and brought text-to-image generation to the forefront of machine-learning (ML) research. In the era of large models, scaling up model size and the integration with large language models have further improved the performance of TTI models, resulting the generation result nearly indistinguishable from real-world images, revolutionizing the way we retrieval images. Our explorative study has incentivised us to think that there are further ways of scaling text-to-image models with the combination of innovative model architectures and prediction enhancement techniques. We have divided the work of this survey into five main sections wherein we detail the frameworks of major literature in order to delve into the different types of text-to-image generation methods. Following this we provide a detailed comparison and critique of these methods and offer possible pathways of improvement for future work. In the future work, we argue that TTI development could yield impressive productivity improvements for creation, particularly in the context of the AIGC era, and could be extended to more complex tasks such as video generation and 3D generation.},

  abstract     = {The number of categories of instances in the real world is normally huge, and each instance may contain multiple labels. To distinguish these massive labels utilizing machine learning, eXtreme Label Classification (XLC) has been established. However, as the number of categories increases, the number of parameters and nonlinear operations in the classifier also rises. This results in a Classifier Computational Overload Problem (CCOP). To address this, we propose a Multi-Head Encoding (MHE) mechanism, which replaces the vanilla classifier with a multi-head classifier. During the training process, MHE decomposes extreme labels into the product of multiple short local labels, with each head trained on these local labels. During testing, the predicted labels can be directly calculated from the local predictions of each head. This reduces the computational load geometrically. Then, according to the characteristics of different XLC tasks, e.g., single-label, multi-label, and model pretraining tasks, three MHE-based implementations, i.e., Multi-Head Product, Multi-Head Cascade, and Multi-Head Sampling, are proposed to more effectively cope with CCOP. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate that MHE can achieve performance approximately equivalent to that of the vanilla classifier by generalizing the low-rank approximation problem from Frobenius-norm to Cross-Entropy. Experimental results show that the proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art performance while significantly streamlining the training and inference processes of XLC tasks.},

  abstract     = {Social images are often associated with rich but noisy tags from community contributions. Although social tags can potentially provide valuable semantic training information for image retrieval, existing studies all fail to effectively filter noises by exploiting the cross-modal correlation between image content and tags. The current cross-modal vision-and-language representation learning methods, which selectively attend to the relevant parts of the image and text, show a promising direction. However, they are not suitable for social image retrieval since: (1) they deal with natural text sequences where the relationships between words can be easily captured by language models for cross-modal relevance estimation, while the tags are isolated and noisy; (2) they take (image, text) pair as input, and consequently cannot be employed directly for unimodal social image retrieval. This paper tackles the challenge of utilizing cross-modal interactions to learn precise representations for unimodal retrieval. The proposed framework, dubbed CGVR (Cross-modal Guided Visual Representation), extracts accurate semantic representations of images from noisy tags and transfers this ability to image-only hashing subnetwork by a carefully designed training scheme. To well capture correlated semantics and filter noises, it embeds a priori common-sense relationship among tags into attention computation for joint awareness of textual and visual context. Experiments show that CGVR achieves approximately 8.82 and 5.45 points improvement in MAP over the state-of-the-art on two widely used social image benchmarks. CGVR can serve as a new baseline for the image retrieval community.},

We find that a contrastive loss–which encourages learning diverse data transformations while preserving the relevant semantic content of the data–is more suitable than previously proposed losses for transformation learning, a fact that we prove theoretically and empirically. We demonstrate that anomaly detection using neural transformation learning can achieve state-of-the-art results for time series data, tabular data, text data and graph data.

To adapt this concept to the needs of audio signal processing, we implement a short-term spectral analysis of a musical piece, followed by a mapping of its subsequent spectral timeframes onto signatures of fifths reflecting relative intensities of sounds associated with each of the 12 pitch classes. Subsequently, the calculation of the characteristic points of the consecutive signatures of fifths enables the creation of the trajectory of fifths. The results of the experiments and statistical analysis conducted in a set of 8996 audio music pieces belonging to 10 genres indicate that this kind of trajectory, just as its MIDI-compliant precursor, is a source of valuable information (i.e., feature coefficients) concerning the harmonic structure of music, which may find use in audio music classification processes.},

As an important subfield, video-language representation learning focuses on learning representations using global semantic interactions between pre-defined video-text pairs. However, to enhance and refine such coarse-grained global interactions, more detailed interactions are necessary for fine-grained multimodal learning. In this study, we introduce a new approach that models video-text as game players using multivariate cooperative game theory to handle uncertainty during fine-grained semantic interactions with diverse granularity, flexible combination, and vague intensity. Specifically, we design the Hierarchical Banzhaf Interaction to simulate the fine-grained correspondence between video clips and textual words from hierarchical perspectives. Furthermore, to mitigate the bias in calculations within Banzhaf Interaction, we propose reconstructing the representation through a fusion of single-modal and cross-modal components. This reconstructed representation ensures fine granularity comparable to that of the single-modal representation, while also preserving the adaptive encoding characteristics of cross-modal representation. Additionally, we extend our original structure into a flexible encoder-decoder framework, enabling the model to adapt to various downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on commonly used text-video retrieval, video-question answering, and video captioning benchmarks, with superior performance, validate the effectiveness and generalization of our method.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the problem of procedure planning in instructional videos, which aims to make a plan (i.e. a sequence of actions) given the current visual observation and the desired goal. Previous works cast this as a sequence modeling problem and leverage either intermediate visual observations or language instructions as supervision to make autoregressive planning, resulting in complex learning schemes and expensive annotation costs. To avoid intermediate supervision annotation and error accumulation caused by planning autoregressively, we propose a diffusion-based framework, coined as PDPP (Projected Diffusion model for Procedure Planning), to directly model the whole action sequence distribution with task label as supervision instead. Our core idea is to treat procedure planning as a distribution fitting problem under the given observations, thus transform the planning problem to a sampling process from this distribution during inference. The diffusion-based modeling approach also effectively addresses the uncertainty issue in procedure planning. Based on PDPP, we further apply joint training to our framework to generate plans with varying horizon lengths using a single model and reduce the number of training parameters required. We instantiate our PDPP with three popular diffusion models and investigate a serious of condition-introducing methods in our framework, including condition embeddings, Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs), two-stage prediction and Classifier-Free Guidance strategy. Finally, we apply our PDPP to the Visual Planners for human Assistance (VPA) problem which requires the goal specified in natural language rather than visual observation. We conduct experiments on challenging datasets of different scales and our PDPP model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics, even compared with those strongly-supervised counterparts. These results further demonstratethe effectiveness and generalization ability of our model.},

To protect facial privacy, existing methods have proposed adversarial face examples that can fool FR systems. However, most of these methods work only in the digital domain and do not consider natural physical protections. In this paper, we present NatMask, a 3D-based method for creating natural and realistic adversarial face masks that can preserve facial identity in the physical world. Our method utilizes 3D face reconstruction and differentiable rendering to generate 2D face images with natural-looking facial masks. Moreover, we propose an identity-aware style injection (IASI) method to improve the naturalness and transferability of the mask texture. We evaluate our method on two face datasets to verify its effectiveness in protecting face identity against four state-of-the-art (SOTA) FR models and three commercial FR APIs in both digital and physical domains under black-box impersonation and dodging strategies. Experiments show that our method can generate adversarial masks with superior naturalness and physical realizability to safeguard face identity, outperforming SOTA methods by a large margin.},

  abstract     = {Multi-source image fusion combines the information coming from multiple images into one data, thus improving imaging quality. This topic has aroused great interest in the community. How to integrate information from different sources is still a big challenge, although the existing self-attention based transformer methods can capture spatial and channel similarities. In this paper, we first discuss the mathematical concepts behind the proposed generalized self-attention mechanism, where the existing self-attentions are considered basic forms. The proposed mechanism employs multilinear algebra to drive the development of a novel fully-connected self-attention (FCSA) method to fully exploit local and non-local domain-specific correlations among multi-source images. Moreover, we propose a multi-source image representation embedding it into the FCSA framework as a non-local prior within an optimization problem. Some different fusion problems are unfolded into the proposed fully-connected transformer fusion network (FC-Former). More specifically, the concept of generalized self-attention can promote the potential development of self-attention. Hence, the FC-Former can be viewed as a network model unifying different fusion tasks. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, the proposed FC-Former method exhibits robust and superior performance, showing its capability of faithfully preserving information.},

However, when applied to large graphs, especially those sparse ones, this method performs unstably and unsatisfactorily. We make a detailed analysis on it and propose a novel method from the perspective of optimization. On fully connected graphs, the method is equivalent to the Green-function method and can be seen as another interpretation with physical meanings, while on non-fully connected graphs, it helps to explain why the Green-function method causes a mess on large sparse graphs. To solve this dilemma, we propose a workable approach to improve our proposed method. Unlike the original method, our improved method can also apply two accelerating techniques, Gaussian Elimination, and Anchored Graphs to become more efficient on large graphs. Finally, the extensive experiments prove our conclusions and the efficiency, accuracy, and stability of our improved Green&#39;s function method.},

In view of the dilemma faced by our research community, we rethink if the “saliency clues” are really appropriate to serve the panoramic video navigation task. According to our in-depth investigation, we argue that using “saliency clues” cannot generate a satisfying navigation path, failing to well represent the given panoramic video, and the views in the navigation path are also low aesthetics. In this paper, we present a brand-new navigation paradigm. Although our model is still trained on eye-fixations, our methodology can additionally enable the trained model to perceive the “meaningful” degree of the given panoramic video content. Outwardly, the proposed new approach is saliency-free, but inwardly, it is developed from saliency but biasing more to be “meaningful-driven”; thus, it can generate a navigation path with more appropriate content coverage. Besides, this paper is the first attempt to devise an unsupervised learning scheme to ensure all localized meaningful views in the navigation path have high aesthetics. Thus, the navigation path generated by our approach can also bring users an enjoyable watching experience. As a new topic in its infancy, we have devised a series of quantitative evaluation schemes, including objective verifications and subjective user studies. All these innovative attempts would have great potential to inspire and promote this research field in the near future.},

In this work, we present a new framework termed BEVFormer, which learns unified BEV representations from multi-modality data with spatiotemporal transformers to support multiple autonomous driving perception tasks. In a nutshell, BEVFormer exploits both spatial and temporal information by interacting with spatial and temporal space through predefined grid-shaped BEV queries. To aggregate spatial information, we design spatial cross-attention that each BEV query extracts the spatial features from both point cloud and camera input, thus completing multi-modality information fusion under BEV space. For temporal information, we propose temporal self-attention to fuse the history BEV information recurrently. By comparing with other fusion paradigms, we demonstrate that the fusion method proposed in this work is both succinct and effective. Our approach achieves the new state-of-the-art 74.1% in terms of NDS metric on the nuScenes test set. In addition, we extend BEVFormer to encompass a wide range of autonomous driving tasks, including object tracking, vectorized mapping, occupancy prediction, and end-to-end autonomous driving, achieving outstanding results across these tasks.},

This task is particularly challenging for real-world acquisitions due to factors, such as noise, outliers, non-uniform sampling, and missing data. Traditional approaches often simplify the problem by imposing handcrafted priors on either the input point clouds or the resulting surface, a process that can require tedious hyperparameter tuning. In contrast, deep learning models have the capability to directly learn the properties of input point clouds and desired surfaces from data. We study the influence of handcrafted and learned priors on the precision and robustness of surface reconstruction techniques. We evaluate various time-tested and contemporary methods in a standardized manner. When both trained and evaluated on point clouds with identical characteristics, the learning-based models consistently produce higher-quality surfaces compared to their traditional counterparts—even in scenarios involving novel shape categories. However, traditional methods demonstrate greater resilience to the diverse anomalies commonly found in real-world 3D acquisitions. For the benefit of the research community, we make our code and datasets available, inviting further enhancements to learning-based surface reconstruction.},

In this paper, we design a recurrent winner-take-all network and propose the spiking variational policy gradient (SVPG), a new R-STDP learning method derived theoretically from the global policy gradient. Specifically, the policy inference is derived from an energy-based policy function using mean-field inference, and the policy optimization is based on a last-step approximation of the global policy gradient. These fill the gap between the local learning rules and the global target. In experiments including a challenging ViZDoom vision-based navigation task and two realistic robot control tasks, SVPG successfully solves all the tasks. In addition, SVPG exhibits better inherent robustness to various kinds of input, network parameters, and environmental perturbations than compared methods.},

  abstract     = {RGB-Thermal Salient Object Detection (RGB-T SOD) aims to pinpoint prominent objects within aligned pairs of visible and thermal infrared images. A key challenge lies in bridging the inherent disparities between RGB and Thermal modalities for effective saliency map prediction. Traditional encoder-decoder architectures, while designed for cross-modality feature interactions, may not have adequately considered the robustness against noise originating from defective modalities, thereby leading to suboptimal performance in complex scenarios. Inspired by hierarchical human visual systems, we propose the ConTriNet, a robust Confluent Triple-Flow Network employing a “Divide-and-Conquer” strategy. This framework utilizes a unified encoder with specialized decoders, each addressing different subtasks of exploring modality-specific and modality-complementary information for RGB-T SOD, thereby enhancing the final saliency map prediction. Specifically, ConTriNet comprises three flows: two modality-specific flows explore cues from RGB and Thermal modalities, and a third modality-complementary flow integrates cues from both modalities. ConTriNet presents several notable advantages. It incorporates a Modality-induced Feature Modulator (MFM) in the modality-shared union encoder to minimize inter-modality discrepancies and mitigate the impact of defective samples. Additionally, a foundational Residual Atrous Spatial Pyramid Module (RASPM) in the separated flows enlarges the receptive field, allowing for the capture of multi-scale contextual information. Furthermore, a Modality-aware Dynamic Aggregation Module (MDAM) in the modality-complementary flow dynamically aggregates saliency-related cues from both modality-specific flows. Leveraging the proposed parallel triple-flow framework, we further refine saliency maps derived from different flows through a flow-cooperative fusion strategy, yielding a high-quality, full-resolution saliency map for the final prediction. To evaluate the robustness and stability of our approach, we collect a comprehensive RGB-T SOD benchmark, VT-IMAG, covering various real-world challenging scenarios. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks and our VT-IMAG dataset demonstrate that ConTriNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art competitors in both common and challenging scenarios, even when dealing with incomplete modality data.},

  abstract     = {Humans exhibit complex motions that vary depending on the activity they are performing, the interactions they engage in, as well as subject-specific preferences. Therefore, forecasting a human’s future pose based on the history of his or her previous motion is a challenging task. This paper presents an innovative auxiliary-memory-powered deep neural network framework to improve the modelling of historical knowledge. Specifically, we disentangle subject-specific, action-specific, and other auxiliary information from the observed pose sequences and utilise these factorised features to query the memory. A novel Multi-Head knowledge retrieval scheme leverages these factorised feature embeddings to perform multiple querying operations over the historical observations captured within the auxiliary memory. Moreover, we propose a dynamic masking strategy to make this feature disentanglement process adaptive. Two novel loss functions are introduced to encourage diversity within the auxiliary memory, while ensuring the stability of the memory content such that it can locate and store salient information that aids the long-term prediction of future motion, irrespective of any data imbalances or the diversity of the input data distribution. Extensive experiments conducted on two public benchmarks, Human3.6M and CMU-Mocap, demonstrate that these design choices collectively allow the proposed approach to outperform the current state-of-the-art methods by significant margins: $&amp;gt; $ 17% on the Human3.6M dataset and $&amp;gt; $ 9% on the CMU-Mocap dataset.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, a large number of studies have shown that low rank matrix learning (LRML) has become a popular approach in machine learning and computer vision with many important applications, such as image inpainting, subspace clustering, and recommendation system. The latest LRML methods resort to using some surrogate functions as convex or nonconvex relaxation of the rank function. However, most of these methods ignore the difference between different rank components and can only yield suboptimal solutions. To alleviate this problem, in this paper we propose a novel nonconvex regularizer called capped reweighting norm minimization (CRNM), which not only considers the different contributions of different rank components, but also adaptively truncates sequential singular values. With it, a general LRML model is obtained. Meanwhile, under some mild conditions, the global optimum of CRNM regularized least squares subproblem can be easily obtained in closed-form. Through the analysis of the theoretical properties of CRNM, we develop a high computational efficiency optimization method with convergence guarantee to solve the general LRML model. More importantly, by using the Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz (KŁ) inequality, its local and global convergence properties are established. Finally, we show that the proposed nonconvex regularizer, as well as the optimization approach are suitable for different low rank tasks, such as matrix completion and subspace clustering. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the constructed models and methods provide significant advantages over several state-of-the-art low rank matrix leaning models and methods.},

  abstract     = {Depth completion, inferring dense depth maps from sparse measurements, is crucial for robust 3D perception. Although deep learning based methods have made tremendous progress in this problem, these models cannot generalize well across different scenes that are unobserved in training, posing a fundamental limitation that yet to be overcome. A careful analysis of existing deep neural network architectures for depth completion, which are largely borrowing from successful backbones for image analysis tasks, reveals that a key design bottleneck actually resides in the conventional normalization layers. These normalization layers are designed, on one hand, to make training more stable, on the other hand, to build more visual invariance across scene scales. However, in depth completion, the scale is actually what we want to robustly estimate in order to better generalize to unseen scenes. To mitigate, we propose a novel scale propagation normalization (SP-Norm) method to propagate scales from input to output, and simultaneously preserve the normalization operator for easy convergence. More specifically, we rescale the input using learned features of a single-layer perceptron from the normalized input, rather than directly normalizing the input as conventional normalization layers. We then develop a new network architecture based on SP-Norm and the ConvNeXt V2 backbone. We explore the composition of various basic blocks and architectures to achieve superior performance and efficient inference for generalizable depth completion. Extensive experiments are conducted on six unseen datasets with various types of sparse depth maps, i.e., randomly sampled 0.1%/1%/10% valid pixels, 4/8/16/32/64-line LiDAR points, and holes from Structured-Light. Our model consistently achieves the best accuracy with faster speed and lower memory when compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Achieving human-like planning and control with multimodal observations in an open world is a key milestone for more functional generalist agents. Existing approaches can handle certain long-horizon tasks in an open world. However, they still struggle when the number of open-world tasks could potentially be infinite and lack the capability to progressively enhance task completion as game time progresses. We introduce JARVIS-1, an open-world agent that can perceive multimodal input (visual observations and human instructions), generate sophisticated plans, and perform embodied control, all within the popular yet challenging open-world Minecraft universe. Specifically, we develop JARVIS-1 on top of pre-trained multimodal language models, which map visual observations and textual instructions to plans. The plans will be ultimately dispatched to the goal-conditioned controllers. We outfit JARVIS-1 with a multimodal memory, which facilitates planning using both pre-trained knowledge and its actual game survival experiences. JARVIS-1 is the existing most general agent in Minecraft, capable of completing over 200 different tasks using control and observation space similar to humans. These tasks range from short-horizon tasks, e.g., “chopping trees” to long-horizon ones, e.g., “obtaining a diamond pickaxe”. JARVIS-1 performs exceptionally well in short-horizon tasks, achieving nearly perfect performance. In the classic long-term task of ObtainDiamondPickaxe, JARVIS-1 surpasses the reliability of current state-of-the-art agents by 5 times and can successfully complete longer-horizon and more challenging tasks. Furthermore, we show that JARVIS-1 is able to self-improve following a life-long learning paradigm thanks to multimodal memory, sparking a more general intelligence and improved autonomy.},

  abstract     = {Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently played a dominant role in multimodal vision-language learning. Despite the great success, it lacks a holistic evaluation of their efficacy. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of publicly available large multimodal models by building an LVLM evaluation Hub (LVLM-eHub). Our LVLM-eHub consists of 13 representative LVLMs such as InstructBLIP and LLaVA, which are thoroughly evaluated by a quantitative capability evaluation and an online arena platform. The former evaluates five categories of multimodal capabilities of LVLMs such as visual question answering and object hallucination on 42 in-domain text-related visual benchmarks, while the latter provides the user-level evaluation of LVLMs in an open-world question-answering scenario. The study investigates how specific features of LVLMs such as model configurations, modality alignment mechanisms, and training data affect the multimodal understanding. By conducting a comprehensive comparison of these features on quantitative and arena evaluation, our study uncovers several innovative findings, which establish a fundamental framework for the development and evaluation of innovative strategies aimed at enhancing multimodal techniques.},

However, existing methods do not explicitly consider the plane-induced parallax, making the prediction compromised on multiple planes. In this work, we propose a novel method HomoGAN to guide unsupervised homography estimation to focus on the dominant plane. First, a multi-scale transformer is designed to predict homography from the feature pyramids of input images in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Moreover, we propose an unsupervised GAN to impose coplanarity constraint on the predicted homography, which is realized by using a generator to predict a mask of aligned regions, and then a discriminator to check if two masked feature maps are induced by a single homography. Based on the global homography framework, we extend it to the local mesh-grid homography estimation, namely, MeshHomoGAN, where plane constraints can be enforced on each mesh cell to go beyond a single dominant plane, such that scenes with multiple depth planes can be better aligned. To validate the effectiveness of our method and its components, we conduct extensive experiments on large-scale datasets. Results show that our matching error is 22% lower than previous SOTA methods.},

Existing studies usually focus on the crowdsourcing scenarios with low noise ratios but rarely focus on the crowdsourcing scenarios with high noise ratios. In this paper, we focus on the crowdsourcing scenarios with high noise ratios and propose a novel label aggregation algorithm called enhanced label distribution propagation (ELDP). First, ELDP harnesses an internal worker weighting method to estimate the weights of workers and then performs the first label distribution enhancement. Then, for instances not covered in the first enhancement, ELDP performs the second enhancement using a class membership estimation method based on the intra-cluster distance. Finally, ELDP propagates enhanced label distributions from accurately enhanced instances to inaccurately enhanced instances. Experimental results on both simulated and real-world crowdsourced datasets show that ELDP significantly outperforms all the other state-of-the-art label aggregation algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Scene graph generation (SGG) in satellite imagery (SAI) benefits promoting understanding of geospatial scenarios from perception to cognition. In SAI, objects exhibit great variations in scales and aspect ratios, and there exist rich relationships between objects (even between spatially disjoint objects), which makes it attractive to holistically conduct SGG in large-size very-high-resolution (VHR) SAI. However, there lack such SGG datasets. Due to the complexity of large-size SAI, mining triplets $&amp;lt; $&lt;mml:math&gt;&lt;mml:mo&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/mml:mo&gt;&lt;/mml:math&gt;subject, relationship, object$&amp;gt; $&lt;mml:math&gt;&lt;mml:mo&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/mml:mo&gt;&lt;/mml:math&gt; heavily relies on long-range contextual reasoning.

This paper constructs a large-scale dataset for SGG in large-size VHR SAI with image sizes ranging from 512 × 768 to 27 860 × 31 096 pixels, named STAR (Scene graph generaTion in lArge-size satellite imageRy), encompassing over 210K objects and over 400K triplets. To realize SGG in large-size SAI, we propose a context-aware cascade cognition (CAC) framework to understand SAI regarding object detection (OBD), pair pruning and relationship prediction for SGG. We also release a SAI-oriented SGG toolkit with about 30 OBD and 10 SGG methods which need further adaptation by our devised modules on our challenging STAR dataset.},

Thanks to the development of face recognition in the past decade, numerous real face images are available publicly, which are however neglected previously by the existing literature. In this paper, we propose an Anomalous cue Guided FAS (AG-FAS) method, which can effectively leverage large-scale additional real faces for improving model generalization via a De-fake Face Generator (DFG). Specifically, by training on a large-scale real face only dataset, the generator obtains the knowledge of what a real face should be like, and thus has the capability of generating a “real” version of any input face image. Consequently, the difference between the input face and the generated “real” face can be treated as cues of attention for the fake feature learning. With the above ideas, an Off-real Attention Network (OA-Net) is proposed which allocates its attention to the spoof region of the input according to the anomalous cue. Extensive experiments on a total of nine public datasets show our method achieves state-of-the-art results under cross-domain evaluations with unseen scenarios and unknown presentation attacks. Besides, we provide theoretical analysis demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed anomalous cues.},

  abstract     = {Pedestrian detection currently suffers from two issues in crowded scenes: occlusion and dense boundary prediction, making it still challenging in complex real-world scenarios. In recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Vision Transformers (ViT) have shown their superiorities in addressing these issues, where ViTs capture global feature dependency to infer occlusion parts and CNNs make accurate dense predictions by local detailed features. Nevertheless, limited by the narrow receptive field, CNNs fail to infer occlusion parts, while ViTs tend to ignore local features that are vital to distinguish different pedestrians in the crowd. Therefore, it is essential to combine the advantages of CNN and ViT for pedestrian detection. However, manually designing a specific CNN and ViT hybrid network requires enormous time and resources for trial and error. To address this issue, we propose the first Neural Architecture Search (NAS) framework specifically designed for pedestrian detection named NAS-PED, which automatically designs an appropriate CNNs and ViTs hybrid backbone for the crowded pedestrian detection task. Specifically, we formulate transformers and convolutions with various kernel sizes in the same format, which provides an unconstrained space for diverse hybrid network search. Furthermore, to search for a suitable backbone, we propose an information bottleneck based NAS objective function, which treats the process of NAS as an information extraction process, preserving relevant information and suppressing redundant information from the dense pedestrians in crowd scenes Extensive experiments on CrowdHuman, CityPersons and EuroCity Persons datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our NAS-PED obtains absolute gains of 4.0% MR$^{-2}$ and 1.9% AP over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) pedestrian detection framework on CrowdHuman datasets. For the CityPersons and EuroCity Persons datasets, the searched backbone achieves stable improvement across all three subsets, outperforming some large language-image pre-trained models.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a comprehensive exploration of the phenomenon of data redundancy in video understanding, with the aim to improve computational efficiency. Our investigation commences with an examination of spatial redundancy, which refers to the observation that the most informative region in each video frame usually corresponds to a small image patch, whose shape, size and location shift smoothly across frames. Motivated by this phenomenon, we formulate the patch localization problem as a dynamic decision task, and introduce a spatially adaptive video recognition approach, termed AdaFocus. In specific, a lightweight encoder is first employed to quickly process the full video sequence, whose features are then utilized by a policy network to identify the most task-relevant regions. Subsequently, the selected patches are inferred by a high-capacity deep network for the final prediction. The complete model can be trained conveniently in an end-to-end manner. During inference, once the informative patch sequence has been generated, the bulk of computation can be executed in parallel, rendering it efficient on modern GPU devices. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AdaFocus can be easily extended by further considering the temporal and sample-wise redundancies, i.e., allocating the majority of computation to the most task-relevant video frames, and minimizing the computation spent on relatively “easier” videos. Our resulting algorithm, Uni-AdaFocus, establishes a comprehensive framework that seamlessly integrates spatial, temporal, and sample-wise dynamic computation, while it preserves the merits of AdaFocus in terms of efficient end-to-end training and hardware friendliness. In addition, Uni-AdaFocus is general and flexible as it is compatible with off-the-shelf backbone models (e.g., TSM and X3D), which can be readily deployed as our feature extractor, yielding a significantly improved computational efficiency. Empirically, extensive experiments based on seven widely-used benchmark datasets (i.e., ActivityNet, FCVID, Mini-Kinetics, Something-Something V1&amp;V2, Jester, and Kinetics-400) and three real-world application scenarios (i.e., fine-grained diving action classification, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases diagnosis with brain magnetic resonance images (MRI), and violence recognition for online videos) substantiate that Uni-AdaFocus is considerably more efficient than the competitive baselines.},

In MetaEarth, we propose a resolution-guided self-cascading generative framework, which enables the generating of images at any region with a wide range of geographical resolutions. To achieve unbounded and arbitrary-sized image generation, we design a novel noise sampling strategy for denoising diffusion models by analyzing the generation conditions and initial noise. To train MetaEarth, we construct a large dataset comprising multi-resolution optical remote sensing images with geographical information. Experiments have demonstrated the powerful capabilities of our method in generating global-scale images. Additionally, the MetaEarth serves as a data engine that can provide high-quality and rich training data for downstream tasks. Our model opens up new possibilities for constructing generative world models by simulating Earthâs visuals from an innovative overhead perspective.},

Hence, a multi-semantic-granularity and target-sample oriented approach, called Adaptive Graph Learning with Semantic Promotability (AGLSP), is proposed, which consists of three parts: (a) Adaptive Graph Embedding with Semantic Guidance (AGE-SG) that adaptively estimates the promotability of target samples and learns variant semantic and geometrical components from the source and those semantically promotable target samples; (b) Semantically Promotable Sample Enhancement (SPSE) that further increases the discriminability and adaptability of tag granularity by mining the features of intra-class source and semantically promotable target samples with multi-granularities; and (c) Adaptive Graph Learning with Implicit Semantic Preservation (AGL-ISP) that forms the tag granularity by extracting commonalities between the source and those semantically non-promotable target samples. As AGLSP learns more semantics from the two domains, more cross-domain knowledge is transferred. Mathematical proofs and extensive experiments on seven datasets demonstrate the performance of AGLSP.},

To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel fair clustering ensemble method, which takes multiple base clustering results as inputs and learns a fair consensus clustering result. When designing the algorithm, we observe that one of the widely used definitions of fairness may cause a cluster imbalance problem. To tackle this problem, we give a new definition of fairness that can simultaneously characterize fairness and cluster capacity equality. Based on this new definition, we design an extremely simple yet effective regularized term to achieve fairness and cluster capacity equality. We plug this regularized term into our clustering ensemble framework, finally leading to our new fair clustering ensemble method. The extensive experiments show that, compared with the state-of-the-art clustering ensemble methods, our method can not only achieve a comparable or even better clustering performance, but also obtain a much fairer and better capacity equality result, which well demonstrates the effectiveness and superiority of our method.},

To address attribute leakage, we propose the Multi-Instance Generation Controller (MIGC). MIGC generates multiple instances through a divide-and-conquer strategy, breaking down multi-instance shading into single-instance tasks with singular attributes, later integrated. To provide more types of instance descriptions, we developed MIGC++. MIGC++ allows attribute control through text &amp; images and position control through boxes &amp; masks. Lastly, we introduced the Consistent-MIG algorithm to enhance the iterative MIG ability of MIGC and MIGC++. This algorithm ensures consistency in unmodified regions during the addition, deletion, or modification of instances, and preserves the identity of instances when their attributes are changed. We introduce the COCO-MIG and Multimodal-MIG benchmarks to evaluate these methods.

  abstract     = {To date, the widely adopted way to perform fixation collection in panoptic video is based on a head-mounted display (HMD), where users’ fixations are collected while wearing a HMD to explore the given panoptic scene freely. However, this widely-used data collection method is insufficient for training deep models to accurately predict which regions in a given panoptic are most important when it contains intermittent salient events. The main reason is that there always exist “blind zooms” when using HMD to collect fixations since the users cannot keep spinning their heads to explore the entire panoptic scene all the time. Consequently, the collected fixations tend to be trapped in some local views, leaving the remaining areas to be the “blind zooms”. Therefore, fixation data collected using HMD-based methods that accumulate local views cannot accurately represent the overall global importance—the main purpose of fixations—of complex panoptic scenes. To conquer, this paper introduces the auxiliary window with a dynamic blurring (WinDB) fixation collection approach for panoptic video, which doesn&#39;t need HMD and is able to well reflect the regional-wise importance degree. Using our WinDB approach, we have released a new PanopticVideo-300 dataset, containing 300 panoptic clips covering over 225 categories. Specifically, since using WinDB to collect fixations is blind zoom free, there exists frequent and intensive “fixation shifting”—a very special phenomenon that has long been overlooked by the previous research—in our new set. Thus, we present an effective fixation shifting network (FishNet) to conquer it. All these new fixation collection tool, dataset, and network could be very potential to open a new age for fixation-related research and applications in $360^\mathrm{o}$ environments.},

  abstract     = {Recent advancements in deep learning-based compression techniques have demonstrated remarkable performance surpassing traditional methods. Nevertheless, deep neural networks have been observed to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where an added pre-defined trigger pattern can induce the malicious behavior of the models. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to launch a backdoor attack with multiple triggers against learned image compression models. Drawing inspiration from the widely used discrete cosine transform (DCT) in existing compression codecs and standards, we propose a frequency-based trigger injection model that adds triggers in the DCT domain. In particular, we design several attack objectives that are adapted for a series of diverse scenarios, including: 1) attacking compression quality in terms of bit-rate and reconstruction quality; 2) attacking task-driven measures, such as face recognition and semantic segmentation in downstream applications. To facilitate more efficient training, we develop a dynamic loss function that dynamically balances the impact of different loss terms with fewer hyper-parameters, which also results in more effective optimization of the attack objectives with improved performance. Furthermore, we consider several advanced scenarios. We evaluate the resistance of the proposed backdoor attack to the defensive pre-processing methods and then propose a two-stage training schedule along with the design of robust frequency selection to further improve resistance. To strengthen both the cross-model and cross-domain transferability on attacking downstream CV tasks, we propose to shift the classification boundary in the attack loss during training. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that by employing our trained trigger injection models and making slight modifications to the encoder parameters of the compression model, our proposed attack can successfully inject multiple backdoors accompanied by their corresponding triggers into a single image compression model.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we focus on the challenging task of monocular 3D lane detection. Previous methods typically adopt inverse perspective mapping (IPM) to transform the Front-Viewed (FV) images or features into the Bird-Eye-Viewed (BEV) space for lane detection. However, IPM&#39;s dependence on flat ground assumption and context information loss in BEV representations lead to inaccurate 3D information estimation. Though efforts have been made to bypass BEV and directly predict 3D lanes from FV representations, their performances still fall behind BEV-based methods due to a lack of structured modeling of 3D lanes. In this paper, we propose a novel BEV-free method named Anchor3DLane++ which defines 3D lane anchors as structural representations and makes predictions directly from FV features. We also design a Prototype-based Adaptive Anchor Generation (PAAG) module to generate sample-adaptive sparse 3D anchors dynamically. In addition, an Equal-Width (EW) loss is developed to leverage the parallel property of lanes for regularization. Furthermore, camera-LiDAR fusion is also explored based on Anchor3DLane++ to leverage complementary information. Extensive experiments on three popular 3D lane detection benchmarks show that our Anchor3DLane++ outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.},

While existing studies typically employ multi-stage models that follow an iterative refinement process, we present a novel framework based on the denoising diffusion model that retains this core iterative principle. Within this framework, the model iteratively produces action predictions starting with random noise, conditioned on the features of the input video. To effectively capture three key characteristics of human actions, namely the position prior, the boundary ambiguity, and the relational dependency, we propose a cohesive masking strategy for the conditioning features. Moreover, a consistency gradient guidance technique is proposed, which maximizes the similarity between outputs with or without the masking, thereby enriching conditional information during the inference process. Extensive experiments are performed on four datasets, i.e., GTEA, 50Salads, Breakfast, and Assembly101. The results indicate that our proposed method outperforms or is on par with existing state-of-the-art techniques, underscoring the potential of generative approaches for action segmentation.},

Unfortunately, current works merely center on partially eliminating either the spurious or the noisy parts, while overlook the fact that in more practical and general situations, both the spurious and noisy subgraph coexist with the causal one. This brings great challenges and makes previous methods fail to extract the true causal substructure. Unlike existing studies, in this paper, we propose a more reasonable problem formulation that hypothesizes the graph is a mixture of causal, spurious, and noisy subgraphs. With this regard, an Information Bottleneck-constrained denoised Causal Subgraph (IBCS) learning model is developed, which is capable of simultaneously excluding the spurious and noisy parts. Specifically, for the spurious correlation, we design a novel causal learning objective, in which beyond minimizing the empirical risks of causal and spurious subgraph classification, the intervention is further conducted on spurious features to cut off its correlation with the causal part. On this basis, we further impose the information bottleneck constraint to filter out label-irrelevant noise information. Theoretically, we prove that the causal subgraph extracted by our IBCS can approximate the ground-truth. Empirically, extensive evaluations on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate our superiority over state-of-the-art baselines.},

  abstract     = {Recent years have witnessed the success of deep networks in compressed sensing (CS), which allows for a significant reduction in sampling cost and has gained growing attention since its inception. In this paper, we propose a new practical and compact network dubbed PCNet for general image CS. Specifically, in PCNet, a novel collaborative sampling operator is designed, which consists of a deep conditional filtering step and a dual-branch fast sampling step. The former learns an implicit representation of a linear transformation matrix into a few convolutions and first performs adaptive local filtering on the input image, while the latter then uses a discrete cosine transform and a scrambled block-diagonal Gaussian matrix to generate under-sampled measurements. Our PCNet is equipped with an enhanced proximal gradient descent algorithm-unrolled network for reconstruction. It offers flexibility, interpretability, and strong recovery performance for arbitrary sampling rates once trained. Additionally, we provide a deployment-oriented extraction scheme for single-pixel CS imaging systems, which allows for the convenient conversion of any linear sampling operator to its matrix form to be loaded onto hardware like digital micro-mirror devices. Extensive experiments on natural image CS, quantized CS, and self-supervised CS demonstrate the superior reconstruction accuracy and generalization ability of PCNet compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, particularly for high-resolution images.},

Visual prompts, like colorful boxes or circles, are suggested to enhance local perception. However, these methods often include irrelevant and noisy pixels, leading to suboptimal performance. The design of better visual prompts and their collaboration with text prompting remains underexplored. This paper introduces Fine-Grained Visual Text Prompting (FGVTP), a new zero-shot framework for object-based tasks using precise semantic masks and reinforced image-text alignment. FGVTP comprises Fine-Grained Visual Prompting (FGVP) and Consistency-Enhanced Text Prompting (CETP). Specifically, we carefully study visual prompting designs by exploring more visual markings that vary in shape and form. FGVP uses semantic masks from a segmenter like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and employs background blurring (Blur Reverse Mask) to highlight targets while maintaining spatial coherence. Further, CETP enhances image-text alignment by prompting captions based on FGVP-processed images. As a result, FGVTP achieves superior zero-shot referring expression comprehension on RefCOCO/+/g benchmarks, outperforming previous SOTA methods by 5.8% on average. Part detection experiments conducted on the PACO dataset further validate the preponderance of FGVTP over existing works.},

  abstract     = {The Diffusion Model (DM) has emerged as the SOTA approach for image synthesis. However, the existing DM cannot perform well on some image-to-image translation (I2I) tasks. Different from image synthesis, some I2I tasks, such as super-resolution, require generating results in accordance with GT images. Traditional DMs for image synthesis require extensive iterations and large denoising models to estimate entire images, which gives their strong generative ability but also leads to artifacts and inefficiency for I2I. To tackle this challenge, we propose a simple, efficient, and powerful DM framework for I2I, called DiffI2I. Specifically, DiffI2I comprises three key components: a compact I2I prior extraction network (CPEN), a dynamic I2I transformer (DI2Iformer), and a denoising network. We train DiffI2I in two stages: pretraining and DM training. For pretraining, GT and input images are fed into CPEN$_{S1}$ to capture a compact I2I prior representation (IPR) guiding DI2Iformer. In the second stage, the DM is trained to only use the input images to estimate the same IRP as CPEN$_{S1}$. Compared to traditional DMs, the compact IPR enables DiffI2I to obtain more accurate outcomes and employ a lighter denoising network and fewer iterations. Through extensive experiments on various I2I tasks, we demonstrate that DiffI2I achieves SOTA performance while significantly reducing computational burdens.},

Despite their potential, the adoption of these sensors is severely hampered by (a) high data rates and (b) the need for new computational pipelines to handle the unconventional raw data. We introduce a simple, low-bandwidth computational pipeline to address these challenges. Our approach is based on a novel streaming representation with a small memory footprint, efficiently capturing intensity information at multiple temporal scales. Updating the representation requires only 24floating-point operations/pixel, which can be efficiently computed online at the native frame rate of the binary frames. We use a neural network operating on this representation to reconstruct videos in real-time (10-30 fps). We illustrate why such representation is well-suited for these emerging sensors, and how it offers low latency and high frame rate while retaining flexibility for downstream computer vision. Our approach results in significant data bandwidth reductions ($\sim 100\times$) and real-time image reconstruction and computer vision $-10^{4}\text{-}10^{5} \times$ reduction in computation than existing state-of-the-art approach (Ma et al. 2020), while maintaining comparable quality.

However, existing methods can only handle text-line instances, leaving the problem of searching for partial patches within these text-line instances unsolved due to a lack of patch annotations in the training data. To address this issue, we propose a network that can simultaneously retrieve both text-line instances and their partial patches. Our method embeds the two types of data (query text and scene text instances) into a shared feature space and measures their cross-modal similarities. To handle partial patches, our proposed approach adopts a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approach to learn their similarities with query text, without requiring extra annotations. However, constructing bags, which is a standard step of conventional MIL approaches, can introduce numerous noisy samples for training, and lower inference speed. To address this issue, we propose a Ranking MIL (RankMIL) approach to adaptively filter those noisy samples. Additionally, we present a Dynamic Partial Match Algorithm (DPMA) that can directly search for the target partial patch from a text-line instance during the inference stage, without requiring bags. This greatly improves the search efficiency and the performance of retrieving partial patches. We evaluate the proposed method on both English and Chinese datasets in two tasks: retrieving text-line instances and partial patches. For English text retrieval, our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by 8.04% mAP and 12.71% mAP on average, respectively, among three datasets for the two tasks. For Chinese text retrieval, our approach surpasses state-of-the-art approaches by 24.45% mAP and 38.06% mAP on average, respectively, among three datasets for the two tasks.},

Building on this dataset, we introduce a hybrid framework BokehMe++, combining a classical renderer and a neural renderer. The classical renderer is implemented by a hierarchical scattering-based method, which suffers from boundary inaccuracies. These erroneous areas will be identified by an error map generator and be corrected by a two-stage neural renderer. Adaptive resizing and iterative upsampling are introduced in the neural renderer to process arbitrary blur size efficiently. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BokehMe++ outperforms existing methods and provides highly customizable rendering features, such as adjustable blur amount, focal plane, highlight mode and cat-eye effect.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a novel image retrieval network named Correlation Verification Network (CVNet) to replace the conventional geometric re-ranking with a 4D convolutional neural network that learns diverse geometric matching possibilities. To enable efficient cross-scale matching, we construct feature pyramids and establish cross-scale feature correlations in a single inference, thereby replacing the costly multi-scale inference. Additionally, we employ curriculum learning with the Hide-and-Seek strategy to handle challenging samples. Our proposed CVNet demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on several image retrieval benchmarks by a large margin. From an implementation perspective, however, CVNet has one drawback: it requires high memory usage because it needs to store dense features of all database images. This high memory requirement can be a significant limitation in practical applications. To address this issue, we introduce an extension of CVNet called Dense-to-Sparse CVNet (CVNet$^{DS}$), which can significantly reduce memory usage by sparsifying the features of the database images. The sparsification module in CVNet$^{DS}$ learns to select the relevant parts of image features end-to-end using a Gumbel estimator. Since the sparsification is performed offline, CVNet$^{DS}$ does not increase online extraction and matching times. CVNet$^{DS}$ dramatically reduces the memory footprint while preserving performance levels nearly identical to CVNet.},

  abstract     = {Iterative methods such as iterative closest point (ICP) for point cloud registration often suffer from bad local optimality (e.g., saddle points), due to the nature of nonconvex optimization. To address this fundamental challenge, in this paper we propose learning to form the loss landscape of a deep iterative method w.r.t. predictions at test time into a convex-like shape locally around each ground truth given data, namely Deep Loss Convexification (DLC), thanks to the overparametrization in neural networks. To this end, we formulate our learning objective based on adversarial training by manipulating the ground-truth predictions, rather than input data. In particular, we propose using star-convexity, a family of structured nonconvex functions that are unimodal on all lines that pass through a global minimizer, as our geometric constraint for reshaping loss landscapes, leading to (1) extra novel hinge losses appended to the original loss and (2) near-optimal predictions. We demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance using DLC with existing network architectures for the tasks of training recurrent neural networks (RNNs), 3D point cloud registration, and multimodel image alignment.},

However, existing zero-cost proxies either ignore the network structure&#39;s impact on performance or are limited to specific tasks. To address these issues, we propose a novel zero-cost proxy called Skeleton Path Kernel Trace (SPKT) that leverages the whole network architecture&#39;s skeleton path structure information. We then integrate it into an effective Bayesian optimization for NAS framework called PATNAS, and demonstrate its efficacy on different datasets. The results show that our proposed SPKT zero-cost proxy can achieve a high correlation with the final performance of the network across multiple tasks.

While existing surveys on forgetting have primarily focused on continual learning, forgetting is a prevalent phenomenon observed in various other research domains within deep learning. Forgetting manifests in research fields such as generative models due to generator shifts, and federated learning due to heterogeneous data distributions across clients. Addressing forgetting encompasses several challenges, including balancing the retention of old task knowledge with fast learning of new task, managing task interference with conflicting goals, and preventing privacy leakage, etc. Moreover, most existing surveys on continual learning implicitly assume that forgetting is always harmful. In contrast, our survey argues that forgetting is a double-edged sword and can be beneficial and desirable in certain cases, such as privacy-preserving scenarios. By exploring forgetting in a broader context, we present a more nuanced understanding of this phenomenon and highlight its potential advantages. Through this comprehensive survey, we aspire to uncover potential solutions by drawing upon ideas and approaches from various fields that have dealt with forgetting. By examining forgetting beyond its conventional boundaries, we hope to encourage the development of novel strategies for mitigating, harnessing, or even embracing forgetting in real applications.},

Thus, recognizing discriminative details, such as the eyes and beaks of birds, is a key to the task. However, this is particularly challenging when training data is limited. To address this, we propose Task Discrepancy Maximization (TDM), a task-oriented channel attention method tailored for fine-grained few-shot classification with two novel modules Support Attention Module (SAM) and Query Attention Module (QAM). SAM highlights channels encoding class-wise discriminative features, while QAM assigns higher weights to object-relevant channels of the query. Based on these submodules, TDM produces task-adaptive features by focusing on channels encoding class-discriminative details and possessed by the query at the same time, for accurate class-sensitive similarity measure between support and query instances. While TDM influences high-level feature maps by task-adaptive calibration of channel-wise importance, we further introduce Instance Attention Module (IAM) operating in intermediate layers of feature extractors to instance-wisely highlight object-relevant channels, by extending QAM. The merits of TDM and IAM and their complementary benefits are experimentally validated in fine-grained few-shot classification tasks. Moreover, IAM is also effective in coarse-grained and cross-domain few-shot classifications.},

  abstract     = {The Segment Anything Model (SAM), a profound vision foundation model pretrained on a large-scale dataset, breaks the boundaries of general segmentation and sparks various downstream applications. This paper introduces Hi-SAM, a unified model leveraging SAM for hierarchical text segmentation. Hi-SAM excels in segmentation across four hierarchies, including pixel-level text, word, text-line, and paragraph, while realizing layout analysis as well. Specifically, we first turn SAM into a high-quality pixel-level text segmentation (TS) model through a parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach. We use this TS model to iteratively generate the pixel-level text labels in a semi-automatical manner, unifying labels across the four text hierarchies in the HierText dataset. Subsequently, with these complete labels, we launch the end-to-end trainable Hi-SAM based on the TS architecture with a customized hierarchical mask decoder. During inference, Hi-SAM offers both automatic mask generation (AMG) mode and promptable segmentation (PS) mode. In the AMG mode, Hi-SAM segments pixel-level text foreground masks initially, then samples foreground points for hierarchical text mask generation and achieves layout analysis in passing. As for the PS mode, Hi-SAM provides word, text-line, and paragraph masks with a single point click. Experimental results show the state-of-the-art performance of our TS model: 84.86% fgIOU on Total-Text and 88.96% fgIOU on TextSeg for pixel-level text segmentation. Moreover, compared to the previous specialist for joint hierarchical detection and layout analysis on HierText, Hi-SAM achieves significant improvements: 4.73% PQ and 5.39% F1 on the text-line level, 5.49% PQ and 7.39% F1 on the paragraph level layout analysis, requiring $20\times$ fewer training epochs.},

  abstract     = {Deep networks for 3D point clouds have achieved remarkable success in classification task but remain vulnerable to geometric variations resulting from inconsistent data acquisition procedures. This leads to significant performance degradation when models trained on a source domain are tested on out-of-distribution target domains, highlighting the challenges of 3D domain generalization and adaptation. In this paper, we introduce a novel Multi-Scale Part-based feature Representation, dubbed MSPR, as a generalizable representation for point cloud domain generalization and adaptation. Rather than relying on global shape feature, we align the part-level features of shapes at different scales to a set of learnable part-template features that encode local geometric structures shared between the source and the target domains. Specifically, shapes from different domains are organized into part-level features at various scales and then aligned to the part-template features. To balance the generalization and discrimination abilities of parts at different scales, we further design a cross-scale feature fusion module to exchange information between aligned part-based features at different scales. The fused part-based representations are finally aggregated by a part-based feature aggregation module. To improve the robustness of the aligned part-based representations and global shape representation to geometry variations, we further propose a Contrastive Learning framework on Shape Representation (CLSR). Experiments are conducted on 3D domain generalization and adaptation benchmarks for point cloud classification. Extensive experiments on 3D domain generalization and adaptation benchmarks demonstrate that proposed approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both tasks. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the components in our model.},

  abstract     = {Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel compositions of seen primitives. Prior studies have attempted to either learn primitives individually (non-connected) or establish dependencies among them in the composition (fully-connected). In contrast, human comprehension of composition diverges from the aforementioned methods as humans possess the ability to make composition-aware adaptation for these primitives, instead of inferring them rigidly through the aforementioned methods. However, developing a comprehension of compositions akin to human cognition proves challenging within the confines of real space. This arises from the limitation of real-space-based methods, which often categorize attributes, objects, and compositions using three independent measures, without establishing a direct dynamic connection. To tackle this challenge, we expand the CZSL distance metric scheme to encompass complex spaces to unify the independent measures, and we establish an imaginary-connected embedding in complex space to model human understanding of attributes. To achieve this representation, we introduce an innovative visual bias-based attribute extraction module that selectively extracts attributes based on object prototypes. As a result, we are able to incorporate phase information in training and inference, serving as a metric for attribute-object dependencies while preserving the independent acquisition of primitives. We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach on three benchmark datasets, illustrating its superiority compared to baseline methods.},

Besides, we give the theoretical analysis based on probability distributions in both temporal and spatial domains to improve interpretability. In temporal domain, we use timestamp deviations between processing events and central event to judge the temporal correlation and filter out temporal-irrelevant events. In spatial domain, we choose maximum a posteriori (MAP) to discriminate real-world event and noise and use the learned convolutional sparse coding to optimize the objective function. Based on the theoretical analysis, we build Temporal Window (TW) module and Soft Spatial Feature Embedding (SSFE) module to process temporal and spatial information separately, and construct a novel multi-scale window-based event denoising network, named WedNet. The high denoising accuracy and fast running speed of our WedNet enables us to achieve real-time denoising in complex scenes.

To overcome significant variations between images across camera views, mountains of variants of ReID models were developed for solving a number of challenges, such as resolution change, clothing change, occlusion, modality change, and so on. Despite the impressive performance of many ReID variants, these variants typically function distinctly and cannot be applied to other challenges. To our best knowledge, there is no versatile ReID model that can handle various ReID challenges at the same time. This work contributes to the first attempt at learning a versatile ReID model to solve such a problem. Our main idea is to form a two-stage prompt-based twin modeling framework called VersReID. Our VersReID firstly leverages the scene label to train a ReID Bank that contains abundant knowledge for handling various scenes, where several groups of scene-specific prompts are used to encode different scene-specific knowledge. In the second stage, we distill a V-Branch model with versatile prompts from the ReID Bank for adaptively solving the ReID of different scenes, eliminating the demand for scene labels during the inference stage. To facilitate training VersReID, we further introduce the multi-scene properties into self-supervised learning of ReID via a multi-scene prioris data augmentation (MPDA) strategy. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the success of learning an effective and versatile ReID model for handling ReID tasks under multi-scene conditions without manual assignment of scene labels in the inference stage, including general, low-resolution, clothing change, occlusion, and cross-modality scenes.},

Particularly, we propose a novel self-supervised learning approach for real-world RefSR from observations at dual and multiple camera zooms. Firstly, considering the popularity of multiple cameras in modern smartphones, the more zoomed (telephoto) image can be naturally leveraged as the reference to guide the super-resolution (SR) of the lesser zoomed (ultra-wide) image, which gives us a chance to learn a deep network that performs SR from the dual zoomed observations (DZSR). Secondly, for self-supervised learning of DZSR, we take the telephoto image instead of an additional high-resolution image as the supervision information, and select a center patch from it as the reference to super-resolve the corresponding ultra-wide image patch. To mitigate the effect of the misalignment between ultra-wide low-resolution (LR) patch and telephoto ground-truth (GT) image during training, we propose a two-stage alignment method, including patch-based optical flow alignment and auxiliary-LR guiding alignment. To generate visually pleasing results, we present local overlapped sliced Wasserstein loss. Furthermore, we take multiple zoomed observations to explore self-supervised RefSR, and present a progressive fusion scheme for the effective utilization of reference images.

However, the good performance of RSVM heavily depends on the proper values of regularization parameter and ramp parameter. Traditional model selection technique with gird search has extremely high computational cost especially for fine-grained search. To address this challenging problem, in this paper, we first propose solution paths of RSVM (SPRSVM) based on the concave-convex procedure (CCCP) which can track the solutions of the non-convex RSVM with respect to regularization parameter and ramp parameter respectively. Specifically, we use incremental and decremental learning algorithms to deal with the Karush-Khun-Tucker violating samples in the process of tracking the solutions. Based on the solution paths of RSVM and the piecewise linearity of model function, we can compute the error paths of RSVM and find the values of regularization parameter and ramp parameter, respectively, which corresponds to the minimum cross validation error. We prove the finite convergence of SPRSVM and analyze the computational complexity of SPRSVM. Experimental results on a variety of benchmark datasets not only verify that our SPRSVM can globally search the regularization and ramp parameters respectively, but also show a huge reduction of computational time compared with the grid search approach.},

  abstract     = {Service composition dynamically integrates various services from multiple providers to meet complex user requirements. However, most existing methods assume centralized control over all services, which is often unrealistic because providers typically prefer to independently manage their own services, posing challenges to the application of traditional methods. Collaborative service composition offers a solution by enabling providers to work together to complete service composition. However, this approach also faces its own challenges. Driven by self-interest, providers may be reluctant to offer services needed by others, and due to business competition, they may wish to share as few services as possible (where sharing services means disclosing service information to other providers). To address these challenges, we propose a novel collaborative service composition approach that comprehensively considers each provider’s self-interest and achieves service composition with minimal service sharing. First, we introduce a “self-interest degree” model to capture providers’ self-interest. This behavior may lead to service refusal, so we design a service availability prediction method based on a reputation model to minimize rejections. Then, we propose a decentralized service composition method. It utilizes historical composition records to mine empirical rules between requirements and services, constructing a correlations matrix, and collaboratively trains a multi-label classification model with other providers under a distributed federated learning framework. Combining the matrix and model outputs, we design a service composition method and a node coordination protocol that completes service composition with minimal service sharing. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in capturing providers’ self-interest and showcase its superior performance compared to existing methods.},

  abstract     = {In the Industrial Internet of Things, it is necessary to reserve enough bandwidth resources according to the maximum traffic peak. However, bandwidth reservation based on the maximum traffic peak leads to low resource utilization. In this paper, we propose a data transfer optimization solution, based on the cooperation of different entities in the local area, which strives to deliver data acquired by sensors to the cloud in a reliable manner and improve bandwidth utilization to save limited network resources. In our solution, the data transfers from the sensors in a local network are controlled by a local controller and some edge gateways with acceptable cost such that no congestion occurs in the path to the cloud and the bandwidth requirement of each flow can be met. To obtain a tradeoff between resource utilization and transfer delay, we study the problem of minimizing the maximum rate peak of periodic real-time traffic from distributed sensors and propose an algorithm to solve this problem with a desirable lower boundary of the performance. In addition, we design an application-level forwarding method that significantly improves resource utilization and a method of implementing reliable sampling instant adjustment. The experimental results show that our solution significantly improves resource utilization without producing network congestion.},

FedHome leverages federated learning (FL) and generative convolutional autoencoders (GCAE) to train models on decentralized edge devices while prioritizing data privacy. A notable challenge in this domain is the class imbalance in health data, where critical events such as falls are underrepresented, adversely affecting model performance. To address this, the research evaluates six oversampling techniques using Stratified K-fold cross-validation: SMOTE, Borderline-SMOTE, Random OverSampler, SMOTE-Tomek, SVM-SMOTE, and SMOTE-ENN. These methods are tested on FedHome&#39;s public implementation over 200 training rounds with and without stratified K-fold cross-validation. The findings indicate that SMOTE-ENN achieves the most consistent test accuracy, with a standard deviation range of 0.0167–0.0176, demonstrating stable performance compared to other samplers. In contrast, SMOTE and SVM-SMOTE exhibit higher variability in performance, as reflected by their wider standard deviation ranges of 0.0157–0.0180 and 0.0155–0.0180, respectively. Similarly, the Random OverSampler method shows a significant deviation range of 0.0155–0.0176. SMOTE-Tomek, with a deviation range of 0.0160–0.0175, also shows greater stability but not as much as SMOTE-ENN. This finding highlights the potential of SMOTE-ENN to enhance the reliability and accuracy of personalized health monitoring systems within the FedHome framework.},

Traditionally, GANs are trained in centralized data centers, raising data privacy concerns due to the need for clients to upload their data. To address this, Federated Learning (FL) integrates with GANs, allowing collaborative training without sharing local data. However, this integration is complex because GANs involve two interdependent models—the generator and the discriminator—while FL typically handles a single model over distributed datasets. In this article, we propose a novel asynchronous FL framework for GANs, called AsyncFedGAN, designed to efficiently and distributively train both models tailored for molecule generation. AsyncFedGAN addresses the challenges of training interactive models, resolves the straggler issue in synchronous FL, reduces model staleness in asynchronous FL, and lowers client energy consumption. Our extensive simulations for molecular discovery show that AsyncFedGAN achieves convergence with proper settings, outperforms baseline methods, and balances model performance with client energy usage.},

  abstract     = {Attribute-based encryption (ABE) has emerged as a new paradigm for access control in cloud computing. However, despite the many promising features of ABE, its deployment in real-world systems is still limited, partially due to the expensive cost of its underlying mathematical operations, which often grow linearly with the size and complexity of the system&#39;s security policies. This becomes particularly challenging in data-intensive applications, where multiple users may simultaneously access and manipulate large volumes of data, resulting in high levels of concurrency and demand for computing resources, which are too heavy even for high-end servers. Further exacerbating the issues are the functionality and security requirements of a cloud, as they introduce additional computations to both the client and the server. Therefore, in this work, we introduce $ \mathsf{GPABE} $, the first GPU-based parallelization framework for ABE to facilitate its batch processing in cloud computing. By analyzing ABE&#39;s major computational workload, we identify multiple arithmetic modules that are common in the design of pairing-based ABEs. Based on the analysis, we further propose to decompose the ABE algorithm into computation graph, which can be efficiently implemented on the GPU platform. Our graph representation bridges the gap between ABE&#39;s high-level design and their low-level implementation on GPUs, and is applicable to a variety of popular schemes in the realm of ABE. We then implement $ \mathsf{GPABE} $ as a heterogeneous computing server, with several optimization techniques to improve its throughput. Finally, we evaluate the GPU implementation of several ABE schemes using $ \mathsf{GPABE} $. The results show a speedup of least 51.0× and at most 253.6× for the throughput of ABE algorithms, compared to their state-of-the-art CPU implementations, which preliminarily demonstrated the effectiveness of $ \mathsf{GPABE} $.},

  abstract     = {Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) are powerful models to capture temporal, structural, and contextual information on temporal graphs, outperforming other methods in many high-impact downstream tasks. However, achieving high-performance TGNN inference in production environments is challenging because TGNN models suffer from high computation complexity and intrinsic temporal data dependency that hinders data parallelism. In addition, real-world TGNN applications have different latency and throughput requirements. This work presents ViTeGNN, a versatile TGNN inference solution for memory-based TGNNs on FPGAs. ViTeGNN performs algorithm-model-architecture co-design to meet the latency and throughput requirements of real-world TGNN applications. Besides the vanilla inference mode ViTeGNN-bal that updates embeddings for nodes interacting with others, we propose ViTeGNN-lat and ViTeGNN-thpt, optimized for latency and throughput. Our model optimizations include a lightweight method to compute attention scores and a related temporal neighbor pruning strategy to reduce computation and memory accesses. These are holistically coupled with key hardware optimizations that leverage the FPGA hardware. We propose a novel hardware module to execute the complex neighbor update process efficiently. To ensure similar accuracy vis-á-vis the original model, the simplified models are trained using the knowledge distillation technique. We propose a unified hardware design that supports all of these three inference modes without FPGA reconfiguration. Enabled by our flexible hardware architecture, we further propose ViTeGNN-auto, which automatically selects the best inference mode at runtime based on latency and throughput requirements, guided by our accurate performance model. We evaluate the performance of the proposed hardware accelerator on five real-world datasets. ViTeGNN-bal reduces the computation complexity by an average of 62% and memory accesses by an average of 36% with only 0.0042 accuracy loss. Compared with state-of-the-art implementations on CPU and GPU, our FPGA implementation achieves $53.9/26.0/16.1\times$ speedup and $8.2/4.0/2.5\times$ speedup for ViTeGNN-lat/-bal/-thpt, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Data streaming is an ordered sequence of data continuously generated over time, whose dynamic scale is hard to be predicated in advance. Since the traditional integrity verification primitives are not qualified to check the integrity of the retrieved data and the outsourced database in streaming setting, some specific schemes were proposed by adopting the tree-like authentication structure or the combination of signature and accumulator. However, these schemes are not optimal for the owner. The main concerns can be generalized as how to reduce the size of the authentication information to be less than the scale of the data streaming, and enable the resource-constrained owner to check the data integrity without using challenge. To address the problems, we intend to find a new approach to design the scheme by exploiting the novel technique called decentralized vector commitment (DVC). Towards this goal, we first propose a key exposure-freeness chameleon vector commitment scheme, and then present the efficient DVC technique based on our key exposure-freeness chameleon vector commitment scheme. The scheme is finally constructed by leveraging the efficient DVC technique. Besides the integrity verification, our scheme is also sufficient to efficiently distribute the data to a user who is protected from receiving the stale data. To optimize the performance in concurrently retrieving multiple data, we introduce the batch query that reduces large amounts of communication and computation overheads.

  abstract     = {This article finds that existing mutex locks suffer from throughput collapses or latency collapses, or both, in the oversubscribed scenarios where applications create more threads than the CPU core number, e.g., database applications like mysql use per thread per connection. We make an in-depth performance analysis on existing locks and then identify three design rules for the lock primitive to achieve scalable performance in oversubscribed scenarios. First, to achieve ideal throughput, the lock design should keep adequate number of active competitors. Second, the active competitors should be arranged carefully to avoid the lock-holder preemption problem. Third, to meet latency requirements, the lock design should track the latency of each competitor and reorder the competitors according to the latency requirement. We propose a new lock library called HTLL that satisfies these rules and achieves both high throughput and low latency even when the cores are oversubscribed. HTLL only requires minimal human effort (e.g., add several lines of code) to annotate the latency requirement. Evaluation results show that HTLL achieves scalable performance in the oversubscribed scenarios. Specifically, for the real-world database, LMDB, HTLL can reduce the tail latency by up to 97% with only an average 5% degradation in throughput, compared with state-of-the-art alternatives such as Malthusian, CST, and Mutexee locks; In comparison to the widely used pthread_mutex_lock, it can increase the throughput by up to 22% and decrease the latency by up to 80%. Meanwhile, for the under-subscribed scenarios, it also shows comparable performance than state-of-the-art blocking locks.},

This approach is particularly advantageous for parallel hardware accelerators, such as Google&#39;s Edge Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), which is widely used for deep neural network (DNN) inference on embedded systems. This paper studies sporadic global non-preemptive fixed-priority (NP-FP) rigid gang scheduling, which is well-suited for DNN applications in Edge TPU pipelines. Each gang task spawns a fixed number of threads that must execute concurrently across distinct processing units. We introduce the first carry-in limitation technique specifically designed for gang task response time analysis, addressing the unique challenges posed by intra-task parallelism. This technique is formulated as a generalized knapsack problem, and we develop both a linear programming relaxation and a dynamic programming approach to solve it under different time complexities. Additionally, we propose the first optimal priority assignment policy for NP-FP gang schedulability tests. Our proposed schedulability analysis and optimal priority assignment policy are evaluated through extensive experiments, including both synthetic task sets and a case study using DNN benchmarks on commercial off-the-shelf Edge TPU accelerators. The results demonstrate that the proposed approaches effectively enhance the state-of-the-art global NP-FP gang schedulability tests, achieving improvements of up to 57.9% for synthetic task sets and 76.7% for Edge TPU benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct an ablations study to examine the impact of different algorithmic components in the proposed technique, providing valuable insights for future research.},

  abstract     = {Pretrained Foundation Models (PFMs) are regarded as a promising accelerator for the development of various Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, and have recently been widely fine-tuned to satisfy users’ personalized inference demands. As many users are attracted to PFM-based AI applications, remote data centers are increasingly unable to solely bear the enormous computational demands and meet the delay requirements of inference requests. Mobile edge computing (MEC) offers a viable solution for delivering low-latency inference services by pulling fine-tuned PFMs from the remote data center to cloudlets in the proximity of users. However, a fine-tuned PFM typically comprises billions of model parameters, which are highly resource-intensive, time-consuming, and cost-prohibitive to execute at the edge. To address this, we investigate a novel joint large model selection and pulling problem in MEC networks. The novelty of our study lies in exploring parameter sharing among fine-tuned PFMs based on their common knowledge. Specifically, we first formulate a Non-Linear Integer Programming (NLIP) for the problem to minimize the total delay of implementing all inference requests. We then transform the NLIP into an equivalent Integer Linear Program (ILP) that is much simpler to solve. We further propose a randomized algorithm with a provable approximation ratio for the problem. We also consider the online version of the problem with uncertain request demand, and develop an online learning algorithm with a bounded regret. The crux of the online algorithm is the adoption of the multi-armed bandit technique with restricted context for dynamic admissions of inference requests. We finally conduct extensive experiments based on real datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithms reduce at least 38% in total delays and average costs, while achieving a 5% improvement in average accuracies.},

  abstract     = {Since 2017, NVIDIA GPUs have been equipped with specialized units known as Tensor Cores, which demonstrate remarkable efficiency in processing matrix multiplications (GEMMs). Beyond GEMMs, researchers have explored the potential applications of Tensor Cores in matrix factorization, such as QR factorization. However, the inside GEMMs in QR factorization are typically tall and skinny. Compared to compute-bound square GEMMs, these tall and skinny GEMMs are memory bound, leading to suboptimal performance on Tensor Cores. To solve this problem, we indicate the recursive QR factorization can convert the tall and skinny GEMMs to relatively square and large GEMMs, resulting in better performance on Tensor Cores. Besides, we extend the FP16 Tensor-Cores-based QR factorization to accommodate FP32 and FP64 on FP16 and INT8 Tensor Cores, respectively. Additionally, to address the issue of orthogonality loss in the preceding Tensor Cores-based QR factorization, we transition from the Gram-Schmidt to the Householder algorithm while preserving high performance. According to our experimental evaluation conducted on NVIDIA&#39;s A100 and GeForce RTX 3090 GPU, the precision levels of FP64, FP32, and FP16 are up to 6.22x, 8.67x, and 4.03x faster, respectively, than the current state-of-the-art implementations.},

  abstract     = {Transformer models have become widely popular in numerous applications, and especially for building foundation large language models (LLMs). Recently, there has been a surge in the exploration of transformer-based architectures in non-LLM applications. In particular, the self-attention mechanism within the transformer architecture offers a way to exploit any hidden relations within data, making it widely applicable for a variety of spatio-temporal tasks in scientific computing domains (e.g., weather, traffic, agriculture). Most of these efforts have primarily focused on accelerating the inference phase. However, the computational resources required to train these attention-based models for scientific applications remain a significant challenge to address. Emerging non-volatile memory (NVM)-based processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures can achieve higher performance and better energy efficiency than their GPU-based counterparts. However, the frequent weight updates during training would necessitate write operations to NVM cells, posing a significant barrier for considering stand-alone NVM-based PIM architectures. In this paper, we present HpT, a new hybrid approach to accelerate the training of attention-based models for scientific applications. Our approach is hybrid at two different layers: at the software layer, our approach dynamically switches from a full-parameter training mode to a lower-parameter training mode by incorporating intrinsic dimensionality; and at the hardware layer, our approach harnesses the combined power of GPUs, resistive random-access memory (ReRAM)-based PIM devices, and systolic arrays. This software-hardware co-design approach is aimed at adaptively reducing both runtime and energy costs during the training phase, without compromising on quality. Experiments on four concrete real-world scientific applications demonstrate that our hybrid approach is able to significantly reduce training time (up to $11.9\times$) and energy consumption (up to $12.05\times$), compared to the corresponding full-parameter training executing on only GPUs. Our approach serves as an example for accelerating the training of attention-based models on heterogeneous platforms including ReRAMs.},

  abstract     = {GPU clusters have been widely used to co-locate various deep learning (DL) workloads in a multi-tenant way. Although such resource sharing can significantly reduce training cost, resource contention and interference among co-located workloads make task scheduling very complex and challenging. To simplify the scheduling problem, existing algorithms usually divide the procedure of scheduling into two sub-tasks, i.e., task placement and resource allocation, and allocate resources according to pre-defined and fixed resource demands. However, such a paradigm significantly constrains the selection of potential scheduling solutions. In this article, we present MAIFS, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning based scheduling algorithm that handles task placement and resource allocation integratedly, and allows fungible resource allocation based on resource sensitivity of DL workloads. The core of MAIFS lies in two mechanisms. The multi-agent attention mechanism is designed to learn and share inter-related resource state features observed from different agents, which enables agents to explore fungible resource allocation solutions. The dynamic coordination graph mechanism is designed for coordinating interactive task placement decisions of agents during integrated scheduling, so as to mitigate potential task conflicts. Simulated experiments using two large scale production DL workload traces and physical deployment experiments based on a Kubernetes based GPU cluster show that MAIFS can outperform state-of-the-art scheduling algorithms by up to 44% in terms of makespan and 46% in terms of job completion time (JCT).},

  abstract     = {Sharding is a promising solution to scale blockchain by separating the system into multiple shards to process transactions in parallel. However, due to state separation and shard isolation, it is still challenging to efficiently support smart contracts on a blockchain sharding system where smart contracts can interact with each other, involving states maintained by multiple shards. Specifically, existing sharding systems adopt a costly multi-step collaboration mechanism to execute smart contracts, resulting in long latency and low throughput. This article proposes Sparrow, a blockchain sharding protocol achieving one-step execution for smart contracts. To break shard isolation, inspired by non-local hotspot data caching in traditional databases, we propose a new idea of inter-shard caching, allowing a shard to prefetch and cache frequently accessed contract states of other shards. The miner can thus use the inter-shard cache to pre-execute a pending transaction, retrieve all its contract invocations, and commit it to multiple shards in one step. Particularly, we first propose a speculative dispersal cache synchronisation mechanism for efficient and secure cache synchronization across shards in Byzantine environments. Then, we propose a multi-branch exploration mechanism to solve the rollback problem during the optimistic one-step execution of contract invocations with dependencies. We also present a series of conflict resolution mechanisms to decrease the rollback caused by inherent transaction conflicts. We implement prototypes for Sparrow and existing sharding systems, and the evaluation shows that Sparrow improves the throughput by $2.44\times$ and reduces the transaction latency by 30% compared with the existing sharding systems.},

  abstract     = {In cloud data centers, the exponential growth of data places increasing demands on computing, storage, and network resources, especially in multi-tenant environments. While this growth is crucial for ensuring Quality of Service (QoS), it also introduces challenges such as fluctuating resource requirements and static container configurations, which can lead to resource underutilization and high energy consumption. This article addresses online resource provisioning and efficient scheduling for multi-tenant environments, aiming to minimize energy consumption while balancing elasticity and QoS requirements. To address this, we propose a novel optimization framework that reformulates the resource provisioning problem into a more manageable form. By reducing the original multi-constraint optimization to a container placement problem, we apply the interior-point barrier method to simplify the optimization, integrating constraints directly into the objective function for efficient computation. We also introduce elasticity as a key parameter to balance energy consumption with autonomous resource scaling, ensuring that resource consolidation does not compromise system flexibility. The proposed Energy-Efficient and Elastic Resource Provisioning (EEP) framework comprises three main modules: a distributed resource management module that employs vertical partitioning and dynamic leader election for adaptive resource allocation; a prediction module using $\omega$-step prediction for accurate resource demand forecasting; and an elastic scheduling module that dynamically adjusts to tenant scaling needs, optimizing resource allocation and minimizing energy consumption. Extensive experiments across diverse cloud scenarios demonstrate that the EEP framework significantly improves energy efficiency and resource utilization compared to established baselines, supporting sustainable cloud management practices.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we introduce a novel Fast Autonomous expLoration framework using COverage path guidaNce (FALCON), which aims at setting a new performance benchmark in the field of autonomous aerial exploration. Despite recent advancements in the domain, existing exploration planners often suffer from inefficiencies, such as frequent revisitations of previously explored regions. FALCON effectively harnesses the full potential of online generated coverage paths in enhancing exploration efficiency. The framework begins with an incremental connectivity-aware space decomposition and connectivity graph construction, which facilitate efficient coverage path planning. Subsequently, a hierarchical planner generates a coverage path spanning the entire unexplored space, serving as a global guidance. Then, a local planner optimizes the frontier visitation order, minimizing traversal time while consciously incorporating the intention of the global guidance. Finally, minimum-time smooth and safe trajectories are produced to visit the frontier viewpoints. For fair and comprehensive benchmark experiments, we introduce a lightweight exploration planner evaluation environment that allows for comparing exploration planners across a variety of testing scenarios using an identical quadrotor simulator. In addition, an in-depth analysis and evaluation is conducted to highlight the significant performance advantages of FALCON in comparison with the state-of-the-art exploration planners based on objective criteria. Extensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each component in the proposed framework. Real-world experiments conducted fully onboard further validate FALCON’s practical capability in complex and challenging environments. The source code of both the exploration planner FALCON and the exploration planner evaluation environment has been released to benefit the community.},

  abstract     = {Robot localization is a fundamental task in achieving true autonomy. Recently, many graph-based navigators have been proposed that combine an inertial measurement unit (IMU) with an exteroceptive sensor applying IMU preintegration to synchronize both sensors. IMUs are affected by biases that also have to be estimated. To increase the navigator robustness when faults appear on the perception system, IMU preintegration can be complemented with linear velocity measurements obtained from visual odometry, leg odometry, or a Doppler Velocity Log (DVL), depending on the robotic application. Moreover, higher grade IMUs are sensitive to the Earth rotation rate, which must be compensated in the preintegrated measurements. In this article, we propose a general purpose preintegration methodology formulated on a compact Lie group to set motion constraints on graph simultaneous localization and mapping problems considering the Earth rotation effect. We introduce the SE$_{N}(3)$ group to jointly preintegrate IMU data and linear velocity measurements to preserve all the existing correlation within the preintegrated quantity. Field experiments using an autonomous underwater vehicle equipped with a DVL and a navigational grade IMU are provided and results are benchmarked against a commercial filter-based inertial navigation system to prove the effectiveness of our methodology.},

However, in tactile perception, the relatively high cost of data collection still largely impedes the adoption of such data-driven learning solutions. In this article, we introduce TactGen, a novel, cross-modal framework to tackle this challenge. In particular, using a two-step data generation pipeline, we leverage easily accessible vision data to synthesise artificial tactile data for downstream classifier training. Specifically, we use readily collected video data of objects of interest to efficiently learn neural radiance field (NeRF) representations. The NeRF models are then used to render red–green–blue-depth (RGBD) images from any desired vantage points. In the second stage, the RGBD images are translated into corresponding tactile images typically generated by camera-based tactile sensors using a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN). The cGAN model is itself trained with a large set of visuo-tactile images collected in simulation, and can be transferred into the real world without fine-tuning or additional data collection. We extensively validate this approach in the context of tactile object classification, showing that it effectively reduces data collection time by a factor of 20 while achieving similar performance to training a classifier on manually collected real data.},

Strain-based models have recently emerged as a promising candidate to describe such systems, however, they tend to be high-dimensional and time-consuming. This article presents a novel model order reduction approach for soft and hybrid robots by combining strain-based modeling with proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). The method identifies optimal coupled strain basis functions—or mechanical synergies—from simulation data, enabling the description of soft robot configurations with a minimal number of generalized coordinates. The reduced order model (ROM) achieves substantial dimensionality reduction in the configuration space while preserving accuracy. Rigorous testing demonstrates the interpolation and extrapolation capabilities of the ROM for soft manipulators under static and dynamic conditions. The approach is further validated on a snake-like hyper-redundant rigid manipulator and a closed-chain system with soft and rigid components, illustrating its broad applicability. Moreover, the approach is leveraged for shape estimation of a real six-actuator soft manipulator using only two position markers, showcasing its practical utility. Finally, the ROM&#39;s dynamic and static behavior is validated experimentally against a parallel hybrid soft-rigid system, highlighting its effectiveness in representing the high-order model and the real system. This POD-based ROM offers significant computational speed-ups, paving the way for real-time simulation and control of complex soft and hybrid robots.},

  abstract     = {Quickly and reliably finding accurate inverse kinematics (IK) solutions remains a challenging problem for many robot manipulators. Existing numerical solvers are broadly applicable but typically only produce a single solution and rely on local search techniques to minimize nonconvex objective functions. Recent learning-based approaches that approximate the entire feasible set of solutions have shown promise in generating multiple fast and accurate IK results in parallel. However, existing learning-based techniques have a significant drawback: each robot of interest requires a specialized model that must be trained from scratch. To address this key shortcoming, we propose a novel distance-geometric robot representation coupled with a graph structure that allows us to leverage the generalizability of graph neural networks (GNNs). Our approach, which we call generative graphical IK (GGIK), is the first learned IK solver that is able to efficiently yield a large number of diverse solutions in parallel while also displaying the ability to generalize—a single learned model can be used to produce IK solutions for a variety of different robots. When compared to several other learned IK methods, GGIK provides more accurate solutions with the same amount of training data. GGIK can also generalize reasonably well to robot manipulators unseen during training. In addition, GGIK is able to learn a constrained distribution that encodes joint limits and scales well with the number of robot joints and sampled solutions. Finally, GGIK can be used to complement local IK solvers by providing a reliable initialization for the local optimization process.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in control and planning allow for seamless physical human–robot interaction (pHRI). At the same time, novel challenges appear in orchestrating intelligent decision-making and ensuring safe control of robots. Particularly in scenarios involving unforeseen or unintended collisions, robots face the imperative of reacting judiciously to avert potential risks to humans, other robots, obstacles, or themselves. At the same time, they need to maintain focus on their primary task or be able to safely resume it. Collision detection and identification algorithms are now well established in industry, yet complex collision reflexes have not transitioned into industrial applications beyond basic stopping reactions. Despite the introduction of numerous advanced high-performance reflex controllers over the past decades, their real-world adoption has remained a challenge. This work establishes a systematic framework to address that gap. For this, the reflex control problem is defined, reflex behaviors are systematically classified and categorized, and relevant safety data is acquired following existing international standards. We argue that this foundational step is crucial for improving the safety and capabilities of robots in both complex industrial and domestic environments. We validate our approach within the system class of articulated manipulators through a state-of-the-art cooperative pick-and-place task, providing a blueprint for future implementations for other robot classes.},

  abstract     = {Aerial swarm systems possess immense potential in various aspects, such as cooperative exploration, target tracking, and search and rescue. Efficient accurate self- and mutual state estimation are the critical preconditions for completing these swarm tasks, which remain challenging research topics. This article proposes Swarm-LIO2, a fully decentralized, plug-and-play, computationally efficient, and bandwidth-efficient light detection and ranging (LiDAR)-inertial odometry for aerial swarm systems. Swarm-LIO2 uses a decentralized plug-and-play network as the communication infrastructure. Only bandwidth-efficient and low-dimensional information is exchanged, including identity, ego state, mutual observation measurements, and global extrinsic transformations. To support the plug and play of new teammate participants, Swarm-LIO2 detects potential teammate autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs) and initializes the temporal offset and global extrinsic transformation all automatically. To enhance the initialization efficiency, novel reflectivity-based AAV detection, trajectory matching, and factor graph optimization methods are proposed. For state estimation, Swarm-LIO2 fuses LiDAR, inertial measurement units, and mutual observation measurements within an efficient error state iterated Kalman filter (ESIKF) framework, with careful compensation of temporal delay and modeling of measurements to enhance the accuracy and consistency. Moreover, the proposed ESIKF framework leverages the global extrinsic for ego state estimation in the case of LiDAR degeneration or refines the global extrinsic along with the ego state estimation otherwise. To enhance the scalability, Swarm-LIO2 introduces a novel marginalization method in the ESIKF, which prevents the growth of computational time with swarm size. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the broad adaptability to large-scale aerial swarm systems and complicated scenarios, including GPS-denied scenes and degenerated scenes for cameras or LiDARs. The experimental results showcase the centimeter-level localization accuracy, which outperforms other state-of-the-art LiDAR-inertial odometry for a single-AAV system. Furthermore, diverse applications demonstrate the potential of Swarm-LIO2 to serve as a reliable infrastructure for various aerial swarm missions.},

In this work, we leverage a multimodal visuotactile sensor within the framework of imitation learning (IL) to perform contact-rich tasks that involve relative motion (e.g., slipping and sliding) between the end-effector and the manipulated object. We introduce two algorithmic contributions, tactile force matching and learned mode switching, as complimentary methods for improving IL. Tactile force matching enhances kinesthetic teaching by reading approximate forces during the demonstration and generating an adapted robot trajectory that recreates the recorded forces. Learned mode switching uses IL to couple visual and tactile sensor modes with the learned motion policy, simplifying the transition from reaching to contacting. We perform robotic manipulation experiments on four door-opening tasks with a variety of observation and algorithm configurations to study the utility of multimodal visuotactile sensing and our proposed improvements. Our results show that the inclusion of force matching raises average policy success rates by 62.5%, visuotactile mode switching by 30.3%, and visuotactile data as a policy input by 42.5%, emphasizing the value of see-through tactile sensing for IL, both for data collection to allow force matching, and for policy execution to enable accurate task feedback.},

We leverage probably approximately correct-Bayes theory to train a policy with a guaranteed bound on performance on the training distribution. Our idea for OOD detection relies on the following intuition: violation of the performance bound on test environments provides evidence that the robot is operating OOD. We formalize this via statistical techniques based on $p$-values and concentration inequalities. The approach provides guaranteed confidence bounds on OOD detection including bounds on both the false-positive and false-negative rates of the detector and is task-driven and only sensitive to changes that impact the robot&#39;s performance. We demonstrate our approach in simulation and hardware for a grasping task using objects with unfamiliar shapes or poses and a drone performing vision-based obstacle avoidance in environments with wind disturbances and varied obstacle densities.

This article presents a novel approach to state estimation for systems with multiple coupled continuum robots, which allows estimating the shape and strain variables of multiple continuum robots in an arbitrary coupled topology. Simulations and experiments demonstrate the capabilities and versatility of the proposed method, while achieving accurate and continuous estimates for the state of such systems, resulting in average end-effector errors of 3.3 mm and 5.02$^\circ$ depending on the sensor setup. It is further shown, that the approach offers fast computation times of below 10 ms, enabling its utilization in quasi-static real-time scenarios with average update rates of 100–200 Hz. An open-source C++ implementation of the proposed state estimation method is made publicly available to the community.},

  abstract     = {The noncontact acoustic manipulation of particles, biosamples, droplets, and air bubbles has emerged as a promising technology in the fields of biology, chemistry, medicine, etc. The noncontact nature offers significant advantages in terms of biocompatibility, contamination free, and material versatility. However, current noncontact acoustic manipulation techniques still lack adequate selectivity, robustness, and precision controllability in complex environments. To this end, in this article, we propose an automated noncontact manipulation system that leverages a high-density ultrasonic phased transducer array in combination with a microscope to further optimize and enhance the controllability and flexibility of noncontact particle manipulation. This work presents several notable contributions. First, we successfully realized selective particle manipulation, allowing instantaneous interaction with users to perform user-designated and objective-oriented manipulation tasks. Second, we integrated a closed-loop control strategy into the system that effectively mitigates misalignment errors induced by the trapping stiffness heterogeneity of acoustic trap and enables automated precision position control of particles in complex environments (in 30-mm-wide workspace, positioning precision is 1/40 of the wavelength). Third, we proposed a reconfigurable acoustic trap design method, named pseudovortex trap, featuring real-time computing and trapping particles larger than the wavelength. The system setup, the calibration specifics, the acoustic trap design methodology, and the corresponding visual servo control scheme (in terms of selective trapping, precision positioning, and dynamic trajectory planning) are given in detail in the article. Meanwhile, the trapping stiffness and the manipulation stability are also analyzed in this work. Experimental results well demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed system.},

  abstract     = {Obstacle avoidance for uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) in cluttered environments is significantly challenging. Existing obstacle avoidance for UAVs either focuses on fully static environments or static environments with only a few dynamic objects. In this article, we take the initiative to consider the obstacle avoidance of UAVs in dynamic cluttered environments in which dynamic objects are the dominant objects. This type of environment poses significant challenges to both perception and planning. Multiple dynamic objects possess various motions, making it extremely difficult to estimate and predict their motions using one motion model. The planning must be highly efficient to avoid cluttered dynamic objects. This article proposes fast and adaptive perception and planning for UAVs flying in complex dynamic cluttered environments. A novel and efficient point cloud segmentation strategy is proposed to distinguish static and dynamic objects. To address multiple dynamic objects with different motions, an adaptive estimation method with covariance adaptation is proposed to quickly and accurately predict their motions. Our proposed trajectory optimization algorithm is highly efficient, enabling it to avoid fast objects. Furthermore, an adaptive replanning method is proposed to address the case when the trajectory optimization cannot find a feasible solution, which is common for dynamic cluttered environments. Extensive validations in both simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed system for highly dynamic and cluttered environments.},

Here, we consider compliance discrimination with a soft biomimetic tactile optical sensor (TacTip). In previous work, we proposed a vision-based approach derived from a computational model of human tactile perception to discriminate object compliance with the TacTip, based on contact area spread computation over the indenting force. In this work, we first increased the robustness of our vision-based method with a more precise estimation of the initial contact area condition, which enables correct compliance estimation also when the probing direction is other than normal to the specimen surface. Then, we integrated within our validated framework the mechanisms of internal muscular regulation (co-contraction) that humans adopt during object compliance probing, to maximize the information uptake. To this aim, we used human co-contraction patterns extracted during object softness probing to control a Variable Stiffness Actuator (that emulates the agonistic-antagonistic behavior of human muscles), which is used to actuate the indenter system endowed with the TacTip for object compliance exploration. We found that our model-based approach for compliance discrimination, fed with more precisely estimated initial conditions, significantly improves with the human-inspired impedance regulation, with respect to the usage of a rigid actuator.},

However, variable stiffness is limited in actuation, response speed, stiffness ratio, and, most importantly, modeling. This article proposes hybrid actuated laminar jamming to outperform individual actuated variable stiffness mechanisms. An analytical model for multilayer laminar jamming that accurately characterizes mechanical behaviors in experiments is first built. Comprehensive parametrical analysis based on this model serves as design guidelines for performance improvements of laminar jamming. Feedforward control further proves the validity of the proposed model and exhibits good controllability, showing response speed as fast as 5 ms. The synergy between electroadhesion and vacuum actuation significantly enhances overall performance, resulting in far greater effects than individual contributions. For instance, the proposed device generates a high stiffness that is almost impossible for individual vacuum or electroadhesion. Moreover, vacuuming increases 23% of the breakdown voltage, which leads to a larger electroadhesion force and, hence, a higher stiffness.},

In this study, we focus on the ramifications of plastic terrain deformation on the hop-to-hop energy dynamics of a spring-legged monopedal hopping robot animated by a switched-compliance energy injection controller. From this deliberately simple robot-terrain template, we derive a hop-to-hop energy return map, and we use physical experiments and simulations to validate the hop-to-hop energy map for a real robot hopping on a real deformable substrate. The dynamical properties (fixed points, eigenvalues, basins of attraction) of this map provide insights into efficient, responsive, and robust locomotion on deformable terrain. Specifically, we identify constant-fixed-point surfaces in a controller parameter space that suggest it is possible to tune control parameters for efficiency or responsiveness while targeting a desired gait energy level. We also identify conditions under which fixed points of the energy map are globally stable, and we further characterize the basins of attraction of fixed points when these conditions are not satisfied. We conclude by discussing the implications of this hop-to-hop energy map for planning, control, and estimation for efficient, agile, and robust legged locomotion on deformable terrain.},

  abstract     = {Multiobjective multitask optimization (MO-MTO) aims to exploit the similarities among different multiobjective optimization tasks through knowledge transfer (KT), facilitating their simultaneous resolution. The effective design of KT techniques embedded in multiobjective evolutionary optimizers is crucial for enhancing the performance of multiobjective multitask evolutionary algorithms (MO-MTEAs). However, a significant limitation of existing KT techniques in MO-MTEAs is their equal treatment of particles/individuals for transferred knowledge reception, which can negatively impact the balance of diversity and convergence in population evolution. To remedy this limitation, this article proposes a new MO-MTEA, named MTEA-DCK, which incorporates diversity-oriented KT (DKT) and convergence-oriented KT (CKT) techniques tailored for different particles in the population. MTEA-DCK utilizes a strength-Pareto-based competitive mechanism to divide particles into winners and losers: 1) for winners, DKT is conducted via an intertask domain alignment approach to enhance population diversity and 2) for losers, CKT is executed within the unified search space to improve convergence. Additionally, to ensure robust performance on complex task combinations, we introduce two automatic parameter control strategies specifically designed for these KT techniques. MTEA-DCK was performed on 39 benchmark MO-MTO problems and demonstrated superior performance compared to eight state-of-the-art MO-MTEAs and six multiobjective evolutionary algorithms. Finally, we present three real-world MO-MTO application cases, where our approach also yielded better results than other algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Due to the complex entanglement between distributed control and distributed estimation, adaptive multiagent dynamics over leaderless directed graphs are yet not completely understood. This happens even when the adaptive dynamics are based on established tools like model reference adaptive control (MRAC). This work starts from the observation that existing MRAC-based leaderless designs stop at asymptotic consensus, lacking of any guarantee for exponential consensus or parameter identification. The main contribution of this work is to show a new design departing from the existing ones in terms of exploiting persistence of excitation (PE): the proposed design is the first one attaining exponential consensus with exponential parameter identification over leaderless directed graphs. In the special case that the unknown parameters are homogeneous, PE can be relaxed to a weaker cooperative PE (C-PE) condition. The design is illustrated and verified alongside the state-of-the-art.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the optimal group consensus problem (GCP) in multiagent systems (MASs). To address this problem, a novel distributed optimal control policy is designed in the framework of off-policy reinforcement learning (RL). First, a framework for multiagent differential graphical games is formulated. Second, a min-max strategy is then introduced to ensure the achievement of group consensus through a data-driven value iteration (VI) approach. Finally, the presented consensus control policy is extended to address the group formation tracking problem (GFTP) of nonholonomic mobile robots, with a numerical example to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed results. Compared with the existing literature, this article has the following contributions: 1) A group of agents are decomposed into multiple subgroups to accomplish different consensus objectives; 2) the prior knowledge of agents’ dynamics and initial stabilizing control gains can be eliminated; and 3) the performance index function (PIF) for each agent is designed to integrate not only its individual control policy but also that of its neighboring agents.},

  abstract     = {Robot systems, due to their unique flexibility and economy, are widely used in modern industry and intelligent manufacturing. The parameters of the system are unknown, and traditional parameter estimation methods are difficult to achieve fixed time convergence, which leads to extremely position tracking control problem. In addition, the transient and steady-state performance of the robot system is difficult to specify in advance. In this article, a novel composite learning fixed-time (FxT) control strategy is proposed for the robotic systems to deal with these issues. The funnel control (FC) is utilized to transform the original error system into a new error dynamics with transient performance constraints. The two-phase nonsingular FxT sliding mode surface is constructed to avoid the singularity problem. Then, the filter operation is introduced to obtain the expression of parameter estimation error and is used to design the composite learning law. To achieve parameter estimation, a FxT composite learning law based on online historical data and regression extension is proposed, where the interval excitation (IE) is considered in the adaptive law. Finally, the designed adaption is incorporated into the nonsingular FxT sliding mode control to achieve tracking control. Moreover, the comparison of three different controllers is made to demonstrate the benefits of the developed control strategy.},

It is noticeable that when the DoS attacker is active, the controller does not receive any information, which makes the controller fail to work. To tackle the challenge, an adaptive NN switching state observer is first built to estimate the unmeasurable states. Second, an FTPP function is constructed to boost the transient and steady-state performances of NCSs. Third, under the framework of the backstepping technique, an adaptive command filter is established by combining the dynamic adaptive technique with the switching state observer, which handles the “complexity explosion” problem and improves the robustness of NCSs. Besides, it is rigorously proved mathematically that the boundedness of all signals in the closed-loop system and the designed controller compels the tracking error to fall into the predefined boundary within a finite time. Finally, an application-oriented example of the single-link robotic arm system is utilized to demonstrate the viability of the proposed control method.},

To expand the attraction domain within the local FTS framework, a piecewise fractional-order differential inequality based on impulsive control systems is proposed. Subsequently, a new hybrid control strategy is designed by integrating a simple feedback controller with an impulsive controller involving a finite number of impulses, which can be accurately calculated using the proposed impulsive degree. Additionally, a set of local/global FTS criteria is formulated, and the settling time can be explicitly estimated.

To reduce the communication resources and controller update times, an event-triggered mechanism is designed via employing the sampled augmented systems states and triggered control input signals. Based on the developed event-triggered mechanism and Bellman optimality theory, a fuzzy optimal event-triggered control (ETC) approach is presented. Since solution of optimal control policy reduces to algebraic Riccati equations (AREs), its analytical solution is difficult to solve directly. Then, to search its approximation solution, a VI algorithm is formulated. By rigorous proof, the proposed optimal ETC scheme can assure that the USVs systems are asymptotically stable and the Q-learning algorithm is convergent. Finally, the simulation and comparisons results with previous optimal controllers verify the feasibility of the presented optimal ETC scheme.},

Specifically, partial-state variables are decomposed into a sum of two vector signals s and N. Then, setting s as the output vector, a new normal form is derived. For the new normal form, N and an auxiliary signal are designed to exponentially stabilize the unstable zero/internal dynamics of the auxiliary system; and the real input is designed to ensure that $s $ is exponentially stable. In particular, the zero/internal dynamics dependence on the input is fully considered in this article, and the proposed method ensures global stabilization of the closed-loop system without relying on the existence condition of Lyapunov functions. Finally, a high fidelity hypersonic vehicle model is given to show the design procedure and verify the feasibility and validity of the proposed stabilizing control scheme.},

  abstract     = {Tower cranes are complex multi-input multioutput underactuated mechatronics systems. The anti-swing control issue of tower crane with varying suspension cable length and double spherical pendulum effect is still open. Furthermore, the system parameters uncertainty makes it more challenging to implement anti-swing control. In this study, we present an adaptive sliding mode anti-swing control approach based on time-delay estimation for underactuated tower crane with varying suspension cable length and double spherical pendulum effect. First, we employ the Lagrange’s method to develop a seven-degree-of-freedom (7-DOF) tower crane dynamic model that comprehensively accounts for jib slewing, trolley motion, payload hoisting/lowering, and payload/hook spherical swing within a three-dimensional (3-D) space. Then, a sliding mode surface is constructed by analyzing the nonlinear coupling relationship between the unactuated states and actuated states. The time-delay estimation technique with adaptive scheme can adapt and predicate unknown system parameters online. An adaptive sliding mode anti-swing control method with time-delay estimation is designed for 7-DOF tower crane system subject to the parameter uncertainties. The convergence of the closed-loop control system is carefully demonstrated through the Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, the hardware experiments verify the anti-swing control performance and robustness of the designed adaptive sliding mode controller. The superiority of the proposed adaptive sliding mode anti-swing controller is confirmed by a decrease of at least 42.09% and 58.33% in the maximum and residual payload swing, respectively, over state-of-the-art control methods.},

  abstract     = {Symbolic regression is commonly considered in wide-ranging applications due to its inherent capability for learning both structure and weighting parameters of an interpretable model. However, for those scenarios that require fitting multiple expressions (MEs) synchronously, existing symbolic regression algorithms need to run multiple times step by step asynchronously for fitting such a group of expressions. Due to lacking mechanisms to explicitly capture and leverage the relationships between these expressions, the coupling information among MEs will be lost in this approach. A multiexpression symbolic regression algorithm (ME-SR) is proposed in this article to address the issue in learning MEs. Additionally, a methodology for extracting the approximate maximum common subexpression (aMCSE) among these MEs is suggested to disclose the relationships. A new metric is formulated to measure the quality of an aMCSE in ME-SR by imitating the concept of intersection over union. Furthermore, an adaptive cross matrix is incorporated into the algorithm to balance the search efforts between intertask and intratask domains. The proposed ME-SR demonstrates superior performance when compared to its counterparts of single expression symbolic regression on the designed test set.

  abstract     = {Peak carbon emissions and carbon neutrality have become important initiatives for the country to solve outstanding problems of resource and environmental constraints and promote green and low-energy development, and have attracted widespread attention from the industry. The distributed flow shop scheduling problem (DPFSP) is a typical problem that mainly works by consuming energy. However, DPFSP rarely considers energy efficiency and blocking constraints. In this study, an excellent bi-population cooperative discrete differential evolution (BCDDE) is proposed, aiming to address the energy-efficient distributed blocking flow shop scheduling problem (EEDBFSP) with total energy consumption (TEC) and total tardiness (TTD) as two objectives. A bi-population cooperative strategy is constructed to enhance the diversity of BCDDE, while utilizing it to initialize the population to enhance the quality of the initial solution. An adaptive local search operator strategy is developed to improve the BCDDE convergence. Critical and noncritical paths are devised to further optimize TEC and TTD objectives. The efficiency of each strategy related to BCDDE is verified and compared with state-of-the-art algorithms in the benchmark suite.

  abstract     = {Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms for addressing expensive optimization problems with both continuous and categorical variables (EOPCCVs) are still in the early stages of development. This study makes significant advancements by leveraging the mixed-variable nature of EOPCCVs in two crucial ways. First, it introduces a novel hybrid approach combining differential evolution and upper confidence bound sampling (DEUCB), designed to explore the mixed search space effectively. Second, a specialized value distance metric (VDM) is proposed, integrating continuous and categorical variables, to enhance the accuracy of the radial basis function (RBF) model approximation. Finally, we present a customized evolutionary expensive optimization algorithm (CEEO), which seamlessly incorporates DEUCB and RBF-VDM into the widely utilized global and local surrogate-assisted evolutionary optimization framework. Experimental results, compared against state-of-the-art counterparts on three distinct sets of benchmark problems and a convolutional neural network hyperparameter optimization task, consistently affirm the efficacy of the proposed CEEO in addressing EOPCCVs. The source code for the proposed CEEO algorithm is available at https://github.com/CIAM-Group/EvolutionaryAlgorithm_Codes/tree/main/CEEO_Code.},

To address this dilemma, this article studies a local knowledge transfer-based evolutionary algorithm for constrained multitask optimization. To be specific, each task population is divided into multiple niches to enhance the diversity and control the intensity of knowledge transfer, thus avoiding excessive transfer of knowledge. Then a new similarity judgment method based on the information feedback of pioneer individuals is developed to judge the similarity between tasks and whether to perform knowledge transfer. Furthermore, two different transfer methods: a direct transfer and a learning transfer, are devised to perform knowledge transfer among niches pertaining to different tasks. In addition, an excellent-information-guided mutation mechanism is proposed to prevent niches from getting trapped in local optima and to promote rapid convergence. The system experiment on 18 constrained multitask test instances and 2 real-world problems demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms or is at least comparable to other EMTO algorithms and constrained single-objective optimization algorithms.},

However, owing to complex architectures, existing approaches have failed to achieve high accuracies in real-time applications. In this article, a novel knowledge distillation (KD) SegFormer-based network, called KDSNet-S*, is proposed to explore the tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, a structured KD scheme is designed to transfer the rich advanced features of a teacher network (KDSNet-T) to a student network (KDSNet-S). Thereafter, the KDSNet-S network learns the precise segmentation ability of the KDSNet-T network. Additionally, a multifield perceptual fusion model is proposed to learn more integrated features for a single modality and obtain discriminative and comprehensive feature representations. Furthermore, a high-level feature integration module is introduced to refine multimodality high-level features. Finally, multilevel features are fused, and a label-decoupling-based three-stream decoder that decomposes the original semantic segmentation map into center and contour diffusion maps for different supervision tasks is introduced. Experimental results on two public red-green–blue-thermal semantic segmentation datasets indicate the superiority of KDSNet-S* over compared state-of-the-art methods. The KDSNet-S* reduces parameters and floating-point operations per second by 91.1% and 81.9%, respectively, compared with the KDSNet-T.

Considering the asynchrony among the agents, we develop an algorithm in which agents compute and communicate individually, without any form of synchronized coordination. Agents perform their local updates by local communication with their immediate neighbors, and this may involve the use of stale information. Since asynchrony naturally leads to latency or packet loss, an asynchronous robust gradient tracking mechanism is developed to guarantee estimating the average of agents’ gradients precisely. Moreover, it employs uncoordinated step-sizes which are more flexible and general than constant or decaying step-size. When the global objective is strongly convex and the local objectives have Lipschitz-continuous gradients, we prove that each agent executing the asynchronous algorithm linearly converges to the consensus optimal point at an $\mathcal {O}(\lambda ^{k})$ rate, where $\lambda \in (0,1)$ is convergence factor and k represents the iteration number, with a step satisfying a tight explicit upper bound. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our algorithm has better advantages over the state-of-the-art asynchronous algorithms.},

Using behavioral incentives via trust to encourage voluntary preference adjustments improves consensus through mutual agreement. This article aims to establish a trust incentive-driven framework for enabling consensus in social network group decision making (SN-GDM). First, a trust incentive mechanism is modeled via interactive trust functions that integrate risk attitude. The inclusion of risk attitude is crucial as it reflects the diverse ways decision makers (DMs) respond to uncertainty in trusting others’ judgments, capturing the varied behaviors of risky, neutral, and insurance DMs in the consensus process. Inconsistent DMs then adjust opinions in exchange for heightened trust. This mechanism enhances the importance degrees via a new weight assignment method, serving as a reward to motivate DMs to further align with the majority. Subsequently, a trust incentive-driven bounded maximum consensus model is proposed to optimize cooperation dynamics while preventing over-compensation of adjustments. Simulations and comparative analysis demonstrate the model’s efficacy in facilitating cooperation through tailored trust incentive mechanisms that account for these diverse risk preferences. Finally, the approach is applied to evaluate candidates for the Norden Shipping Scholarship, providing a cooperation-focused SN-GDM framework for achieving mutually agreeable solutions while acknowledging the impact of individual risk attitude on trust-based interactions.},

Specifically, a real-time scheduling framework is proposed in which a multiagent scheduling architecture is designed for achieving task selection, machine allocation and AGV allocation. Then, an action space and an efficient action decoding algorithm are proposed, which enable agents to explore in the high-quality solution space and improve the learning efficiency. In addition, a state space with generalization, a reward function considering machine idle time and a strategy for handling four disturbance events are designed to minimize the total tardiness cost. Comparison experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the priority dispatching rules, genetic programming and four popular reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods, with performance improvements mostly exceeding 10%. Furthermore, experiments considering four disturbance events demonstrate that the proposed method has strong robustness, and it can provide appropriate scheme for uncertain manufacturing system.},

Specifically, first, we consider three different switching point locations, and establish some sufficient criteria ensuring that NNs with n-neurons can have, and only have, $5^{n_{1}}\cdot 3^{n_{2}}$ equilibrium points (EPs) with $n_{1}+n_{2}=n$ , by utilizing the geometric features of the sigmoidal functions, the fixed point theorem, the Filippov’s EP definition, and the contraction mapping theorem. Then, based on novel Lyapunov functions and by applying the fractional-order calculus theory, it is demonstrated that $3^{n_{1}}\cdot 2^{n_{2}}$ out of $5^{n_{1}}\cdot 3^{n_{2}}$ total EPs are locally stable. This work’s investigation reveals that competitive NNs with switching afford more storage capacity compared to the nonswitching case. Additionally, our results are valid for the integer-order and fractional-order switched NNs, improving and generalizing current works. Furthermore, two numerical examples and an application example of associative memory are provided to validate the effectiveness of the theoretical findings, and the way various fractional orders affect the NNs’ convergence speed is shown through simulations.},

To conserve communication resources, an ABETM is employed to determine the release of system measurements to the PIO. Before transmission over the communication network, the triggered signal is quantized through a probabilistic quantization mechanism. The goal of this article is to devise a PIO that guarantees ultimate boundedness of the estimation error dynamics in the mean square. Initially, a sufficient condition is derived to ensure that the estimation error dynamics are exponentially ultimately bounded in the mean square. Following this, necessary PIO gains are identified by solving specific matrix inequalities, and the efficacy of this proposed PIO approach is validated using a three-tank system simulation.},

To prevent the leakage of sensitive data during communication, a novel privacy-preserving scaled distributed protocol is proposed. This protocol uses homomorphic encryption, whereby agents initially encrypt their information and transmit it in ciphertext form to neighboring agents. The control protocol is then reconstructed by the agents using the encrypted information received from their neighbors. A modified Halanay-like inequality is formulated and, by leveraging algebraic graph theory and the Lyapunov stability theorem, sufficient conditions are established to ensure that the MASs can achieve exponentially ultimately bounded scaled consensus. Furthermore, a convex optimization method is adopted to identify the optimal control gain so as to maximize the allowable sampling interval bound.

  abstract     = {The Epileptor model is a mathematical framework utilized for simulating the transition from interictal to ictal local field potential (LFP) activity in the brain, with the aim of predicting and preventing epileptic seizures. This article introduces a novel approach integrating Lyapunov and Poincaré–Bendixson methods to analyze the stability of limit cycles in nonlinear systems, specifically focusing on Epileptors with a two-state dynamic. Our method accurately delineates the limit cycle boundary through eigenvalue-based analysis, facilitating precise assessment of stability properties and identification of critical regions linked to seizure initiation and termination. Through the investigation of the two-state dynamics of Epileptors, we gain deeper insights into the transition between low activity and seizure states, consequently improving our understanding of epileptic seizures. Our approach can be employed to establish stability conditions and determine the existence of limit cycles in Epileptor models, which can further aid in predicting and preventing epileptic seizures by identifying critical regions associated with seizure initiation and termination. The simulations conducted in this study demonstrate that the model under investigation exhibits stable limit cycle behavior and manifests bifurcation, with significant implications for the development of targeted interventions and more effective prediction and treatments for epilepsy. The findings indicate that the suggested approach establishes that external stimulation should not surpass 10.8 mA. Moreover, the initial normal state lies within the range of −1.6 to −0.1 ictal LFP. On the other hand, the LaSalle and eigenvalue methods individually cannot precisely determine the limit cycle region.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the crucial aspect of safety in collaborative robotics by introducing a new continuous wavelet transform-convolutional neural network (CWT-CNN) for efficient robot collision detection. Unlike conventional methods, CWT-CNN exhibits superior data efficiency, requiring minimal collision data for robust training without relying on a dynamic model. The network’s adaptability extends to varying internal stiffness levels, offering robustness to changes in robotic system characteristics. Through comprehensive experimental studies, we investigate the impact of input signal types, wavelet types, wavelet scale ranges, and time-moving window sizes on collision detection performance, offering critical insights for optimal CWT parameter selection. Additionally, our transferability analysis demonstrates that the CWT-CNN can seamlessly adapt from one joint to another, requiring only minimal free-motion data from the new joint. This adaptability is validated through extensive experiments on an industrial robot and the robot equipped with variable stiffness actuators. In conclusion, the CWT-CNN is highly generalizable and data-efficient, making it a reliable solution for real-time collision detection in human-robot interactions, addressing a key aspect of safety in collaborative environments.},

  abstract     = {Safe exploration can be regarded as a constrained Markov decision problem (CMDP) where the expected long-term cost is constrained. Previous off-policy algorithms convert the constrained optimization problem into the corresponding unconstrained dual problem by introducing the Lagrangian relaxation technique. However, the cost function of the above algorithms provides inaccurate estimations and causes the instability of the Lagrange multiplier learning. In this article, we present a novel off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm called conservative distributional maximum a posteriori policy optimization (CDMPO). At first, to accurately judge whether the current situation satisfies the constraints, CDMPO adapts distributional RL method to estimate the Q-function and C-function. Then, CDMPO uses a conservative value function loss to reduce the number of violations of constraints during the exploration process. In addition, we utilize adaptive proportional integral derivative (APID) to update the Lagrange multiplier stably. In our experiments, we select eight representative constrained tasks from two well-known safe RL benchmarks (Safety Gym and Bullet Safety Gym), providing a comprehensive evaluation of our methods across diverse scenarios. Empirical results show that the proposed method has fewer violations of constraints in the early exploration process. The final test results also illustrate that our method has better-risk control capabilities.},

This article studies the finite-time synchronization of coupled FOSs with nonlinearity via fuzzy intermittent quantized control and two novel fractional-order differential inequalities. An interval-type 2 Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy technique is introduced, which not only facilitates the handling of the nonlinear term in the error dynamic system, but also greatly simplifies the control design. Synchronization conditions in form of linear matrix inequalities are provided by designing a novel Lyapunov function on the basis of ellipsoidal norm. Moreover, two corollaries show the generality of the new analysis framework. Compared with existing results, it is amazing that the decreasing magnitude of Lyapunov function on the control intervals can be smaller than its increasing magnitude on the subsequent noncontrol interval. Finally, Chua’s system is used to clarify the effectiveness of theoretical outcomes.},

The uniqueness of CEBO lies in its capability of balancing feasibility and objective improvement under a limited function evaluation budget, which is achieved by designing two strategies to obtain promising solutions. The first strategy prefers feasibility. It tends to obtain a feasible solution by utilizing the predicted value and uncertainty provided by Gaussian process (GP). The second strategy prefers objective improvement. It maintains and evolves the population of evolutionary algorithms, and selects a solution with a good objective function value and violating the constraints not too much based on the predicted value and uncertainty provided by GP at each iteration. The sequential implementation of these two strategies allows CEBO to balance feasibility and objective improvement. The effectiveness of CEBO is verified by 26 test instances and a practical application. The results demonstrate that CEBO is able to find high-quality solutions with 100 FEs.},

Most vehicles use a variety of different sensors to improve robustness. A vital part of these is the radar sensor. It provides the vehicle not only with location but also with valuable velocity information from surrounding objects. The increasing usage of radar systems in road traffic also causes problems in terms of mutual interference between different radar sensors. This interference leads to broadband disturbances in the signal which must be mitigated to ensure reliable object detection and object angle estimation. In this article, we compare different variants of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in their ability to mitigate mutual interference for multiantenna radar data. We analyze the potential of using multiantenna data for real-valued CNN (RVCNN) and complex-valued (CVCNN) models, comparing detection, phase reconstruction, and angle estimation performances. Furthermore, we propose a complex-valued CVCNN (CVCNN) architecture using a modified batch normalization method that omits activation scaling. Our experiments show, that using multiantenna data in combination with CVCNNs can greatly improve detection, phase, as well as angle estimation performance and that activation scaling is detrimental to our CVCNN architecture.},

Several positive augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii (L-K) functionals are proposed by introducing integral quadratic functions based on the L-K stability theorem. To further reduce the estimation gap caused by the existing integral inequalities, which were applied for dealing with the derived augmented-type integral term from augmented functional, some refined matrix-separation-based inequalities are introduced. With fewer decision variables, the proposed method considers the information among the system state, its derivative, and their related terms. After these, some cubic functions in the time-varying delay appear and show nonconvexity. Then, negative definite conditions are imposed on such cubic terms to obtain the stability criterion in the form of the linear matrix inequality (LMI). Inspired by the Taylor’s expansion methodology and the delay-partitioning techniques, we improve the existing negative definite conditions on the cubic function without introducing any decision variable. For linear systems with a time-varying delay, this relaxed condition, the refined matrix-separation-based inequalities, and the constructed L-K functionals, are combined to produce a less conservatism stability criterion. Two numerical examples illustrate the effect of the offered methods and the stability condition.},

Building on the principles of arbitrage pricing theory (APT), this study introduces a dynamic neural network model aimed at minimizing investment risk, optimizing portfolio allocation within predefined constraints, and maximizing returns. First, a convex optimization objective function incorporating risk constraints is formulated based on APT principles. This is followed by the introduction of a novel dynamic neural network model designed to solve the convex optimization problem, accompanied by comprehensive theoretical analysis and rigorous proofs. The study uses two distinct datasets sourced from Yahoo Finance, consisting of 30 selected stocks, covering a span of 250 valid trading days to validate the proposed methodology. The results of 30 different stock market scenario experiments indicate that, when the upper limit for investment risk is set at $3.285 \times 10^{-4}$ , the expected maximum investment return exceeds the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) index by 16.2816%. These empirical findings highlight the viability, stability, and efficacy of the proposed approach and framework, demonstrating its potential applicability for real-time, high-frequency trading scenarios.

  abstract     = {The State of Charge (SoC) is an important parameter of a battery energy storage system (BESS), and its balance problem is also an issue worth studying in a multi-BESS network. Recently, some researchers have proposed a power allocation method, claiming that as long as the power sharing state and SoC balance state can be obtained in real-time, it can not only maintain supply and demand balance, but also ensure that any BESS will not exit early due to insufficient energy storage. Considering this, we are attempting to design a distributed dynamic average tracking algorithm based on multiagent systems (MASs) with prescribed transient and steady state performance to estimate the power sharing and SoC balance states of a BESSs network with dynamic load in a distributed manner. Two versions of the solution are designed here, where one is event triggered and the other is self triggered. These two schemes ensure the performance of the estimators under intermittent communication to varying degrees, respectively. In each constructed estimation scheme, prescribed performance control (PPC) method is implemented to ensure the expected steady-state and dynamic performance, which is encapsulated in a performance function. Thus, it achieves almost zero error estimation of the fast time-varying power sharing and the SoC balance states. In addition, consensus and average tracking performance are decoupled, which provides convenience for parameters tuning. Finally, to verify the results of the theoretical analysis, some cases are studied and relevant simulations are performed on a 4 bus system.},

Differential neural networks (DNNs) are modeling tools for dynamic systems that can be useful for developing precise representations of periodic systems. This study presents the design of a novel family of DNN identifiers that could reproduce the trajectories of periodic systems with an uncertain mathematical model. The suggested DNN identifiers may produce an approximate model with periodic properties similar to the system under analysis exhibiting an one-period convergence of DNN weights. The fundamentals of the Floquet’s theory drive the design of the learning laws to ensure the reproduction of the periodic properties in the DNN. The design of a controlled Lyapunov function allows the learning laws to be derived for the DNN weights whose evolution depends on the positive definite solution of a periodic differential Lyapunov equation. Several numerical evaluations on periodic systems confirmed the modeling performance of the proposed identifier when the approximation performance is compared with traditional DNN identifiers using sigmoidal functions.},

In the adaptation law design, $\sigma $ -modification combined with G+D estimator is adopted to robustly shape the dynamics of closed-loop system and enhance the steady-state performance. Through Lyapunov stability analysis, it is proved that the CPSs under the proposed control scheme can accommodate the effect of DoS attacks of nearly arbitrary intensity, i.e., the communication is not completely blocked. Finally, a numerical simulation is carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed control scheme.},

However, the existing linear interaction patterns do not realistically reflect users’ decision-making processes. The formation of users’ opinions on items and the evolutionary preference interaction process among users needs to be explored. In our work, we bridge social psychology and recommender systems to develop a social recommendation model, nonlinearly utilizing latent user preferences and item features to simulate the intrinsic formation of users’ decision-making. We extend the cognitive opinion formation mechanism by improving the two-stage process and seamlessly combine it and matrix factorization, simulating the nonlinear interactions between users and items. We incorporate the implicit user influence and explicit social dynamics with bounded confidence effect into the nonlinear cognitive recommendation framework to characterize the evolutionary preference interactions among users. We conduct comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets to compare the proposed method with the state-of-the-art models. The results indicate that our method makes notable improvements in rating prediction for all users and cold-start users. In addition, the nonlinear cognitive opinion formation has a significant effect on improving performance, conferring higher interpretability to the recommendation.},

Subsequently, the transformed model and reinforcement learning (RL) theory are integrated to obtain a novel data-driven distributed learning framework. This framework enables online learning of the optimal control law and ensures tracking consensus of all followers’ position and velocity states. Compared to the traditional actor–critic framework, an additional neural network (NN) is utilized to approximate the forward reward information (FRI) to improve the information learning capability of the MASs. Furthermore, the convergence analysis of system states and three NNs structures are conducted by Lyapunov theory. Finally, the proposed framework is verified to have better convergence and require fewer iteration steps than classical actor–critic framework by numerical simulation comparison experiments.},

However, when agent resources are scarce, assignment strategies aimed at eliminating agent conflicts become infeasible. Consequently, there is a need to select the optimal assignment with a minimal number of agent conflicts, which is essentially a nonlinear bilevel optimization problem. To tackle this issue, we first design the group role assignment with minimized agent conflicts (GRAMAC) model to formalize this problem. It converts this problem into an extended integer linear programming (x-ILP) one and finds the optimal solution. Then, we prove that solving the GRAMAC model is an $\mathscr {NP} - \mathrm {complete}$ task. Moreover, we identify the sufficient and necessary condition under which the GRAMAC model has the optimal conflict-free solution. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to existing strategies, our proposed method reduces the number of agent conflicts by an average of approximately 30% while ensuring the group performance of the collaborative system.},

However, its configuration optimization in confined three-dimensional (3-D) space is very complicated due to infinite configurations of inverse kinematics solutions. This article proposes a spatial triarc planning method in response to the issue mentioned above. A reasonable triarc configuration can be optimized by this method based on six input parameters, i.e., the proximal control point and tangent vector, distal control point and tangent vector, and two centers of curvature circles in both two-dimensional (2-D) and 3-D space. This method has the following three advantages. First, the task configuration of a spatial triarc can be predicted by presetting the relationship between the proximal and distal tangent vectors. Furthermore, the configuration of the middle and inner concentric cable-driven mechanism can be controlled by adjusting the direction of the distal tangent vector. Additionally, the proportion of each concentric cable-driven mechanism can be controlled by changing centers of curvature circles. Finally, the proposed spatial triarc planning method is verified by simulations and experiments. Results show that the maximum errors of the C-shaped spatial triarc and the S-shaped spatial triarc experiments are 1.68 mm and 1.36 mm, respectively.},

We emphasize the impact of TPs on FS-MJSs by utilizing known TPs and introducing them into sufficient conditions for MSS. Numerically testable stability criteria for FS-MJSs in the sense of MSS are provided. The existence criteria are suggested to design the controller to guarantee the MSS of the closed-loop FS-MJSs.

Different variable admittance controllers with essential stability analyses are required for multiple interaction scenarios in a complex task, where stability analysis is the major difficulty. In this article, we propose a unified stability-guaranteed variable admittance control architecture to decrease the control system complexity, in which we represent the admittance control model as a port-Hamiltonian (pH) system and design an energy tank with the optimization theory. The advantages of the proposed architecture are reflected in several aspects: 1) compatibility with common strategies; 2) perturbation resistance; and 3) passivity as a natural property. As the dissipated energy from the pH system is injected into the energy tank while the energy in the tank is used to support the interaction and perturbation resistance, the best passive approximation of the desired behaviors is generated, which can avoid the control signal failure (control signal failure denotes that the unexpected input $u=0$ occurs due to a lack of energy in the tank). Three different groups of experiments are conducted to verify the feasibility, perturbation resistance, and practicality of the proposed architecture.},

In particular, a special neural network called zeroing neural network (ZNN) has recently been developed to solve the time-dependent CNE (TDCNE). In this study, we propose a new discrete-time ZNN (DTZNN) model to determine the numerical solution of the TDCNE. Such a model, which is derived from the discretization of the previous ZNN model via a special difference formula, can achieve excellent performance on computing and solving the TDCNE. Theoretical analysis and comparative numerical results further denote the validity and superiority of the proposed DTZNN model. Finally, the proposed model is used to simulate the dual-arm robot system, which verifies the practicability and feasibility of the DTZNN.},

  abstract     = {Infinite-horizon optimal control of constrained piecewise affine (PWA) systems has been approximately addressed by hybrid model predictive control (MPC), which, however, has computational limitations, both in offline design and online implementation. In this article, we consider an alternative approach based on approximate dynamic programming (ADP), an important class of methods in reinforcement learning. We accommodate nonconvex union-of-polyhedra state constraints and linear input constraints into ADP by designing PWA penalty functions. PWA function approximation is used, which allows for a mixed-integer encoding to implement ADP. The main advantage of the proposed ADP method is its online computational efficiency. Particularly, we propose two control policies, which lead to solving a smaller-scale mixed-integer linear program than conventional hybrid MPC, or a single convex quadratic program, depending on whether the policy is implicitly determined online or explicitly computed offline. We characterize the stability and safety properties of the closed-loop systems, as well as the suboptimality of the proposed policies, by quantifying the approximation errors of value functions and policies. We also develop an offline mixed-integer-linear-programming-based method to certify the reliability of the proposed method. Simulation results on an inverted pendulum with elastic walls and on an adaptive cruise control problem validate the control performance in terms of constraint satisfaction and CPU time.},

  abstract     = {Centrality metrics play a crucial role in network analysis, while the choice of specific measures significantly influences the accuracy of conclusions as each measure represents a unique concept of node importance. Among over 400 proposed indices, selecting the most suitable ones for specific applications remains a challenge. Existing approaches—model-based, data-driven, and axiomatic—have limitations, requiring association with models, training datasets, or restrictive axioms for each specific application. To address this, we introduce the culling method, which relies on the expert concept of centrality behavior on simple graphs. The culling method involves forming a set of candidate measures, generating a list of as small graphs as possible needed to distinguish the measures from each other, constructing a decision-tree survey, and identifying the measure consistent with the expert’s concept. We apply this approach to a diverse set of 40 centralities, including novel kernel-based indices, and combine it with the axiomatic approach. Remarkably, only 13 small 1-trees are sufficient to separate all 40 measures, even for pairs of closely related ones. By adopting simple ordinal axioms like Self-consistency or Bridge axiom, the set of measures can be drastically reduced making the culling survey short. Applying the culling method provides insightful findings on some centrality indices, such as PageRank, Bridging, and dissimilarity-based Eigencentrality measures, among others. The proposed approach offers a cost-effective solution in terms of labor and time, complementing existing methods for measure selection, and providing deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms of centrality measures.},

The proposed protocol makes use of two independent channels to transmit data separately, thereby improving the channel utilization efficiency and reducing the probability of packet dropout. Then, with the proposed protocol and the iterative dynamic linearization approach, an adaptive iterative learning controller associated with a parameter estimation strategy is provided for the nonlinear system under investigation. The control law is data-driven, which therefore does not require knowledge of the model. Subsequently, the sufficient condition is derived under which the tracking error is forced to convergent.

In this framework, dependence between $\mathcal {X}$ and $\mathcal {Y}$ in D, denoted ${\mathfrak {B}}_{\mathrm {}} (\mathcal {X}, \mathcal {Y} | D)$ , is quantified as $P (H_{1} | D)$ , the posterior probability for the model of dependence given D, or any strictly increasing function thereof. It is therefore a measure of the evidence for dependence between $\mathcal {X}$ and $\mathcal {Y}$ as modeled by $H_{1}$ and observed in D. We review several statistical models and reconsider standard results in the light of ${\mathfrak {B}}_{\mathrm {}} (\mathcal {X}, \mathcal {Y} | D)$ as a measure of dependence. Using simulations, we focus on two specific issues: 1) the effect of noise and 2) the behavior of ${\mathfrak {B}}_{\mathrm {}} (\mathcal {X}, \mathcal {Y} | D)$ when $H_{1}$ has a parameter coding for the intensity of dependence. We then derive some general properties of ${\mathfrak {B}}_{\mathrm {}} (\mathcal {X}, \mathcal {Y} | D)$ , showing that it quantifies the information contained in D in favor of $H_{1}$ versus $H_{0}$ . While some of these properties are typical of what is expected from a valid measure of dependence, others are novel and naturally appear as desired features for specific measures of dependence, which we call inferential. We finally put these results in perspective; in particular, we discuss the consequences of using the Bayesian framework as well as the similarities and differences between ${\mathfrak {B}}_{\mathrm {}} (\mathcal {X}, \mathcal {Y} | D)$ and mutual information.},

  abstract     = {Bird excrement deposited on solar panels can lead to hotspots, significantly reducing the efficiency of solar power plants. This article presents a novel solution to this problem leveraging unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems for the automated geolocation and removal of bird excrement across large-scale solar power facilities. First, a UAV executes a predefined flight path to capture sequential aerial images of the plant. These images are subsequently stitched to produce a high-definition orthomosaic of the entire facility. An advanced detection framework based on YOLOv7, enhanced with an attention module, is employed to accurately detect bird excrement by reducing background noise and highlighting key features. An additional prediction head is integrated to improve detection of smaller bird excrements. To compute precise geolocation of the detected excrement, the midpoint pixel coordinates of the excrement along with the azimuth angle and actual ground distance (AGD) relative to a ground control point (GCP) is used. This article further proposes a cleaning technique that employs a traveling salesman problem (TSP) approximation algorithm to efficiently optimize flight path of the cleaning UAV. Experimental results indicate the system achieves an average detection precision (AP) of 93.91% and GPS coordinate accuracy with an average error of 0.149 m, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed method in both geolocation and removal of bird excrement from solar panels.},

Furthermore, we establish that random nonlinear systems utilizing self-triggered control (STC) can achieve NSS, by setting a minimum triggering time to prevent Zeno behavior. Lastly, by adopting the adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) strategy, we develop self-triggered optimal control for random systems with Markovian switching, ensuring the uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the signals in all closed-loop systems. This article addresses three key gaps in the field of RDE optimal control, contributing substantially to both theoretical and practical advancements.

Taking Petri nets (PNs) as a modeling and analysis tool, this article focuses on the deadlock control problem for a forward-conflict free net (FCFN), which allows for batch assembly and multiple resource allocations. First, a new structural characterization of deadlocks in FCFN is proposed through two structural objects: 1) circuit and 2) $\omega $ -structure. The starting point for this is motivated by the fact that deadlocks in assembly systems stem not only from the circular wait of resources but also the parts waiting for their assembly with other parts. Subsequently, based on these two objects, a necessary and sufficient condition about FCFNs liveness is obtained: 1) an FCFN is live if and only if no circuit and 2) $\omega $ -structure are saturated at any reachable marking. Finally, in order to prevent each such object from inducing deadlocks, a hierarchical search algorithm appropriate for real-time implementation is developed to avoid its saturation. The proposed algorithm is proven to be capable of ensuring the deadlock-free operation of FCFNs. Moreover, several examples are provided to demonstrate its effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {In multiagent systems, conventional methods for addressing consensus problems typically rely on utilizing local and smooth control inputs; however, the focus of these methods is often on achieving asymptotic behavior, rather than transient response. In the existing literature, it has been shown that resetting some controller states can improve the transient response of linear systems. In this article, by utilizing a model predictive control (MPC)-based reset strategy, a new design framework is proposed that ensures not only the asymptotic stability but also the achievement of a desired transient performance. The proposed approach entails minimizing a quadratic cost function to determine the optimal after-reset values for controller states. The problem is then reformulated as a linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimization problem, which is solved to determine the reset law at specific reset instants, enabling the controller to achieve optimal performance and stability in a given multiagent system. The proposed method can be implemented in two distinct modalities. In the first one, characterized as distributed, when the reset conditions are satisfied in a particular agent at any given moment, only the controller state of that specific agent undergoes a reset in that moment, consequently, the transient performance improvement is exclusively limited to that particular agent. On the other hand, in the second modality, known as centralized, when the reset conditions hold in one agent, the controller states of all agents are reset simultaneously, thereby the transient performances of all agents concurrently experience improvement. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the superior performance of both suggested approaches in comparison with conventional reset methods. Furthermore, a comparison between the two suggested strategies is conducted.},

Fixed-time convergence guarantees are provided for the modified GD update law under the condition that the recorded data fulfills a rank condition, which is less restrictive than the standard PE condition. To guarantee fixed-time convergence, fixed-time Lyapunov analysis is leveraged. Compared to typical GD-based update laws, two main advantages of the presented approach are: 1) the modified GD update law guarantees fixed-time convergence instead of asymptotic convergence and 2) the convergence guarantee is provided under an easy-to-check rank condition rather than the standard PE condition, which is hard or even impossible to check online. Simulation results are provided to verify the obtained results.},

  abstract     = {Systems of different types of agents coupled with high-order interactions can emerge complex synchronization patterns. This article presents an analysis framework to study the group synchronization of heterogeneous multiagent systems with hierarchical structure and directed interactions of arbitrary order. First, directed hypergraph is introduced to describe the arbitrary-order interactions among the agents. Then, to explore the possible group synchronization patterns, the agent partition methods commonly used in dyadic graphs are extended to the directed hypergraph. Meanwhile, to verify the admissibility of the group synchronization patterns, two equitable partition types of agent partition are defined from the perspective of hyperedge partition. Next, using the simultaneous block diagonalization method, the stability problem of the group synchronous solution is decoupled into several independent subblocks. These subblocks are associated with the perturbations along and transverse to the synchronous manifold, with transverse subblocks related to loss of synchronization. Therefore, the stability of the group synchronous solution can be investigated by evaluating the stability of each transverse subblock via the master stability function method, thus significantly reducing the stability calculation complexity. Finally, the effectiveness of the analysis framework is illustrated via the simulation.},

Building on prior work, chiefly the BMatrix—a matrix descriptor visualized as the invariant ’network portrait’ heatmap—we introduce BFS-Census, a new algorithm computing our Census data structures: Census-Node, Census-Edge, and Census-Stub. Our experiments show Census-Stub, which focuses on ’stubs’ (half-edges), has orders of magnitude greater discerning power (ability to tell non-isomorphic graphs apart) than any other descriptor in this study, without a difficult trade-off: the substantial increase in resolution doesn&#39;t come at a commensurate cost in storage space or computation power. We also present new visualizations—our Hop-Census polylines and Census-Census trajectories—and evaluate them using real-world graphs, including a sensitivity analysis that shows graph topology change maps to visual Census change.},

Computing a layout for such graphs means embedding the node trajectories and edge surfaces over time in a $2D + t$ space, known as the space-time cube. Currently, these space-time cube layouts are visualized through animation or by slicing the cube at regular intervals. However, both techniques present problems such as below-average performance on tasks as well as loss of precision and difficulties in selecting timeslice intervals. In this article, we present TimeLighting, a novel visual analytics approach to visualize and explore temporal graphs embedded in the space-time cube. Our interactive approach highlights node trajectories and their movement over time, visualizes node “aging”, and provides guidance to support users during exploration by indicating interesting time intervals (“when”) and network elements (“where”) are located for a detail-oriented investigation. This combined focus helps to gain deeper insights into the temporal network&#39;s underlying behavior. We assess the utility and efficacy of our approach through two case studies and qualitative expert evaluation. The results demonstrate how TimeLighting supports identifying temporal patterns, extracting insights from nodes with high activity, and guiding the exploration and analysis process.},

Among the many contributions proposed in this area, some systems embrace the ambitious objective of imitating human analysts to identify relevant relationships in data and make appropriate design choices to represent these relationships with insightful charts. We denote these systems as “agnostic” VRSs since they do not rely on human-provided constraints and rules but try to learn the task autonomously. Despite the high application potential of agnostic VRSs, their progress is hindered by several obstacles, including the absence of standardized datasets to train recommendation algorithms, the difficulty of learning design rules, and defining quantitative criteria for evaluating the perceptual effectiveness of generated plots.

Existing generic novel view synthesis methods rely on time-consuming scene geometry pre-computation or redundant sampling of the entire space for neural volumetric rendering, limiting the overall efficiency. Instead, we incorporate learned MVS priors into the neural volume rendering pipeline while improving the rendering efficiency by reducing sampling points under the guidance of depth probability distributions. Specifically, fewer but important points are sampled under the guidance of depth probability distributions extracted from the learned MVS architecture. Based on the learned probability-guided sampling, we develop a sophisticated neural volume rendering module that effectively integrates source view information with the learned scene structures. We further propose confidence-aware refinement to improve the rendering results in uncertain, occluded, and unreferenced regions. Moreover, we build a four-view camera system for holographic display and provide a real-time version of our framework for free-viewpoint experience, where novel view images of a spatial resolution of 512×512 can be rendered at around 20 fps on a single GTX 3090 GPU. Experiments show that our method achieves 15 to 40 times faster rendering compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with strong generalization capacity and comparable high-quality novel view synthesis performance.},

However, there is a need to address their potential constraints, especially in the context of human cognitive capacity limits. These limits dictate the maximum information our mind can process at once. We explore the issue of capacity limitation by testing competing theories that describe how the number of frames shown in a display, the scale of the frames, and time constraints impact user performance with small multiples of line charts in an energy grid scenario. In two online studies (Experiment 1 n = 141 and Experiment 2 n = 360) and a follow-up eye-tracking analysis (n = 5), we found a linear decline in accuracy with increasing frames across seven tasks, which was not fully explained by differences in frame size, suggesting visual search challenges. Moreover, the studies demonstrate that highlighting specific frames can mitigate some visual search difficulties but, surprisingly, not eliminate them. This research offers insights into optimizing the utility of small multiples by aligning them with human limitations.},

  abstract     = {The rapid, accurate, and robust computation of virtual human figures’ “in-between” pose transitions from available and sometimes sparse inputs is of fundamental significance to 3D interactive graphics and computer animation. Various methods have been proposed to produce natural lifelike transitions of human pose automatically in recent decades. Nevertheless, conventional pure model-driven methods require heuristic knowledge (e.g., least motion guided by physics laws) and ad-hoc clues (e.g., splines with non-uniform time warp) that are difficult to obtain, learn, and infer. With the fast emergence of large-scale datasets readily available to animators in the most recent years, deep models afford a powerful alternative to tackle the aforementioned challenges. However, pure data-driven methods still suffer from the remaining challenges such as unseen data in practice and less generative power in model/domain/data transfer, and the measurement of the generative power has always been omitted in these works. In essence, data-driven methods solely rely on the qualities and quantities of training datasets. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach built upon the seamless integration of data-driven and model-driven methods, called Dynamic Motion Transition (DMT), with the following salient modeling advantages: (1) The data augmentation capability based on the limited human locomotion data capture and the concept of force-derived directly from physical laws; (2) Force learning by which skeleton joints are driven to move, and the Conditional Temporal Transformer (CTT) being trained to learn the force change in the local range, both at the fine level; and (3) At the coarse level, the effective and flexible creation of the subsequent step motion using Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP) until the target is reached. Our extensive experiments have confirmed that our model can outperform the state-of-the-art methods under the newly devised metric by virtue of the least action loss function. In addition, our novel method and system are of immediate benefit to many other animation tasks such as motion synthesis and control, and motion tracking and prediction in this bigdata graphics era.},

To support onboarding, we use large language models to interpret visualization designs and view relationships based on system specifications. For exploration, we use large language models to recommend insights based on the analysis of system status and data to facilitate mixed-initiative exploration. For summarization, we present a selective reporting strategy to retrace analysis history through a stream visualization and generate insight reports with the help of large language models.

We provide its definition and describe its construction steps. Based on this structure, we present an extraction and categorization of sheets using advanced graph matching techniques to handle the non-hex elements. This enables us to develop an enhanced visual analysis of the structure for any hex-dominant meshes. We apply this structure-based visual analysis to compare hex-dominant meshes generated by different methods to study their advantages and disadvantages. This complements the standard quality metric based on the non-hex element percentage for hex-dominant meshes. Moreover, we propose a strategy to extract a cleaned (optimized) valence-based singularity graph wireframe to analyze the structure for both mesh and sheets. Our results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid base complex provides a coarse representation for mesh element, and the proposed valence singularity graph wireframe provides a better internal visualization of hex-dominant meshes.},

  abstract     = {Obtaining high-quality labeled training data poses a significant bottleneck in the domain of machine learning. Data programming has emerged as a new paradigm to address this issue by converting human knowledge into labeling functions (LFs) to quickly produce low-cost probabilistic labels. To ensure the quality of labeled data, data programmers commonly iterate LFs for many rounds until satisfactory performance is achieved. However, the challenge in understanding the labeling iterations stems from interpreting the intricate relationships between data programming elements, exacerbated by their many-to-many and directed characteristics, inconsistent formats, and the large scale of data typically involved in labeling tasks. These complexities may impede the evaluation of label quality, identification of areas for improvement, and the effective optimization of LFs for acquiring high-quality labeled data. In this article, we introduce EvoVis, a visual analytics method for multi-class text labeling tasks. It seamlessly integrates relationship analysis and temporal overview to display contextual and historical information on a single screen, aiding in explaining the labeling iterations in data programming. We assessed its utility and effectiveness through case studies and user studies. The results indicate that EvoVis can effectively assist data programmers in understanding labeling iterations and improving the quality of labeled data, as evidenced by an increase of 0.16 in the average F1 score when compared to the default analysis tool.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we devise a framework for volumetrically reconstructing fluid from observable, measurable free surface motion. Our innovative method amalgamates the benefits of deep learning and conventional simulation to preserve the guiding motion and temporal coherence of the reproduced fluid. We infer surface velocities by encoding and decoding spatiotemporal features of surface sequences, and a 3D CNN is used to generate the volumetric velocity field, which is then combined with 3D labels of obstacles and boundaries. Concurrently, we employ a network to estimate the fluid&#39;s physical properties. To progressively evolve the flow field over time, we input the reconstructed velocity field and estimated parameters into the physical simulator as the initial state. Our approach yields promising results for both synthetic fluid generated by different fluid solvers and captured real fluid. The developed framework naturally lends itself to a variety of graphics applications, such as 1) effective reproductions of fluid behaviors visually congruent with the observed surface motion, and 2) physics-guided re-editing of fluid scenes. Extensive experiments affirm that our novel method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches for 3D fluid inverse modeling and animation in graphics.},

Most of the existing makeup transfer methods are based on the generative adversarial networks. Despite their success in makeup transfer for a single image, they struggle to maintain the consistency of makeup under different poses and expressions of the same person. In this article, we propose a robust makeup transfer method which consistently transfers the makeup style of a reference image to facial images in any poses and expressions. Our method introduces the implicit 3D representation, neural radiance fields (NeRFs), to ensure the geometric and appearance consistency. It has two separate stages, including one basic NeRF module to reconstruct the geometry from the input facial image sequence, and a makeup module to learn how to transfer the reference makeup style consistently. We propose a novel hybrid makeup loss which is specially designed based on the makeup characteristics to supervise the training of the makeup module. The proposed loss significantly improves the visual quality and faithfulness of the makeup transfer effects. To better align the distribution between the transferred makeup and the reference makeup, a patch-based discriminator that works in the pose-independent UV texture space is proposed to provide more accurate control of the synthesized makeup. Extensive experiments and a user study demonstrate the superiority of our network for a variety of different makeup styles.},

  abstract     = {The use of natural language interfaces (NLIs) to create charts is becoming increasingly popular due to the intuitiveness of natural language interactions. One key challenge in this approach is to accurately capture user intents and transform them to proper chart specifications. This obstructs the wide use of NLI in chart generation, as users’ natural language inputs are generally abstract (i.e., ambiguous or under-specified), without a clear specification of visual encodings. Recently, pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have exhibited superior performance in understanding and generating natural language, demonstrating great potential for downstream tasks. Inspired by this major trend, we propose ChartGPT, generating charts from abstract natural language inputs. However, LLMs are struggling to address complex logic problems. To enable the model to accurately specify the complex parameters and perform operations in chart generation, we decompose the generation process into a step-by-step reasoning pipeline, so that the model only needs to reason a single and specific sub-task during each run. Moreover, LLMs are pre-trained on general datasets, which might be biased for the task of chart generation. To provide adequate visualization knowledge, we create a dataset consisting of abstract utterances and charts and improve model performance through fine-tuning. We further design an interactive interface for ChartGPT that allows users to check and modify the intermediate outputs of each step. The effectiveness of the proposed system is evaluated through quantitative evaluations and a user study.},

Existing research has shown that increasing the space on a computer screen can enhance usability. Since virtual displays offer the unique ability to present content without rigid physical space constraints, they provide various new design possibilities. Therefore, we must understand the trade-offs of layout choices when structuring that space. We propose a single Canvas approach that eliminates boundaries from traditional multi-monitor approaches and instead places windows in one large, unified space. Our user study compared this approach against a multi-monitor setup, and we considered both purely virtual systems and hybrid systems that included a physical monitor. We looked into usability factors such as performance, accuracy, and overall window management. Results show that Canvas displays can cause users to compact window layouts more than multiple monitors with snapping behavior, even though such optimizations may not lead to longer window management times. We did not find conclusive evidence of either setup providing a better user experience. Multi-Monitor displays offer quick window management with snapping and a structured layout through subdivisions. However, Canvas displays allow for more control in placement and size, lowering the amount of space used and, thus, head rotation. Multi-Monitor benefits were more prominent in the hybrid configuration, while the Canvas display was more beneficial in the purely virtual configuration.},

Existing methods directly detect POIs from the entire 3D shape, resulting in low efficiency and accuracy. Therefore, we propose a novel multi-modal POI detection method using a coarse-to-fine approach, with the key idea of reducing data complexity and enabling more efficient and accurate subsequent POI detection by first identifying and processing important regions on the 3D shape. It first obtains important areas on the 3D shape through 2D projected images, then processes points within these regions using attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing POI detection techniques.},

It is, however, unclear which descriptors are more suitable for a particular application. This paper fills the gap by comprehensively evaluating nine state-of-the-art spectral descriptors on ten popular deformable shape datasets as well as perturbations such as mesh discretization, geometric noise, scale transformation, non-isometric setting, partiality, and topological noise. Our evaluated terms for a spectral descriptor cover four major concerns, i.e., distinctiveness, robustness, compactness, and computational efficiency.

  abstract     = {The reset technique of Redirected Walking (RDW) forcibly reorients the user&#39;s direction overtly to avoid collisions with boundaries, obstacles, or other users in the physical space. However, excessive resetting can decrease the user&#39;s sense of immersion and presence. Several RDW studies have been conducted to address this issue. Among them, much research has been done on reset techniques that reduce the number of resets by devising reset direction rules or optimizing them for a given environment. However, existing optimization studies on reset techniques have mainly focused on a single-user environment. In a multi-user environment, the dynamic movement of other users and static obstacles in the physical space increase the possibility of resetting. In this study, we propose Multi-Agent Reinforcement Resetter (MARR), which resets the user taking into account both physical obstacles and multi-user movement to minimize the number of resets. MARR is trained using multi-agent reinforcement learning to determine the optimal reset direction in different environments. This approach allows MARR to effectively account for different environmental contexts, including arbitrary physical obstacles and the dynamic movements of other users in the same physical space. We compared MARR to other reset technologies through simulation tests and user studies, and found that MARR outperformed the existing methods. MARR improved performance by learning the optimal reset direction for each subtle technique used in training. MARR has the potential to be applied to new subtle techniques proposed in the future. Overall, our study confirmed that MARR is an effective reset technique in multi-user environments.},

  abstract     = {A novel neural network called the isomorphic mesh generator (iMG) is proposed to generate isomorphic meshes from point clouds containing noise and missing parts. Isomorphic meshes of arbitrary objects exhibit a unified mesh structure, despite objects belonging to different classes. This unified representation enables various modern deep neural networks (DNNs) to easily handle surface models without requiring additional pre-processing. Additionally, the unified mesh structure of isomorphic meshes enables the application of the same process to all isomorphic meshes, unlike general mesh models, where processes need to be tailored depending on their mesh structures. Therefore, the use of isomorphic meshes can ensure efficient memory usage and reduce calculation time. Apart from the point cloud of the target object used as input for the iMG, point clouds and mesh models need not be prepared in advance as training data because the iMG is a data-free method. Furthermore, the iMG outputs an isomorphic mesh obtained by mapping a reference mesh to a given input point cloud. To stably estimate the mapping function, a step-by-step mapping strategy is introduced. This strategy enables flexible deformation while simultaneously maintaining the structure of the reference mesh. Simulations and experiments conducted using a mobile phone have confirmed that the iMG reliably generates isomorphic meshes of given objects, even when the input point cloud includes noise and missing parts.},

However, to provide more real-time and efficient communication services, information freshness is becoming increasingly important in the ISTN. In this paper, we investigate a multi-agent DRL-based power control algorithm for minimizing the average age of information (AoI) in the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) enabled ISTN. Specifically, a multi-agent proximal policy optimization (PPO) is employed to jointly allocate the power and reduce inter-beam interference. Due to the imperfect serial interference cancellation (SIC), the average AoI minimization is formulated as a non-convex problem that satisfies both quality of service constraints and total power limitations. Therefore, a generalized advantage estimation PPO-based power allocation (GAP3A) algorithm is proposed, which operates by centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) to enhance the training stability. Especially, an ingenious, global reward function is designed to guide the DRL training towards minimizing the average AoI of the ISTN. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CTDE-based GAP3A algorithm can effectively lower the average AoI to an optimal level and significantly outperforms the other three benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {Broadcasting is an essential service for video transmission, particularly when wide distribution of common content is required. However, providing high-performance broadcasting service remains a crucial challenge when users are located in areas with poor channel quality and the transmit power budget is insufficient. To address such difficulty, intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) can be employed to construct reconfigurable BS-IRS-user links, thereby enhancing spectral and power efficiency. In this paper, we design a quality-driven video broadcasting framework assisted by the IRS. The problem is formulated as the maximization of the minimum peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) for all users via a joint optimization of active and passive beamforming. To address the formulated non-convex problem, we introduce an effective algorithm that leverages penalty-based successive convex approximation (P-SCA) to achieve a suboptimal solution. Simulation results validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm and unveil the impact of video spatial-temporal content complexity on PSNR.},

In this correspondence, we propose a novel phase hopping scheme for IRS-aided multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems, which dispenses with the channel state information (CSI) by randomly changing the IRS&#39;s reflections over different time slots within the channel coherence time, thereby creating artificial time diversity to enhance the communication performance.

In practice, multiple real-life DD channel responses might be co-located within a same DD grid interval, leading to performance degradation. A finer grid interval is needed to distinguish these responses, but this could result in a significantly higher CE complexity when traditional methods are used. To address this issue, a grid evolution method for doubly fractional CE is proposed by evolving the initially uniform coarse DD grid into a non-uniform dense grid. Simulation results show that our proposed method leads to improved computational efficiency, and achieves a good trade-off between CE performance and complexity.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the performance of a $K$ -user rate splitting (RS) assisted terahertz (THz) wireless communication transmission systems with additive transceiver hardware distortions (ATHD). Among them, the THz link is affected by three factors including high path loss, fading effect, and pointing errors. Exact expressions of the probability density function (PDF) and the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) for each user are derived. Using these statistical expressions, precise analytical expressions for average rate (AR), outage probability (OP), and average bit error rate (BER) can be obtained. By comparing the simulation results with the numerical calculations, the precision of the theoretical framework is verified. Additionally, asymptotic analysis is performed and diversity gains are obtained for further insights. According to these performance indicators, the communication system&#39;s performance is evaluated and finally the validation results are plotted. The results show that pointing errors and ATHD have a great impact on system performance, and the RS scheme can improve the performance of THz wireless transmission systems.},

To achieve covert transmission in the NOMA network, in the proposed scheme, the IRS switches between the IRS and IOS mechanisms to create uncertainty. To analyze the performance of this scheme, we first characterize the statistical properties of the users&#39; cascaded channels. Then, we derive the closed-form expressions of the expectation of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and the average block error rates (BLERs) of NOMA users. To balance covertness and reliability, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the effective covert throughput (ECT) subject to the reliability and delay constraints and the level of covertness. Via this optimization, we then obtain closed-form expressions for optimal power and blocklength. Simulation results demonstrate that the ECT of the proposed scheme is much higher than that of benchmarks.},

In order to improve the reliability of the investigated network, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the maximum error probability (EP) among all INs by jointly optimizing the transmit power (TP) of the dedicated energy source (ES), the short-packet blocklength and power reflection coefficient (PRC) at each IN. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer non-linear programming problem. To tackle it, we first derive the close-form expressions for both the optimal TP at the ES and the optimal PRC at each IN, resulting in two subproblems where the optimal TP and PRC are utilized. Then the optimal solution to the original problem (OP) corresponds to that of the subproblem with the lower EP at the worst IN. After replacing integer variables with continuous ones, the convexities of the two subproblems are demonstrated. Consequently, the solution to the OP can be achieved by addressing the two subproblems via convex tools and utilizing an integer conversion method. Simulation results show the superiority of the proposed scheme in terms of the EP by comparing with several benchmark schemes.},

However, it is difficult to further scale up the phased array to provide high data rate communication. The reconfigurable holographic surface (RHS) with continuous or quasi-continuous aperture is a promising alternative to phased array for satellite communications. Unlike the amplitude ratio controlled RHS, the amplitude-controlled RHS is firstly modelled in the satellite broadcasting system. To reduce the computational complexity of the RHS sum rate maximization problem, the unrolled gradient projection (GP) method is proposed. The simulation results show that the RHS scheme has larger sum rate than the phased array method, and the unrolled GP method for RHS is faster than the phased array method.},

In each transmission, BS transmits the information to R, while one selected tag also conveys its own information to R by modulating and backscattering the BS&#39;s signals simultaneously. The communications from BS to R and tags to R are called as the cellular and backscatter communication (BackCom) transmissions, respectively. To describe the randomness of the position and number of the tags, the homogeneous Poisson point process is used. Besides, the consumed power by tags is considered and the optimal dynamic reflection coefficient is adopted. To achieve the tag access, the random selection access (RSA) scheme and selection diversity access (SDA) scheme are proposed and the corresponding outage performances are analyzed for both the cellular and BackCom transmissions. Numerical results show that the SDA scheme has a significantly superior outage performance compared to the RSA one at the cost of a higher system overhead. If neglecting the randomness of the number and position of tags, the obtained results will obviously deviate the practical performance. Moreover, the performance of the fixed RC scheme is much lower than that of the optimal dynamic RC.},

Each serving cell, which is managed by a distinct service provider, is designed individually due to the orthogonal frequencies. However, when a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is deployed for a certain cell, the RIS still incurs reflective channels for the overall system since the RIS reflects signals across all frequency ranges. This may cause severe undesired performance degradation for the other cells unless the reflection coefficients are properly designed. To tackle this issue, by utilizing the Riemannian manifold optimization method, an RIS reflection coefficients design is proposed in this paper to maximize the performance improvements of the cell that deploys the RIS while minimizing the undesired performance degradation for the other cells simultaneously. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed design can effectively balance the two objectives for practical scenarios.},

To support the NOMA-empowered ISAC system efficiently, a beamforming-based cross-layer scheduling scheme is designed, which exploits the traffic dynamics information at the network layer and channel state information at the physical layer. Under the cross-layer scheduling scheme, an efficient joint beamforming, power allocation, and rate adaptation strategy is obtained via a developed Newton&#39;s method-based algorithm and the linear programming formulation. With the aid of the proposed strategy, the average delay in the communication task can be minimized while assuring sensing capability. Besides, an optimal tradeoff between the average delay and the average transmission power in the NOMA-empowered ISAC system is uncovered, which is further demonstrated by extensive numerical results.},

Except for the large-scale fading, the small-scale fading, allocated power from APs and inter-user interference are considered as important criteria for AP selection in this paper. Rather than the conventional FL method with predetermined fuzzy membership function, in the proposed adaptive FL scheme, the thresholds are adjusted adaptively according to the change of criteria&#39;s numerical ranges, which is more robust to the changing network environment. The proposed method considers the time-variation of the channel in each coherence block and remains system scalability in signal processing for data transmission and power control. This method also focuses on the AP clusters association by choosing the power and inter-user interference as criteria in FL, to avoid redundant connection and reduce interference between UEs. To achieve scalability in channel estimation, an initial association algorithm with switching scheme is proposed, making an attractive balance between UE fairness and limited AP processing capabilities. Simulation verifies that the adaptive FL based AP selection scheme outperforms other existing algorithms in terms of UE fairness, spectral efficiency and energy efficiency.},

The surge in the number of base station (BS) antennas has introduced new characteristics such as spatial non-stationarity in the wireless channel, which means users at different locations probably ‘see’ different parts of the BS antenna array, namely their visible regions (VRs). The concept of VR has been widely employed to simplify the design of XL-MIMO transmission. However, the VR information has yet to be utilized in the design of non-orthogonal pilots. Therefore, we aim to leverage the VR information to reduce the pilot overhead. To this end, we first establish the relationship between the VRs of users and the spatial correlation of the corresponding channel. Subsequently, we formulate the non-orthogonal pilot scheduling problem for XL-MIMO systems with spatial non-stationarity. Assuming knowledge of all users&#39; VRs, we propose a graph-based non-orthogonal pilot design approach called the two-stage graph partitioning (TSGP), which jointly exploits the VR and angle domain information. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed TSGP algorithm can effectively reduce the pilot overhead without compromising sum rate performance compared to the conventional orthogonal training approach.},

In order to get full advantages of IDET technology in future communication networks and realize efficient beamforming design, the base station (BS) must obtain accurate downlink channel state information (CSI). In this work, we propose an energy harvesting (EH) aided channel estimation scheme using a novel deep learning (DL) architecture in an end-to-end training mode. This architecture simultaneously obtains CSI from both an energy harvester and a data decoder at an IDET receiver. By designing a hypernetwork-aided deep neural network (DNN), we achieve more accurate channel estimation, while effectively reducing the pilot overhead in channel estimation.

To regress the model, those PLEs are extracted via measurement and the region map. We also verify the model in two suburban areas and compare with the 3GPP path loss model and the Alpha-Beta-Gamma (ABG) model.

In this work, integrating the concept of spatial crowdsourcing (SC), we develop an SC-based MDC network model and investigate the task allocation problem for UAV-assisted MDC. In variable maritime service scenarios, tasks are allocated to UAVs based on the spatial and temporal requirements of the tasks, as well as the mobility of the UAVs. To address this problem, we design an SC-based task allocation algorithm for the MDC (SC-MDC-TA). The quality estimation is utilized to assess and regulate task execution quality by evaluating signal to interference plus noise ratio and the UAV energy consumption. The reverse auction is employed to potentially reduce the task waiting time as much as possible while ensuring timely completion. Additionally, we establish typical task allocation scenarios based on maritime service requirements indicated by electronic navigational charts. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SC-MDC-TA algorithm effectively allocates tasks for various MDC scenarios. Furthermore, compared to the benchmark, the SC-MDC-TA algorithm can also reduce the task completion time and lower the UAV energy consumption.},

  abstract     = {Satellite edge computing (SEC) has emerged as an innovative paradigm for future satellite-terrestrial integrated networks (STINs), expanding computation services by sinking computing capabilities into Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) satellites. However, the mobility of LEO satellites poses two key challenges to SEC: 1) constrained onboard computing and transmission capabilities caused by limited and dynamic energy supply, and 2) stochastic task arrivals within the satellites&#39; coverage and time-varying channel conditions. To tackle these issues, it is imperative to design an optimal SEC offloading strategy that effectively exploits the available energy of LEO satellites to fulfill competing task demands for SEC. In this paper, we propose a dynamic offloading strategy (DOS) with the aim to minimize the overall completion time of arriving tasks in an SEC-assisted STIN, subject to the long-term energy constraints of the LEO satellite. Leveraging Lyapunov optimization theory, we first convert the original long-term stochastic problem into multiple deterministic one-slot problems parameterized by current system states. Then we use sub-problem decomposition to jointly optimize the task offloading, computing, and communication resource allocation strategies. We theoretically prove that DOS achieves near-optimal performance. Numerical results demonstrate that DOS significantly outperforms the other four baseline approaches in terms of task completion time and dropping rate.},

  abstract     = {Due to the limited battery capacity and computational power of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, emerging IoT applications depend on mobile edge computing (MEC) networks for computational offloading and wireless power transfer (WPT) to sustain energy levels, with transfer performance influenced by the propagation environment and transmission strategies. Compared to the traditional reflecting-only reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), simultaneously transmitting and reflecting (STAR)-RIS extends coverage from half-space to full-space, significantly enhancing transferring efficiency. This paper compares the performance of three different uplink transmission schemes on a STAR-RIS WPT MEC network. On this basis, for each scenario, a non-convex optimization problem is formulated to maximize the total computational bits for the system, where energy transfer, local processing, uplink transmission allocated resources, and phase shift vectors of STAR-RIS are jointly optimized. To address the non-convexity, each scenario is decoupled into two main subproblems: phase shift vectors of STAR-RIS optimization and joint power, time, and computing frequency optimization. While a closed-form expression is derived to optimize the phase shift vector of STAR-RIS in time division multiple access (TDMA), semi-definite relaxation is employed to optimize the phase shift vectors under Hybrid TDMA-non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and NOMA. Furthermore, block coordinate descent is employed to address the remaining resources. Simulation results indicate the superiority of the proposed scheme for all scenarios in terms of total computational bits compared to benchmark schemes. Moreover, among the three uplink transmission schemes, TDMA performs the best in total computational bits and user fairness owing to its ability to flexibly adapt STAR-RIS phase shift vectors.},

To enhance flexibility, we introduce a smart dynamic task partitioning and cooperative offloading/delivery mechanism, enabling users to offload task partitions to various MEC servers. Uncertainties stemming from users&#39; high mobility and traffic variations may lead to unpredictable task offloading demands and Imperfect Channel State Information (I-CSI), potentially causing unsuccessful task offloading/delivery. In response, we propose a robust and cooperative two-time-scale task offloading/delivery approach, adept at handling demand uncertainty and I-CSI. The problem formulation involves a two-time scale Markov decision process, aimed at minimizing task offloading/delivery costs while maximizing task completion rates. Large time-scale slots incorporate intelligent RSU activation/deactivation, while short time-scale slots focus on task offloading/delivery. To efficiently implement this framework, we propose Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) algorithm based on Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG); namely Low overhead Multi-Agent DDPG (LoMADDPG) where at each slot, all agents tune their Actor and Critic neural network weights with the help of Global Software-defined Networking (SDN) Controller (GSC) which acts as a global weight tuner.

Artificial intelligence and machine learning are regarded as key enablers thanks to the massive amount of data that smart vehicles will collect from onboard sensors. Federated learning is one of the most promising techniques for training global machine learning models while preserving data privacy of vehicles and optimizing communications resource usage. In this article, we propose vehicular radio environment map federated learning (VREM-FL), a computation-scheduling co-design for vehicular federated learning that combines mobility of vehicles with 5G radio environment maps. VREM-FL jointly optimizes learning performance of the global model and wisely allocates communication and computation resources. This is achieved by orchestrating local computations at the vehicles in conjunction with transmission of their local models in an adaptive and predictive fashion, by exploiting radio channel maps. The proposed algorithm can be tuned to trade training time for radio resource usage. Experimental results demonstrate that VREM-FL outperforms literature benchmarks for both a linear regression model (learning time reduced by 28%) and a deep neural network for semantic image segmentation (doubling the number of model updates within the same time window).},

As a new network paradigm, Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) can offer an environment for information technology service and extend cloud computing capability to the edge of mobile communication network. So communication data can be timely processed near the source to effectively solve the limitation of on-board resources. In this paper, we consider the heterogeneous characteristics of services and different requirements of tasks in urban rail transit system, and a MEC system architecture based on task classification is designed. To effectively utilize communication and computing resources, a resource allocation strategy based on Task Classification Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient (TC-TD3) algorithm is proposed, which includes communication and computing resources allocation. In addition, to address the offloading selection issue of multi-MEC servers, a task offloading algorithm based on balancing tasks priority of MEC is designed. In the system model, considering the random arrival time of tasks and the dynamic resource allocation at each time slot, we propose a dynamic task execution model which is more suitable for the urban rail transit system.

  abstract     = {Long-range (LoRa) communication technology, distinguished by its low power consumption and long communication range, is widely used in the Internet of Things. However, the LoRa MAC layer adopts pure ALOHA for medium access control, which may lead to severe packet collisions as the network scale expands, consequently reducing the system energy efficiency (EE). To address this issue, it is critical to carefully allocate transmission parameters such as the channel (CH), transmission power (TP) and spreading factor (SF) to each end device (ED). Owing to the low duty cycle and sporadic traffic of LoRa networks, evaluating the system EE under various parameter settings proves to be time-consuming. Therefore, we propose an analytical model to calculate the system EE while fully considering the impacts of multiple gateways, duty cycling, quasi-orthogonal SFs and capture effects. On this basis, we investigate a joint CH, SF and TP allocation problem with the objective of optimizing the system EE for uplink transmissions. Due to the NP-hard complexity of this optimization problem, it is decomposed into two subproblems: CH assignment and SF/TP assignment. First, a matching-based algorithm is introduced to address the CH assignment subproblem. Then, an attention-based multiagent reinforcement learning technique is employed to address the SF/TP assignment subproblem for EDs allocated to the same CH, which reduces the number of learning agents to achieve fast convergence. The simulation outcomes indicate that the proposed approach converges quickly under various parameter settings and obtains significantly better system EE than the baseline algorithms.},

A major challenge of LiFi is that its coverage is relatively limited, as the surrounding walls, objects, and other surfaces mostly absorb visible light. Thus, a number of studies have proposed aggregating the bandwidth of WiFi and LiFi to serve all users within a room. However, complementing LiFi with WiFi via bandwidth aggregation typically comes with an overhead in terms of both aggregation and computation, which reduces the data rates that can be used. Furthermore, data provided to users are often also limited by the backhaul capacity, which is typically wired Ethernet in indoor settings. In this work, we model the utilization of the functioning of WiFi and LiFi access points as a two-dimensional flow graph and show that the problem of maximizing the sum of data rate across all users is NP-Hard in practice. We then design an algorithm FLADA to solve this problem by solving its relaxed version where the variables are treated as real numbers, and then rounding to the nearest integer. We prove formally that it provides a solution that is at least $0.5\times$ the optimal. We further compare it with a greedy baseline approach through extensive simulations and show that it outperforms it by up to 81.6%.},

In a dynamic wireless network, drones often share data with multiple users, which is vulnerable to various security threats, e.g., eavesdropping, privacy leakage, and impersonation. Ensuring secure sharing of drone operation data is a critical issue. Existing schemes employ blockchain to ensure accountability in untrusted IoD contexts. However, drones perform excessive operations, e.g., consensus and homomorphic encryption, leading to impractical drone computation overhead. Furthermore, these existing schemes perform point-to-multipoint (P2MP) data sharing by using identity-based broadcast encryption (IBBE) as it has stateless receiver property, i.e., drones can directly establish sharing groups based on the receiver identities. However, these IBBE-based schemes need to preset the sharing group capacity, reducing sharing efficiency and flexibility in dynamic IoD networks. Also, identities in sharing groups probably result in receiver privacy breaches. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-assisted data-sharing scheme with accountability and privacy-preserving for IoD networks. We utilize on-chain immutable smart contracts and short signatures to construct a lightweight accountability mechanism that can verify and punish the above misbehavior. We develop an efficient privacy-preserving IBBE algorithm for P2MP sharing of drone operation data that enables dynamic group sharing. We prove that our algorithm is secure and receiver anonymity against chosen ciphertext attacks. The experiment results show that our scheme outperforms existing schemes in computational and communication overhead. In real-world logistics scenarios, the wireless data rate of 50Mbps can satisfy the communication requirements for ciphertext lengths up to 19.5KB. For a sharing group of 60 receivers, drone encryption costs only about 101 ms. The decryption cost remains constant and takes about 3.1 ms.},

  abstract     = {Conventional optimization methods have been presented to solve the cooperative target tracking problem of radars without considering the task preference and the resource cost of the individual radar simultaneously, thus leading to robustness deficiency and performance degradation in dynamic jamming environments. To address this problem, the cooperative task assignment and power allocation problem of netted radars for maneuvering target tracking in self-defensive suppressive jamming is characterized as a decision-making and control process of multiple autonomous agents, and the multiagent cooperative tracking and control framework is therefore developed constituting with state prediction, coalition formation, power allocation, and state estimation. To characterize the preferences of radars for tracking decision, the utility function consisting of the reward function under the quality of service framework and the cost function with considering system resources is devised. Then, the hierarchical coalition game is formulated to describe the cooperative task assignment and power allocation process of radars, and the existence of the stable coalition partition of the game is proven. Based on the developed game model, the alternating coalition formation and projection gradient (ACFPG) algorithm is proposed leveraging the interacting multiple model filter for maneuvering target tracking. Numerical simulations are performed to illustrate the superiorities of the proposed strategy against some counterparts in terms of tracking utility and resource reduction.},

  abstract     = {Electric vehicles (EVs) bring convenience to public transport while having the potential to increase energy efficiency. With the rapid growth of the number of EVs, cross-domain charging will become a strong demand. Despite massive research on EV charging, existing schemes can hardly meet the security requirements of privacy protection and access control for cross-domain scenarios. Meanwhile, centralized methods bring the single point of failure and data modification. The problem of designing a secure cross-domain EV charging scheme to simultaneously ensure decentralization, privacy and access control has not been studied and remains open. Therefore, in this paper, we design BlockPPA, the first blockchain-assisted privacy-preserving authentication scheme for cross-domain EV charging in order to achieve this purpose. Our scheme makes each EV obtain an attribute-based secret key, which is used to authenticate itself and also anonymously illustrate that it really satisfies a designated access policy when cross-domain authentication happens. Only authorized EVs satisfying the policy do they have the ability to charge. We design three smart contracts and exploit Fabric blockchain to record the domain&#39;s detailed information and the authentication record of each cross-domain access from an EV, while achieving the decentralized verification of an authentication request. The results of security and performance analysis show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed cross-domain authentication mechanism.},

  abstract     = {LEO satellite networks provide global users with satellite internet services, yet the risk of cascading failures severely threatens the reliable operation of the network. Failures rapidly propagate from congested and overloaded satellites to normal satellites, causing the network to be trapped in a vicious cycle of periodic failures, unable to return to a stable state capable of providing regular services. Existing routing schemes focus on optimizing network performance under normal conditions, paying little attention to fault tolerance mechanisms after satellite failures, or the mechanisms are too simplistic to handle large-scale cascading scenarios of satellite failures, ultimately leading to rapid failure propagation or even complete network paralysis. To address these issues, this paper proposes a distributed anti-cascading routing scheme based on fuzzy logic, aimed at promptly initiating takeover routing after the network triggers cascading failures, preventing further failure propagation, and restoring the network to stable operation. A strategy for collecting and sharing information of two-hop neighboring satellites is introduced, and a routing decision method based on fuzzy logic is constructed, five main update steps for the membership functions based on a detailed analysis of cascading scenarios. Satellites can make routing decisions to reduce the risk of cascading based on two-hop neighbor information. Compared with six routing schemes under a case constellation, simulation results show that the proposed scheme can ensure stable recovery within 35% satellite failure.

This can extend GTs&#39; computing capability and save their energy cost. However, to enhance the energy efficiency of UAV propulsion, ensure successful completion of each GT&#39;s mission, and maintain a stable UAV-GT uplinks, it is crucial to design a rational UAV 3D trajectory and mission offloading strategy. To address this joint problem, We further build a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based framework in the UAV-enabled MEC system, which applies Double Deep Q-learning (D-DQN) and convex optimization techniques to jointly work out the near-optimal UAV 3D-trajectory and task offloading strategy among GTs in an online manner. With the proposed framework, the UAV-enabled MEC system can finish each GT task quickly and save the UAV mission time and propulsion energy effectively. Numerical results show that the DLR-based framework outperforms the benchmark solutions, e.g., In scenario 1, the throughput, the average data transferring rate through UAV-GT links, and the average energy efficiency of UAV compared to DQN are improved from 64.24Kb to 72.99Kb, 4.72Kbps to 20.75Kbps, 0.32bits/J to 0.36bits/J, respectively, and almost the same as the existing Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) solution, making the energy efficient edge computing truly viable in UAV-enabled MEC system.},

Although previous research has made many efforts in this area, they have struggled to serve the scenario containing multiple heterogeneous task requests. This challenge is further exacerbated when the number of terminal devices increases and multiple edge servers are required to collaborate to handle task requests. To this end, this paper proposes a fine-grained Collaborative DNN Model Selection scheme for heterogeneous edge computing systems (CoMS), aiming to promote cooperation between edge servers and achieve more effective model selection. Specifically, we first design a reinforcement learning scheme with real-time dynamic normalization strategy, aiming to accelerate model convergence and improve the efficiency of model selection. Next, we introduce a model selection strategy based on greedy algorithm and an efficient fine-grained collaborative model selection strategy respectively to promote cooperation between edge servers, thereby further achieving a balance between inference accuracy and overhead. Extensive experimental results show that compared with baselines, our CoMS reduces the average trade-off overhead by 4.2% to 12.8% and improves the success ratio by 3% to 16%.},

  abstract     = {Radio tomographic Imaging (RTI) provides high-precision localization of targets in a monitoring area by exploiting the relationship between target location and radio link attenuation. Most recent RTI approaches leverage pre-processing and data-driven strategies to improve the accuracy of moving targets. However, these approaches suffer from limitations such as training time and low frame rate, which constrain RTI to quickly and accurately localize the moving target. To address these limitations, we develop a coarse-to-fine RTI (CF-RTI) system that achieves a maximum frame rate of 29 frames per second (fps), surpassing the minimum requirement of 16 fps for a typical RGB camera while maintaining remarkable accuracy and resolution. First, CF-RTI enables high frame rate imaging by constructing a visual fingerprint database that establishes connections between target locations and potentially affected links, thereby enabling multi-step acquisition, reconstruction, and estimation. Second, the multi-step processing exploits the knowledge gained from localization efforts during acquisition processing, enabling high-quality imaging by rapidly identifying and collecting measurements from the target&#39;s affected links. Finally, the experimental results show that our CF-RTI can achieve centimeter-level positioning accuracy and a maximum frame rate of 29 fps while using only 9% of the traditional RTI measurements. The maximum frame rate of our CF-RTI is comparable to that of standard RGB cameras. These results suggest that our CF-RTI has excellent potential for implementing RTI techniques in real-world scenarios.},

To circumvent this drawback, this paper devises a novel non-circular signal detection scheme within the framework of generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) by employing the non-circular characteristic of primary signals. The proposed method is able to leverage the exhaustive second-order statistical information of NC signals by taking into account both the standard covariance and complementary covariance. Performance merits in terms of false alarm probability (FAP) and detection probability (DP) are analyzed in the exact and approximate manners. Specifically, the exact distribution of proposed statistic under null hypothesis is derived with the support of Mellin transform, leading to a closed-form expression for the probability of false alarm. The Wilks&#39; theorem is then used to approximately compute the FAP in the large-sample regime. Moreover, a computationally efficient and high-precision approximation for the FAP is provided via the method of Beta-based moment matching. Detection probability (DP) is also obtained by employing the moment-matching method once more. Extensive numerical examples are included to corroborate our theoretical calculations and demonstrate the superiority of our proposed NC-ST method over other state-of-the-art detectors.},

The objective is to maximize the overall spectral efficiency of users located in severely blocked dead zones, where there is no direct link between the base station (BS) and the users and, the ARIS acts as a relay to facilitate communication. To achieve this, we formulate a sum-rate maximization problem considering the joint design of active beamforming at the BS, passive beamforming at the ARIS, and determination of the ARIS height. The constraints include given packet size and packet error probability (PEP) requirements. Since the original problem is non-convex, we propose an alternating optimization framework to solve it. The framework involves solving sub-problems of beamforming design and ARIS location alternately. The beamforming design sub-problem is addressed using successive convex approximation, while the ARIS location sub-problem is solved using a particle-swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The proposed solution demonstrates fast convergence within a few iterations, as validated through numerical simulations. Additionally, a computational complexity analysis is performed. The results show that the proposed RSMA scheme for the ARIS-aided DL URLLC system surpasses conventional multiple access schemes in terms of rate performance. The findings highlight the potential of utilizing ARIS and RSMA to enhance the spectral efficiency and meet the requirements of URLLC applications.},

This study leverages the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture&#39;s flexibility and programmability to introduce a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) strategy for QoS-aware intra-slice resource allocation. By employing intelligent agents and a Deep Q-Network (DQN)-based framework, our approach precisely tailors resource distribution within O-RAN, optimizing for enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) slices.

A streamlined algorithm effectively reduces computational complexity, ensuring robust performance under resource constraints. Simulation results underscore the algorithm&#39;s ability to substantially enhance 5G network slice performance, offering a parameterized solution for user association in O-RAN networks using DRL.

  abstract     = {Autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV)-aided short-packet transmissions have emerged as a promising paradigm for supporting mission-critical applications in future mobile communication networks. However, the security issues raised by the open nature of the wireless transmission deserve attention, especially when confronted with cooperative wardens and eavesdroppers. To this end, we consider a new framework for an energy-efficient design of AAV-aided short-packet transmission systems against cooperative hostile detection and eavesdropping attacks. Specifically, the false rate of the cooperative hostile detection is first derived by utilizing the likelihood ratio test and the bivariate Gaussian distribution property. Then, we formulate a problem to maximize the minimum covert secrecy energy efficiency (MCSEE) by jointly optimizing the user association, AAV power control, and AAV three-dimensional (3D) trajectory design. We propose a penalty-based dual-loop iterative optimization algorithm to tackle this complex problem suboptimally with the aid of auxiliary penalty variables, where the communication resource scheduling, the AAV trajectory planning, and the auxiliary penalty variables are optimized in the inner loop. In particular, the intractable joint AAV power control and 3D trajectory design sub-problem is suboptimally addressed by introducing slack variables and employing successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. The penalty factor is updated in the outer loop. Finally, numerical results are provided to verify the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed solution to several benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {The space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) greatly improves coverage and reliability for millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication in high-speed railway (HSR) scenarios. However, a significant challenge arises in the transmission scheduling due to the rapid changes in channel state, link selection for train mobile relays (MRs), and order of the flow scheduling. To tackle this challenge, we introduce an optimization problem focused on maximizing the weighted sum completed flows that satisfy the quality of service (QoS) requirements for HSR mmWave communication in SAGIN. To facilitate the simultaneous scheduling of flows by base station-MR (BS-MR), satellite-airship-MR, and satellite-MR links, we propose a link selection algorithm, which can help each flow choose a suitable set of links in every frame and determine whether the BS networks need the assistance of the satellite and airship. Furthermore, taking into account the priority and occupied time slots (TSs) resource of different flows, we propose a multi-link weighted flow scheduling (MWFS) algorithm. This algorithm not only prioritizes scheduling high-priority flows but also aims to maximize the weighted sum completed flows for MRs. Our simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithm significantly increases the weighted sum completed flows and the total transmitted bits. Additionally, the proposed algorithm can achieve the optimal flow transmission in different link switching periods and enhance the scheduling of high-priority flows compared to other algorithms.},

Although cognitive radio (CR) technology has been widely studied in 5G communications, its influence on connectivity, particularly in CVNs, has been seldom discussed. In this paper, probability theory is adopted to deduce the connectivity probabilities of CVNs by analyzing the cognitive and communication characteristics of CVs, so as to unveil the correlations between network connectivity and the channel environment together with road traffic factors. In particular, to demonstrate the impact of cognitive and vehicular capacity on connectivity performance, two traffic scenarios with different vehicular transmission coverages and relay behaviors are discussed. Simulation results present the variation of connectivity probabilities with different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), coverage ranges of both RSUs and CVs, and the densities of CVs. It can be found that the improvement of channel environment leads to better network connectivity, thus demonstrating the significant impact of cognitive activities on the connectivity of CVNs.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a non-uniform pilot pattern based on the cyclic difference set (CDS) for sparse channel estimation in multiple-input-multiple-output orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems. The CDS-based pilot patterns can effectively enhance the performance of sparse channel estimation by applying compressed sensing (CS) techniques. However, the existing CDS pilot patterns are limited to single-input-single-output orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (SISO-OFDM) systems. In MIMO-OFDM systems, as the required number of CDS increases, there will be a growing number of intersecting (overlapping) elements among different CDSs (antennas), thus introducing significant interference among different antennas. To tackle this problem, a special CDS property called identical multi-set intersection (IMI) property is disclosed which can significantly reduce the inter-antenna interference. In addition, two constructions of desired CDS collection $\bf D_{I}$ having such IMI property are presented. To further eliminate the residual interference due to the remaining intersecting elements, i.e. the exact $\lambda$ overlapping positions among all antennas, two pilot placement algorithms, i.e., zero setting (ZS) and partial orthogonal cover coding (POCC), are proposed to achieve orthogonal pilot patterns in frequency. Our simulation results show that our proposed MIMO non-uniform IMI CDS pilot patterns exhibit superior estimation accuracy, closely approaching that of SISO systems. Furthermore, our MSE simulation results also show that, under the same condition, the proposed IMI CDS pilot scheme significantly outperforms the 3GPP 5G NR MIMO-OFDM pilot schemes, offering better estimation performance while maintaining much lower generating complexity compared with other existing multi-antenna pilot schemes.},

Firstly, a deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm is designed to ensure communication reliability by dynamically allocating wireless channels and transmitting power to vehicles based on their geographic positions.

However, the major drawback is the significant expense required to deploy and maintain numerous infrastructure sites and connect them to a central processing unit (CPU) for baseband processing. This paper proposes utilizing CF-M-MIMO processing atop existing micro/macrocellular deployments in current 5G networks. It suggests connecting all base stations (BSs) to a CPU via fronthaul links to enable joint processing of user equipment (UE) without the costly deployment of many scattered access points (APs). By jointly managing all transmit/receive points (TRPs) in the network, a novel switch on/off strategy is derived to maximize energy efficiency by exploiting the sleep mode capabilities of current baseband/RF hardware, adapting to changes in UE behavior and operator requirements. Additionally, the paper considers multiantenna user terminals, common in current 5G setups, and proposes a technique to manage the number of streams directed to each UE, balancing multiplexing gains and increased pilot contamination.},

This paper presents a three-tier system for edge caching, integrating massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) networks. We consider a scenario with an extensive file library whose size is larger than the aggregated caching capacity of the small base stations (SBSs). Each SBS proactively caches files based on dynamic file popularity that is unknown in advance. A distinguishing aspect of our model is its file-wise approach to the cache instead of the conventional vector-wise methods based on aggregate popularity. This approach introduces additional computational challenges concerning the extensive file library. We formulated the optimization problem to maximize the long-term discounted cache hit rate while minimizing the delivery delay. For the solution, two multi-agent federated $Q$-learning algorithms are proposed. The first algorithm employs selective updates of the $Q$-values of popular files to minimize computational overhead. The second algorithm incorporates linear function approximation (LFA) and tensor completion (TC) to streamline the updating process further, reducing the required parameter number. Through the real-world MovieLens dataset and compared with various baseline algorithms, simulations demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can reduce the delay by around 2.60--21.29%, improve the cache hit rate by around 5.71--66.42%, and reduce the computational complexity by at most 97.91%.},

In this paper, we investigate a RIS-aided joint L&amp;C system, where the localization and data transmission functions are integrated in a time-division pattern. Specifically, we aim to jointly optimize the covariance matrices of the localization signal and the communication signal, the RIS beamforming matrix and the time division ratio to simultaneously improve the localization and communication performance. An alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is proposed via jointly leveraging the successive convex approximation technique, the semidefinite relaxation method and the projected gradient descent with momentum algorithm, based on which we strike a compelling trade-off between the localization and communication performance. Considering the high computational cost in the large-scale array scenario, we also develop a low-complexity algorithm free of iterations. To analyze the optimality of our proposed AO algorithm, we further consider the special single-user line-of-sight (LoS) scenario and validate that our AO algorithm could achieve the beam alignment, implying its effectiveness.

Specifically, by exploiting the correlation of angle information during multiple consecutive channel coherence blocks, we estimate the full channel state information in the first coherence block (FCB) and only update the gain information in each subsequent block. Then, based on the ambiguity property, a low-pilot-overhead two-stage method is adopted in the FCB. In Stage 1, all users jointly transmit pilot to estimate the angles of arrival at the BS and the correlation factors between different paths of the common BS-RIS channel via introducing a set of matching matrices and a designed RIS phase shift matrix, which achieves a significant MU diversity gain. By exploiting the mmWave cascaded channels&#39; ambiguity property, an ambiguous common BS-RIS channel is constructed with the estimated correlation factors. In Stage 2, each user independently transmits a limited number of pilots to estimate their individual ambiguous RIS-user channel, leading to a comprehensive cascaded channel estimation. For the remaining blocks, we adopt a straightforward least-squares method for rapid gain estimation. Simulation results confirm the method&#39;s effectiveness in providing accurate estimation with reduced pilot overhead, outperforming existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) techniques are capable of boosting the throughput of next 6G networks. However, due to the large number of antennas in the wideband XL-MIMO systems, they suffer from the so-called near-field beam split effect, where beams at different frequencies are focused on different locations. This effect imposes a severe performance loss on near-field channel estimation. To address this issue, in this paper, we investigate the wideband near-field channel covariance estimation problem of XL-MIMO systems. Explicitly, we first propose a sophisticated polar-domain dictionary for the wideband near-field channel at different frequencies. Specifically, the proposed polar-domain dictionary consists of several sub-matrices. For each sub-matrix, the angle is sampled from a unique range while the distance is sampled from the same range. Meanwhile, considering the beam split effect, we construct the corresponding dictionaries for different frequencies that can beneficially adjust the grid of the sampled angles and distances. Then we propose an algorithm termed as the correlation coefficient sparsity adaptive matching pursuit relying on parameter refinement (CCSAMP-PR) to reconstruct the near-field channel without any prior knowledge of the channel sparsity. More explicitly, an iterative parameter refinement step is conceived for gradually refining the angles and distances per iteration. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is capable of adaptively adjusting its step size for ensuring rapid convergence. Finally, numerical results are provided for demonstrating that both our proposed polar-domain dictionary and CCSAMP-PR algorithm outperform the family of existing schemes.},

  abstract     = {Mixed-numerology transmission is a flexible physical layer waveform technology to support different service. The coexistence of different numerologies causes inter-numerology interference (INI) and deteriorates the system performance. In uplink transmission, the detection of mixed-numerology signal is based on Least common multiple (LCM) symbols to ensure the integrity of symbol sampling for each numerology. However, the LCM symbol-based detection increases the latency for delay sensitive services, which adopt numerologies with short symbols. In this paper, we propose an active INI cancellation (A-INIC) algorithm at the transmitter and a soft iterative INI cancellation (soft I-INIC) algorithm at receiver for uplink mixed-numerology transmission. Based on the proposed algorithms, we construct an A-INIC transceiver which can pre-cancel the INI with multi-path fading channel. In the transmitter, the A-INIC module actively compensate for the INI generated by the user itself to adjacent subbands as well as the corresponding secondary INI in target subband, which facilitate symbol-based detection at receiver for latency reduction. In the receiver, a soft I-INIC module is applied to cancel the residual INI when the feedback channel state information (CSI) for INI pre-compensation is imperfect. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms in block error ratio (BLER) performance even without any guard subcarrier.},

  abstract     = {Orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) modulation is fast becoming a popular modulation scheme for high-mobility wireless communication due to its ability to render time-varying channels invariant and sparse. However, due to the limited time duration and frequency bandwidth of the transmitted OTFS signal, the occurrence of fractional delay and Doppler shifts becomes inevitable, causing both inter-delay interference (IDeI) and inter-Doppler interference (IDI). In this paper, an impulse-based channel estimation method is used, which takes advantage of the fact that the pilot impulse is a pulse tone (pulsone). A pulsone maintains its shape despite time delay and Doppler shift operations, as well as being self-dual between time and frequency domains. Exploiting these two features, a low-complexity algorithm is proposed to estimate the fractional delay and fractional Doppler channel. We derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the estimated fractional channel and show that the developed estimator is efficient. Then, we provide the computational complexity analysis of the proposed algorithm. After that, we show and stress that the proposed channel estimation scheme is better in terms of the channel normalized mean squared error (NMSE) and the bit-error rate (BER). Lastly, the simulation results are confirmed via real experimental results.},

  abstract     = {Cognitive electronic warfare (CEW) has received increasing attention, and it is widely recognized that it will play a significant role. Cognitive jamming decision-making, as one of the critical technologies of CEW, dramatically impacts the global battlefield situation. In this paper, we introduce the A2C algorithm into cognitive jamming decision-making and propose a heuristic improved A2C algorithm. As a fusion algorithm of DQN and Policy Gradient, on the one hand, the Actor-Critic algorithm has the advantages of iterative updating of policies and high efficiency in complex spaces, compared to the DQN algorithm. On the other hand, compared with the Policy Gradient algorithm, it features fast convergence. But, it suffers from high variance, making convergence difficult. First, we establish a cognitive jamming decision-making model to address the above issues. Then, we develop an improved A2C algorithm by introducing a baseline and dueling networks. The baseline reduces the variance of the critic network, while dueling networks further decrease variance, enhancing the convergence of the A2C algorithm. Additionally, the improved A2C algorithm does not rely on prior information, and enhances the adaptive capability of the jammer when interacting with the target radar. We conducted numerical simulations based on the designed cognitive jamming decision-making model. The results demonstrated that compared with the four algorithms (DQN, Policy Gradient, Actor-Critic, A2C), the convergence speed of the improved A2C algorithm is improved by 50$\%$, 57.8$\%$, 34.5$\%$, and 13.64$\%$, respectively, and verified the excellent performance of the improved A2C. Finally, we introduce the heuristic reward function and propose the heuristic improved A2C algorithm. Compared with the improved A2C algorithm, the convergence speed of this algorithm is improved by 31.58$\%$. The simulation results prove that the algorithm can greatly improve our advantage in electronic countermeasures.},

As user nodes in vehicle networks, vehicles have high mobility, which leads to the highly complex and unstable topology of vehicle networks. Therefore, we propose a practical solution to solve the problem of advertising dissemination among Intelligent Networked Vehicles (INVs). In our strategy, advertisements are first sent to a group of selected seed INVs and then spread among INVs. To encourage INVs to disseminate advertising actively, we propose an incentive scheme that combines online and offline to maximize profit. We propose a dynamic seed INVs replacement algorithm using the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm to decide the update cycle of the seed INVs set. Simulation results show that the proposed strategy is superior to the existing methods in terms of delivery ratio of advertisement dissemination and expected profit of merchant.},

Motivated by the fact that switches are phase-independent and more power/cost efficient than PSs, we consider the switch-based HBF (SW-HBF) for wideband large-scale multiple-input multiple-output systems in this paper. We first derive a closed-form expression of the beam squint ratio unveiling that the severity of beam squint linearly increases with the number of antennas, the antenna spacing distance, and the fractional bandwidth. We then focus on the SW-HBF designs to maximize the spectral efficiency (SE) in both single-user (SU) and multiuser (MU) systems. The formulated problems in both cases exhibit intractable non-convex and mixed-integer challenges. To address them, for the SU case, by combining the tabu search (TS) method and projected gradient ascend (PGA), we propose an efficient heuristic PGA-TS algorithm to design analog beamformers while the digital ones admit closed-form solutions. For the MU case, we develop a two-step algorithm based on fractional programming and the PGA-TS method. Simulation results show that the proposed SW-HBF schemes are efficient and can outperform PS-based HBF architectures in terms of both SE and energy efficiency in wideband systems.},

In the delivery phase, we employ an access points cooperation based delivery scheme that maximizes the cooperative transmission capability among multiple F-APs. By integrating the placement and delivery schemes, we propose an access points cooperation based secretive coded caching scheme that minimize the sum rate. We further derive a closed-form expression for the worst-case sum rate and obtain an information theretic lower bound on the sum rate by using cut-set arguments. Our analysis reveals that the proposed scheme achieves the information theoretic lower bound within a factor that depends on the number of F-APs. Additionally, we analyze the decodability and secrecy aspects of the proposed coded caching scheme. Simulation results demonstrate that when the cache capacity of each F-AP is large, the performance of our proposed scheme approaches the theoretical optimum.},

To achieve these objectives, a low complexity and cost-efficient hybrid NOMA-OMA-based resource allocation mechanism is introduced which can enhance network connectivity without aggravating interference. The hybrid successive-interference-cancellation (SIC) decoding method is utilized to improve transmission robustness. Additionally, a novel hybrid SIC decoding approach is specifically designed when the transmitted signals experience the same fading effects over a common channel transmission mode, i.e. the link between the relay and the base station (BS). We show that the FD relay-assisted vehicular communication system suffers from an outage probability error floor. Hence a modified zero-forcing (ZF) criterion-based transmit beamformer is designed to enhance the transmission robustness and eliminate the residual self-interference (SI) caused by FD operation. Moreover, a truncated Gaussian distribution is considered to model vehicle mobility. In order to minimize the line-of-sight (LoS) link obstruction phenomenon, the optimal vehicle speed is derived. Further, the exact and asymptotic outage probability expressions are derived, based on which the analysis of diversity order is provided. To validate the accuracy of our analytical results, Monte-Carlo simulations are conducted. Our results reveal that the hybrid SIC-based decoding scheme for SGF NOMA transmission provides a superior outage performance compared to the conventional NOMA transmission with the conventional SIC-based decoding scheme. Additionally, combining the hybrid SIC decoding method with the relay beamforming approach can eliminate the outage probability error floor while guaranteeing the quality of service (QoS) for the primary vehicle in the uplink FD cooperative vehicular communication system.},

Using the explicit interference signal model with the standard MIMO-FMCW object signal model, we turn the interference mitigation into a spatial-domain object detection under incoherent MIMO-FMCW interference. By exploiting the structural property of the derived interference model at both transmit and receive steering vector space, we derive a detector via beamforming optimization to achieve good detection performance and further propose an adaptive version of this detector to enhance its practical applicability.

  abstract     = {Supporting massive access from Internet of Things (IoT) devices plays a pivotal role in the design of 6G networks. Nonetheless, concurrent massive access to the network deteriorates the quality of 6G communications. To overcome the challenge of massive access, our focus shifts to optimizing the age-critical frameless ALOHA (ACFA) random access protocol. The conventional ACFA suffers from high latency and unreliability when massive devices attempt to access the network. Consequently, we introduce an adaptive algorithm to address the transmission issues. This paper optimizes the random access channel (RACH) procedure by maximizing a long-term multi-objective function, which consists of the average age of information (AoI), normalized throughput, traffic load and the average number of successfully accessed machine-type communication devices. To achieve the optimal objective in ACFA, we apply deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms. In our algorithms, agents take action in both distributed and centralized manners. In the distributed approach, each device learns the choice of the access probability and the slot, guided by feedback from the base station (BS). Simultaneously, in the centralized approach, the BS restricts a specific number of devices from accessing the network and dynamically adjusts the frame length based on the transmission results of devices. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme surpasses benchmark schemes and exhibits significant potential to minimize AoI performance.},

  abstract     = {The lateral state information of vehicles is pivotal for their lateral control and safety monitoring of motion states. In light of the high cost associated with a vehicle&#39;s lateral speed sensor, this study focuses on estimating the lateral velocity of autonomous vehicles using the vehicle&#39;s longitudinal speed and yaw rate. The main difficulty is that the state estimation is affected by sampled and delayed sensor data measurements as well as unknown modeling uncertainties. To overcome these challenges, this article proposes a novel sampled data neural network observer. The proposed observer consists of two components: a continuous state observer and a compensating injector. The compensating injector is devised to offset the information loss during sampling by digital sensors. Additionally, a radial basis function neural network is employed to approximate the unknown dynamics and modeling uncertainties in the vehicle systems. The weights of the neural network are updated using a newly designed weight update law. Furthermore, to tackle the challenge of both sampling and delay measurement, an additional integrator is incorporated in the designed compensating injector. This additional integrator aims to mitigate the impact of sensor data delays on the estimation process. Finally, the stability of the proposed method is demonstrated using the Lyapunov technique. The effectiveness of the proposed sampled data neural network observer is verified through simulation and experiment performed on a full driving automation vehicle experimental platform.},

First, to estimate the yaw rate of the ASV, an adaptive cubature Kalman filter (ACKF) estimator is designed, in which an adaptive dynamic programming is utilized to tackle the model mismatches and generate a compensation term for the reduction of the estimation error. Second, the saturation model with smooth function is presented to deal with the saturation nonlinearities, aiming to restrict the surge force, sway force, and yaw moment of the ASV in the predefined boundaries. Third, a finite-time prescribed performance robust integral of the sign of the error (RISE) control method with the radial basis function neural network is proposed to overcome model uncertainties and external disturbances, dedicating to guarantee the transient performance and achieve the asymptotic trajectory tracking of the ASV. For the closed-loop system, the finite-time asymptotic stability is proved by employing the Lyapunov stability theorem. The effectiveness of the proposed estimator-based control method is validated by numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {Fuel cell hybrid electric vehicles (FCEVs) are considered an appealing option for heavy-duty and long-distance vehicles. However, they require the use of multiple power converters to manage power distribution among the fuel cell, battery or ultracapacitor, and AC motor, leading to increased power losses and a more complex system. To overcome this challenge, multi-port power converters have been proposed to combine two power sources and the AC motor into one conversion stage, boosting overall efficiency and power density in hybrid powertrains. However, these converters still rely on a high number of semiconductors and involve complex control systems. This paper introduces a three-port converter (TPC) for FCHEVs, using only one power stage with 6 semiconductors, achieving high performance control of an ac motor, a fuel cell and a battery. A multivariable optimal control (Finite-Control-Set Model Predictive Current Control) manages the power flows between the energy sources and drives the motor simultaneously. Additionally, the performance of the multiport converter is improved by replacing its three inductors with a custom coupled inductor designed to reduce circulating AC currents. This innovation contributes to improved efficiency and overall functionality of the FCHEV system. The proposed system was validated through an 0.5kW experimental test bench and simulations of an urban driving cycle. The system controlled the multiple variables of the hybrid system with proper operation and fast dynamics, meanwhile the coupled inductor decreases the current magnitude in 20$\%$ compared to the non-coupled configuration.},

Then a hybrid feedforward controller combining with steady-state control, dynamic compensation, and oblique steering compensation is established to enhance vehicle dynamics stability in extreme driving conditions, taking into account the reference yaw rate and road adhesion constraints. Meanwhile, an adaptive linear quadratic regulator-based feedback controller with a piece-wise affine tire model is put forward to account for the influence of vertical load, road adhesion condition, and yaw rate tracking error. The controller adopts an adaptive weighting coefficient mechanism to satisfy various working conditions based on different steady-state gains of the front and rear wheel angles over the yaw rate. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is experimentally verified under comprehensive testing scenarios through Hardware-in-the-Loop tests. The results show that the proposed scheme has superior performance relative to the state-of-the-art methods.},

To improve the performance of Battery/Supercapacitor (SC) based EV, an adaptive EMS based on Pontryagin&#39;s Minimum Principle (PMP) considering actual road slope and velocity prediction through Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based method is proposed. An adaptive EMS is designed by considering the solution obtained from PMP based EMS. The solution obtained by PMP is based on a constant costate variable which cannot be applied to uncertain driving conditions. To solve this problem, the costate variable is adjusted in real time using a novel adaptation law which considers the future power demand of the vehicle, actual road slope and battery conditions. The integration of ANN based velocity prediction model with EMS results in an enhanced technique that can adapt automatically to changing road and vehicle conditions and thus improves the efficiency of the EV. The entire system is tested on three actual road slope conditions and different driving cycles. A Rule Based Strategy (RBS) and PMP based technique without velocity prediction are also studied to compare and analyse the performance of the proposed Adaptive EMS based on PMP (APMP). Simulation results show that the proposed Adaptive EMS based on PMP increases the participation of SC in the EMS and thereby improves battery health.},

  abstract     = {The field of intelligent connectivity in modern vehicles continues to expand, with vehicle functions becoming increasingly complex over time. This expansion has led to numerous vehicle safety issues, which can easily result in safety failures, leading to injuries and deaths. Therefore, it is particularly important to identify high-risk intelligent connected systems in vehicles, as it can inform safety personnel which systems are most susceptible to safety failures, enabling them to conduct more thorough inspections and tests. In this paper, we develop a new model for vehicle intelligent connected system risk assessment by combining Interval Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (I-FAHP) with Fuzzy Cluster Analysis (FCA), called VSRQ model. We extract crucial indicators related to vehicle safety, utilizing FCA in conjunction with the I-FAHP to identify vulnerable components in the vehicle intelligent connected system. Priority testing is then conducted on these components to mitigate risks and ensure vehicle safety. We evaluate the model on OpenPilot and provide experimental evidence of the VSRQ model&#39;s effectiveness in assessing the safety of vehicle intelligent connected systems. Our experiments fully adhere to the ISO 26262 standard, and our model exhibits a higher accuracy rate compared to other models. These results provide a promising new research direction for predicting the safety risks of vehicle intelligent connected systems and provide typical application tasks for VSRQ. The experimental results show that the accuracy rate is 94.36%, and the recall rate is 73.43%, which is at least 14.63% higher than all other known methods.},

To study the performance of the SEP braking system with the controller, the simulation model of the SEP braking system with a high fidelity to the static standard bench of 150-marshalling freight train is established based on the principle of Model-120 distribution valve, and extensive simulations for the SEP braking performance with the controller are carried out. The controller can realize an online adaptive tuning for the PID parameters by applying the GA to optimize the scaling factors and control rules of variable universe fuzzy inference, resulting in a great enhancement of control performance. The simulation and experiment results show that, compared with traditional pneumatic braking and SEP braking with FVUF-PID controller optimized by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), the time difference of starting rise of the braking cylinder between the first and last car of a 150-marshalling freight train can be reduced by 78% and 15.3%, respectively. Also, the braking time and distance of the SEP braking system with the proposed controller are shorter by 20.9% and 23.03%, and 3.13% and 5.63%, respectively, compared with those of the traditional pneumatic braking system and SEP braking with FVUF-PID controller optimized by PSO at a pressure reduction of 140kPa. Furthermore, the maximum compressional forces of the coupler during traditional pneumatic braking are reduced by $18.11-62.83\%$ under different decompression pressures, demonstrating a significant improvement on the SEP braking performance by using the controller.},

  abstract     = {In the 2000s, the liberalization of the rail markets for freight and passenger travel opened up the competition. Nowadays, local, regional, and long-distance passenger rail are gradually following suit. As a consequence of the paradigm of realizing smart and sustainable cities, the operators of local railway infrastructures (i.e., metro, light railway, and commuter) are studying strategies to improve the energy efficiency of the overall system. The operators are thus involved in renewing technological infrastructures and examining new operation models for coordinating the motion of the trains fleet. With this regard, the present work proposes a timetable adjustment approach to reduce energy consumption in metro rail transit systems. In addition, a centralized control strategy to manage the output voltage of Traction Power Substations (TPSs), train regenerative power, and charge/discharge power profiles of off-board Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) is proposed. The approach is based on a two-step procedure aimed at optimally allocating the layover time among the train stops. This approach is formulated as an optimization problem, which consider the adopted control strategy, because of the correlation between control actions and timetable. Numerical examples have been carried out based on the real data from metro line 1 of Naples, (Italy).

  abstract     = {The boost and strengthening of electromobility are only possible under the simultaneous development of energy storage systems along with their ancillary systems. In this regard, the thermal management system (TMS) study is being broadened as it is in charge of battery packs&#39; good performance and durability. New systems or adaptions of already employed ones are being studied to improve electric vehicle outcomes. In this context, the system presented in this work is a hybrid system between the current cold plates and the lately studied phase change materials (PCMs), which is incorporated into a real case electrification of a commercial vehicle. As a result, integrating the PCM buffer into the battery pack&#39;s base structure aims to improve mechanical strength while also improving thermal management. The operation analysis results under 6 C fast charge and motorway speed discharge showed the capability of the proposed TMS. The increase in the system&#39;s thermal capacitance by 31.9% when combining the use of cold plate with PCM enabled distributing the heat dissipation along the charge and discharge, despite the weight being increased by 10.14%. Hence, the auxiliary cooling system&#39;s peak power was reduced, allowing for size reduction and an energy consumption reduction of 21%. Moreover, the PCM delimits the maximum temperature reached by the system with a reduction at the end of fast charge of more than 10%, serving as a security element with the cold plate switched off. Therefore, the proposed system&#39;s weight demerits could be overcome with temperature and auxiliary consumption reductions, proving an effective system for a high-performance vehicle.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the development of electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure and efforts to achieve more sustainable transportation systems have increased. The enhanced utilization of EVs will require fast charging systems, which will overload utility power grids and require high-cost additional installations and equipment. However, a significant amount of regenerative braking energy (RBE) is available in electric railway systems (ERSs), which needs to be properly stored and accommodated. The integration of ERSs and EV charging stations (EVCS) at strategic points, such as parking areas close to ERS stations or rail freight intermodal terminals where EVs are parked most hours of the day, can be a promising solution to save RBE in the dedicated internal EV batteries. In this article, a new method is proposed to charge EVs by transferring RBE from ERSs to EVCSs, taking advantage of a combined power management scheme based on stationary hybrid energy storage systems (HESSs) integrated with railway power flow controllers (RPFCs). A coordinated hierarchical control (CHC) method collaborating with an internal model predictive control (IMPC) strategy is presented to manage an optimal power flow paradigm for various operating system modes. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is confirmed through simulations executed with the desired precision representing real system behavior.},

  abstract     = {Recently, multi-motor electric vehicles (EVs) gain much attraction from both academics and industry as they offer prospective advantages in performance and efficiency improvement thanks to the torque-split configuration. Such EVs can enhance the energy consumed throughout normal operation by using a suitable torque distribution system. However, researches on conventional energy management system regularly do not take into account the dynamics of the vehicle, particularly the loss caused by the slip phenomenon of the wheel on the road. Dealing with dual-motor all-wheel-driven EVs, we propose an efficiency-based optimal strategy considering longitudinal vehicle dynamics for improving energy consumption by formulating an energetic cost function that links the energy management and the motion control of EVs. For that, the proposed strategy optimally distributes the required total torque to the front and rear axles to maximize the efficiencies of traction motors in both acceleration and deceleration duration. Software simulation and experiment are carried out on multiple testing scenarios to validate the performance of the proposal. The results show that the proposed distribution strategy can save from 4.4% to 18.8% of consumed energy, compared to several other management strategies described in the article.},

The energetic macroscopic representation formalism is used to organize the models of the subsystems so they have the right interactions. The developed model is validated by experimental tests on a real subway line. The error on the global energy consumption is lower than 2.2%. The model is then employed to examine the influence of the vehicle time interval on energy consumption.

This substitution is to decrease the circuit complexity, cost, and required space. However, fulfilling these goals highly depends on the selection of a suitable topology. This paper performs a multi-criteria ranking to deeply analyze the impact of different ZSI topologies on the performance of a recreational FC-HEV, composed of FC stack and lithium-ion capacitor bank. First, the dual-energy sources are embedded into the Z-source network (ZSN). Subsequently, the Preference Ranking Organization METHod for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE) is utilized to rank different possible ZSI topologies based on four scenarios (standard, compactness, input current ripple, and compactness versus input current ripple). This analysis indicates that each scenario can have a suitable topology with respect to its requirements. Finally, the two highest-ranked ZSI topologies according to standard scenario are implemented by signal hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) to validate the effectiveness of the performed analysis. The results indicate that the use of the ZSI topologies lead to higher average efficiencies (1.98% and 4.07%), and smaller size and volume of passive components, compared to a conventional two-stage inverter.},

Then, signal analysis techniques such as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy combined with machine learning algorithms can generate a representation of the system state of health space using data in known conditions. Although the onboard measurement of EIS can be done by controlling the harmonic content of the power converter at the output of the fuel cell, the implementation of in-vehicle diagnostic algorithms is still limited by the absence of a large database listing the evolution of performance throughout the life cycle. This paper presents a fast-diagnostic method able to consider the occurrence of new data to adapt the dimensional space representing the health state and compensate for the lack of data. Available measurements come from two low-temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell technologies characterized by two laboratories. The results presented in the paper show that the automatic parameter selection provides performances as good as the ones obtained by an expert.

  abstract     = {Intelligent parking guidance systems (IPGSs) based on vacant parking space (VPS) availability predictions are highly effective to alleviate the increasingly serious parking difficulties in metropolis. The spatial-temporal correlation analysis of VPS information of multiple parking lots in a region shows that not only the number of VPS in each parking lot has a stable temporal correlation, but also there is obvious spatial correlation among different parking lots. Given this, this article takes full advantage of the space-time correlation and makes short-term (within 30 min) and long-term (over 30 min) predictions about the number of VPSs in multiple parking lots in an area parallelly. Specifically, this article develops a deep gated graph recurrent neural network (G$^{2}$RNN) model which has the ability to extract both spatial and temporal correlations concurrently between different parking lots. The advantages of the G$^{2}$RNN model are that, first, spatial and temporal correlations between different parking lots can be accurately obtained simultaneously, and second, there is no need to grid the raw data since it uses graph-structured data. For long-term predictions, two different approaches, namely the single-step and iterative predictions, are investigated. The performance of the G$^{2}$RNN based prediction method is extensively evaluated with practical data collected from eight public parking lots in Santa Monica. The results show that it can achieve considerably high accuracy in both short-term and long-term predictions.},

The safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is profoundly influenced by the driving behavior of different drivers, especially in complex and dynamic scenarios. To address these safety risks arising from various driving behavior, this study introduces a low-risk, high-efficiency motion planning approach based on a trajectory prediction model. Firstly, an unsupervised driving style recognition framework using real-world data information is developed to categorize vehicles into three distinct driving style: cautions, normal, and aggressive. Next, a trajectory prediction model incorporating different driving styles is established using the Transformer prediction network to predict the future trajectories of surrounding vehicles (SVs). Subsequently, a motion planning framework that incorporates driving intentions is constructed to generate candidate planning trajectory cluster. Moreover, based on trajectory prediction and driving style information of SVs, a personalized risk assessment model is established, while also comprehensively considering the impact of safety, efficiency and comfort. Finally, the proposed approach is verified through real datasets and comparative experiments. The results show that the proposed framework achieves high-precision trajectory prediction and attains a 99% success rate in closed-loop testing with real datasets, thereby providing safe motion planning for AVs in dynamic environments.},

  abstract     = {The widespread adoption of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) has revolutionized high-precision positioning services. However, the accuracy of these systems is significantly compromised by Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) signals, especially in urban canyons. Specifically, Line-of-Sight (LOS) signals are obstructed, and the reflections lead to substantial errors. Machine learning has emerged as a promising tool for identifying NLOS signals. However, traditional methods often train models on extensive datasets from various environments and fine-tune them with new data to adjust to new scenarios. This fine-tuning can result in catastrophic forgetting, which impairs the models&#39; generalization performance across different environments. To address the limitations of model fine-tuning, we introduce NICL, an approach for NLOS Identification with Continual Learning. NICL preserves performance on previously encountered scenarios while adapting to new environments by employing simple regularization techniques that do not require access to the data from the old scenarios. Specifically, our method incorporates Kullback-Leibler divergence regularization and explainability-based regularization to maintain the model&#39;s prior outputs and the logic behind those outputs, thus mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results on real-world GNSS datasets have shown that our NICL method outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving an absolute improvement of 5%-12% in NLOS identification accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Maximizing traffic flow at signalized intersections using adaptive signal control (ASC) strategy has proven highly effective in mitigating the risk of traffic congestion. However, existing ASC strategies typically consider the traffic conditions of a single downstream road at a time, limiting their overall effectiveness. To address this limitation and enhance ASC strategies, this paper proposes an improved adaptive signal control (IASC) which considers traffic conditions of multiple downstream roads during phase selection. Furthermore, with the emergence of vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) technologies, traffic light agents can now communicate with vehicle agents. By leveraging this connectivity, this paper proposes a unified framework called VR-IASC which combines vehicle rerouting strategy with the IASC strategy. First, the proposed IASC considers the intentions of the vehicles in the connected vehicle (CV) environment during the selection of the traffic light phases. Then, the road congestion levels are predicted by considering the vehicle flow affected by the selected traffic light phases. Upon detecting the congested roads, alternative routes based on travel time and remaining road capacity are assigned to the vehicles before they enter the congested roads. Based on simulation results, the proposed IASC outperforms the state-of-the-art ASC strategy by 38.1% and 12.3% in terms of percentage reduction in average travel time in a simple grid network and a real-life Kuala Lumpur (KL) network, respectively. Furthermore, by combining the proposed IASC strategy with vehicle rerouting strategy, the proposed VR-IASC framework achieves substantial reductions in average travel time of 42.26% and 34.74% in the grid network and the KL network, respectively.},

To accurately diagnose axle-box bearing surface defects, robust blind deconvolution (BD) methods are proposed to extract defect-induced repetitive impulses from axle-box vibration measurements in this article. Specifically, a unified theoretical framework for the BD methods using time-domain and frequency-domain generalized statistical indicators as objective functions is established respectively by converting the deconvolution problem into a generalized Rayleigh quotient-based generalized eigenvalue problem. On this basis, two new BD methods for extracting repetitive impulse features are presented by employing the robust power function-based Gini index as the objective function. They obtain optimal deconvolution filters by adaptively evaluating repetitive transient features in the squared envelope and squared envelope spectrum of the filtered signal, respectively. The developed methods are verified on bench experimental signals of manufactured and naturally occurring axle-box bearing faults. The results show that the presented BD methods can effectively enhance repetitive impulse features and diagnose various defects of railway vehicle axle-box bearings.},

  abstract     = {Accurately characterizing wheel polygonal wear (PW) is critical for evaluating the operation status of vehicle-rail systems. While prior research has predominantly focused on employing a two-dimensional wheel profiles, it has overlooked the combined effects of circumferential and lateral wear. Furthermore, although there is evidence suggesting that interharmonics can influence wheel wear, existing studies have not thoroughly explored this aspect. Therefore, this paper examines the evolution characteristics of three-dimensional (3D) PW under the influence of interharmonics from the perspective of electromechanical coupling. Initially, an evolution model for 3D wheel PW is developed, integrating an electromechanical coupling model, a 3D wheel profile model, and the USFD wear function. Subsequently, 3D distribution characteristics of PW under multiple operating conditions are analyzed. The results reveal significant differences in the order and depth of PW across different lateral positions. Specially, on curved tracks, the order of PW is presented in distinct groupings. The dominant polygon of the locomotive running (70 km/h) on a straight track is 200 mm, attributed to $| {5f - 7{{f}_0}} |$ interharmonic effect, whereas on the curved track, it is 316 mm, attributed to P2 resonance. Moreover, as the curve radius increases, the ratio between PW depth of 316 and 200 mm significantly decrease.},

  abstract     = {Obstacle avoidance is the crux of formation control for a UAV swarm, no matter in urban or wild application environments. But there is a dilemma to promote both of obstacle avoidance flexibility and consistency in UAV formation control, which has not been solved effectively by existing researches. In view of this, this paper proposes a consensus based reinforcement learning method for differentiated formation control (DFC) of UAVs, to balance the obstacle avoidance flexibility and consistency. In this method, to promote obstacle avoidance flexibility of a UAV swarm, a consensus mechanism with differentiated formation control strategies is designed, it allows each UAV in a swarm changes its formation control strategy among aggregation, formation keeping and obstacle avoidance according to its local environment, and calculates its own current subgoal based on the selected strategy. Further, to improve the flight efficiency of the UAV swarm, a reinforcement learning model is provided to generate the optimal offset vector for each UAV according to its current subgoal. Moreover, to enhance the obstacle avoidance consistency of the UAV swarm, a collaborative obstacle avoidance algorithm is designed in the obstacle avoidance strategy, it requires UAVs to share their obstacle information and obstacle avoidance actions, and provides obstacle avoidance consensus rules to help UAVs to choose consistent obstacle avoidance directions. The experiment results show that the proposed method can combine obstacle avoidance flexibility and consistency of UAVs, thereby achieving higher flight efficiency and maintaining stable network connectivity.},

Therefore, to enhance the overall disturbance-resisting performance of the MMLS, this paper proposes an ultra-local sliding mode adjacent cross-coupling controller (USMACC). First, a general model of the MMLS is established. The coupling relationship between LPs is deduced considering the composite motion of the system centroid. Then, an ultra-local sliding mode controller (USMC) is designed, which eliminates the parameter dependency of an accurate system model and possesses excellent dynamic performance for each LP. Next, adjacent cross-coupling control (ACC) is integrated into USMC, effectively reducing tracking errors of each LP and synchronization errors between LPs. Last, comparative experiments with conventional PID and USMC demonstrate that the MMLS adopting the proposed USMACC possesses exceptional overall disturbance-resisting performance under various inconsistent external disturbances.},

This paper integrates the two topics and proposes a general cooperation method for multi-train operation in urban rail transit system. The cooperative operation problem is formulated as an optimal control problem and then solved as a nonlinear program (NLP). By treating catenary voltages as control variables, we show that the dynamic electric power flow for the typical double-track DC railway system can be considered within the NLP, with no need to develop a complex power flow calculation for the coupled circuits. Compared to existing works, the proposed method achieves true cooperation among trains by minimizing the global substation energy usage, while ensuring dynamic safety-tracking distances among adjacent trains.},

Specifically, a novel performance index, estimation gain, is introduced to evaluate the benefit of scheduling one sensor for estimation error reduction. Then, sensor scheduling and data transmission are jointly optimized to minimize the time-accumulated estimation error, which is challenging to directly solve due to the unclear impact of imperfect transmission on estimation performance. To this end, an estimation gain-based algorithm is designed to determine the scheduled sensors. Besides, an iterative algorithm is designed to solve the adaptive cooperative transmission problem.

  abstract     = {A reachable area defines the potential end positions that a reusable vehicle can reach under its current flight state. The area comprises feasible flight trajectories and helps to sustainably regenerate trajectories through instantaneous computation. Thus, it is essential for online plan decisions, particularly in emergencies. However, computing end positions can be challenging when there is high degree of nonlinear coupling between the flight constraints, dynamics, objective functions, and thermal/load factors. To solve this issue, we propose a new flight profile that easily satisfies strict constraints. In addition, we devise a series of analytic dynamics to instantly predict the thermal/load factors and objective functions. The analytic models integrate Earth&#39;s perturbations and rotations and complex aerodynamic models, thus improving the accuracy of the derived reachable area. Based on a novel Mercator plane with minimum projection deformation, we devise a lateral profile using a cubic B-spline model that easily satisfies the extensively checked waypoints. Based on the results, the proposed algorithm mitigates nonlinear coupling to a significant extent and facilitates reachable area generation. In addition, we study and reveal the principles of evolutionary method improvements and convergence and devise a deep reinforcement learning-based multiobjective particle swarm optimization method to obtain the Pareto Set. The Set maximizes/minimizes the down/crossrange of a vehicle and comprises a series of end positions to define the reachable area. The reachable area is then employed to rapid vehicle trajectory recomputation. Finally, we validate our algorithm through numerical simulations analyze the results for future improvements.},

  abstract     = {The automated emergency braking system is designed to prevent rear-end collisions. However, unexpected failures within this system during braking could potentially lead to accidents. To address this concern, we propose an integrated safe replanning and motion control framework to mitigate collision risks in the event of braking failures. Unlike previous fault-tolerant control works, the steering system is intervened to eliminate failure risks instead of re-configuring the braking torque; therefore, the longitudinal driving risks can be lessened from the lateral perspective. To achieve this approach, firstly, a risk assessment function with a failure factor is constructed to reconsider the driving target. Then, the driving target position and surrounding obstacle information are incorporated into one novel integral heuristic barrier Lyapunov function to reformulate the motion replanning and tracking problems as one yaw angle tracking problem. After, a novel barrier function-based sliding mode controller is introduced to ensure the yaw angle tracking performance within constraints. In this paper, decision-making, motion planning, and tracking tasks are incorporated into one analytical solution framework uniformly.Additionally, the prescribed time stability of our strategy ensures an upper bound setting time, indicating stability before the ego vehicle stop completly. Finally, numerous simulation results are carried out to confirm the effectiveness and superiority of our strategy in circumventing the troubles of braking system failures.},

We use average nonlinear age (ANA) to measure data freshness and study linear, squared and exponential penalty functions. We prove that the zero-wait sampling, the uniform quantization, and the ANA-optimal coding policies together provide an asymptotically optimal solution, in the sense that, as the average distortion approaches zero, the solution achieves the minimum ANA asymptotically, for the linear and squared penalty functions. When the probability density function (pdf) is weakly unimodal, we also prove that the zero-wait sampling, the K-L quantization which is asymptotically optimal for the quantization with Rényi entropy constraint, and the ANA-optimal coding policies are asymptotically optimal for the exponential penalty function. Furthermore, we prove that the optimal ANA is asymptotically linear with respect to the log MSE distortion with a slope of $-\frac{3}{4}$, $-\sqrt{\frac{7}{12}}$ and $-1$, corresponding to the linear, squared and exponential penalty functions, respectively.},

Intelligent vehicles, roadside devices, and open wireless communication networks collectively expand the vulnerability landscape of intelligent transportation system (ITS) security, thereby increasing the potential exposure to security risks. Nonetheless, mobile vehicles require frequent authentication with Roadside Units (RSUs), which in turn results in substantial computational and communication overhead. Consequently, this approach leads to performance bottlenecks in resource-constrained On-Board Units (OBUs). In this paper, we are concerned with a lattice-based certificateless secure data transmission scheme for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) based on Blockchain. The proposed protocol incorporates identity authentication functionality and effectively integrates the cross-domain authentication characteristics of the Blockchain. Initially, the Trusted Authority (TA) uploads the registration information of vehicles onto the Blockchain to verify the authenticity of a vehicle&#39;s identity by examining the data stored in the Blockchain. When Roadside Units securely collect authenticated transactions and message transmission traffic, the integrity of the messages is ensured through the utilization of the lattice-based signcryption algorithm as part of a block. Subsequently, according to the data transmission algorithm, these partial blocks are transformed into complete blocks and disseminated across the entire network. The complete blocks were subsequently mined using a consensus algorithm that incorporated a voting mechanism. Furthermore, the security of the proposed protocol is rigorously proven by employing a random oracle model. Finally, the efficiency of the data transmission algorithm was rigorously evaluated under the Barabasi-Albert BA (3) and Erdos-Renyi ER (0,1) models, ensuring its effectiveness in various network topologies.},

In this paper, both Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) and polarized Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) channel measurements are conducted in an IIoT scenario at the less congested Wi-Fi band, i.e., 5.5 GHz. The purpose is to investigate wireless characteristics of communications between access points and terminals mounted on automated guided vehicles as well as those surrounding manufacturing areas. For SISO channel measurements, statistical properties including the delay Power Spectral Density (PSD), path loss, shadowing fading, delay spread, excess delay, K-factor, and amplitude distribution of small-scale fading are analyzed and compared with those observed in an office scenario. For MIMO channel measurements, results show that there are multiple Dense Multipath Component (DMC) processes in the delay PSD. An estimation algorithm based on the algorithm for a single DMC process is proposed to effectively process the multi-processes data. Moreover, delay, angular, power, and polarization properties of DMCs are investigated and compared with those of specular multipath components. Furthermore, effects of DMCs on Singular Values (SVs) and channel capacities are explored. Ignoring DMCs can overestimate SVs and underestimate channel capacities.},

  abstract     = {Positioning with fifth-generation (5G) new radio (NR) signals is promising, particularly in areas where the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) is blocked. However, the design of the receiver for 5G NR signals is challenging by the presence of multipath in indoor and urban environments, especially for time-of-arrival (TOA) tracking. In this paper, we propose a signal parameter estimation method for 5G NR that utilizes the estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques (ESPRIT) and the state space model to achieve signal parameter estimation. First, the ESPRIT is employed as the delay and phase discriminator, and a path selection criterion based on amplitude is proposed to avoid outliers in ESPRIT estimation caused by overestimating the channel order based on the minimum description length (MDL) criterion. Then, the state space model is used for carrier phase and Doppler frequency estimation, and the measurement matrix based on the phase error of the ESPRIT discriminator is derived. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is tested in an indoor environment containing a commercial small cell base station (BS). The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the DLL and ESPRIT, with a pseudorange estimation root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.63m. Therefore, the proposed method in this article has essential reference significance for promoting and commercializing 5G indoor positioning.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is considered as one of the revolutionary technologies for sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication as it can be adapted to assist communication systems by adaptively manipulating the propagation environment and greatly expanding network coverage. In this case, the aerial IRS (AIRS)-assisted communications have unique advantages, such as more flexible deployment and wider service coverage. However, accurate channel modeling of AIRS-assisted system is challenging due to mobility. In this paper, we propose a novel geometry-based three-dimensional (3D) wideband channel model for AIRS-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems, where the rotational degrees of freedom in three directions and the arbitrary trajectory of AIRS in space are specially considered. Firstly, a novel geometry-based 3D channel model that considers the realistic motion trajectory of UAVs in reality is proposed. The scatterers in the environment are modeled as different clusters set to simulate the frequency-selective fading caused by multipath effects. Secondly, a space-time-related cluster visibility algorithm based on the birth-death process is developed to characterize the non-stationarity introduced by the mobility of AIRS. Based on the model, the channel impulse responses (CIRs) and the corresponding statistical characteristic functions are derived. Finally, we investigate and analyze the impacts of different AIRS trajectories on channel statistical characteristics, such as the space-time correlation function, Doppler power spectral density, and channel capacity. Meanwhile, the influence of non-ideal AIRS on the channel is discussed, including discrete phase design and discrete time reflection phase. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model can accurately capture the channel properties, which therefore provides valuable insights for future development of AIRS for 6G systems.},

Power consumption optimization plays an important role in green IoV networks. Using decode-and-forward (DF) relaying, we investigate the intelligent power allocation optimization of green cooperative IoV networks. Based on the characteristics of mobile channels, we employ outage probability (OP) criterion to analyze communication performance of green cooperative connected IoV networks from a mathematical perspective. Novel OP mathematical expressions are obtained. Using the obtained OP results, we investigate the problem of OP performance minimization via power allocation optimization. The complex non-convex problem of power allocation is formulated, as well as the optimization function. Based on the sparrow search algorithm (SSA), an intelligent optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the above complex problem. The proposed SSA approach is compared to the state-of-the-art intelligence algorithms, and our proposed algorithm can achieve a shorter running time and a good OP performance, thereby enhancing the system&#39;s efficiency.},

This paper presents a diffusion model-based data augmentation for enhanced vehicular network applications. The existing data augmentation techniques fail to modify the semantics of the images in the dataset. Addressing this, we propose a diffusion-based model for effective data augmentation. The augmentation technique involves feeding a randomly generated prompt (covering several image features like weather, lighting, background, visibility, and surface) along with canny edge features of an existing image to a diffusion model to generate an image with desired features. We used a vision-based accident detection dataset and a MobileNet-based deep learning model to understand the efficacy of the proposed data augmentation technique. Our experimental analysis indicates the proposed data augmentation technique improves the performance notably (3%).},

First, a dynamic model for the multiple-point levitation module of a maglev vehicle is established. Considering the actuator drive redundancy, the mode matrix is given for each possible fault. Next, based on each fault mode, the corresponding control signal is designed to ensure the stability and asymptotic tracking performance of the system, and the multi-controller set is formed. Then, the control switching mechanism is designed to select the most appropriate controller to generate control signals.

  abstract     = {As network and autonomous driving technologies rapidly advance, traffic flow prediction has become a crucial area of research. It plays a significant role in optimizing urban traffic management and enhancing road safety, drawing increasing attention from researchers. As a specific form of time-series data, traffic flow data is often used in prediction tasks utilizing large language models. Recent developments in graph data and improvements in graph neural networks have led researchers to employ methods like adjacency and Laplacian matrices for addressing relational issues among distant nodes. However, most existing methods focus on enhancing prediction performance through network architectures or using adaptive matrices to capture spatiotemporal relationships, with limited exploration into the impact of input embedding. This paper introduces an innovative approach to traffic flow prediction, the ASTRformer, which emphasizes the fusion of spatial and temporal information in historical data through an adaptive spatio-temporal relation learning mechanism. This mechanism integrates feature embedding with adaptive spatial and temporal embeddings. A learnable spatio-temporal fusion network then parameterizes these embeddings, producing the input representations. Subsequently, a transformer model captures these representations to predict future traffic flows. Experimental results on six datasets demonstrate that our method effectively captures spatio-temporal dependencies, achieving state-of-the-art performance across various prediction metrics.},

  abstract     = {The integration of video monitoring and intelligent applications in intelligent transportation and pedestrian navigation has sparked concerns regarding privacy protection. Person re-identification, a key application, utilizes deep learning models to manage traffic efficiently and guide pedestrians. However, this technology raises privacy issues. Existing de-identification methods, such as blurring or pixelation, compromise the realism of crucial pedestrian attributes for identification, and often overlook the importance of identity restoration and person attributes required by law enforcement. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Attribute-Consistency Reversible Pedestrian De-Identification (ACRPD) framework. ACRPD comprises three main processes: attribute-level contrastive learning, cross-view pedestrian anonymization generation, and raw pedestrian image recovery. Attribute-level contrastive learning ensures consistency in attributes between anonymized pedestrian images, using a predictor trained on attribute labels like ID, gender, age, and clothing. The cross-view pedestrian anonymization generation module employs attribute transformation and adversarial training to generate anonymized images while preserving important attribute information and removing ID details. For reversibility, a raw pedestrian image recovery stage reconstructs original images from anonymized ones, ensuring compatibility with authorized scenarios. Extensive experiments on two person reidentification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ACRPD, achieving average 12.1% and 5.0% rank-1 accuracies on Market and MSMT17 datasets respectively. ACRPD successfully maintains attribute consistency while safeguarding privacy-sensitive ID information, offering a promising solution for privacy protection in intelligent transportation and pedestrian navigation applications.},

Vehicles use the 3D object detection algorithm to perceive their surroundings and share detection results with other vehicles using the internet of vehicles technology, improving the efficiency of intelligent transportation systems. Multimodal information fusion of LiDAR and cameras can improve the performance of 3D object detection. However, the different modality information is inhomogeneous, multimodal 3D object detection still has challenges, such as difficult semantic alignment of modal elements and inadequate fusion. To mitigate these challenges, we first propose the sparse interaction with centroid query (SICQ) for voxel-level features from different modalities, which aligns different modal semantic information through more precise and fine-grained interaction. Then, we propose the dense fusion with multi-scale masked attention (DFMMA), using multi-scale feature masks from bird&#39;s-eye-view (BEV)-level multimodal features to improve performance for small object feature perception. Finally, we propose the multimodal grid encoder with positional information (MGEPI), through positional information implicitly guiding and the transformer-based attention mechanism for grid-level features, improves the perception of detection scene context spatial information and enhances the robustness of the algorithm. Additionally, this paper performs comprehensive experiments on the popular KITTI dataset and demonstrates that our algorithm has superior 3D object detection performance.},

The vehicle routing problem based on waste classification for collection and transportation (C&amp;T) has garnered increasing attention as a typical issue within this system. Given the diverse nature of waste types and the need to organize multiple vehicles to service collection points, congestion often arises due to simultaneous vehicle operations or queuing, posing a significant challenge. To address this, our study introduces asynchronous constraints on vehicle operations to mitigate congestion. Furthermore, building upon the separate loading and unified loading waste C&amp;T models, a combined C&amp;T model grounded in waste classification is devised. We propose an enhanced ant colony optimization algorithm to solve this intricate problem and validate its efficacy. Experimental findings reveal that, compared to both separate and unified schemes, the proposed combined model yields respective reductions of 5.38% and 2.75% in C&amp;T costs. Meanwhile, the comprehensiveness of the combined model has been demonstrated through other experiments, providing a reference for the improvement and optimization of garbage classification C&amp;T schemes.},

  abstract     = {To solve the partial offloading problem of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) applications in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) under edge computing environment, this paper proposes a partial offloading algorithm for DAG application via deep reinforcement learning. The proposed algorithm considers the complexity of server computing resource allocation and computing offloading decision to maximize the comprehensive utility of time delay and energy consumption. First, we propose a partial offloading model of DAG application. In order to determine the execution priority of each sub-module in DAG application, an execution priority algorithm is designed to transform DAG application into sequence structure. Then, a recurrent neural network-based sequence-to-sequence network is designed as a strategy network, and a partial offloading algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning is proposed. Finally, to ensure the reliable offloading of DAG application in the IoV, a re-decision scheme is proposed in the case of edge server failure. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves better comprehensive utility than the baseline algorithms under the same computation offloading scenario, and the designed fault handling scheme can ensure reliable offloading of DAG applications in the case of server faults.},

The objective of this article is to analyze the safety issues of human electromagnetic exposure containing implants in the electric vehicle wireless power transfer (EV-WPT). This article establishes an adult male human model with a coronary artery stent and hip joint implant and is exposed to the leakage magnetic field of an EV-WPT system. The EV-WPT system has a transmission power of 30 kW and a working frequency of 85 kHz. Fully considering the uncertainty of human exposure to the electromagnetic environment of the EV-WPT system, such as the distance between the human body and the EV-WPT system, the distance between the EV-WPT system coils, and the parameters of the compensation circuit, this article uses Bayesian Neural Networks to evaluate human electromagnetic safety. Bayesian neural networks can obtain accurate results with fewer training sets and have higher computational efficiency. The results showed that the probability of electromagnetic exposure levels significantly exceeding the standard limit in the human body with hip joint implants was almost 100%, while the probability of exceeding the standard limit in the human heart with coronary artery stents did not exceed 31.5%. Patients with medical implants may need to limit power when using the EV-WPT system.},

This paper proposes an innovative framework for privacy-preserving reputation-based Opportunistic Federated Learning (PR-OppCL) to address these challenges. Firstly, we introduce a reputation value considering factors like time and model loss. This value guides our incentive mechanism, which encourages high-quality data-seeking clients to join the training process. Secondly, we implement an auction mechanism that allows clients to auction local training tasks to fog nodes, improving efficiency, and addressing performance imbalances. Thirdly, we integrate lightweight cryptographic primitive Oblivious Transfer (OT) into gradient sharing to protect vehicle privacy.

Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technology can provide a multitude number of communication services between vehicles and Roadside Units (RSUs), making vehicle cooperative caching a viable solution. Nevertheless, for new energy vehicles such as electric ones, how to reduce the energy consumption of the vehicle network system remains a formidable challenge. Additionally, the task delay of vehicle cooperative caching can also be further reduced. In this paper, a clustering caching model is proposed by considering constraints for tolerable delay of tasks and the residence time of vehicles, and the kinetic energy recovery scheme of vehicles and the Energy Harvesting (EH) mechanism of RSUs are designed to reduce the system energy consumption. Terahertz (THz) communication is employed in vehicle to vehicle (V2V) to accelerate the completion of tasks. Subsequently, the energy consumption optimization problem for the vehicle cooperative caching system is constructed. Furthermore, the continuity and high-dimensionality properties of the decision variables for the optimization problem are analyzed, and we propose the joint Download Size and Bandwidth Allocation (DSBA) algorithm to explore an approximate optimal solution for task decomposition and resource allocation in the high-dynamic environment. We also propose an algorithm named Vehicle Cache Content Recommendation (VCCR) to avoid the additional delay and the waste of energy caused by the vehicle user cache miss-hit problem.

  abstract     = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are widely used for commercial transportation and data collection in many applications. Recently, UAVs have been used as flying relays to support terrestrial cellular networks for enhancing coverage and connectivity. Multiple UAVs serve as data collectors at a common altitude in a UAV-aided Internet of Things (IoT) network. Data collected is processed by Federated Learning (FL) before being sent to central servers to protect users&#39; privacy and reduce communication costs. Batteries in UAVs are tiny and efficient only for a short duration, making FL challenging to execute for many iterations. Therefore, a Multi-UAV Energy Efficient Coverage Deployment algorithm based on a Spatial Adaptive Play (MUECD-SAP) is proposed in this article. MUECD uses a modified Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to optimize the accurate location of deployed UAVs based on the Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SINR) to increase the data collection rate. Also, to make the FL run for multiple iterations, SAP dynamically allocates resources using Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) to optimize the energy consumed and the link latency between the user and the UAV system. The proposed MUECD algorithm outperforms all the state-of-the-art algorithms by achieving an improved data rate and balanced SINR value. The proposed SAP resource allocation strategy has improved the FL execution by 66.67% and attains a very low latency and energy consumed compared to other resource allocation techniques.},

  abstract     = {The increased charging demand resulting from the rapid development of electric vehicles (EVs) poses various challenges to the stable operation of distribution networks and the smart grid. Due to stochastic EV charging behaviour, high charging demand at charging stations (CSs) elevates the load curve which may lead to a spatially imbalanced load demand. As such, forecasting the highly stochastic EV charging load considering an individual EV&#39;s unique charging behaviour can result in maintaining safe operation of the grid and distribution network. Therefore, in this work, we propose Block-FeDL, a blockchain-based Federated Learning (FL) approach for EV charging load forecasting considering private and sensitive charging information of each EV user. Thereafter, we use a Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) model within FeDL for predicting EV charging load patterns at each client. Moreover, instead of using a centralized server for global model aggregation, we use blockchain technology, where model aggregation is performed in a decentralized manner and local model parameters shared by FL clients can be validated and securely recorded. Lastly, the results show that Block-FeDL outperforms the second-best baseline method by 95%, 96%, and 77% in terms of mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE) for forecasting EV charging load.},

The deployed IoV devices allow traffic participants to generate and analyze the traffic information such as driving status and road condition. They can further share the collected traffic data through the centralized cloud service to improve road operation efficiency, safety and reduce economic losses. Storing sensitive traffic data in an untrusted cloud server, however, raises the requirement of data access control to protect valuable business issues. Unfortunately, using pure cryptographic access control schemes for traffic data faces several limitations. In this paper, we first develop a pure cryptographic construction to enforce attribute-based access control (ABAC) model in untrusted cloud for IoV system based on ciphertext policy-attribute based encryption (CP-ABE) and explore three limitations of it. By studying ABAC in the context of CP-ABE, we can effectively lower-bound the costs that would be incurred when using more advanced and more expensive predicate encryption schemes. We then propose a new attribute based access control system (AACS) for cloud-aided IoV system to overcome the barriers of CP-ABE by using trusted hardware (Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX)). AACS uses a secure data division framework to achieve a small Trusted Computing Base (TCB) and integrates SGX with several cryptographic protocols as well as optimization techniques. We comprehensively evaluate AACS to show the design advantages of it.},

Instead of instance-level contrastive learning, SPCC retains the useful representations selectively under the guidance of the superpixel subregion.

To address this problem, we model the operations of three unconventional (signal-free) autonomous intersections and compare their operational performance with one conventional autonomous intersection. Results show that unconventional vehicle crossing paths at intersections are likely to reduce vehicle delay and fuel consumption compared with conventional intersections in most scenarios. Three crucial intersection layout factors, i.e. the number of conflicts, the distance between conflicting points, and the conflict angle, are investigated, which provides new insights into the mechanism of the performance change of unconventional intersections under the CAV environment.

These instructions serve as guidance for the generation of dispatching strategies within complex distributed network scenarios. According to this strategy, the proposed framework seamlessly integrates the decision-making capabilities of LLM with multiple D3PG models to generate a large number of candidate dispatching strategies and then uses the whale optimization algorithm to optimize these strategies to achieve better dispatching results.

AVA integrates both federated learning and multi-agent reinforcement learning to fully utilize computing resources in the vehicular environment, and simultaneously achieves task delay reduction, energy consumption minimization, and task completion rate augmentation. Moreover, we establish a federated learning framework to judiciously determine the proportion of resource allocation of AV through the implementation of inventive mechanisms. Experiment results validate that our approach not only leads to the improvement of key system performance indicators, but also ensures the comprehensive exploitation of the computing resources of mobile vehicles.},

  abstract     = {In the contemporary landscape of vehicular communications, the role of vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) has become increasingly pivotal, transcending the capabilities of traditional mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs). These advancements in VANETs play a critical role in enhancing traffic management systems, promoting collision prevention, bolstering road safety, and efficiently handling emergency scenarios. Modern vehicles, equipped with advanced data collection tools, accumulate extensive information encompassing vehicle health, fuel requirements, and comprehensive location histories. This rich data repository is instrumental in forecasting future destinations and facilitating timely arrangements, embodying the essence of ambient intelligence within the Internet of Things (IoT) framework. In emergency contexts, the rapid analysis of vehicle data is crucial for identifying the nearest emergency facilities. This paper proposes an innovative approach that leverages machine learning and edge computing techniques to predict vehicles&#39; subsequent locations using large-scale data, concurrently prioritizing user privacy. We employ federated learning for processing at the network&#39;s edge and integrate a blockchain-based distributed database to ensure robust data privacy and security. The application of blockchain and federated learning in training models on expansive datasets is particularly effective in estimating the proximity to medical facilities and emergency services. Furthermore, this study introduces an optimization method to monitor vehicle speed and outlines a comprehensive attack model, along with effective protection measures. Our research contributes to illustrate the transformative potential of extensive data models and sophisticated machine learning methodologies in reshaping transportation systems, with a particular focus on safety and emergency response optimization.},

One of these scenarios can be formulated as an online continual learning (OCL) problem. That is, data come in an online fashion, and models are updated according to these streaming data. Two major OCL challenges are catastrophic forgetting and data imbalance. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose an Analytic Exemplar-Free Online Continual Learning algorithm (AEF-OCL). The AEF-OCL leverages analytic continual learning principles and employs ridge regression as a classifier for features extracted by a large backbone network. It solves the OCL problem by recursively calculating the analytical solution, ensuring an equalization between the continual learning and its joint-learning counterpart, and works without the need to save any used samples (i.e., exemplar-free). Additionally, we introduce a Pseudo-Features Generator (PFG) module that recursively estimates the mean and the variance of real features for each class. It over-samples offset pseudo-features from the same normal distribution as the real features, thereby addressing the data imbalance issue. Experimental results demonstrate that despite being an exemplar-free strategy, our method outperforms various methods on the autonomous driving SODA10M dataset.},

Incorporating artificial intelligence and machine learning, these LMs are poised to revolutionize various aspects of transportation.

Specifically, algorithms based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) are developed for distributed optimization of CAV trajectories. The synchronous ADMM and asynchronous ADMM algorithms enable parallelized coordination of large-scale CAV systems. Simultaneously, we propose a distributed training scheme where each CAV trains its cost and dynamics networks on simulators local to each vehicle. A central coordinator interacts with the vehicles to tune the coupling networks. Then, we introduce an innovative car-following model named the integrated velocity and acceleration fusion model that integrates state information from multiple lead and following vehicles to determine the optimal acceleration for the subject CAV. While we utilize graph sample and aggregate –based neural network and the gated recurrent unit and propose a model for recognizing driving intentions and predicting the trajectories of surrounding vehicles based on these theories.

  abstract     = {3D object detection in autonomous driving systems perceives the surrounding environment and is the foundation for autonomous driving. Due to the sparsity inherent in point clouds in autonomous driving scenarios, LiDAR-based 3D object detection often fails to distinguish distant objects effectively. Addressing the issue of point cloud sparsity will enhance the detection range in autonomous driving scenarios. Pseudo point clouds have been used to enhance the ability of deep learning models to detect distant points. However, this approach has several shortcomings. In this paper, a curbed fake point collector (CFPC), which addresses the three issues caused by pseudo points, is proposed to support 3D object detection for autonomous vehicles. First, for noise points with inaccurate coordinates, the dead pixel checker (DPC) calculates the depth map gradient using the Sobel operator. This approach enables the deep learning model to identify noise points. Second, because of the excessive quantity of points, sparse prioritized local sampling (SPLS) reduces the number of input point clouds to a lightweight level that can be accommodated by computing devices with limited memory. This is achieved through grid-based random sampling and real-point-prioritized farthest point sampling. This module effectively samples an appropriate pseudo point cloud based on the density of points in local space. Third, with respect to interference among channels, channel mask set abstraction (CMSA) isolates channels describing different information within the point cloud using GroupMLP, which is an MLP that separates channels into their respective groups. Group separation facilitates the extraction of features without mutual influence, allocating half of the output channels to color information and the other half to geometric information. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by the results of experiments conducted on the KITTI dataset. It is superior to the baseline in most situations, particularly in the categories of cars and riders.},

  abstract     = {The traditional vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) gradually evolved into the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), which has also become a potential target for attacks and faces security challenges in an open network environment. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) based on machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) are introduced to mitigate security threats. However, existing ML/DL-based IDS suffer from challenges in IoV environments. First, due to the limitations of ML/DL-based methods, classification performance is unsatisfactory when they extract only unidirectional contextual features or spatial characteristics. Second, existing research on in-vehicle network IDS often limits validation and testing to a static dataset of a single vehicle model. This approach may not adequately address diverse potential attacks in a dynamic environment. Third, few studies of hybrid IDS can simultaneously implement in-vehicle and extra-vehicle network intrusion detection. Large language models (LLM) have shown outstanding applications in fields such as natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). In particular, bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) obtain new state-of-the-art results on eleven famous NLP tasks. Consequently, this paper introduces a hybrid network IDS in IoV utilising LLM, denoted as IoV-BERT-IDS. This framework encompasses four modules: semantic extractor (SE), input embedding, IoV-BERT-IDS pre-training, and IoV-BERT-IDS fine-tuning. To conform to the BERT model, the semantic extractor is introduced to transform traffic data devoid of apparent semantics into contextual semantics, comprising bidirectional and unidirectional SE. Through SE, controller area network (CAN) data is transformed into a CAN byte sentence (CBS), while extra-vehicle network traffic data is transformed into a traffic byte sentence (TBS). Additionally, two pre-training tasks, the masked byte word model (MBWM) and next byte sentence prediction (NBSP) are proposed to acquire bidirectional contextual features from contextual semantics. These features can be adapted to downstream tasks in both in-vehicle and extra-vehicle networks through fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate that IoV-BERT-IDS outperforms in CICIDS, BoT-IoT, Car-Hacking, and In-vehicle network intrusion detection challenge (IVN-IDS) datasets and shows good generalisation capabilities to in-vehicle networks of different vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have been applied to the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) to provide convenience services such as traffic flow prediction. However, concerns regarding privacy and security are on the rise as huge amounts of data are aggregated to form large models (LMs). Although federated learning (FL), which trains and updates a model without sharing the actual datasets, has been intensively researched to prevent privacy breaches, there are still potential security threats like a single point of failure and intentional tampering with malicious data. This is because of the vulnerability of a central curator and a lack of authentication. As participants, they (i.e., vehicles) may unintentionally update low-quality data caused by poor wireless connectivity, unstable availability, and insufficient training datasets. They may also intentionally update unreliable data to carry out poisoning attacks. The divergence among local models, trained on non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data, can slow convergence and diminish model accuracy when these models are aggregated. Therefore, it is important to carefully select trustworthy participants. In this paper, we propose a new reliable and secure federated learning for IoV based on decentralized blockchain and reputation management. To cope with a single point of failure, injection of malicious data, and lack of authentication while ensuring privacy and traceability, our scheme combines blockchain and a lightweight digital signature. Moreover, we employ the concept of the reputation of vehicles to select suitable participants with reliability, ultimately improving accuracy. Security analysis results, including comparisons with previous works, prove that the proposed scheme can address security concerns. The results of performance evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular networks have huge potential to improve road safety and traffic efficiency, especially in the context of large models. Cloud computing can significantly improve the performance of vehicular networks, and the concept of cloud-assisted vehicular networks comes into being. Reputation management plays a crucial role in vehicular networks, since it can help each vehicle evaluate the trustworthiness of the other vehicles and the received messages. Reputation updating is essential in reputation management and it is usually done by the Trusted Authority (TA) regularly after collecting, decrypting, and verifying a large number of reputation feedbacks, which leads to great computation and communication overheads on the TA side and even makes the TA become the bottleneck of reputation management system. In this paper, we propose a novel Privacy-Preserving Reputation Updating (PPRU) scheme for cloud-assisted vehicular networks based on the Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and Paillier algorithms, in which the reputation feedbacks are collected and preprocessed by the honest-but-curious Cloud Service Provider (CSP) in a privacy-preserving manner, and the computation and communication overheads on the TA side can be dramatically reduced by about 88.36% and 83.88% as a result, respectively. Meanwhile, the proposed scheme can provide strong privacy preservation, strong security, and robust reputation management with acceptable computation and communication overheads. Furthermore, the comprehensive theoretical analysis and simulation evaluation are conducted, and the results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is significantly superior to the existing schemes in several aspects.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, concomitant with the rapid advancements in large models (LMs) technologies within the field of artificial intelligence (AI), the domain of intelligent Internet of Vehicles (IoV) network has also experienced swift progress. Those potential applications such as autonomous driving, intelligent driver assistance systems, personalized driver experience, and traffic flow and urban mobility management are dependent on the excellent IoV wireless communications system. However, there still exist many fundamental challenges when involving LMs into IoV network. How to provide effective coverage for intervening massive heterogeneous terminals in complex dynamic wireless network environments is a challenging problem. Besides, the generalization and robustness of beamforming within various scenarios are the fundamental for IoV applications mentioned above. To address the aforementioned issues, we in this paper formulate and integrate LMs to achieve excellent hybrid beamforming within IoV wireless communications system which is aided by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and base stations (BSs) to provide additional channels and coverage gains. Benefiting from RISs, wireless channels become complex and reconstructable, thus providing the possibility of creating LMs based hybrid beamforming. The proposed LMs are formulated by utilizing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to effectively interact with environments so that robust beamforming can be maintained within RIS aided IoV network. Finally, we exploit the excellent performance of LMs enabled hybrid beamforming and investigate the impact of critical learning parameters. Comprehensive experimental results have consistently confirmed that the proposed LMs enabled hybrid beamforming for RIS aided IoV outperforms traditional schemes in the respect of system throughput and network coverage under dynamic wireless environments.},

  abstract     = {The advancement of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) significantly relies on the integration of Internet-of-Things technology for real-time data processing and decision-making. Object detection, a critical component of AVs, necessitates utilizing machine learning techniques. However, this poses challenges including data privacy and the inefficiency of transmitting large volumes of data to a central server. To overcome these challenges, we employ Federated Learning (FL), which allows local devices to train a global model without sharing their raw data. While effective, synchronous federated learning can be time-consuming due to stragglers and often encounter device dropout issues. In contrast, asynchronous federated learning provides faster updates but frequently yields sub-optimal models compared to its synchronous counterpart. Motivated by that, in this paper, we introduce a novel FL framework that combines the strengths of both synchronous and asynchronous methods. Further, by organizing devices into a hierarchical structure, we aim to optimize model convergence while mitigating straggler and dropout problems. Moreover, deploying large models on local edge devices is impractical due to limited computational capabilities, necessitating the adoption of lightweight models to mitigate prolonged training and prediction duration. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we conduct a series of experiments using publicly available datasets and subsequently compare the results.

  abstract     = {This paper develops a new approach of large language model (LLM) enhanced reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), in a bid to achieve energy-efficient and reliable communication in 6G Internet of Vehicles (IoV). It is well known that RIS offers an innovative solution to improve signal quality by intelligently adjusting the propagation path of radio waves. However, configuring RIS in the dynamically changing vehicular environment remains a challenge. This study leverages the analytical capabilities of LLM, combined with key IoV data such as channel status, vehicle movement patterns, and quality of service requirements, to model and optimize RIS-based IoV communication systems. The work focuses on constructing a real-time model of the RIS-based IoV wireless transmission system and proposes an optimal strategy for wireless resource allocation. Through comprehensive simulation results, this paper justifies the significant performance advantages of LLM-enhanced RIS, demonstrating a viable technical pathway for the development of 6G IoV.},
