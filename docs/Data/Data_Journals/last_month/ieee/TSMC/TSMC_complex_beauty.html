Instead of assuming that the premise variables are precisely available for the controller, this work provides linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) conditions to design controller gains depending on premise variables with additive uncertainties. This uncertainty model includes inexact measurements of the premise variables due to sensor devices or an approximate representation in the T-S modeling, which can assume the form of absolute uncertainties in the membership functions. Numerical examples illustrate the robustness of the approach.},

  abstract     = {Multiobjective multitask optimization (MO-MTO) aims to exploit the similarities among different multiobjective optimization tasks through knowledge transfer (KT), facilitating their simultaneous resolution. The effective design of KT techniques embedded in multiobjective evolutionary optimizers is crucial for enhancing the performance of multiobjective multitask evolutionary algorithms (MO-MTEAs). However, a significant limitation of existing KT techniques in MO-MTEAs is their equal treatment of particles/individuals for transferred knowledge reception, which can negatively impact the balance of diversity and convergence in population evolution. To remedy this limitation, this article proposes a new MO-MTEA, named MTEA-DCK, which incorporates diversity-oriented KT (DKT) and convergence-oriented KT (CKT) techniques tailored for different particles in the population. MTEA-DCK utilizes a strength-Pareto-based competitive mechanism to divide particles into winners and losers: 1) for winners, DKT is conducted via an intertask domain alignment approach to enhance population diversity and 2) for losers, CKT is executed within the unified search space to improve convergence. Additionally, to ensure robust performance on complex task combinations, we introduce two automatic parameter control strategies specifically designed for these KT techniques. MTEA-DCK was performed on 39 benchmark MO-MTO problems and demonstrated superior performance compared to eight state-of-the-art MO-MTEAs and six multiobjective evolutionary algorithms. Finally, we present three real-world MO-MTO application cases, where our approach also yielded better results than other algorithms.},

This happens even when the adaptive dynamics are based on established tools like model reference adaptive control (MRAC). This work starts from the observation that existing MRAC-based leaderless designs stop at asymptotic consensus, lacking of any guarantee for exponential consensus or parameter identification. The main contribution of this work is to show a new design departing from the existing ones in terms of exploiting persistence of excitation (PE): the proposed design is the first one attaining exponential consensus with exponential parameter identification over leaderless directed graphs. In the special case that the unknown parameters are homogeneous, PE can be relaxed to a weaker cooperative PE (C-PE) condition. The design is illustrated and verified alongside the state-of-the-art.},

Finally, the presented consensus control policy is extended to address the group formation tracking problem (GFTP) of nonholonomic mobile robots, with a numerical example to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed results.

In addition, the transient and steady-state performance of the robot system is difficult to specify in advance. In this article, a novel composite learning fixed-time (FxT) control strategy is proposed for the robotic systems to deal with these issues. The funnel control (FC) is utilized to transform the original error system into a new error dynamics with transient performance constraints. The two-phase nonsingular FxT sliding mode surface is constructed to avoid the singularity problem. Then, the filter operation is introduced to obtain the expression of parameter estimation error and is used to design the composite learning law. To achieve parameter estimation, a FxT composite learning law based on online historical data and regression extension is proposed, where the interval excitation (IE) is considered in the adaptive law. Finally, the designed adaption is incorporated into the nonsingular FxT sliding mode control to achieve tracking control. Moreover, the comparison of three different controllers is made to demonstrate the benefits of the developed control strategy.},

It is noticeable that when the DoS attacker is active, the controller does not receive any information, which makes the controller fail to work. To tackle the challenge, an adaptive NN switching state observer is first built to estimate the unmeasurable states. Second, an FTPP function is constructed to boost the transient and steady-state performances of NCSs. Third, under the framework of the backstepping technique, an adaptive command filter is established by combining the dynamic adaptive technique with the switching state observer, which handles the “complexity explosion” problem and improves the robustness of NCSs. Besides, it is rigorously proved mathematically that the boundedness of all signals in the closed-loop system and the designed controller compels the tracking error to fall into the predefined boundary within a finite time. Finally, an application-oriented example of the single-link robotic arm system is utilized to demonstrate the viability of the proposed control method.},

To expand the attraction domain within the local FTS framework, a piecewise fractional-order differential inequality based on impulsive control systems is proposed. Subsequently, a new hybrid control strategy is designed by integrating a simple feedback controller with an impulsive controller involving a finite number of impulses, which can be accurately calculated using the proposed impulsive degree. Additionally, a set of local/global FTS criteria is formulated, and the settling time can be explicitly estimated.

The USV systems are first modeled by Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy systems. To reduce the communication resources and controller update times, an event-triggered mechanism is designed via employing the sampled augmented systems states and triggered control input signals. Based on the developed event-triggered mechanism and Bellman optimality theory, a fuzzy optimal event-triggered control (ETC) approach is presented. Since solution of optimal control policy reduces to algebraic Riccati equations (AREs), its analytical solution is difficult to solve directly. Then, to search its approximation solution, a VI algorithm is formulated. By rigorous proof, the proposed optimal ETC scheme can assure that the USVs systems are asymptotically stable and the Q-learning algorithm is convergent. Finally, the simulation and comparisons results with previous optimal controllers verify the feasibility of the presented optimal ETC scheme.},

Specifically, partial-state variables are decomposed into a sum of two vector signals s and N. Then, setting s as the output vector, a new normal form is derived. For the new normal form, N and an auxiliary signal are designed to exponentially stabilize the unstable zero/internal dynamics of the auxiliary system; and the real input is designed to ensure that $s $ is exponentially stable. In particular, the zero/internal dynamics dependence on the input is fully considered in this article, and the proposed method ensures global stabilization of the closed-loop system without relying on the existence condition of Lyapunov functions.

The anti-swing control issue of tower crane with varying suspension cable length and double spherical pendulum effect is still open. Furthermore, the system parameters uncertainty makes it more challenging to implement anti-swing control. In this study, we present an adaptive sliding mode anti-swing control approach based on time-delay estimation for underactuated tower crane with varying suspension cable length and double spherical pendulum effect. First, we employ the Lagrange’s method to develop a seven-degree-of-freedom (7-DOF) tower crane dynamic model that comprehensively accounts for jib slewing, trolley motion, payload hoisting/lowering, and payload/hook spherical swing within a three-dimensional (3-D) space. Then, a sliding mode surface is constructed by analyzing the nonlinear coupling relationship between the unactuated states and actuated states. The time-delay estimation technique with adaptive scheme can adapt and predicate unknown system parameters online. An adaptive sliding mode anti-swing control method with time-delay estimation is designed for 7-DOF tower crane system subject to the parameter uncertainties. The convergence of the closed-loop control system is carefully demonstrated through the Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, the hardware experiments verify the anti-swing control performance and robustness of the designed adaptive sliding mode controller. The superiority of the proposed adaptive sliding mode anti-swing controller is confirmed by a decrease of at least 42.09% and 58.33% in the maximum and residual payload swing, respectively, over state-of-the-art control methods.},

  abstract     = {Symbolic regression is commonly considered in wide-ranging applications due to its inherent capability for learning both structure and weighting parameters of an interpretable model. However, for those scenarios that require fitting multiple expressions (MEs) synchronously, existing symbolic regression algorithms need to run multiple times step by step asynchronously for fitting such a group of expressions. Due to lacking mechanisms to explicitly capture and leverage the relationships between these expressions, the coupling information among MEs will be lost in this approach. A multiexpression symbolic regression algorithm (ME-SR) is proposed in this article to address the issue in learning MEs. Additionally, a methodology for extracting the approximate maximum common subexpression (aMCSE) among these MEs is suggested to disclose the relationships. A new metric is formulated to measure the quality of an aMCSE in ME-SR by imitating the concept of intersection over union. Furthermore, an adaptive cross matrix is incorporated into the algorithm to balance the search efforts between intertask and intratask domains. The proposed ME-SR demonstrates superior performance when compared to its counterparts of single expression symbolic regression on the designed test set. Finally, the efficacy of the method is well verified by a real-world circuit design case.},

  abstract     = {Aiming at the large differences between tasks in continuous remaining useful life (RUL) prediction and the limited information capturing capability of the existing continuous learning (CL) methods, this article develops a novel multibranch horizontal augmentation network (MBHAN). First, a hierarchical self-attention (HSA) mechanism is proposed to capture the local degradation features and dependencies at different scales and enhance the representation capacity of RUL prediction model. Based on HSA and temporal convolutional network (TCN), a time-frequency fusion TCN (TFFTCN) is designed to mine the hidden degradation information from the time-domain and frequency-domain data. Then, a memory weight constraint (MWC) regularization term is built to control the update of important parameters for pervious tasks during the learning of new task. A horizontal network augmentation rule based on the task similarity and MWC is proposed, including the augmentation of a task branch network for small task difference and the augmentation of a feature extraction backbone network for large task difference. On this basis, the MBHAN is proposed to continuously predict RUL of machinery. Finally, the experimental results on the life-cycle bearing and gear datasets demonstrate that TFFTCN achieve an average accuracy of 93% across both datasets, surpassing the existing prediction methods.},

The target of the problem is to minimize the timewise tracking error and the input drifts, which are combined by a time-iteration-dependent factor. By searching the nearest available pass at each time instant for the current iteration, the optimal control gain can be obtained. Theoretical analysis indicates that the tracking error converges asymptotically in spite of the actuator fault and the robustness against the shifted initial state is further proven.

  abstract     = {Peak carbon emissions and carbon neutrality have become important initiatives for the country to solve outstanding problems of resource and environmental constraints and promote green and low-energy development, and have attracted widespread attention from the industry. The distributed flow shop scheduling problem (DPFSP) is a typical problem that mainly works by consuming energy. However, DPFSP rarely considers energy efficiency and blocking constraints. In this study, an excellent bi-population cooperative discrete differential evolution (BCDDE) is proposed, aiming to address the energy-efficient distributed blocking flow shop scheduling problem (EEDBFSP) with total energy consumption (TEC) and total tardiness (TTD) as two objectives. A bi-population cooperative strategy is constructed to enhance the diversity of BCDDE, while utilizing it to initialize the population to enhance the quality of the initial solution. An adaptive local search operator strategy is developed to improve the BCDDE convergence. Critical and noncritical paths are devised to further optimize TEC and TTD objectives. The efficiency of each strategy related to BCDDE is verified and compared with state-of-the-art algorithms in the benchmark suite. Numerical results show that BCDDE becomes an efficient optimizer for the EEDBFSP, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art algorithms at the 95% confidence interval.},

This study makes significant advancements by leveraging the mixed-variable nature of EOPCCVs in two crucial ways. First, it introduces a novel hybrid approach combining differential evolution and upper confidence bound sampling (DEUCB), designed to explore the mixed search space effectively. Second, a specialized value distance metric (VDM) is proposed, integrating continuous and categorical variables, to enhance the accuracy of the radial basis function (RBF) model approximation. Finally, we present a customized evolutionary expensive optimization algorithm (CEEO), which seamlessly incorporates DEUCB and RBF-VDM into the widely utilized global and local surrogate-assisted evolutionary optimization framework. Experimental results, compared against state-of-the-art counterparts on three distinct sets of benchmark problems and a convolutional neural network hyperparameter optimization task, consistently affirm the efficacy of the proposed CEEO in addressing EOPCCVs.

To address this dilemma, this article studies a local knowledge transfer-based evolutionary algorithm for constrained multitask optimization. To be specific, each task population is divided into multiple niches to enhance the diversity and control the intensity of knowledge transfer, thus avoiding excessive transfer of knowledge. Then a new similarity judgment method based on the information feedback of pioneer individuals is developed to judge the similarity between tasks and whether to perform knowledge transfer. Furthermore, two different transfer methods: a direct transfer and a learning transfer, are devised to perform knowledge transfer among niches pertaining to different tasks. In addition, an excellent-information-guided mutation mechanism is proposed to prevent niches from getting trapped in local optima and to promote rapid convergence. The system experiment on 18 constrained multitask test instances and 2 real-world problems demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms or is at least comparable to other EMTO algorithms and constrained single-objective optimization algorithms.},

However, owing to complex architectures, existing approaches have failed to achieve high accuracies in real-time applications. In this article, a novel knowledge distillation (KD) SegFormer-based network, called KDSNet-S*, is proposed to explore the tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, a structured KD scheme is designed to transfer the rich advanced features of a teacher network (KDSNet-T) to a student network (KDSNet-S). Thereafter, the KDSNet-S network learns the precise segmentation ability of the KDSNet-T network. Additionally, a multifield perceptual fusion model is proposed to learn more integrated features for a single modality and obtain discriminative and comprehensive feature representations. Furthermore, a high-level feature integration module is introduced to refine multimodality high-level features. Finally, multilevel features are fused, and a label-decoupling-based three-stream decoder that decomposes the original semantic segmentation map into center and contour diffusion maps for different supervision tasks is introduced. Experimental results on two public red-green–blue-thermal semantic segmentation datasets indicate the superiority of KDSNet-S* over compared state-of-the-art methods. The KDSNet-S* reduces parameters and floating-point operations per second by 91.1% and 81.9%, respectively, compared with the KDSNet-T.

Considering the asynchrony among the agents, we develop an algorithm in which agents compute and communicate individually, without any form of synchronized coordination. Agents perform their local updates by local communication with their immediate neighbors, and this may involve the use of stale information. Since asynchrony naturally leads to latency or packet loss, an asynchronous robust gradient tracking mechanism is developed to guarantee estimating the average of agents’ gradients precisely. Moreover, it employs uncoordinated step-sizes which are more flexible and general than constant or decaying step-size. When the global objective is strongly convex and the local objectives have Lipschitz-continuous gradients, we prove that each agent executing the asynchronous algorithm linearly converges to the consensus optimal point at an $\mathcal {O}(\lambda ^{k})$ rate, where $\lambda \in (0,1)$ is convergence factor and k represents the iteration number, with a step satisfying a tight explicit upper bound. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our algorithm has better advantages over the state-of-the-art asynchronous algorithms.},

Using behavioral incentives via trust to encourage voluntary preference adjustments improves consensus through mutual agreement. This article aims to establish a trust incentive-driven framework for enabling consensus in social network group decision making (SN-GDM). First, a trust incentive mechanism is modeled via interactive trust functions that integrate risk attitude. The inclusion of risk attitude is crucial as it reflects the diverse ways decision makers (DMs) respond to uncertainty in trusting others’ judgments, capturing the varied behaviors of risky, neutral, and insurance DMs in the consensus process. Inconsistent DMs then adjust opinions in exchange for heightened trust. This mechanism enhances the importance degrees via a new weight assignment method, serving as a reward to motivate DMs to further align with the majority. Subsequently, a trust incentive-driven bounded maximum consensus model is proposed to optimize cooperation dynamics while preventing over-compensation of adjustments. Simulations and comparative analysis demonstrate the model’s efficacy in facilitating cooperation through tailored trust incentive mechanisms that account for these diverse risk preferences. Finally, the approach is applied to evaluate candidates for the Norden Shipping Scholarship, providing a cooperation-focused SN-GDM framework for achieving mutually agreeable solutions while acknowledging the impact of individual risk attitude on trust-based interactions.},

Comparison experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the priority dispatching rules, genetic programming and four popular reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods, with performance improvements mostly exceeding 10%.

Specifically, first, we consider three different switching point locations, and establish some sufficient criteria ensuring that NNs with n-neurons can have, and only have, $5^{n_{1}}\cdot 3^{n_{2}}$ equilibrium points (EPs) with $n_{1}+n_{2}=n$ , by utilizing the geometric features of the sigmoidal functions, the fixed point theorem, the Filippov’s EP definition, and the contraction mapping theorem. Then, based on novel Lyapunov functions and by applying the fractional-order calculus theory, it is demonstrated that $3^{n_{1}}\cdot 2^{n_{2}}$ out of $5^{n_{1}}\cdot 3^{n_{2}}$ total EPs are locally stable. This work’s investigation reveals that competitive NNs with switching afford more storage capacity compared to the nonswitching case. Additionally, our results are valid for the integer-order and fractional-order switched NNs, improving and generalizing current works. Furthermore, two numerical examples and an application example of associative memory are provided to validate the effectiveness of the theoretical findings, and the way various fractional orders affect the NNs’ convergence speed is shown through simulations.},

A comprehensive model is established to characterize partial state saturations, wherein only a part of the state variables are saturated while the remaining variables maintain normal conditions. To conserve communication resources, an ABETM is employed to determine the release of system measurements to the PIO. Before transmission over the communication network, the triggered signal is quantized through a probabilistic quantization mechanism. The goal of this article is to devise a PIO that guarantees ultimate boundedness of the estimation error dynamics in the mean square. Initially, a sufficient condition is derived to ensure that the estimation error dynamics are exponentially ultimately bounded in the mean square. Following this, necessary PIO gains are identified by solving specific matrix inequalities, and the efficacy of this proposed PIO approach is validated using a three-tank system simulation.},

  abstract     = {This article is concerned with the privacy preservation problem for scaled consensus in nonlinear multiagent systems (MASs) through sampled data. In scaled consensus, the aim is for agents’ states to achieve specified proportions rather than converging to a single value, and this approach encompasses standard consensus, bipartite consensus, and cluster consensus within its framework. To prevent the leakage of sensitive data during communication, a novel privacy-preserving scaled distributed protocol is proposed. This protocol uses homomorphic encryption, whereby agents initially encrypt their information and transmit it in ciphertext form to neighboring agents. The control protocol is then reconstructed by the agents using the encrypted information received from their neighbors. A modified Halanay-like inequality is formulated and, by leveraging algebraic graph theory and the Lyapunov stability theorem, sufficient conditions are established to ensure that the MASs can achieve exponentially ultimately bounded scaled consensus. Furthermore, a convex optimization method is adopted to identify the optimal control gain so as to maximize the allowable sampling interval bound. The theoretical results are substantiated through a numerical simulation.},

  abstract     = {The Epileptor model is a mathematical framework utilized for simulating the transition from interictal to ictal local field potential (LFP) activity in the brain, with the aim of predicting and preventing epileptic seizures. This article introduces a novel approach integrating Lyapunov and Poincaré–Bendixson methods to analyze the stability of limit cycles in nonlinear systems, specifically focusing on Epileptors with a two-state dynamic. Our method accurately delineates the limit cycle boundary through eigenvalue-based analysis, facilitating precise assessment of stability properties and identification of critical regions linked to seizure initiation and termination. Through the investigation of the two-state dynamics of Epileptors, we gain deeper insights into the transition between low activity and seizure states, consequently improving our understanding of epileptic seizures. Our approach can be employed to establish stability conditions and determine the existence of limit cycles in Epileptor models, which can further aid in predicting and preventing epileptic seizures by identifying critical regions associated with seizure initiation and termination. The simulations conducted in this study demonstrate that the model under investigation exhibits stable limit cycle behavior and manifests bifurcation, with significant implications for the development of targeted interventions and more effective prediction and treatments for epilepsy. The findings indicate that the suggested approach establishes that external stimulation should not surpass 10.8 mA. Moreover, the initial normal state lies within the range of −1.6 to −0.1 ictal LFP. On the other hand, the LaSalle and eigenvalue methods individually cannot precisely determine the limit cycle region.},

The network’s adaptability extends to varying internal stiffness levels, offering robustness to changes in robotic system characteristics. Through comprehensive experimental studies, we investigate the impact of input signal types, wavelet types, wavelet scale ranges, and time-moving window sizes on collision detection performance, offering critical insights for optimal CWT parameter selection. Additionally, our transferability analysis demonstrates that the CWT-CNN can seamlessly adapt from one joint to another, requiring only minimal free-motion data from the new joint. This adaptability is validated through extensive experiments on an industrial robot and the robot equipped with variable stiffness actuators. In conclusion, the CWT-CNN is highly generalizable and data-efficient, making it a reliable solution for real-time collision detection in human-robot interactions, addressing a key aspect of safety in collaborative environments.},

  abstract     = {Safe exploration can be regarded as a constrained Markov decision problem (CMDP) where the expected long-term cost is constrained. Previous off-policy algorithms convert the constrained optimization problem into the corresponding unconstrained dual problem by introducing the Lagrangian relaxation technique. However, the cost function of the above algorithms provides inaccurate estimations and causes the instability of the Lagrange multiplier learning. In this article, we present a novel off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm called conservative distributional maximum a posteriori policy optimization (CDMPO). At first, to accurately judge whether the current situation satisfies the constraints, CDMPO adapts distributional RL method to estimate the Q-function and C-function. Then, CDMPO uses a conservative value function loss to reduce the number of violations of constraints during the exploration process. In addition, we utilize adaptive proportional integral derivative (APID) to update the Lagrange multiplier stably. In our experiments, we select eight representative constrained tasks from two well-known safe RL benchmarks (Safety Gym and Bullet Safety Gym), providing a comprehensive evaluation of our methods across diverse scenarios. Empirical results show that the proposed method has fewer violations of constraints in the early exploration process. The final test results also illustrate that our method has better-risk control capabilities.},

This article studies the finite-time synchronization of coupled FOSs with nonlinearity via fuzzy intermittent quantized control and two novel fractional-order differential inequalities. An interval-type 2 Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy technique is introduced, which not only facilitates the handling of the nonlinear term in the error dynamic system, but also greatly simplifies the control design. Synchronization conditions in form of linear matrix inequalities are provided by designing a novel Lyapunov function on the basis of ellipsoidal norm. Moreover, two corollaries show the generality of the new analysis framework. Compared with existing results, it is amazing that the decreasing magnitude of Lyapunov function on the control intervals can be smaller than its increasing magnitude on the subsequent noncontrol interval. Finally, Chua’s system is used to clarify the effectiveness of theoretical outcomes.},

The first strategy prefers feasibility. It tends to obtain a feasible solution by utilizing the predicted value and uncertainty provided by Gaussian process (GP). The second strategy prefers objective improvement. It maintains and evolves the population of evolutionary algorithms, and selects a solution with a good objective function value and violating the constraints not too much based on the predicted value and uncertainty provided by GP at each iteration. The sequential implementation of these two strategies allows CEBO to balance feasibility and objective improvement. The effectiveness of CEBO is verified by 26 test instances and a practical application. The results demonstrate that CEBO is able to find high-quality solutions with 100 FEs.},

Most vehicles use a variety of different sensors to improve robustness. A vital part of these is the radar sensor. It provides the vehicle not only with location but also with valuable velocity information from surrounding objects. The increasing usage of radar systems in road traffic also causes problems in terms of mutual interference between different radar sensors. This interference leads to broadband disturbances in the signal which must be mitigated to ensure reliable object detection and object angle estimation. In this article, we compare different variants of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in their ability to mitigate mutual interference for multiantenna radar data. We analyze the potential of using multiantenna data for real-valued CNN (RVCNN) and complex-valued (CVCNN) models, comparing detection, phase reconstruction, and angle estimation performances. Furthermore, we propose a complex-valued CVCNN (CVCNN) architecture using a modified batch normalization method that omits activation scaling. Our experiments show, that using multiantenna data in combination with CVCNNs can greatly improve detection, phase, as well as angle estimation performance and that activation scaling is detrimental to our CVCNN architecture.},

Several positive augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii (L-K) functionals are proposed by introducing integral quadratic functions based on the L-K stability theorem. To further reduce the estimation gap caused by the existing integral inequalities, which were applied for dealing with the derived augmented-type integral term from augmented functional, some refined matrix-separation-based inequalities are introduced. With fewer decision variables, the proposed method considers the information among the system state, its derivative, and their related terms. After these, some cubic functions in the time-varying delay appear and show nonconvexity. Then, negative definite conditions are imposed on such cubic terms to obtain the stability criterion in the form of the linear matrix inequality (LMI). Inspired by the Taylor’s expansion methodology and the delay-partitioning techniques, we improve the existing negative definite conditions on the cubic function without introducing any decision variable. For linear systems with a time-varying delay, this relaxed condition, the refined matrix-separation-based inequalities, and the constructed L-K functionals, are combined to produce a less conservatism stability criterion.

Building on the principles of arbitrage pricing theory (APT), this study introduces a dynamic neural network model aimed at minimizing investment risk, optimizing portfolio allocation within predefined constraints, and maximizing returns. First, a convex optimization objective function incorporating risk constraints is formulated based on APT principles. This is followed by the introduction of a novel dynamic neural network model designed to solve the convex optimization problem, accompanied by comprehensive theoretical analysis and rigorous proofs. The study uses two distinct datasets sourced from Yahoo Finance, consisting of 30 selected stocks, covering a span of 250 valid trading days to validate the proposed methodology. The results of 30 different stock market scenario experiments indicate that, when the upper limit for investment risk is set at $3.285 \times 10^{-4}$ , the expected maximum investment return exceeds the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) index by 16.2816%. These empirical findings highlight the viability, stability, and efficacy of the proposed approach and framework, demonstrating its potential applicability for real-time, high-frequency trading scenarios.

  abstract     = {The State of Charge (SoC) is an important parameter of a battery energy storage system (BESS), and its balance problem is also an issue worth studying in a multi-BESS network. Recently, some researchers have proposed a power allocation method, claiming that as long as the power sharing state and SoC balance state can be obtained in real-time, it can not only maintain supply and demand balance, but also ensure that any BESS will not exit early due to insufficient energy storage. Considering this, we are attempting to design a distributed dynamic average tracking algorithm based on multiagent systems (MASs) with prescribed transient and steady state performance to estimate the power sharing and SoC balance states of a BESSs network with dynamic load in a distributed manner. Two versions of the solution are designed here, where one is event triggered and the other is self triggered. These two schemes ensure the performance of the estimators under intermittent communication to varying degrees, respectively. In each constructed estimation scheme, prescribed performance control (PPC) method is implemented to ensure the expected steady-state and dynamic performance, which is encapsulated in a performance function. Thus, it achieves almost zero error estimation of the fast time-varying power sharing and the SoC balance states. In addition, consensus and average tracking performance are decoupled, which provides convenience for parameters tuning. Finally, to verify the results of the theoretical analysis, some cases are studied and relevant simulations are performed on a 4 bus system.},

The identifier, critic, actor, and disturbance neural networks (NNs) are employed to estimate unknown dynamics, assess system performance, carry out control actions, and derive the worst disturbance strategy, respectively. With the scheme, the persistent excitation requirements are removed by adopting simplified NNs updating laws, which are derived using the gradient descent method toward designed positive functions instead of the square of Bellman residual. For achieving the desired error precision within the prescribed time, a constraining function and an error transformation scheme are employed. In addition, to enhance the system’s robustness, a fault observer is utilized to compensate for the impact of the unknown nonlinear faults. The stability of the closed-loop system is assured, while the prescribed performance is realized. Finally, simulation examples validate the effectiveness of the proposed optimal control strategy.},

  abstract     = {This article focuses on stabilizing highly nonlinear hybrid stochastic complex dynamical networks with time delays (HSCNT) via sampled-data control with asynchronously periodic self-triggered intermittent decentralized strategy (SCAPI). Considering the constraints imposed by linear growth conditions in real models, we introduce high nonlinearity into the networks. Moreover, considering the possibility of nonsimultaneous transmission of control information by the controllers, the asynchronous decentralization is thus brought in periodic self-triggered intermittent control for the first instance. Then, to resolve the problems caused by asynchronous decentralization, a graph-theoretic approach is employed. Combining this with an auxiliary timer, an innovative Lyapunov functional is designed, after which an original Lyapunov-based method is proposed to cope with the complexity of introducing high nonlinearity and asynchronous decentralization into networks. In particular, some numerical simulations are provided for demonstration.},

  abstract     = {The precise modeling of dynamic systems with periodic trajectories is required to describe diverse systems in mechanical, electrical, and many other disciplines. Nevertheless, the modeling task based on traditional methodologies could be complicated, considering the specific nature of periodic motions in actual systems. Differential neural networks (DNNs) are modeling tools for dynamic systems that can be useful for developing precise representations of periodic systems. This study presents the design of a novel family of DNN identifiers that could reproduce the trajectories of periodic systems with an uncertain mathematical model. The suggested DNN identifiers may produce an approximate model with periodic properties similar to the system under analysis exhibiting an one-period convergence of DNN weights. The fundamentals of the Floquet’s theory drive the design of the learning laws to ensure the reproduction of the periodic properties in the DNN. The design of a controlled Lyapunov function allows the learning laws to be derived for the DNN weights whose evolution depends on the positive definite solution of a periodic differential Lyapunov equation. Several numerical evaluations on periodic systems confirmed the modeling performance of the proposed identifier when the approximation performance is compared with traditional DNN identifiers using sigmoidal functions.},

In order to enhance the system robustness against DoS attacks, a rapid exponential stabilization (RES) method is leveraged in controller design to accelerate the convergence rate of the system state. Meanwhile, to take into account the performance boundary of the system state, the learning algorithms are designed to mitigate the peaking phenomenon due to the high-gain feedback in the RES method. In the adaptation law design, $\sigma $ -modification combined with G+D estimator is adopted to robustly shape the dynamics of closed-loop system and enhance the steady-state performance. Through Lyapunov stability analysis, it is proved that the CPSs under the proposed control scheme can accommodate the effect of DoS attacks of nearly arbitrary intensity, i.e., the communication is not completely blocked.

In our work, we bridge social psychology and recommender systems to develop a social recommendation model, nonlinearly utilizing latent user preferences and item features to simulate the intrinsic formation of users’ decision-making. We extend the cognitive opinion formation mechanism by improving the two-stage process and seamlessly combine it and matrix factorization, simulating the nonlinear interactions between users and items. We incorporate the implicit user influence and explicit social dynamics with bounded confidence effect into the nonlinear cognitive recommendation framework to characterize the evolutionary preference interactions among users. We conduct comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets to compare the proposed method with the state-of-the-art models. The results indicate that our method makes notable improvements in rating prediction for all users and cold-start users.

Subsequently, the transformed model and reinforcement learning (RL) theory are integrated to obtain a novel data-driven distributed learning framework. This framework enables online learning of the optimal control law and ensures tracking consensus of all followers’ position and velocity states. Compared to the traditional actor–critic framework, an additional neural network (NN) is utilized to approximate the forward reward information (FRI) to improve the information learning capability of the MASs. Furthermore, the convergence analysis of system states and three NNs structures are conducted by Lyapunov theory. Finally, the proposed framework is verified to have better convergence and require fewer iteration steps than classical actor–critic framework by numerical simulation comparison experiments.},

However, when agent resources are scarce, assignment strategies aimed at eliminating agent conflicts become infeasible. Consequently, there is a need to select the optimal assignment with a minimal number of agent conflicts, which is essentially a nonlinear bilevel optimization problem. To tackle this issue, we first design the group role assignment with minimized agent conflicts (GRAMAC) model to formalize this problem. It converts this problem into an extended integer linear programming (x-ILP) one and finds the optimal solution. Then, we prove that solving the GRAMAC model is an $\mathscr {NP} - \mathrm {complete}$ task. Moreover, we identify the sufficient and necessary condition under which the GRAMAC model has the optimal conflict-free solution. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to existing strategies, our proposed method reduces the number of agent conflicts by an average of approximately 30% while ensuring the group performance of the collaborative system.},

However, its configuration optimization in confined three-dimensional (3-D) space is very complicated due to infinite configurations of inverse kinematics solutions. This article proposes a spatial triarc planning method in response to the issue mentioned above. A reasonable triarc configuration can be optimized by this method based on six input parameters, i.e., the proximal control point and tangent vector, distal control point and tangent vector, and two centers of curvature circles in both two-dimensional (2-D) and 3-D space. This method has the following three advantages. First, the task configuration of a spatial triarc can be predicted by presetting the relationship between the proximal and distal tangent vectors. Furthermore, the configuration of the middle and inner concentric cable-driven mechanism can be controlled by adjusting the direction of the distal tangent vector. Additionally, the proportion of each concentric cable-driven mechanism can be controlled by changing centers of curvature circles. Finally, the proposed spatial triarc planning method is verified by simulations and experiments. Results show that the maximum errors of the C-shaped spatial triarc and the S-shaped spatial triarc experiments are 1.68 mm and 1.36 mm, respectively.},

We emphasize the impact of TPs on FS-MJSs by utilizing known TPs and introducing them into sufficient conditions for MSS. Numerically testable stability criteria for FS-MJSs in the sense of MSS are provided. The existence criteria are suggested to design the controller to guarantee the MSS of the closed-loop FS-MJSs.

Moreover, to eliminate the effect arising from the repeated derivatives of the virtual control signal, a predefined-time filter is embedded into the backstepping-based controller.

A memory-based mode-dependent resilient event-triggering scheme (MMRETS) based on aperiodically sampled data is designed to avoid Zeno behavior and continuous monitor, which has the advantages in mitigating the transmission times and tolerating the DoS attacks. Meanwhile, the asynchronous circumstance between the system and corresponding event-triggered controller in the absence of DoS attacks is characterized via a hidden Markov model (HMM). Subsequently, by using a novel Lyapunov functional and an iterative approach, sufficient conditions are obtained to guarantee the ${\mathcal {H}}_{\infty }$ performance of the resultant Markov closed-loop system. Finally, a practical truck-trailer model example is provided to illustrate the efficacy and benefits of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {Interaction stability is an important concern in variable admittance control, and it is a prerequisite for achieving the desired compliant interaction with humans or uncertain environments. Different variable admittance controllers with essential stability analyses are required for multiple interaction scenarios in a complex task, where stability analysis is the major difficulty. In this article, we propose a unified stability-guaranteed variable admittance control architecture to decrease the control system complexity, in which we represent the admittance control model as a port-Hamiltonian (pH) system and design an energy tank with the optimization theory. The advantages of the proposed architecture are reflected in several aspects: 1) compatibility with common strategies; 2) perturbation resistance; and 3) passivity as a natural property. As the dissipated energy from the pH system is injected into the energy tank while the energy in the tank is used to support the interaction and perturbation resistance, the best passive approximation of the desired behaviors is generated, which can avoid the control signal failure (control signal failure denotes that the unexpected input $u=0$ occurs due to a lack of energy in the tank). Three different groups of experiments are conducted to verify the feasibility, perturbation resistance, and practicality of the proposed architecture.},

In this article, we consider an alternative approach based on approximate dynamic programming (ADP), an important class of methods in reinforcement learning. We accommodate nonconvex union-of-polyhedra state constraints and linear input constraints into ADP by designing PWA penalty functions. PWA function approximation is used, which allows for a mixed-integer encoding to implement ADP. The main advantage of the proposed ADP method is its online computational efficiency. Particularly, we propose two control policies, which lead to solving a smaller-scale mixed-integer linear program than conventional hybrid MPC, or a single convex quadratic program, depending on whether the policy is implicitly determined online or explicitly computed offline. We characterize the stability and safety properties of the closed-loop systems, as well as the suboptimality of the proposed policies, by quantifying the approximation errors of value functions and policies. We also develop an offline mixed-integer-linear-programming-based method to certify the reliability of the proposed method. Simulation results on an inverted pendulum with elastic walls and on an adaptive cruise control problem validate the control performance in terms of constraint satisfaction and CPU time.},

  abstract     = {Centrality metrics play a crucial role in network analysis, while the choice of specific measures significantly influences the accuracy of conclusions as each measure represents a unique concept of node importance. Among over 400 proposed indices, selecting the most suitable ones for specific applications remains a challenge. Existing approaches—model-based, data-driven, and axiomatic—have limitations, requiring association with models, training datasets, or restrictive axioms for each specific application. To address this, we introduce the culling method, which relies on the expert concept of centrality behavior on simple graphs. The culling method involves forming a set of candidate measures, generating a list of as small graphs as possible needed to distinguish the measures from each other, constructing a decision-tree survey, and identifying the measure consistent with the expert’s concept. We apply this approach to a diverse set of 40 centralities, including novel kernel-based indices, and combine it with the axiomatic approach. Remarkably, only 13 small 1-trees are sufficient to separate all 40 measures, even for pairs of closely related ones. By adopting simple ordinal axioms like Self-consistency or Bridge axiom, the set of measures can be drastically reduced making the culling survey short. Applying the culling method provides insightful findings on some centrality indices, such as PageRank, Bridging, and dissimilarity-based Eigencentrality measures, among others. The proposed approach offers a cost-effective solution in terms of labor and time, complementing existing methods for measure selection, and providing deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms of centrality measures.},

The proposed protocol makes use of two independent channels to transmit data separately, thereby improving the channel utilization efficiency and reducing the probability of packet dropout. Then, with the proposed protocol and the iterative dynamic linearization approach, an adaptive iterative learning controller associated with a parameter estimation strategy is provided for the nonlinear system under investigation. The control law is data-driven, which therefore does not require knowledge of the model. Subsequently, the sufficient condition is derived under which the tracking error is forced to convergent.

In this framework, dependence between $\mathcal {X}$ and $\mathcal {Y}$ in D, denoted ${\mathfrak {B}}_{\mathrm {}} (\mathcal {X}, \mathcal {Y} | D)$ , is quantified as $P (H_{1} | D)$ , the posterior probability for the model of dependence given D, or any strictly increasing function thereof. It is therefore a measure of the evidence for dependence between $\mathcal {X}$ and $\mathcal {Y}$ as modeled by $H_{1}$ and observed in D. We review several statistical models and reconsider standard results in the light of ${\mathfrak {B}}_{\mathrm {}} (\mathcal {X}, \mathcal {Y} | D)$ as a measure of dependence. Using simulations, we focus on two specific issues: 1) the effect of noise and 2) the behavior of ${\mathfrak {B}}_{\mathrm {}} (\mathcal {X}, \mathcal {Y} | D)$ when $H_{1}$ has a parameter coding for the intensity of dependence. We then derive some general properties of ${\mathfrak {B}}_{\mathrm {}} (\mathcal {X}, \mathcal {Y} | D)$ , showing that it quantifies the information contained in D in favor of $H_{1}$ versus $H_{0}$ . While some of these properties are typical of what is expected from a valid measure of dependence, others are novel and naturally appear as desired features for specific measures of dependence, which we call inferential. We finally put these results in perspective; in particular, we discuss the consequences of using the Bayesian framework as well as the similarities and differences between ${\mathfrak {B}}_{\mathrm {}} (\mathcal {X}, \mathcal {Y} | D)$ and mutual information.},

This article presents a novel solution to this problem leveraging unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems for the automated geolocation and removal of bird excrement across large-scale solar power facilities. First, a UAV executes a predefined flight path to capture sequential aerial images of the plant. These images are subsequently stitched to produce a high-definition orthomosaic of the entire facility. An advanced detection framework based on YOLOv7, enhanced with an attention module, is employed to accurately detect bird excrement by reducing background noise and highlighting key features. An additional prediction head is integrated to improve detection of smaller bird excrements. To compute precise geolocation of the detected excrement, the midpoint pixel coordinates of the excrement along with the azimuth angle and actual ground distance (AGD) relative to a ground control point (GCP) is used. This article further proposes a cleaning technique that employs a traveling salesman problem (TSP) approximation algorithm to efficiently optimize flight path of the cleaning UAV. Experimental results indicate the system achieves an average detection precision (AP) of 93.91% and GPS coordinate accuracy with an average error of 0.149 m, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed method in both geolocation and removal of bird excrement from solar panels.},

Furthermore, we establish that random nonlinear systems utilizing self-triggered control (STC) can achieve NSS, by setting a minimum triggering time to prevent Zeno behavior. Lastly, by adopting the adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) strategy, we develop self-triggered optimal control for random systems with Markovian switching, ensuring the uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the signals in all closed-loop systems.

Taking Petri nets (PNs) as a modeling and analysis tool, this article focuses on the deadlock control problem for a forward-conflict free net (FCFN), which allows for batch assembly and multiple resource allocations. First, a new structural characterization of deadlocks in FCFN is proposed through two structural objects: 1) circuit and 2) $\omega $ -structure. The starting point for this is motivated by the fact that deadlocks in assembly systems stem not only from the circular wait of resources but also the parts waiting for their assembly with other parts. Subsequently, based on these two objects, a necessary and sufficient condition about FCFNs liveness is obtained: 1) an FCFN is live if and only if no circuit and 2) $\omega $ -structure are saturated at any reachable marking. Finally, in order to prevent each such object from inducing deadlocks, a hierarchical search algorithm appropriate for real-time implementation is developed to avoid its saturation. The proposed algorithm is proven to be capable of ensuring the deadlock-free operation of FCFNs. Moreover, several examples are provided to demonstrate its effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {In multiagent systems, conventional methods for addressing consensus problems typically rely on utilizing local and smooth control inputs; however, the focus of these methods is often on achieving asymptotic behavior, rather than transient response. In the existing literature, it has been shown that resetting some controller states can improve the transient response of linear systems. In this article, by utilizing a model predictive control (MPC)-based reset strategy, a new design framework is proposed that ensures not only the asymptotic stability but also the achievement of a desired transient performance. The proposed approach entails minimizing a quadratic cost function to determine the optimal after-reset values for controller states. The problem is then reformulated as a linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimization problem, which is solved to determine the reset law at specific reset instants, enabling the controller to achieve optimal performance and stability in a given multiagent system. The proposed method can be implemented in two distinct modalities. In the first one, characterized as distributed, when the reset conditions are satisfied in a particular agent at any given moment, only the controller state of that specific agent undergoes a reset in that moment, consequently, the transient performance improvement is exclusively limited to that particular agent. On the other hand, in the second modality, known as centralized, when the reset conditions hold in one agent, the controller states of all agents are reset simultaneously, thereby the transient performances of all agents concurrently experience improvement. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the superior performance of both suggested approaches in comparison with conventional reset methods. Furthermore, a comparison between the two suggested strategies is conducted.},

  abstract     = {During the past two decades or so, many researchers devoted themselves to avoiding the deadlocks of automated manufacturing systems (AMSs). Many deadlock control policies have been developed under the assumption that AMSs do not contain unreliable resources and assembly operations. This work focuses on the deadlock control of failure-prone AMS with assembly operations and a single unreliable resource. At first, an automata model is developed to characterize the studied AMS. Then, four properties that a robust deadlock control policy for the studied AMS should satisfy are proposed and rigorously formulated for the first time. Finally, a new robust deadlock control policy based on the modified Banker’s algorithms is proposed. Compared with existing control policies, only the proposed one can well satisfy the newly proposed properties, thus representing a significant contribution to the field of robust control of failure-prone manufacturing systems.},

  abstract     = {This article develops a fixed-time identifier for modeling unknown discrete-time nonlinear systems without requiring the standard persistence of excitation (PE) condition. A data-driven update law based on a modified gradient descent (GD) update law is presented to learn the system parameters, which relies on the concurrent learning approach under which the recorded past data and the current data are employed concurrently. Fixed-time convergence guarantees are provided for the modified GD update law under the condition that the recorded data fulfills a rank condition, which is less restrictive than the standard PE condition. To guarantee fixed-time convergence, fixed-time Lyapunov analysis is leveraged. Compared to typical GD-based update laws, two main advantages of the presented approach are: 1) the modified GD update law guarantees fixed-time convergence instead of asymptotic convergence and 2) the convergence guarantee is provided under an easy-to-check rank condition rather than the standard PE condition, which is hard or even impossible to check online. Simulation results are provided to verify the obtained results.},

  abstract     = {Systems of different types of agents coupled with high-order interactions can emerge complex synchronization patterns. This article presents an analysis framework to study the group synchronization of heterogeneous multiagent systems with hierarchical structure and directed interactions of arbitrary order. First, directed hypergraph is introduced to describe the arbitrary-order interactions among the agents. Then, to explore the possible group synchronization patterns, the agent partition methods commonly used in dyadic graphs are extended to the directed hypergraph. Meanwhile, to verify the admissibility of the group synchronization patterns, two equitable partition types of agent partition are defined from the perspective of hyperedge partition. Next, using the simultaneous block diagonalization method, the stability problem of the group synchronous solution is decoupled into several independent subblocks. These subblocks are associated with the perturbations along and transverse to the synchronous manifold, with transverse subblocks related to loss of synchronization. Therefore, the stability of the group synchronous solution can be investigated by evaluating the stability of each transverse subblock via the master stability function method, thus significantly reducing the stability calculation complexity. Finally, the effectiveness of the analysis framework is illustrated via the simulation.},
