  abstract     = {To ensure the safe and efficient operation of flights in terminal maneuvering areas, airports establish standard arrival and departure procedures. However, designing these procedures is typically time-consuming and challenging for quantitative path length optimization. This paper presents an efficient optimization method for designing multiple arrival and departure procedures, taking into account the configuration of the airport and the nearby environment. The objective is to minimize the total length of routes while satisfying related operational constraints, such as obstacle avoidance and route separation. Each route is modeled in three dimensions, consisting of a horizontal polygonal line and a vertical cone. Considering the actual procedures’ merging or diverging configuration characteristics, multiple arrival or departure routes are then modeled as a tree-like topology structure. A hybrid algorithm, integrating simulated annealing and an improved algorithm, is developed for automated problem-solving. Simulation results, based on tests at Sweden’s Arlanda Airport, exhibit advantages over existing related research in terms of both total route length and computing time. Tests at Shanghai Pudong Airport show an 8% reduction in total path length compared to actual procedures, demonstrating the proposed method’s effectiveness and potential contributions to energy savings and emissions reduction.},

  abstract     = {The nonlinear trajectory tracking control problem is studied for a flying-wing aircraft. Starting from a nonlinear dynamics model of the flying-wing aircraft, the trajectory tracking control is decomposed into multiple loops of position control, flight path control, and attitude control. An incremental backstepping sliding mode control is proposed to implement attitude control, while an incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion and a nonlinear dynamic inversion design are used to deal with the nonlinear system model for the flight path and position control, respectively. In addition, a radial basis function neural-network-based extended state disturbance observer is proposed to deal with model uncertainties, gust disturbances, and unknown faults of the aircraft. The closed-loop control system is proved to be stable using Lyapunov theory. The performance of the proposed disturbance-observer-based incremental backstepping sliding mode control is demonstrated in simulation through a set of three-dimensional tracking scenarios. Compared with both backstepping control and backstepping sliding mode control, tracking performance measured by settling time, tracking error, and overshoot are improved by the proposed design when realistic trajectory tracking missions are executed.},

  abstract     = {A cooperative guidance strategy is developed to enable multiple pursuers to intercept a target simultaneously. The guidance strategy works to minimize the time-to-go difference between neighboring pursuers while still keeping them on track for interception. The guidance law is derived using sliding mode control, with one sliding surface for every pair of neighboring pursuers to remove time-to-go difference and one global sliding surface to make sure at least one pursuer is heading toward the target, guaranteeing the others’ interception as well. A time-to-go approximation scheme for a stationary target is used during the derivation. In addition, the guidance law is expanded to a moving target using a predicted interception point approximation scheme. A two-dimensional nonlinear simulation of the relative kinematics is run for cases of both two pursuers and more, as well as a moving target, in which the guidance law is shown to successfully cause simultaneous interception among multiple pursuers starting from different initial conditions. The guidance law is compared to different guidance laws, bringing simultaneous interception for a case where a disturbance is entered into the system in the middle of the encounter, showing the flexibility of the derived guidance law to deal with such a disturbance.},

  abstract     = {The present work deals with accessibility analysis and robust controller design of dual-spin projectiles (DSPs). Applying linear controllability checks to a nonlinear system by linearizing about the operating points may prove inconclusive while examining the controllability of the system because such checks specify only the sufficient conditions for controllability. Thus, tools based on differential geometry have to be used to assess the controllability of nonlinear systems. One such tool is the Lie algebraic rank condition, used in the accessibility analysis of a system. In this study, the accessibility analysis is carried out for three different configurations of DSPs: the skid-to-turn (STT), the bank-to-turn (BTT), and the precision guidance kit (PGK). The analysis reveals the inaccessibility of the PGK configuration. Consequently, the controllers are designed for the STT and BTT configurations. A robust pitch/yaw autopilot is designed based on Lyapunov theory and a roll autopilot is designed based on robust backstepping. The efficacy of the designed controllers to intercept the target and handle uncertainties in the initial conditions and aerodynamic coefficients is validated through simulations. The results are compared for the STT and BTT configurations, and the equivalency of the dynamics of the two configurations is proven.},

  abstract     = {A major challenge in homing guidance is that accurately predicting the time to go for missiles is generally difficult, which limits the practical application of a certain class of guidance laws with impact-time constraints or cooperative capabilities. To address this issue, a generalized method referred to as the time-to-go inversion guidance is presented, where the time to go is first specified as an explicit function and then the corresponding guidance law is inversely derived. By employing this new method, a variety of guidance laws and their globally accurate time-to-go solutions can be developed, regardless of whether the impact-angle constraint is considered or not. Different from all existing studies, the proposed method addresses the problem of time-to-go estimation without relying on any linearizing approximations or numerical iterations. To enhance the practicality of the proposed method, it is augmented with bias commands to result in either the impact time control guidance law or the impact time and angle control guidance law. Numerical simulation results demonstrate the higher accuracy, larger feasible solution region, and lower computational demand of the proposed guidance laws even for the missiles with nonconstant speeds.},

  abstract     = {Approaching a target from a desired heading is crucial for various modern applications. Existing literature mostly addresses terminal angle-constrained guidance for stationary targets, which also includes strategies for achieving the entire angular spectrum (all-aspect approach). However, existing strategies against moving targets can achieve only a restricted set of terminal angles. To this end, this paper presents a proportional-navigation-based multiphase guidance strategy against a nonmaneuvering target, moving at a lower speed than the pursuer, with any desired terminal angle in 2-D, by shaping the trajectory on an angular phase plane. First, a generalized version of the two-phase guidance scheme is presented for achieving terminal angles in one half-space. This is subsequently extended to attaining any desired terminal angle in the other half-space by using an additional phase for line-of-sight rotation reversal. By shaping the angular phase-plane trajectory, the pursuer’s field-of-view constraint is also seamlessly incorporated in the guidance formulation. Further, an all-aspect approach in a 3-D environment is achieved by splitting the entire 3-D engagement into two planar engagement phases and employing the developed planar guidance on each engagement plane. The performance of the developed guidance strategies is validated through extensive numerical simulations considering first-order lag and lateral acceleration limits.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the problem of stabilizing a bio-inspired fighter aircraft at its Air Combat Maneuver Condition in steady-level and coordinated-turning flight. The aircraft equations of motion are linearized, and an infinite-horizon linear quadratic regulator design is conducted. The open-loop system is unstable in the short-period and Dutch roll modes. This is mitigated in the closed-loop system, which is analyzed in the time and frequency domains. Included in the simulation dynamics are first-order actuator models, actuator deflection limits, and actuator rate limits. These are particularly important for this bio-inspired aircraft because control actuation requires rotation of the empennage, which has relatively large inertia. Simulation responses to initial condition dispersions, aerodynamic model error, and atmospheric turbulence are analyzed to characterize time-domain properties: settling time, region of attraction, control saturation, and robustness. Due to poor singular values for the throttle setting and rotating tail inputs, analysis is dedicated to control designs with these inputs fixed at trim values. Within the scope of these analyses, fixing the rotating tail at trim does not significantly degrade system performance.},

  abstract     = {After the loss of control authority over the thrusters of the Nauka module, the International Space Station lost attitude control for 45 min with potentially disastrous consequences. Motivated by a scenario of orbital inspection, we consider a similar malfunction occurring to the inspector satellite and investigate whether its mission can still be safely fulfilled. While a natural approach is to counteract in real time the uncontrolled and undesirable thrust with the remaining controlled thrusters, vehicles are often subject to actuation delays hindering this approach. Instead, we extend resilience theory to systems suffering from actuation delay and build a resilient trajectory tracking controller with stability guarantees relying on a state predictor. We demonstrate that this controller can accurately track the reference trajectory of the inspection mission despite the actuation delay and the loss of control authority over one of the thrusters.},

  abstract     = {Neural-network adaptive control offers a promising avenue for managing dynamic uncertainties with unknown structures. Nevertheless, traditional neural-network adaptive control methodologies are plagued by challenges such as persistent excitation and learning singularities. This study introduces an enhanced neural-network adaptive control methodology that optimizes the use of empirical data and ensures a more even spatial distribution of samples. A neural-network adaptive controller is developed, incorporating an experience replay strategy that refines the adaptive tuning of network weights. The adaptation is fueled by the current tracking and historical model prediction errors, markedly improving the excitation condition. Furthermore, a data- selection strategy that prioritizes regions with sparse samples is introduced, effectively mitigating the issue of learning singularities. Additionally, an adaptive technique to circumvent control saturation is employed. The stability of the control system and the convergent behavior of the network weights are substantiated through theoretical analysis. Simulation outcomes corroborate the superiority of the proposed algorithm in terms of parameter convergence, learning efficacy, and control precision.},

  abstract     = {Recent debris removal inevitably relies heavily on the motion estimation of the target debris, i.e., an uncooperated body. Reliable and robust capture during proximity operation is key for debris removal. This paper first provides an innovative strategy, contactless and multiple debris removal in a single flight, as an introduction to show the context behind it. This study presents a new method for the direct estimation of both dynamic attitude motion and inertia properties, excluding reliance on a priori information. The authors have so far presented a fraction of the simulation results without describing the mathematical process in detail. This paper, for the first time, provides a concrete description of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the task of sensor selection over a finite time horizon for systems modeled via discrete-time, linear state-space representations. Our method for this general linear setting accommodates both spatial and temporal noise correlations. To our best knowledge, this is the first work to do so. Scheduling policies are designed to limit sensor usage and minimize a minimum-mean-square-error-based criterion with time-varying weights to accommodate different user scenarios (e.g., prioritizing certain state elements at certain times or performing linear quadratic Gaussian control). The approach is also nonmyopic since the effects of sensor activations on all time steps are incorporated. A new but algebraically equivalent formulation of the scheduling model is introduced that readily accounts for colored noise sequences. This lends a closed-form expression for the error covariance that is explicit in all scheduling variables. Such an expression had been considered intractable for filtering in both white and colored noise regimes. This expression is leveraged to develop a well-motivated surrogate objective function that is shown to be submodular, thus enabling the use of an efficient greedy algorithm accompanied by performance guarantees with respect to the surrogate objective. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.},

  abstract     = {While there is a strong current interest in and an increasing body of the latest numerical work on fuel-optimal powered descent inside an atmosphere, little recent analytical understanding of the problem has been reported. This paper analyzes the endo-atmospheric fuel-optimal rocket landing problem in three-dimensional motion. The necessary conditions for the problem that account for both propulsive and aerodynamic forces are derived. They include the full set of costate equations and the optimality conditions of the body attitude in terms of the angle of attack and sideslip angle. In contrast to a long-standing assumption of coordinated flight in the literature, it is shown that in general coordinated flight is not optimal if sideslip modulation is allowed. Special cases, such as small-angle and in-plane motion, are analyzed and harmonized with the previous results that are well known in the literature. The analytical conditions derived in this paper can also serve as independent verification for numerical solutions obtained by direct methods in optimal control or can be exploited for trajectory-design purposes.},
