The traveling crossflow mode over a swept wing with a Mach number of 6 is first solved using direct numerical simulations. The MPT decomposition illustrates the vortical nature of the traveling crossflow mode, with the vortical component having a higher magnitude than the acoustic and thermal components. The vortical source makes the greatest contribution to the mode instability, whereas the response of the source terms depends on the control method used. Wall cooling primarily impacts the thermal component, thus decreasing the thermal source and subsequently changing the vortical source. Wall suction influences the vortical component directly, and only the vortical source undergoes a small reduction. The acoustic and vortical components are sensitive to grooves. The compression waves induced by grooves are identified as the source of the stabilization effect.},

A nonlinear least-squares approach with trust-region reflective optimization is then used to obtain the strength and locations of singularities together with the domain boundary panel strengths by fitting to measured wall pressures. The technique is demonstrated using computational fluid dynamics for the test case of a well-documented slender delta wing body with high blockage and validated against both experiments and legacy data.

  abstract     = {Turbulent boundary layer wall pressure fluctuations are of significant concern in acoustic engineering for both high-speed airborne and underwater vehicles, and the modeling of the associated wavenumber-frequency spectra has been extensively studied. In this paper, a review of 12 models developed between 1964 and 2017 has been conducted, and both the 2D and 1D forms investigated. In this work, fundamental concepts are introduced, followed by a classification of the models into two categories, that is, Corcos-type and non-Corcos-type models. Both the 2D and 1D forms of the 12 models are individually introduced in chronological order. To evaluate these models, comparisons of the 2D and 1D wavenumber-frequency spectra at different speeds and frequencies were conducted. Unlike Corcos-type models, non-Corcos-type models are grounded in a stronger theoretical foundation, with some models accurately reflecting acoustic region characteristics. Corcos-type models exhibit good consistency, however, they require an auto-spectrum as a necessary input, which makes them semiempirical models. In addition, the models within the Corcos-type and the non-Corcos-type were also compared, respectively, and a few important conclusions were accordingly made. The research output from this paper can provide an important practical engineering reference for studies associated with acoustic engineering, such as aircraft cabin noise and submarine hydrodynamic noise.},

The first objective of the present study was to address the incomplete spectroscopic data for the absorption feature near through the determination of line strengths and broadening coefficients with collisional partners including , and Ar. Line shape characterization in both an absorption cell and a shock tube behind reflected shock waves was conducted to determine the temperature exponents of these broadening coefficients. The other objective was to demonstrate the capability of the sensor through detection in multicomponent mixtures and time-history measurements in the shock tube for investigating chemical kinetics at engine and gas-turbine-relevant conditions. The sensor developed in this study could serve as a cost-effective diagnostic tool for chemical kinetic measurements, combustion monitoring, and other applications where flexibility and robustness are prioritized.},

To solve the multidimensional control laws from a single gain dimension, an active shape control model training framework is proposed based on the deep Q-network algorithm, including the state space, action space, and reward function. Numerical simulations, with errors stemming from two typical thermal loads as the initial errors, are conducted to illustrate the effect of the proposed control method. The influence of the voltage step size on the shape control precision is analyzed, and further online training is discussed for implementing control. The results indicate that the proposed method reduces the root-mean-square (RMS) error by more than 50% The control effect of the trained control model on other error conditions does not perform as desired. However, online training can effectively solve this problem, achieving faster convergence and a significant reduction of the RMS error.},

  abstract     = {Tensegrity structures are emerging as pivotal components in the assembly of ultralarge modular spacecraft in orbit, primarily due to their exceptional volume-to-mass ratio and robust controllability. During on-orbit operations, given the low damping and high flexibility of tensegrity, its vibration-induced deformations affect the magnitude of the heat flux, presenting a typical force–shape coupling problem. This paper introduces an energy-preserving matrix perturbation solution designed to efficiently and accurately address the thermally induced vibration challenges in tensegrity. This method effectively mitigates the energy dissipation and numerical instability issues. Furthermore, the analysis incorporates the impact of the axial component of heat flux on structural vibration, uncovering the influence mechanism of this often-overlooked slow variable on the dynamic behavior of tensegrity. The proposed method demonstrates a deviation of less than 1% between the thermal response and the results obtained from finite element analysis, while achieving a 70% reduction in computation time. The varying axial thermal load leads to a rapid decrease in system frequency, resulting in divergent thermal vibrations. Additionally, the significant dynamic stress can potentially surpass the structural stress limits. These findings underscore the critical importance of considering such effects in the design and calculation of tensegrity structures for aerospace applications.},

Unlike previous studies, the structural model considered in this paper includes practical situations and conditions arising in the design process and application of FGM cylindrical panels. The properties of material constituents are assumed to be temperature-dependent, and the effective properties of porous FGM are determined using a modified rule of mixture. Governing equations in terms of deflection and stress function are established based on first-order shear deformation theory, taking into account von Kármán–Donnell nonlinearity and initial geometric imperfection. Analytical solutions are assumed to satisfy simply supported boundary conditions, and the Galerkin method is applied to derive a time differential equation containing both quadratic and cubic nonlinear terms. This differential equation is numerically integrated employing the fourth-order Runge–Kutta scheme to determine the frequencies of nonlinear free vibration. Parametric studies are carried out to assess numerous effects on both linear and nonlinear frequencies of porous FGM cylindrical panels. The study reveals that natural frequencies are strongly decreased and that frequency nonlinearity is more significant due to axial compressive loads.},

In this work, a probabilistic approach is proposed for reliability and sensitivity analysis of composite all-movable fin flutter.

A composite beam and a composite plate are analyzed to test the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach. The finite element model of composite all-movable fin flutter is approximated by the basis-adaptive PCE model, which is adaptively updated by the FBR learning function. The weighed -means strategy is added to accelerate the convergence speed and reduce the number of iterations. Then the basis-adaptive PCE model is combined with numerical simulation for reliability and sensitivity analysis of composite all-movable fin flutter. Based on the results of Monte Carlo simulation, compared with adaptive support vector regression, kriging, and the traditional PCE method, it is found that the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method are the best for reliability and sensitivity analysis of composite all-movable fin flutter.},

Tests were conducted inside an optically accessible vacuum chamber where the PSI process was simulated using a sonic jet impinging on a bed of regolith simulant. Crater geometry measurements were taken at nozzle heights of 4.6 to 55.6 nozzle diameters above the simulant surface. Results show that the highly underexpanded plume under subatmospheric conditions resulted in broad and shallow craters compared to craters formed under Earth atmosphere. Some craters under subatmospheric conditions exhibited lobed geometry characterized by azimuthal depth variations. In these same cases, the deepest portion of the crater was located radially away from the center, and particles were observed moving toward the center resulting in fountain-like particle movement. Craters formed under Earth atmospheric conditions had an axisymmetric parabolic geometry with the location of maximum depth at the center. In general, subatmospheric crater growth was slower than Earth atmospheric. However, subatmospheric crater formation at nozzle heights of 9.3D and below was characteristically like Earth atmospheric crater formation at large nozzle heights.},

A concept of operation for AAM vehicles is considered to deliver packages for a number of customers at different locations. The objective of the problem is to minimize the overall energy consumption of all AAM vehicles. A feed-forward neural network (FFNN) is proposed to predict the fight energy consumption of a delivery drone, whose flight data were used to train the neural network. To optimize the allocation of AAM vehicles to service stations (e.g., for charging and maintenance) with limited service bays, a distributed limited resource allocation algorithm (DLRAA) is proposed based on the Hungarian method. DLRAA was compared with a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) solver based on the average run time and average cost in 1000 simulation runs. The results show that the proposed FFNN produced an accurate prediction given noisy flight data, the proposed DLRAA generates allocation that satisfies the given constraints efficiently, and DLRAA outperforms MILP based on average cost in all testing cases. DLRAA outperforms MILP based on the average run time when the number of charging stations is less than 30 and the number of drones is less than 160.},

However, a commonly omitted constraint is the linear stability constraint at the equilibrium point, which undermines the optimized solution’s applicability. To enforce the linear stability constraint in practical gradient-based optimization, the derivatives must be computed accurately, and their computational cost must scale favorably with the number of design variables. In this paper, we propose an algorithm based on the coupled adjoint method and the algorithmic differentiation method that can compute the derivative of such constraint accurately and efficiently. We verify the proposed method using several simple low-dimensional dynamical systems. The relative difference between the adjoint method and the finite differences is between to . The proposed method is demonstrated through several optimizations, including a nonlinear aeroelastic optimization. The proposed algorithm has the potential to be applied to more complex problems involving large-scale nonlinear PDEs, such as aircraft flutter and buffet suppression.},

  abstract     = {Aerodynamic shape optimization requires a robust, accurate, and efficient flow solver. However, during aerodynamic shape optimization, large geometry and flow solution changes may decrease solution accuracy and efficiency on fixed meshes. The optimizer may converge to a spurious optimum if the solution loses accuracy. We use the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method to tackle this problem because it yields high-order-accurate solutions that often have less error per degree of freedom compared to second-order finite-volume methods. Because DG degrees of freedom often incur a higher computational cost, we take advantage of local adaptation to maximize accuracy at a given cost. However, during optimization, it is not clear when to adapt to avoid overoptimizing initial designs and to avoid errors polluting the optimal solution. We develop an adaptation strategy that reaches a target error at the end of a single optimization loop. Finally, we present results for two airfoil optimization test cases. Our results show that this adaptation procedure outperforms optimization using fixed-fidelity DG and second-order finite volume on a per-degree-of-freedom basis.},

  abstract     = {Understanding and predicting the dynamics of complex fluid systems including liquid–liquid phase separation, relevant to both biological and engineered applications, typically uses a nonideal free energy. Introducing such a thermodynamic constraint into the Lattice-Boltzmann Method can be accomplished by altering either the equilibrium distribution function or the external force. The former requires a lengthy parameterization for a free energy of multiple independent variables which becomes cumbersome for more than three components. The latter has been done for a multicomponent compressible system, but a correction term for the force is required to recover the expected conservation equations. This work builds upon the incompressible single component forcing method from He et al. (Journal of Computational Physics, Vol. 152, No. 2, 1999) by deriving and implementing the required force needed to successfully recover the expected mass conservation from a nonideal free energy with an arbitrary number of components. This allows the simulation of more realistic phase separating fluid systems by including many interacting components, which is demonstrated here for up to five components and phases.},

  abstract     = {The baseline two-equation Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) models include fluid density but lack calibration for compressible flows, making them inadequate for high Mach numbers. Various compressibility corrections have been proposed to integrate the van Driest transformation or the semilocal transformation, i.e., a given compressible law of the wall, into the RANS formulation. Prior work has focused mainly on the logarithmic layer, but upon evaluating these log-layer compressibility corrections, we find that they do not significantly improve skin friction estimates. To overcome this challenge, we develop viscous-layer compressibility corrections. We do that by altering the dissipation terms. These corrections conform the RANS model to the semilocal scaling, resulting in more accurate predictions of mean velocity and temperature in a posteriori tests. Although not the primary focus of this study, we also find that the baseline one-equation Spalart–Allmaras model, which was proposed before the concept of semilocal scaling, produces results consistent with the semilocal scaling in a posteriori tests without requiring any compressibility correction.},

Planar particle image velocimetry and surface pressure measurements were used to quantify the flow development at the midspan of the model. For the intermediate conditions, the airfoil is stalled in the time-average sense. However, conditionally averaged velocity field measurements reveal that reattachment of the separated flow and laminar separation bubble formation occur intermittently on the suction surface. The characteristics of the intermittently forming separation bubble and fully separated flow are analyzed based on conditional statistics, revealing variations in the transition process that may underpin the observed low-frequency flow oscillations. The growth rates of the most amplified wavenumbers in the separated shear layer vary with the angle between the separation streamline and the suction surface, leading to earlier transition when the separation angle increases. This change in transition location may play a role in spontaneous changes between fully separated and reattaching flow states.},

  abstract     = {Natural laminar flow (NLF) is an important technique for reducing drag of the next-generation supersonic transport aircraft. However, achieving NLF on supersonic transport wings is challenging due to the large swept angles and high-Reynolds-number conditions, which significantly amplify Tollmien–Schlichting (TS) and crossflow (CF) instabilities. To address this problem, this paper proposes a modified target pressure distribution to attenuate the TS and CF instabilities. Compared with conventional targets defined using empirical functions, it is derived in two steps: the first step is to prescribe an initial flat target pressure distribution with a narrow leading-edge flow acceleration region and conduct inverse designs; the second step is to modify the target pressure distribution according to the stability analysis results of the designed wing in order to achieve a balance of disturbance growth at positive and negative wave angles. The proposed approach is validated on a 60°-swept infinite-span wing at and . Results demonstrate that TS and CF instabilities are well-suppressed under the modified target pressure distribution, with the transition location delayed from on the baseline wing to on the designed wing, suggesting that the proposed method is effective for NLF design on supersonic highly swept wings.},

The distortion transferred to the fan face detrimentally impacts the engine performance. The current study explores the efficacy of steady vortex generator jets (VGJ) to alleviate this flow distortion using high-fidelity implicit large-eddy simulations on a quasi-3D intake. The study reveals that VGJs, strategically placed on the windward side of the intake, induce coherent structures that include cylindrical jet shear layers, horseshoe vortices, and counter-rotating vortex pairs similar to transverse jets in crossflow. Parametric studies are carried out to identify the optimal VGJ location and blowing ratios. Superior flow control is achieved when the VGJs are placed on the windward side closer to the leading edge, reducing the distortion coefficient by compared to the uncontrolled case. In contrast, when the VGJs are placed farther from the leading edge, the flow relaminarizes and the coherent structures decay rapidly due to severe acceleration over the intake lip. Consistent with experiments, our computations at higher blowing ratios (VR1.5 and VR2) show an improved pressure recovery decreasing the distortion coefficient by due to deeper jet penetration and enhanced mixing.},

  abstract     = {Numerical and experimental studies were conducted to uncover the physical aspects of a liquid jet injected into a supersonic crossflow with gas throttling systematically. The results were obtained with the inflow conditions of a Mach number of 2.0, a total temperature of 300 K, and a total pressure of 0.55 MPa. The results show that fuel–air mixing is considerably enhanced due to shock-induced flow distortion by adding gas throttling. The strength of downstream backpressure determines the distance of forward movement of the throttling shock wave train and the flowfield structure in the channel. When the mass flux of gas throttling is high, the influence of throttling gas spreads across the expansion section, resulting in significant flow separation in front of the liquid jet. It is found that the spray flashback phenomenon is similar to the flame flashback phenomenon that occurs in the supersonic combustion process under the action of a precombustion shock train. The wall counterrotating vortex pair and induced cavity streamwise vortices are enhanced with the increase of the flux of gas throttling. The relatively high-pressure environment generated by gas throttling promotes the atomization of droplets. As a result, the mixing enhancement mechanism of a liquid jet in a supersonic crossflow with gas throttling is mainly due to the combined effects of 1) the shock waves separating the side wall boundary layer and modifying the local flow state of air in the combustor, which lead to a dramatic increase in fuel–air mixing, and 2) the streamwise vorticity values as well as the residence time resulting from channel blockage elevating.},

The effects of the rotor wake are dominant in low forward flight, and performing high-fidelity simulations of the rotor-fuselage-intake simultaneously is expensive. This study presents a novel hybrid nonlinear vortex–computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach to rotor-fuselage-intake aerodynamics and icing. The method combines nonlinear vortex–lattice, Lagrangian vortex–particle, and Eulerian CFD methods on airflow and droplet impingement with a PDE-based ice-accretion model. The Lagrangian description of rotor wake preserves the wake structure independently of the Eulerian grid, whereas the Eulerian description of the flowfield naturally computes nonlinear flow phenomena and surface properties. The algorithm allowed the ice accretion to be computed much faster than existing methods. The method was validated by considering airflow, surface pressure, and ice accretion around a model rotorcraft. We investigated ice accretion with strong rotor wakes for different advance ratios and rotor thrust coefficients. We also investigated the effects of the suction of airflow in the intake and the differences between with and without the rotor. It was found that the advance ratio had a dominant effect compared to the rotor thrust coefficient.},

Training data were acquired in an anechoic chamber on both isolated rotors and rotor–airframe configurations. The acoustic amplitude and phase of the revolution-averaged interaction were predicted, which required up to 25 harmonics to capture the impulse event caused by the blade’s approach and departure from the airframe. Prediction performance showed, on average, that the artificial neural network models could estimate the acoustic amplitude and phase over the relevant harmonics for unseen conditions with 86% and 75% accuracy, respectively. This enables a time-domain reconstruction of the waveform for the range of geometric and flow parameters tested.

  abstract     = {The effects of part-speed geometry changes on the performance of an aeroengine centrifugal compressor are evaluated. In many applications, impellers are often of a high-flow-coefficient, high-specific-speed design. When coupled with the high rotational speeds and high temperature ratios of modern impellers, significant deformation occurs as the compressor moves across its operating range from low speeds to high speeds. At each operating speed studied, the impeller geometry was deformed to achieve the running, warm geometry at that speed. Typically, a single hot-to-cold analysis is performed to generate the cold geometry needed for fabricating the hardware. The hot as-designed geometry is used to predict performance at all operating speeds. The present study shows that this approach tends to overpredict part-speed performance. The variation between the hot geometry and the warm geometry at part speeds below 80% of design speed was nearly one point in efficiency and more than 1.2% in total pressure ratio. The assumption of constant geometry is made due to the time-consuming and computationally expensive iterative procedure required to compute the warm part-speed geometries. To address this, a scaling is presented that allows for part-speed geometries to be determined using only the as-manufactured and as-designed geometries.},

  abstract     = {The current study aims to evaluate and investigate the development of projection-based reduced-order models (ROMs) for efficient and accurate rotating detonation engine (RDE) simulations. Specifically, we focus on assessing the projection-based ROM construction utilizing three different approaches: the linear static basis, the nonlinear quadratic basis, and an adaptive model order reduction (MOR) formulation. First, an a priori analysis is performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the linear static and nonlinear quadratic bases in representing the detonation wave dynamics. The a priori analysis reveals that, compared to the linear basis, the nonlinear quadratic basis provides significantly improved representation of detonation wave dynamics within the training regime. However, it exhibits limited capabilities in representing the dynamics beyond the training regime, either in the future state or under a different operating parameter (i.e., inlet velocity). Second, the investigations proceed to the adaptive MOR formulation, which constructs an online adaptive ROM with a small amount of offline training data. It is demonstrated that the adaptive ROM can provide significantly enhanced predictive capabilities in modeling the RDE dynamics in the future state and subject to parametric variations. More importantly, the adaptive ROM is shown to be capable of capturing the initial transience in establishing the detonation wave.},

  abstract     = {The rotating detonation engine is perhaps the most promising means to realize pressure-gain combustion in modern engines. The physical processes underpinning the dynamics of the combustion wave are complex, and a lack of understanding of these processes represents a significant barrier to practical implementation of the technology. A significant simplification of the RDE is considered through an abstracted experimental setup. The detonation wave is replaced with a nonreacting shock generated by a shock tube, and the annulus is unwrapped into a single linear channel. Both simplifications make direct visualization of the problem via schlieren imaging tractable. Several performance metrics are used to relate the fluid-dynamic behavior of the shock–injector interaction to the performance of a theoretical rotating detonation engine. The first such metric is “recovery time,” based on the time taken for the injector to return to a fully flowing state after the passage of a detonation wave. The second such metric not only considers the mass flow through the injector exit but also accounts for potential backflow into the injector nozzle that may occur for sufficiently strong waves. Finally, a reactant mass-deficit metric is used to characterize the reduction in mass injection due to the interaction with the wave.},

  abstract     = {When a civil aircraft engine is operated at windmill during the cruise flight phase, there is supersonic flow acceleration around the leading edge of the fan cowl toward the external surface. The terminating normal shock wave can separate the turbulent boundary layer developing on this external surface. A series of experiments at a flight-relevant Reynolds number (1.2 million based on lip thickness) are performed in a quasi-two-dimensional wind tunnel rig to investigate the underlying flow physics. At a nominal inflow Mach number of 0.65 and a nacelle incidence angle of 4.5 deg, as the equivalent engine mass-flow rate is reduced, an increase in shock strength results in flow separation when the shock exceeds Mach 1.4. Over a 10% range in the notional engine mass-flow rate, the boundary layer developing on the external fan cowl thickens by a factor of three on the onset of separation. A reduction in the incoming Mach number from 0.65 to 0.60 weakens the shock wave and thus delays separation. An increase in surface roughness has no significant effect in situations where the boundary layer remains attached. However, for separated cases, an increased local roughness height causes a greater separation extent and a thicker boundary layer downstream of the shock wave.},

  abstract     = {To ensure the safe and efficient operation of flights in terminal maneuvering areas, airports establish standard arrival and departure procedures. However, designing these procedures is typically time-consuming and challenging for quantitative path length optimization. This paper presents an efficient optimization method for designing multiple arrival and departure procedures, taking into account the configuration of the airport and the nearby environment. The objective is to minimize the total length of routes while satisfying related operational constraints, such as obstacle avoidance and route separation. Each route is modeled in three dimensions, consisting of a horizontal polygonal line and a vertical cone. Considering the actual procedures’ merging or diverging configuration characteristics, multiple arrival or departure routes are then modeled as a tree-like topology structure. A hybrid algorithm, integrating simulated annealing and an improved algorithm, is developed for automated problem-solving. Simulation results, based on tests at Sweden’s Arlanda Airport, exhibit advantages over existing related research in terms of both total route length and computing time. Tests at Shanghai Pudong Airport show an 8% reduction in total path length compared to actual procedures, demonstrating the proposed method’s effectiveness and potential contributions to energy savings and emissions reduction.},

An incremental backstepping sliding mode control is proposed to implement attitude control, while an incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion and a nonlinear dynamic inversion design are used to deal with the nonlinear system model for the flight path and position control, respectively. In addition, a radial basis function neural-network-based extended state disturbance observer is proposed to deal with model uncertainties, gust disturbances, and unknown faults of the aircraft. The closed-loop control system is proved to be stable using Lyapunov theory. The performance of the proposed disturbance-observer-based incremental backstepping sliding mode control is demonstrated in simulation through a set of three-dimensional tracking scenarios. Compared with both backstepping control and backstepping sliding mode control, tracking performance measured by settling time, tracking error, and overshoot are improved by the proposed design when realistic trajectory tracking missions are executed.},

The guidance strategy works to minimize the time-to-go difference between neighboring pursuers while still keeping them on track for interception. The guidance law is derived using sliding mode control, with one sliding surface for every pair of neighboring pursuers to remove time-to-go difference and one global sliding surface to make sure at least one pursuer is heading toward the target, guaranteeing the others’ interception as well. A time-to-go approximation scheme for a stationary target is used during the derivation. In addition, the guidance law is expanded to a moving target using a predicted interception point approximation scheme. A two-dimensional nonlinear simulation of the relative kinematics is run for cases of both two pursuers and more, as well as a moving target, in which the guidance law is shown to successfully cause simultaneous interception among multiple pursuers starting from different initial conditions. The guidance law is compared to different guidance laws, bringing simultaneous interception for a case where a disturbance is entered into the system in the middle of the encounter, showing the flexibility of the derived guidance law to deal with such a disturbance.},

  abstract     = {The present work deals with accessibility analysis and robust controller design of dual-spin projectiles (DSPs). Applying linear controllability checks to a nonlinear system by linearizing about the operating points may prove inconclusive while examining the controllability of the system because such checks specify only the sufficient conditions for controllability. Thus, tools based on differential geometry have to be used to assess the controllability of nonlinear systems. One such tool is the Lie algebraic rank condition, used in the accessibility analysis of a system. In this study, the accessibility analysis is carried out for three different configurations of DSPs: the skid-to-turn (STT), the bank-to-turn (BTT), and the precision guidance kit (PGK). The analysis reveals the inaccessibility of the PGK configuration. Consequently, the controllers are designed for the STT and BTT configurations. A robust pitch/yaw autopilot is designed based on Lyapunov theory and a roll autopilot is designed based on robust backstepping. The efficacy of the designed controllers to intercept the target and handle uncertainties in the initial conditions and aerodynamic coefficients is validated through simulations. The results are compared for the STT and BTT configurations, and the equivalency of the dynamics of the two configurations is proven.},

  abstract     = {A major challenge in homing guidance is that accurately predicting the time to go for missiles is generally difficult, which limits the practical application of a certain class of guidance laws with impact-time constraints or cooperative capabilities. To address this issue, a generalized method referred to as the time-to-go inversion guidance is presented, where the time to go is first specified as an explicit function and then the corresponding guidance law is inversely derived. By employing this new method, a variety of guidance laws and their globally accurate time-to-go solutions can be developed, regardless of whether the impact-angle constraint is considered or not. Different from all existing studies, the proposed method addresses the problem of time-to-go estimation without relying on any linearizing approximations or numerical iterations. To enhance the practicality of the proposed method, it is augmented with bias commands to result in either the impact time control guidance law or the impact time and angle control guidance law. Numerical simulation results demonstrate the higher accuracy, larger feasible solution region, and lower computational demand of the proposed guidance laws even for the missiles with nonconstant speeds.},

  abstract     = {Approaching a target from a desired heading is crucial for various modern applications. Existing literature mostly addresses terminal angle-constrained guidance for stationary targets, which also includes strategies for achieving the entire angular spectrum (all-aspect approach). However, existing strategies against moving targets can achieve only a restricted set of terminal angles. To this end, this paper presents a proportional-navigation-based multiphase guidance strategy against a nonmaneuvering target, moving at a lower speed than the pursuer, with any desired terminal angle in 2-D, by shaping the trajectory on an angular phase plane. First, a generalized version of the two-phase guidance scheme is presented for achieving terminal angles in one half-space. This is subsequently extended to attaining any desired terminal angle in the other half-space by using an additional phase for line-of-sight rotation reversal. By shaping the angular phase-plane trajectory, the pursuer’s field-of-view constraint is also seamlessly incorporated in the guidance formulation. Further, an all-aspect approach in a 3-D environment is achieved by splitting the entire 3-D engagement into two planar engagement phases and employing the developed planar guidance on each engagement plane. The performance of the developed guidance strategies is validated through extensive numerical simulations considering first-order lag and lateral acceleration limits.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the problem of stabilizing a bio-inspired fighter aircraft at its Air Combat Maneuver Condition in steady-level and coordinated-turning flight. The aircraft equations of motion are linearized, and an infinite-horizon linear quadratic regulator design is conducted. The open-loop system is unstable in the short-period and Dutch roll modes. This is mitigated in the closed-loop system, which is analyzed in the time and frequency domains. Included in the simulation dynamics are first-order actuator models, actuator deflection limits, and actuator rate limits. These are particularly important for this bio-inspired aircraft because control actuation requires rotation of the empennage, which has relatively large inertia. Simulation responses to initial condition dispersions, aerodynamic model error, and atmospheric turbulence are analyzed to characterize time-domain properties: settling time, region of attraction, control saturation, and robustness. Due to poor singular values for the throttle setting and rotating tail inputs, analysis is dedicated to control designs with these inputs fixed at trim values. Within the scope of these analyses, fixing the rotating tail at trim does not significantly degrade system performance.},

  abstract     = {After the loss of control authority over the thrusters of the Nauka module, the International Space Station lost attitude control for 45 min with potentially disastrous consequences. Motivated by a scenario of orbital inspection, we consider a similar malfunction occurring to the inspector satellite and investigate whether its mission can still be safely fulfilled. While a natural approach is to counteract in real time the uncontrolled and undesirable thrust with the remaining controlled thrusters, vehicles are often subject to actuation delays hindering this approach. Instead, we extend resilience theory to systems suffering from actuation delay and build a resilient trajectory tracking controller with stability guarantees relying on a state predictor. We demonstrate that this controller can accurately track the reference trajectory of the inspection mission despite the actuation delay and the loss of control authority over one of the thrusters.},

Nevertheless, traditional neural-network adaptive control methodologies are plagued by challenges such as persistent excitation and learning singularities. This study introduces an enhanced neural-network adaptive control methodology that optimizes the use of empirical data and ensures a more even spatial distribution of samples. A neural-network adaptive controller is developed, incorporating an experience replay strategy that refines the adaptive tuning of network weights. The adaptation is fueled by the current tracking and historical model prediction errors, markedly improving the excitation condition. Furthermore, a data- selection strategy that prioritizes regions with sparse samples is introduced, effectively mitigating the issue of learning singularities. Additionally, an adaptive technique to circumvent control saturation is employed. The stability of the control system and the convergent behavior of the network weights are substantiated through theoretical analysis. Simulation outcomes corroborate the superiority of the proposed algorithm in terms of parameter convergence, learning efficacy, and control precision.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the task of sensor selection over a finite time horizon for systems modeled via discrete-time, linear state-space representations. Our method for this general linear setting accommodates both spatial and temporal noise correlations. To our best knowledge, this is the first work to do so. Scheduling policies are designed to limit sensor usage and minimize a minimum-mean-square-error-based criterion with time-varying weights to accommodate different user scenarios (e.g., prioritizing certain state elements at certain times or performing linear quadratic Gaussian control). The approach is also nonmyopic since the effects of sensor activations on all time steps are incorporated. A new but algebraically equivalent formulation of the scheduling model is introduced that readily accounts for colored noise sequences. This lends a closed-form expression for the error covariance that is explicit in all scheduling variables. Such an expression had been considered intractable for filtering in both white and colored noise regimes. This expression is leveraged to develop a well-motivated surrogate objective function that is shown to be submodular, thus enabling the use of an efficient greedy algorithm accompanied by performance guarantees with respect to the surrogate objective. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.},

This paper analyzes the endo-atmospheric fuel-optimal rocket landing problem in three-dimensional motion. The necessary conditions for the problem that account for both propulsive and aerodynamic forces are derived. They include the full set of costate equations and the optimality conditions of the body attitude in terms of the angle of attack and sideslip angle. In contrast to a long-standing assumption of coordinated flight in the literature, it is shown that in general coordinated flight is not optimal if sideslip modulation is allowed. Special cases, such as small-angle and in-plane motion, are analyzed and harmonized with the previous results that are well known in the literature. The analytical conditions derived in this paper can also serve as independent verification for numerical solutions obtained by direct methods in optimal control or can be exploited for trajectory-design purposes.},
