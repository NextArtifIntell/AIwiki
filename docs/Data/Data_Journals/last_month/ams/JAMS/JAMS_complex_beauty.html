  abstract     = {We formulate and prove a Conner–Floyd isomorphism for the algebraic K-theory of arbitrary qcqs derived schemes. To that end, we study a stable $\infty$-category of non-$\mathbb {A}^1$-invariant motivic spectra, which turns out to be equivalent to the $\infty$-category of fundamental motivic spectra satisfying elementary blowup excision, previously introduced by the first and third authors. We prove that this $\infty$-category satisfies $\mathbb {P}^1$-homotopy invariance and weighted $\mathbb {A}^1$-homotopy invariance, which we use in place of $\mathbb {A}^1$-homotopy invariance to obtain analogues of several key results from $\mathbb {A}^1$-homotopy theory. These allow us in particular to define a universal oriented motivic $\mathbb {E}_\infty$-ring spectrum $\mathrm {MGL}$. We then prove that the algebraic K-theory of a qcqs derived scheme $X$ can be recovered from its $\mathrm {MGL}$-cohomology via a Conner–Floyd isomorphism \[ \mathrm {MGL}^{**}(X)\otimes _{\mathrm {L}{}}\mathbb {Z}[\beta ^{\pm 1}]\simeq \mathrm {K}{}^{**}(X), \] where $\mathrm {L}{}$ is the Lazard ring and $\mathrm {K}{}^{p,q}(X)=\mathrm {K}{}_{2q-p}(X)$. Finally, we prove a Snaith theorem for the periodized version of $\mathrm {MGL}$.},

  abstract     = {The infinite spin problem is an old problem concerning the rotational behavior of total collision orbits in the n -body problem. It has long been known that when a solution tends to total collision then its normalized configuration curve must converge to the set of normalized central configurations. In the planar n-body problem every normalized configuration determines a circle of rotationally equivalent normalized configurations and, in particular, there are circles of normalized central configurations. It’s conceivable that by means of an infinite spin , a total collision solution could converge to such a circle instead of to a particular point on it. Here we prove that this is not possible, at least if the limiting circle of central configurations is isolated from other circles of central configurations. (It is believed that all central configurations are isolated, but this is not known in general.) Our proof relies on combining the center manifold theorem with the Łojasiewicz gradient inequality.},

  abstract     = {Let $f$ be a dominant endomorphism of a smooth projective surface $X$ over an algebraically closed field $\mathbf {k}$ of characteristic $0$. We prove that if there is no rational function $H \in \mathbf {k}(X)$ such that $H \circ f = H$, then there exists a point $x \in X(\mathbf {k})$ such that the forward orbit of $x$ under $f$ is Zariski dense in $X$. This result gives us a positive answer to the Zariski dense orbit conjecture for endomorphisms of smooth projective surfaces. We also define a new topology on varieties over algebraically closed fields with finite transcendence degree over $\mathbb {Q}$, which we call “the adelic topology”. This topology is stronger than the Zariski topology, and an irreducible variety is still irreducible in this topology. Using the adelic topology, we propose an adelic version of the Zariski dense orbit conjecture that is stronger than the original one and quantifies how many such orbits there are. We also prove this adelic version for endomorphisms of smooth projective surfaces, for endomorphisms of abelian varieties, and for split polynomial maps. This yields new proofs of the original conjecture in the latter two cases. In Appendix A, we study endomorphisms of $k$-affinoid spaces. We show that for certain endomorphisms $f$ on a $k$-affinoid space $X$, the attractor $Y$ of $f$ is a Zariski closed subset and that the dynamics of $f$ is semi-conjugate to its restriction to $Y$. A special case of this result is used in the proof of the main theorem. In Appendix B, written in collaboration with Thomas Tucker, we prove the Zariski dense orbit conjecture for endomorphisms of $(\mathbb {P}^1)^N$.},
