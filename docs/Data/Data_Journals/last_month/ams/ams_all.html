To that end, we study a stable $\infty$-category of non-$\mathbb {A}^1$-invariant motivic spectra, which turns out to be equivalent to the $\infty$-category of fundamental motivic spectra satisfying elementary blowup excision, previously introduced by the first and third authors. We prove that this $\infty$-category satisfies $\mathbb {P}^1$-homotopy invariance and weighted $\mathbb {A}^1$-homotopy invariance, which we use in place of $\mathbb {A}^1$-homotopy invariance to obtain analogues of several key results from $\mathbb {A}^1$-homotopy theory. These allow us in particular to define a universal oriented motivic $\mathbb {E}_\infty$-ring spectrum $\mathrm {MGL}$. We then prove that the algebraic K-theory of a qcqs derived scheme $X$ can be recovered from its $\mathrm {MGL}$-cohomology via a Conner–Floyd isomorphism \[ \mathrm {MGL}^{**}(X)\otimes _{\mathrm {L}{}}\mathbb {Z}[\beta ^{\pm 1}]\simeq \mathrm {K}{}^{**}(X), \] where $\mathrm {L}{}$ is the Lazard ring and $\mathrm {K}{}^{p,q}(X)=\mathrm {K}{}_{2q-p}(X)$. Finally, we prove a Snaith theorem for the periodized version of $\mathrm {MGL}$.},

  abstract     = {The infinite spin problem is an old problem concerning the rotational behavior of total collision orbits in the n -body problem. It has long been known that when a solution tends to total collision then its normalized configuration curve must converge to the set of normalized central configurations. In the planar n-body problem every normalized configuration determines a circle of rotationally equivalent normalized configurations and, in particular, there are circles of normalized central configurations. It’s conceivable that by means of an infinite spin , a total collision solution could converge to such a circle instead of to a particular point on it. Here we prove that this is not possible, at least if the limiting circle of central configurations is isolated from other circles of central configurations. (It is believed that all central configurations are isolated, but this is not known in general.) Our proof relies on combining the center manifold theorem with the Łojasiewicz gradient inequality.},

  abstract     = {Let $f$ be a dominant endomorphism of a smooth projective surface $X$ over an algebraically closed field $\mathbf {k}$ of characteristic $0$. We prove that if there is no rational function $H \in \mathbf {k}(X)$ such that $H \circ f = H$, then there exists a point $x \in X(\mathbf {k})$ such that the forward orbit of $x$ under $f$ is Zariski dense in $X$. This result gives us a positive answer to the Zariski dense orbit conjecture for endomorphisms of smooth projective surfaces. We also define a new topology on varieties over algebraically closed fields with finite transcendence degree over $\mathbb {Q}$, which we call “the adelic topology”. This topology is stronger than the Zariski topology, and an irreducible variety is still irreducible in this topology. Using the adelic topology, we propose an adelic version of the Zariski dense orbit conjecture that is stronger than the original one and quantifies how many such orbits there are. We also prove this adelic version for endomorphisms of smooth projective surfaces, for endomorphisms of abelian varieties, and for split polynomial maps. This yields new proofs of the original conjecture in the latter two cases. In Appendix A, we study endomorphisms of $k$-affinoid spaces. We show that for certain endomorphisms $f$ on a $k$-affinoid space $X$, the attractor $Y$ of $f$ is a Zariski closed subset and that the dynamics of $f$ is semi-conjugate to its restriction to $Y$. A special case of this result is used in the proof of the main theorem. In Appendix B, written in collaboration with Thomas Tucker, we prove the Zariski dense orbit conjecture for endomorphisms of $(\mathbb {P}^1)^N$.},

  abstract     = {We describe an elementary algorithm for recursively constructing diagonal approximations on those finite regular CW-complexes for which the closure of each cell can be explicitly collapsed to a point. The algorithm is based on the standard proof of the acyclic carrier theorem, made constructive through the use of explicit contracting homotopies. It can be used as a theoretical tool for constructing diagonal approximations on families of polytopes in situations where the diagonals are required to satisfy certain coherence conditions. We compare its output to existing diagonal approximations for the families of simplices, cubes, associahedra and permutahedra. The algorithm yields a new explanation of a magical formula for the associahedron derived by Markl and Shnider [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 358 (2006), pp. 2353–2372] and Masuda, Thomas, Tonks, and Vallette [J. Éc. polytech. Math. 8 (2021), pp. 121–146] and Theorem 4.1 provides a magical formula for other polytopes. We also describe a computer implementation of the algorithm and illustrate it on a range of practical examples including the computation of cohomology rings for some low-dimensional manifolds. To achieve some of these examples the paper includes two approaches to generating a regular CW-complex structure on closed compact $3$-manifolds, one using an implementation of Dehn surgery on links and the other using an implementation of pairwise identifications of faces in a tessellated boundary of the $3$-ball. The latter is illustrated in Proposition 8.1 with a topological classification of all closed orientable $3$-manifolds arising from pairwise identifications of faces of the cube.},

  abstract     = {The main focus of this article is to provide a mathematical study of greedy algorithms for the construction of reduced bases so as to approximate a collection of parameter-dependent random variables. For each value of the parameter, the associated random variable belongs to some Hilbert space (say the space of square-integrable random variates for instance). But carrying out an exact greedy algorithm in this context would require the computation of exact expectations or variances of parameter-dependent random variates, which cannot be done in practice. Instead, expectations and variances can only be computed approximately via empirical means and empirical variances involving a finite number of Monte-Carlo samples. The aim of this work is precisely to study the effect of finite Monte-Carlo sampling on the theoretical properties of greedy algorithms. In particular, using concentration inequalities for the empirical measure in Wasserstein distance proved by Fournier and Guillin [Probab. Theory Related Fields 162 (2015), pp. 707–738], we provide sufficient conditions on the number of samples used for the computation of empirical variances at each iteration of the greedy procedure to guarantee that the resulting method algorithm is a weak greedy algorithm with high probability. Let us mention here that such an algorithm has initially been proposed by Boyaval and Lelièvre [Commun. Math. Sci. 8 (2010), pp. 735–762] with the aim to design a variance reduction technique for the computation of parameter-dependent expectations via the use of control variates constructed using a reduced basis paradigm. The theoretical results we prove here are not fully practical and we therefore propose a heuristic procedure to choose the number of Monte-Carlo samples at each iteration, inspired from this theoretical study, which provides satisfactory results on several numerical test cases.},

Here we give an explicit construction of matrices with entries in $[0,h]$ with two eigenvalues separated by at most $h^{-n^2/16+o(n^2)}$. Up to a constant in the exponent, this agrees with the known lower bound of $\Omega ((2\sqrt {n})^{-n^2}h^{-n^2})$ (Mahler [Michigan Math. J. 11 (1964), pp. 257–262]). Bounds on the minimum gap are relevant to the worst case analysis of algorithms for diagonalization and computing canonical forms of integer matrices (e.g. Dey et al. [Bit complexity of Jordan normal form and polynomial spectral factorization, Schloss Dagstuhl. Leibniz-Zent. Inform., Wadern, 2023, pp. Art. No. 42]). In addition to our explicit construction, we show there are many matrices with a slightly larger gap of roughly $h^{-n^2/32}$.

The matrix multiplication, a key component of many more advanced numerical algorithms, has been a challenge: the only linear-time algorithms known so far either require the very special structure of HSS-matrices or need to know a suitable basis for all submatrices in advance. In this article, a new and fairly general algorithm for multiplying $\mathcal {H}^2$-matrices in linear complexity with adaptively constructed bases is presented. The algorithm consists of two phases: first an intermediate representation with a generalized block structure is constructed, then this representation is re-compressed in order to match the structure prescribed by the application. The complexity and accuracy are analyzed and numerical experiments indicate that the new algorithm can indeed be significantly faster than previous attempts.},

In certain situations, in particular if $f(A)$ cannot be well approximated by a low-rank matrix, combining probing methods based on graph colorings with stochastic trace estimation techniques can yield accurate approximations at moderate cost. So far, such methods have not been thoroughly analyzed, though, but were rather used as efficient heuristics by practitioners. In this manuscript, we perform a detailed analysis of stochastic probing methods and, in particular, expose conditions under which the expected approximation error in the stochastic probing method scales more favorably with the dimension of the matrix than the error in non-stochastic probing. Extending results from Aune, Simpson, and Eidsvik [Stat. Comput. 24 (2014), pp. 247–263], we also characterize situations in which using just one stochastic vector is always—not only in expectation—better than the deterministic probing method.

  abstract     = {Quantiles are used as a measure of risk in many stochastic systems. We study the estimation of quantiles with the Hilbert space-filling curve (HSFC) sampling scheme that transforms specifically chosen one-dimensional points into high dimensional stratified samples while still remaining the extensibility. We study the convergence and asymptotic normality for the estimate based on HSFC. By a generalized Dvoretzky–Kiefer–Wolfowitz inequality for independent but not identically distributed samples, we establish the strong consistency for such an estimator. We find that under certain conditions, the distribution of the quantile estimator based on HSFC is asymptotically normal. The asymptotic variance is of $O(n^{-1-1/d})$ when using $n$ HSFC-based quadrature points in dimension $d$, which is more efficient than the Monte Carlo sampling and the Latin hypercube sampling. Since the asymptotic variance does not admit an explicit form, we establish an asymptotically valid confidence interval by the batching method. We also prove a Bahadur representation for the quantile estimator based on HSFC. Numerical experiments show that the quantile estimator is asymptotically normal with a comparable mean squared error rate of randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (RQMC) sampling. Moreover, the coverage of the confidence intervals constructed with HSFC is better than that with RQMC.},

  abstract     = {We propose and analyze a type of low-regularity exponential-type integrators (LREIs) for the Zakharov system (ZS) with rough solutions. Our LREIs include a first-order integrator and a second-order one, and they achieve optimal convergence under weaker regularity assumptions on the exact solution compared to the existing numerical methods in literature. Specifically, the first-order integrator exhibits linear convergence in $H^{m+2}(\mathbb {T}^d)\times H^{m+1}(\mathbb {T}^d)\times H^m(\mathbb {T}^d)$ for solutions in $H^{m+3}(\mathbb {T}^d)\times H^{m+2}(\mathbb {T}^d)\times H^{m+1}(\mathbb {T}^d)$ if $m&gt;d/2$, meaning that only the boundedness of one additional derivative of the solution is required to achieve the first-order convergence. While for the second-order integrator, we show that it achieves second-order accuracy by requiring the boundedness of two additional spatial derivatives of the solution. The order of additional derivatives required is reduced by half compared to the classical trigonometric integrators. The main techniques to design the integrators include a reformulation by introducing new variables to exclude the loss of spatial regularity in the original ZS, accurate integration for the dominant term in the linear part of the equations and appropriate approximations (or averaging approximations) to the exponential phase functions involving the nonlinear interactions. Numerical comparisons with classical integrators confirm that our newly proposed LREIs are superior in accuracy and robustness for handling rough data.},

Sci. 21 (2023), pp. 1–23] for the Lévy-Fokker-Planck (LFP) equation. The main difficulties stem not only from the interplay between the scaling and numerical parameters but also the slow decay of the tail of the equilibrium state. We tackle these problems by separating the parameter domain according to the relative size of the scaling parameter $\varepsilon$: in the regime where $\varepsilon$ is large, we design a weighted norm to mitigate the issue caused by the fat tail, while in the regime where $\varepsilon$ is small, we prove a strong convergence of LFP towards its fractional diffusion limit with an explicit convergence rate. This method extends the traditional AP estimates to cases where uniform bounds are unavailable. Our result applies to any dimension and to the whole span of the fractional power.},

Regarding the main results of this paper, there are two aspects. Firstly, we investigate the supercloseness property of the FVEM, specifically examining the quadratic FVEM under tetrahedral meshes. Secondly, we present several guidelines for selecting computing nodes such that the least-squares fitting procedure of the PPR admits a unique solution. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the recovered gradient by the PPR exhibits superconvergence.},

  abstract     = {We study a class of nonlinear nonlocal conservation laws with discontinuous flux, modeling crowd dynamics and traffic flow. The discontinuous coefficient of the flux function is assumed to be of bounded variation (BV) and bounded away from zero, and hence the spatial discontinuities of the flux function can be infinitely many with possible accumulation points. Strong compactness of the Godunov and Lax-Friedrichs type approximations is proved, providing the existence of entropy solutions. A proof of the uniqueness of the adapted entropy solutions is provided, establishing the convergence of the entire sequence of finite volume approximations to the adapted entropy solution. As per the current literature, this is the first well-posedness result for the aforesaid class and connects the theory of nonlocal conservation laws (with discontinuous flux), with its local counterpart in a generic setup. Some numerical examples are presented to display the performance of the schemes and explore the limiting behavior of these nonlocal conservation laws to their local counterparts.},

  abstract     = {Numerical analysis for the stochastic Stokes equations is still challenging even though it has been well done for the corresponding deterministic equations. In particular, the pre-existing error estimates of finite element methods for the stochastic Stokes equations in the $L^\infty (0, T; L^2(\Omega ; L^2))$ norm all suffer from the order reduction with respect to the spatial discretizations. The best convergence result obtained for these fully discrete schemes is only half-order in time and first-order in space, which is not optimal in space in the traditional sense. The objective of this article is to establish strong convergence of $O(\tau ^{1/2}+ h^2)$ in the $L^\infty (0, T; L^2(\Omega ; L^2))$ norm for approximating the velocity, and strong convergence of $O(\tau ^{1/2}+ h)$ in the $L^{\infty }(0, T;L^2(\Omega ;L^2))$ norm for approximating the time integral of pressure, where $\tau$ and $h$ denote the temporal step size and spatial mesh size, respectively. The error estimates are of optimal order for the spatial discretization considered in this article (with MINI element), and consistent with the numerical experiments. The analysis is based on the fully discrete Stokes semigroup technique and the corresponding new estimates.},
