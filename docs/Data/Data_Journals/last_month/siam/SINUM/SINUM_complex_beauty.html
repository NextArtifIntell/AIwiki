  abstract     = {Abstract. We introduce discretizations of infinite-dimensional optimization problems with total variation regularization and integrality constraints on the optimization variables. We advance the discretization of the dual formulation of the total variation term with Raviart–Thomas functions, which is known from the literature for certain convex problems. Since we have an integrality constraint, the previous analysis from Caillaud and Chambolle [IMA J. Numer. Anal., 43 (2022), pp. 692–736] no longer holds. Even weaker -convergence results no longer hold because the recovery sequences generally need to attain noninteger values to recover the total variation of the limit function. We solve this issue by introducing a discretization of the input functions on an embedded, finer mesh. A superlinear coupling of the mesh sizes implies an averaging on the coarser mesh of the Raviart–Thomas ansatz, which enables us to recover the total variation of integer-valued limit functions with integer-valued discretized input functions. Moreover, we are able to estimate the discretized total variation of the recovery sequence by the total variation of its limit and an error depending on the mesh size ratio. For the discretized optimization problems, we additionally add a constraint that vanishes in the limit and enforces compactness of the sequence of minimizers, which yields their convergence to a minimizer of the original problem. This constraint contains a degree of freedom whose admissible range is determined. Its choice may have a strong impact on the solutions in practice as we demonstrate with an example from imaging.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper studies the long time stability of both the solution of a stochastic heat equation on a bounded domain driven by a correlated noise and its approximations. It is popular for researchers to prove the intermittency of the solution, which means that the moments of solution to a stochastic heat equation usually grow to infinity exponentially fast and this hints that the solution to stochastic heat equation is generally not stable in long time. However, quite surprisingly in this paper we show that when the domain is bounded and when the noise is not singular in spatial variables, the system can be long time stable and we also prove that we can approximate the solution by its finite dimensional spectral approximation, which is also long time stable. The idea is to use eigenfunction expansion of the Laplacian on a bounded domain to write a stochastic heat equation as a system of infinite many stochastic differential equations. We also present numerical experiments which are consistent with our theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this work, we propose a numerical method to compute the Wasserstein Hamiltonian flow (WHF), which is a Hamiltonian system on the probability density manifold. Many well-known PDE systems can be reformulated as WHFs. We use the parameterized function as a push-forward map to characterize the solution of WHF, and convert the PDE to a finite-dimensional ODE system, which is a Hamiltonian system in the phase space of the parameter manifold. We establish theoretical error bounds for the continuous time approximation scheme in the Wasserstein metric. For the numerical implementation, neural networks are used as push-forward maps. We design an effective symplectic scheme to solve the derived Hamiltonian ODE system so that the method preserves some important quantities such as Hamiltonian. The computation is done by a fully deterministic symplectic integrator without any neural network training. Thus, our method does not involve direct optimization over network parameters and hence can avoid errors introduced by the stochastic gradient descent or similar methods, which are usually hard to quantify and measure in practice. The proposed algorithm is a sampling-based approach that scales well to higher dimensional problems. In addition, the method also provides an alternative connection between the Lagrangian and Eulerian perspectives of the original WHF through the parameterized ODE dynamics.},

Both perspectives give rise to mixed finite element methods, which we refer to as strongly and weakly coupled, respectively. We prove convergence of both classes of methods, with particular attention to improved convergence rate estimates, and stability in the limit of vanishing characteristic length of the micropolar structure.

In this paper, we develop and analyze a multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) scheme for the Dean–Kawasaki equation, a pivotal representative of this class of SPDEs. We prove analytically and demonstrate numerically that our MLMC scheme provides a significant reduction in computational cost (with respect to a standard Monte Carlo method) in the simulation of the Dean–Kawasaki equation. Specifically, we link this reduction in cost to having a sufficiently large average particle density and show that sizeable cost reductions can be obtained even when we have solutions with regions of low density. Numerical simulations are provided in the two-dimensional case, confirming our theoretical predictions. Our results are formulated entirely in terms of the law of distributions rather than in terms of strong spatial norms: this crucially allows for MLMC speed-ups altogether despite the Dean–Kawasaki equation being highly singular.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A space–time–parameters structure of parametric parabolic PDEs motivates the application of tensor methods to define reduced order models (ROMs). Within a tensor-based ROM framework, the matrix SVD—a traditional dimension reduction technique—yields to a low-rank tensor decomposition (LRTD). Such tensor extension of the Galerkin proper orthogonal decomposition ROMs (POD–ROMs) benefits both the practical efficiency of the ROM and its amenability for rigorous error analysis when applied to parametric PDEs. The paper addresses the error analysis of the Galerkin LRTD–ROM for an abstract linear parabolic problem that depends on multiple physical parameters. An error estimate for the LRTD–ROM solution is proved, which is uniform with respect to problem parameters and extends to parameter values not in a sampling/training set. The estimate is given in terms of discretization and sampling mesh properties and LRTD accuracy. The estimate depends on the local smoothness rather than on the Kolmogorov -widths of the parameterized manifold of solutions. Theoretical results are illustrated with several numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) is a data-driven tool for forecasting and model reduction of dynamics, which has been extensively taken up in the physical sciences. While the method is conceptually simple, in deterministic chaos it is unclear what its properties are or even what it converges to. In particular, it is not clear how EDMD’s least-squares approximation treats the classes of differentiable functions on which chaotic systems act. We develop for the first time a general, rigorous theory of EDMD on the simplest examples of chaotic maps: analytic expanding maps of the circle. To do this, we prove a new, basic approximation result in the theory of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle (OPUC) and apply methods from transfer operator theory. We show that in the infinite-data limit, the least-squares projection error is exponentially small for trigonometric polynomial observable dictionaries. As a result, we show that forecasts and Koopman spectral data produced using EDMD in this setting converge to the physically meaningful limits, exponentially fast with respect to the size of the dictionary. This demonstrates that with only a relatively small polynomial dictionary, EDMD can be very effective, even when the sampling measure is not uniform. Furthermore, our OPUC result suggests that data-based least-squares projection may be a very effective approximation strategy more generally.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We propose an energy-stable parametric finite element method (PFEM) for the planar Willmore flow and establish its unconditional energy stability of the full discretization scheme. The key lies in the introduction of two novel geometric identities to describe the planar Willmore flow: the first involves the coupling of the outward unit normal vector and the normal velocity , and the second concerns the time derivative of the mean curvature . Based on these, we derive a set of new geometric partial differential equations for the planar Willmore flow, leading to our new fully discretized and unconditionally energy-stable PFEM. Our stability analysis is also based on the two new geometric identities. Extensive numerical experiments are provided to illustrate our PFEM’s efficiency and validate its unconditional energy stability.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This work targets the discretization of contact-mechanics accounting for small strains, linear elastic constitutive laws, and fractures or faults represented as a network of co-dimension one planar interfaces. This type of model coupled with Darcy flow plays an important role typically for the simulation of fault reactivation by fluid injection in geological storage or the hydraulic fracture stimulation in enhanced geothermal systems. To simplify the presentation, a frictionless contact behavior at matrix fracture interfaces is considered, although the scheme developed in this work readily extends to more complex contact models such as the Mohr–Coulomb friction. To account for the geometrical complexity of subsurface, our discretization is based on the first order virtual element method (VEM), which generalizes the finite element method to polytopal meshes. Following previous works in the finite element framework, the contact conditions are enforced in a weak sense using Nitsche’s formulation based on additional consistent penalization terms. We perform, in a fully discrete framework, the well-posedness and convergence analysis showing an optimal first order error estimate with minimal regularity assumptions. Numerical experiments confirm our theoretical findings and exhibit the good behavior of the nonlinear semismooth Newton solver.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This study addresses some previously unexplored issues concerning the stability and error bounds of the primal hybrid finite element method. This method relaxes the strong interelement continuity conditions on the unknown of a boundary-value problem, set in terms of a second-order elliptic partial differential equation, by means of a Lagrange multiplier defined on the mesh skeleton. We show how the decomposition of the space of shape functions for the approximation of allows us to derive conditions, simple to verify, ensuring the inf-sup condition of Brezzi and Babuška, crucial for the stability of the discrete problem, both in two and three dimensions. An adaptation of the analysis of the mixed finite element approximation of the Helmholtz equation in [G. J. Fix and R. A. Nicolaides, SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 17 (1980), pp. 779–786] enables us to give stability conditions and error bounds, explicit in the mesh size and . Some numerical experiments show that the primal hybrid finite element method is more robust than the usual continuous finite element method with regard to dispersion anomalies, known as the pollution effect, particularly on well-smoothed meshes.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we design a simple and convergent linear finite element method for the linear second-order elliptic equation in nondivergence form and extend it to the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation. Motivated by the Miranda–Talenti estimate, we establish a discrete analogue of the estimate for the linear finite element space based on a new gradient recovery operator. The construction and properties of the gradient recovery operator, including its superconvergent property on mildly structured meshes, are discussed. We provide a proof of convergence for the proposed methods and support the theory with numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In the analysis of the -version of the finite-element method (FEM), with fixed polynomial degree , applied to the Helmholtz equation with wavenumber , the asymptotic regime is when is sufficiently small and the sequence of Galerkin solutions are quasioptimal; here is the norm of the Helmholtz solution operator, with for nontrapping problems. In the preasymptotic regime, one expects that if is sufficiently small, then (for physical data) the relative error of the Galerkin solution is controllably small. In this paper, we prove the natural error bounds in the preasymptotic regime for the variable-coefficient Helmholtz equation in the exterior of a Dirichlet, or Neumann, or penetrable obstacle (or combinations of these) and with the radiation condition either realized exactly using the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map on the boundary of a ball or approximated either by a radial perfectly matched layer (PML) or an impedance boundary condition. Previously, such bounds for were only available for Dirichlet obstacles with the radiation condition approximated by an impedance boundary condition. Our result is obtained via a novel generalization of the “elliptic-projection” argument (the argument used to obtain the result for ), which can be applied to a wide variety of abstract Helmholtz-type problems.},
