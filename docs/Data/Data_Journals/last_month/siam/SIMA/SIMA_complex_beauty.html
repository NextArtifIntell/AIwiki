In this paper, we present a series of applications of the pointwise estimates of the (unrestricted) Green tensor of the nonstationary Stokes system in the half space, established in our previous work [Comm. Math. Phys., 399 (2023), pp. 1291–1372]. First, we show the - estimates for the Stokes flow with possibly nonsolenoidal initial data, generalizing the results of Giga, Matsui, and Shimizu [Math. Z., 231 (1999), pp. 383–396] and Desch, Hieber, and Prüss [J. Evol. Equ., 1 (2001), pp. 115–142]. Second, we construct mild solutions of the Navier–Stokes equations in the half space with mixed-type pointwise decay or with pointwise decay alongside boundary vanishing. Finally, we explore various coupled fluid systems in the half space including viscous resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations, a coupled system for the flow and the magnetic field of MHD type, and the nematic liquid crystal flow. For each of these systems, we construct mild solutions in , pointwise decay, and uniformly local spaces.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we investigate the two-dimensional extension of a recently introduced set of shallow water models based on a regularized moment expansion of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations [J. Kowalski and M. Torrilhon, Commun. Comput. Phys., 25 (2018), pp. 669–702; J. Koellermeier and M. Rominger, Commun. Comput. Phys., 28 (2020), pp. 1038–1084]. We show the rotational invariance of the proposed moment models with two different approaches. The first proof involves the split of the coefficient matrix into the conservative and nonconservative parts and proves the rotational invariance for each part, while the second one relies on the special block structure of the coefficient matrices. With the aid of rotational invariance, the analysis of the hyperbolicity for the moment model in two dimensions is reduced to the real diagonalizability of the coefficient matrix in one dimension. Then we analyze the real diagonalizability by deriving the analytical form of the characteristic polynomial. We find that the moment model in two dimensions is hyperbolic in most cases and weakly hyperbolic in a degenerate edge case. With a simple modification to the coefficient matrices, we fix this weakly hyperbolicity and propose a new global hyperbolic model. Furthermore, we extend the model to include a more general class of closure relations than the original model and establish that this set of general closure relations retains both rotational invariance and hyperbolicity.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this article, we investigate the nonlinear stability of the viscous contact wave for the isentropic compressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations with a free boundary. It is shown that, when time tends to infinity, the fluid part of solutions will asymptotically converge to the viscous contact waves, and more importantly, the magnetic field will converge to a nontrivial wave pattern. This wave phenomenon is different from those of isentropic compressible Navier–Stokes equations, which means the magnetic field truly makes an essential effect on the fluid behavior. The main result is proved by using elaborate wave pattern analysis and elementary energy methods, provided the initial perturbations and wave strength are suitably small.},

We consider the Cauchy problem for the 3D incompressible axisymmetric swirl-free Euler equations. The convex integration method developed by De Lellis and Székelyhidi rules out the possibility that the Euler equations admit unique admissible weak solutions. It had remained conceivable, though, that axisymmetry of the solution might serve as a selection criterion. Using a surprising link to 2D isentropic compressible Euler equations, we will show that this is not the case: There exists initial data for which there are infinitely many admissible swirl-free axisymmetric weak solutions of the 3D incompressible Euler equations. Moreover, somewhat conversely, we show that there exists an axisymmetric swirl-free initial velocity for which the axisymmetry breaks down instantaneously.},

To overcome this difficulty, we introduce the decomposition , where is a self-similar solution with the same mean as and is a remainder that has better decay. By using the explicit expression for , we are able to get better low-frequency behavior for than we could from dispersive estimates alone. An advantage of our method is its robustness: It does not depend on the precise algebraic structure of the equation, and as such can be more readily adapted to other contexts.},

In the context of linear elasticity, if the Lamé parameters of inclusions are of high contrast with those of the matrix, the stress generally blows up in the narrow region between closely located inclusions. The contributions and novelties of this present paper are twofold: (i) We establish pointwise second-order derivative estimates for the solutions to the Lamé system with partially infinite coefficients, modeling hard and strictly convex inclusions in dimensions two and three, which will build a bridge between PDE analysis and numerical computation. (ii) Precise asymptotic characterizations of the gradient are obtained, which capture all the singularities of different orders and improve our earlier results on the upper and lower bound estimates. Additionally, the asymptotic expressions of each element of the strain tensor are derived. We show that some of them may blow up with different rates, while some of them are bounded.},

We show that the distribution function converges to a regular distribution function along modifications to the characteristics of the linearized problem. We define the linearly growing corrections to the characteristic system in terms of a precise effective asymptotic force field. We make use of the scattering state to obtain the late-time asymptotic behavior of the spatial density.

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we propose and study the utilization of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map to uniquely identify the discount functions and cost function in a stationary mean field game (MFG) system. This study features several technical novelties that make it highly intriguing and challenging. First, it involves a coupling of two nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations. Second, the simultaneous recovery of multiple parameters poses a significant implementation challenge. Third, there is the probability measure constraint of the coupled equations to consider. Finally, the limited information available from partial boundary measurements adds another layer of complexity to the problem. Considering these challenges and problems, we present an enhanced higher-order linearization method to tackle the inverse problem related to the MFG system. Our proposed approach involves linearizing around a pair of zero solutions and fulfilling the probability measurement constraint by adjusting the positive input at the boundary. It is worth emphasizing that this technique is not only applicable for uniquely identifying multiple parameters using full-boundary measurements but also highly effective for utilizing partial-boundary measurements.

This new system of PDEs is an extension of the Monge–Ampère equation in dimensions, naturally arising from the prescribed curvature problem and closely related to the classical problem of the isometric immersions (II). Our main result achieves density in the set of subsolutions, of the Hölder solutions to the Von Kármán system (VK) which is the weak formulation of (MA). The regularity exponent is any exponent satisfying , where is an arbitrary dimension and an arbitrary codimension of the problem.

Our result covers the codimension interval so far uncharted even for the system (II), since the regularity with any achieved by Källen in [Ark.

We specifically focused on investigating the first two situations and gained comprehensive insights into their large time behavior.

We show that the problem of finding the barycenter in the Hellinger–Kantorovich setting admits a least-cost soft multimarginal formulation, provided that a one-sided hard marginal constraint is introduced. The constrained approach is then shown to admit a conic multimarginal reformulation based on defining a single joint multimarginal perspective cost function in the conic multimarginal formulation, as opposed to separate two-marginal perspective cost functions for each two-marginal problem in the coupled-two-marginal formulation, as was studied previously in the literature. We further establish that, as in the Wasserstein metric, the recently introduced framework of unbalanced multimarginal optimal transport can be reformulated using the notion of the least cost. Subsequently, we discuss an example when input measures are Dirac masses and numerically solve an example for Gaussian measures. Finally, we also explore why the constrained approach can be seen as a natural extension of a Wasserstein space barycenter to the unbalanced setting.},

Our proposed two-step reconstruction algorithm first determines the point source locations and subsequently reconstructs the Fourier components of the emission concentration functions. Numerical experiments on simulated data are conducted. The results demonstrate that the proposed two-step reconstruction algorithm can reliably reconstruct multiple point sources and accurately reconstruct the emission concentration functions. Additionally, by partitioning the algorithm into online and offline computations, and concentrating computational demand offline, real-time pollutant traceability becomes feasible. This method, applicable in various fields, especially those related to water pollution, can identify the source of a contaminant in the environment, thus serving as a valuable tool in environmental protection.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper is concerned with asymptotic persistence, extinction, and spreading properties for noncooperative Fisher–KPP systems with space-time periodic coefficients. Results are formulated in terms of a family of generalized principal eigenvalues associated with the linearized problem. When the maximal generalized principal eigenvalue is negative, all solutions to the Cauchy problem become locally uniformly positive in long time, at least one space-time periodic uniformly positive entire solution exists, and solutions with compactly supported initial condition asymptotically spread in space at a speed given by a Freidlin–Gärtner-type formula. When another, possibly smaller generalized principal eigenvalue is nonnegative, then, on the contrary, all solutions to the Cauchy problem vanish uniformly, and the zero solution is the unique space-time periodic nonnegative entire solution. When the two generalized principal eigenvalues differ and zero is in between, the long-time behavior depends on the decay at infinity of the initial condition. The proofs rely on double-sided controls by solutions of cooperative systems. The control from below is new for such systems and makes it possible to shorten the proofs and extend the generality of the system simultaneously.},

More precisely, we prove that the self-similar Güderley imploding shock solutions for a perfect gas with adiabatic exponent admit a self-similar extension consisting of two regions of smooth flow separated by an outgoing spherically symmetric shock wave of finite strength. In addition, for , we show that there is a unique choice of shock wave that gives rise to a globally defined self-similar flow with physical state at the spatial origin.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The present paper is concerned with the well-posedness theory for nonhomogeneous incompressible fluids exhibiting odd (nondissipative) viscosity effects. Differently from previous works, we consider here the full odd viscosity tensor. Similarly to the work of Bresch and Desjardins in compressible fluid mechanics, we identify the presence of an effective velocity in the system, linking the velocity field of the fluid and the gradient of a suitable function of the density. By use of this effective velocity, we propose a new formulation of the original system of equations, thus highlighting a strong similarity with the equations of the ideal magnetohydrodynamics. By taking advantage of the new formulation of the equations, we establish a local-in-time well-posedness theory in Besov spaces based on and prove a lower bound for the lifespan of the solutions implying “asymptotically global” existence: In the regime of small initial density variations, for small , the corresponding solution is defined up to some time satisfying the property when .},

More precisely, we construct nontrivial simply connected co-rotating and traveling patches with unequal vorticity magnitudes. The proof is carried out by means of a combination of a desingularization argument with the implicit function theorem on the linearization of contour dynamics equation. Our results extend recent ones in the range by Hassainia and Hmidi [Discrete Contin. Dyn. Syst., 41 (2021), pp. 1939–1969] and Hassainia and Wheeler [SIAM J. Math. Anal., 54 (2022), pp. 6054–6095] to more singular velocities, filling an open gap in the range of .},

We study the problem of minimal visibility index for bodies with fixed volume contained in the unit sphere. This problem is reduced to a special vector-valued problem of optimal mass transfer, which is solved partly analytically and partly numerically.

In this paper we consider two diffuse interface models for tumor growth coupling a Cahn–Hilliard type equation for the tumor phase parameter to a reaction-diffusion type equation for the nutrient. The models are distinguished by the presence of two different coupling source terms. For such problems, we address the question of the limit, as the diffuse interface parameter tends to zero, from diffuse interface models to sharp interface ones, justifying rigorously what was deduced via formal asymptotics in [H. Garcke, K. F. Lam, E. Sitka, and V. Styles, Math. Models Methods Appl. Sci., 26 (2016), pp. 1095–1148]. The resulting evolutions turn out to be varifold solutions to Mullins–Sekerka type flows for the tumor region suitably coupled with the equation for the nutrient.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We study a semidiscrete model for the two-dimensional incompressible porous medium equation describing the gravitational fingering phenomenon. The model consists of a system of advection-reaction-diffusion equations on concentration, velocity, and pressure, describing the motion of miscible liquids under Darcy’s law in two vertical tubes (real lines) and interflow between them. Our analysis reveals the structure of gravitational fingers in this simple setting — the mixing zone consists of space-time regions of constant intermediate concentrations and the profile of propagation is characterized by two consecutive traveling waves which we call a terrace. We prove the existence of such a propagating terrace for the parameters corresponding to small distances between the tubes. This solution shows the possible mechanism of slowing down the fingers’ growth due to convection in the transverse direction. The main tool in the proof is a reduction to pressure-free transverse flow equilibrium model using geometrical singular perturbation theory and the persistence of stable and unstable manifolds under small perturbations.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We prove a strong form of the comparison principle for the elliptic Monge–Ampère equation, with a Dirichlet boundary condition interpreted in the viscosity sense. This comparison principle is valid when the equation admits a Lipschitz continuous weak solution. The result is tight, as demonstrated by examples in which the strong comparison principle fails in the absence of Lipschitz continuity. This form of comparison principle closes a significant gap in the convergence analysis of many existing numerical methods for the Monge–Ampère equation. An important corollary is that any consistent, monotone, stable approximation of the Dirichlet problem for the Monge–Ampère equation will converge to the viscosity solution.},
