  abstract     = {Abstract. Identifying parameters in nonlinear dynamical systems, based solely on observational time series data, is of paramount importance to modeling, understanding, and predicting complex systems. While the adaptive synchronization technique has been successfully used for various identification tasks in the existing literature, its rigorousness hinges crucially on the prerequisite of the linear independence (LI) behaviors of the data converging to the limit set or attractor. This prerequisite is not always satisfied in real applications, since only the short-term data of transient dynamics produced by the systems under consideration is available. Here, to conquer this challenge, we introduce an iteratively adaptive framework designed to operate efficiently on short-term data of transient dynamics. We conduct theoretical analysis to demonstrate its rigorousness, and we offer a few representative examples from toy models to a real-world dataset to illustrate its practical usefulness and efficacy. In particular, an introduction of deliberately designed control or random perturbations renders the LI behaviors more attainable solely on transient dynamics. Consequently, successful identification of a substantial number of parameters in complex systems using short-term data becomes achievable, which significantly broadens the potential application scenarios of our work.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Recent clinical studies provide strong evidence that adaptive tumor therapy is a promising threshold policy-guided periodic and intermittent treatment for prolonging treatment efficacy particularly for prostate cancer, despite the observed tumor size fluctuations in the patients. Understanding plausible patterns of tumor size fluctuations under different treatment scenarios is important to evaluate the therapy outcomes. Here we use state-of-the-art modeling and analytic frameworks of periodic switching systems and state-dependent switching systems to develop a dynamic model that mimics the adaptive therapy, and we describe dynamical behaviors of the model system with a particular focus on the patterns of periodic fluctuation. Under the threshold policy, patients may not be given therapies during the a priori treatment period. We show that this threshold-guided treatment will give rise to a new type of periodic solutions with complex structures, characterized as -periodic solutions. We examine, both theoretically and numerically, the existence, as well as the local and global stability of such periodic solutions, including the boundary periodic solutions with one vanished compartment and positive -periodic solutions. It is hoped this study also shows the great potential in developing a class of models to describe threshold-triggered periodic and intermittent control in many fields, which in turn may generate many new dynamic behaviors of nonsmooth dynamic systems.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Optimal transport has been an essential tool for reconstructing dynamics from complex data. With the increasingly available multifaceted data, a system can often be characterized across multiple spaces. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain coherence in the dynamics across these diverse spaces. To address this challenge, we introduce synchronized optimal transport (SyncOT), a novel approach to jointly model dynamics that represent the same system through multiple spaces. Given the correspondence between the spaces, SyncOT minimizes the aggregated cost of the dynamics induced across all considered spaces. The problem is discretized into a finite-dimensional convex problem using a staggered grid. Primal-dual algorithm-based approaches are then developed to solve the discretized problem. Various numerical experiments demonstrate the capabilities and properties of SyncOT and validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

We use the Wigner transformation and asymptotic analysis to systematically derive the semiclassical model for the Schrödinger equation in arbitrary spatial dimensions, with any periodic structure. Our particular emphasis lies in addressing the diabatic effect, i.e., the impact of Bloch band crossings. We consider both deterministic and random scenarios. In the former case, we derive a coupled Liouville system, revealing lower-order interactions among different Bloch bands. In the latter case, a coupled system of radiative transport equations emerges, with the scattering cross section induced by the random inhomogeneities. As a specific application, we deduce the effective dynamics of a wave packet in graphene with randomness.},

Multi-species BGK models describe the dynamics of rarefied gases with constituent particles of different elements or compounds with potentially nontrivial velocity distributions. In this paper, moment equations for the bulk velocities, energies, and temperatures of a spatially homogeneous multi-species BGK model are examined. A key challenge in analyzing these equations is the fact that the collision frequencies are allowed to depend on the species temperatures, which allows for more realistic simulations of dilute gas flow. Therefore, a positive lower bound is established for the species temperatures. With this lower bound, a global existence and uniqueness of solutions to the coupled velocity-energy ODE system is established. The lower bound also enables a proof of exponential decay to a unique steady-state solution. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate how the bulk velocities and temperatures relax for large times.},

Solving the stationary nonlinear Fokker–Planck equations is important in applications and examples include the Poisson–Boltzmann equation and the two-layer neural networks. Making use of the connection between the interacting particle systems and the nonlinear Fokker–Planck equations, we propose solving the stationary solution by sampling from the -body Gibbs distribution. This avoids simulation of the -body system for a long time and the requirement of uniform propagation of chaos from direct simulation of the particle systems. While the sampling strategy could be used for any given temperature, we establish the convergence of the Gibbs measure to the stationary solution when the interaction kernel is bounded (not necessarily continuous) and the temperature is high enough. Numerical experiments are performed for the Poisson–Boltzmann equation and the two-layer neural networks to validate the method and the theory.},

It was a simple forward substitution method based on a two-dimensional Zernike basis.

The method is likewise a forward substitution, hence making it very efficient to numerically implement. Moreover, the three-dimensional method only makes use of a relatively small subset of boundary measurements for exact reconstruction compared to a full basis of current densities.},

To that end, we consider an extension of the one-dimensional Klausmeier model that accounts for the toxicity compounds. Numerical simulations are first conducted to capture the qualitative behaviors of the pulse–type solutions and, then, geometric singular perturbation theory is used to prove the existence of such traveling pulses by constructing the corresponding homoclinic orbits in the associated four-dimensional system. A scaling analysis on the investigated model is performed to identify the asymptotic scaling regime in which traveling pulses can be constructed. Interestingly, due to the autotoxicity extension, the use of geometric blowup techniques can be avoided, in contrast with previous work [P. Carter and A. Doelman, SIAM J. Appl. Math., 78 (2023), pp. 3213–3237]. Some biological observations are extracted from the analytical results and the role of autotoxicity in traveling patterns is emphasized. Finally, the analytically constructed solutions are compared with the numerical ones, leading to a good agreement that confirms the validity of the conducted analysis. Numerical investigations are also carried out in order to gain additional information on vegetation dynamics.},

The problem of finding the fastest out of such events to occur is called an extreme first passage time. The rare event times are singular and limit to infinity as a positive parameter scaling the noise magnitude is reduced to zero. In contrast, previous work has shown that the mean of the fastest event time goes to zero in the limit of an infinite number of walkers. The combined limit is studied. In particular, the mean time and the most likely path taken by the fastest random walker are investigated. Using techniques from large deviation theory, it is shown that there is a distinguished limit where the mean time for the fastest walker can take any positive value, depending on a single proportionality constant. Furthermore, it is shown that the mean time and most likely path can be approximated using the solution to a variational problem related to the single-walker rare event.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Many transport processes in ecology, physics, and biochemistry can be described by the average time to first find a site or exit a region, starting from an initial position. Typical mathematical treatments are based on formulations that allow for various diffusive forms and geometries but where only initial and final positions are taken into account. Here we develop a general theory for the mean first passage time (MFPT) for velocity jump processes. For random walkers, both position and velocity are tracked and the resulting Fokker–Planck equation takes the form of a kinetic transport equation. Starting from the forward and backward formulations we derive a general elliptic integro-PDE for the MFPT of a random walker starting at a given location with a given velocity. We focus on two scenarios that are relevant to biological modeling; the diffusive case and the anisotropic case. For the anisotropic case we also perform a parabolic scaling, leading to a well-known anisotropic MFPT equation. To illustrate the results we consider a two-dimensional circular domain under radial symmetry, where the MFPT equations can be solved explicitly. Furthermore, we consider the MFPT of a random walker in an ecological habitat that is perturbed by linear features, such as wolf movement in a forest habitat that is crossed by seismic lines.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The cancer microenvironment is increasingly being viewed as an ecosystem, in which tumor cells interact with surrounding cells through diverse ecological relationships. However, the ecological principles governing the dynamics of cancer development and progression remain a mystery, hindering efforts to develop better treatment strategies. Here, we propose a novel ecological network of “predation-mutualism-amensalism” among tumor cells, immune cells, and mutualist cells. We found that this ecological model can accurately recapitulate the dynamic states and their transitions during cancer immunoediting by integrating mathematical modeling, stability and bifurcation analysis, and validation using experiment data. In contrast, two current models that only described predation and amensalism interactions failed to achieve it, suggesting the essential contribution of mutualism to the evolution of cancer immunoediting. Further, the immune barrier as a quantitative index was exploited to investigate the interlinkages between ecological relationships and cancer progression. Surprisingly, we found that the mutualism-mediated and amensalism-mediated inhibition of antitumor immune response only affects the transition from dormancy to escape phase, while the predation-mediated antitumor immune response affects all the phase transition dynamics of cancer progression. Moreover, by constructing the solution landscape of cancer progression dynamics, we revealed that tumor cell migration enables cancer progression to enter the dormancy phase by evading immunosurveillance, while mutualist cell migration facilitates the tumor’s evasion from dormancy to escape phase. The discovery of these ecological principles and the understanding of cell motility within the cancer microenvironment provide a potential for improved intervention of ecological interactions that could impact cancer progression and treatment.},

In this article, we study the MacDonald Hamiltonian for twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and analyze the low-lying spectrum in TMDs in the limit of small twisting angles. Unlike in twisted bilayer graphene Hamiltonians, we show that TMDs do not exhibit flat bands. The flatness in TMDs for small twisting angles is due to spatial confinement by a matrix-valued potential. We show that by generalizing semiclassical techniques developed by Simon [Ann. Inst. H. Poincaré, 38 (1983), pp. 295–307] and Helffer and Sjöstrand [Comm. Partial Differential Equations, 9 (1984), pp. 337–408] to matrix-valued potentials, there exists a wide range of model parameters such that the low-lying bands are of exponentially small width in the twisting angle, are topologically trivial, and obey a harmonic oscillator type of spacing with explicit parameters.},

Matrix representations are a powerful tool for designing efficient algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems such as matching, and linear matroid intersection and parity. In this paper, we initiate the study of matrix representations using the concept of noncommutative rank (nc-rank), which has recently attracted attention in the research of Edmonds’ problem. We reveal that the nc-rank of the matrix representation of linear matroid parity corresponds to the optimal value of fractional linear matroid parity: a half-integral relaxation of linear matroid parity. Based on our representation, we present an algebraic algorithm for the fractional linear matroid parity problem by building a new technique to incorporate the search-to-decision reduction into the half-integral problem represented via the nc-rank. We further present a faster divide-and-conquer algorithm for finding a maximum fractional matroid matching and an algebraic algorithm for finding a dual optimal solution. They together lead to an algebraic algorithm for the weighted fractional linear matroid parity problem. Our algorithms are significantly simpler and faster than the existing algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Given recording pairwise distances, the Metric Violation Distance problem asks to compute the distance between and the metric cone; i.e., modify the minimum number of entries of to make it a metric. Due to its large number of applications in various data analysis and optimization tasks, this problem has been actively studied recently. We present an -approximation algorithm for Metric Violation Distance, exponentially improving the previous best approximation ratio of of Fan, Raichel, and Van Buskirk [SODA, 2018]. Furthermore, a major strength of our algorithm is its simplicity and running time. We also study the related problem of Ultrametric Violation Distance, where the goal is to compute the distance to the cone of ultrametrics, and achieve a constant factor approximation algorithm. The Ultrametric Violation Distance problem can be regarded as an extension of the problem of fitting ultrametrics studied by Ailon and Charikar [SIAM J. Comput., 2011] and by Cohen-Addad, Das, Kipouridis, Parotsidis, and Thorup [FOCS, 2021] from norm to norm. We show that this problem can be favorably interpreted as an instance of Correlation Clustering with an additional hierarchical structure, which we solve using a new -approximation algorithm for correlation clustering that has the structural property that it outputs a refinement of the optimum clusters. An algorithm satisfying such a property can be considered of independent interest. We also provide an -approximation algorithm for a weighted version of Ultrametric Violation Distance. Finally, we investigate the complementary version of these problems where one aims at choosing a maximum number of entries of forming an (ultra)metric. In stark contrast to the minimization versions, we prove that these maximization versions are hard to approximate within any constant factor assuming the Unique Games Conjecture.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In the -minor-free deletion problem we are given an undirected graph and the goal is to find a minimum vertex set that intersects all minor models of graphs from the family . This captures numerous important problems including Vertex cover, Feedback vertex set, Treewidth- modulator, and Vertex planarization. In the latter one, we ask for a minimum vertex set whose removal makes the graph planar. This is a special case of -minor-free deletion for the family . Whenever the family contains at least one planar graph, then -minor-free deletion is known to admit a constant-factor approximation algorithm and a polynomial kernelization [F. Fomin et al., Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, IEEE, 2012, pp. 470–479]. A polynomial kernelization is a polynomial-time algorithm that, given a graph and integer , outputs a graph on vertices and integer , so that if and only if . The Vertex planarization problem is arguably the simplest setting for which does not contain a planar graph and the existence of a constant-factor approximation or a polynomial kernelization remains a major open problem. In this work we show that Vertex planarization admits an algorithm which is a combination of both approaches. Namely, we present a polynomial -approximate kernelization, for some constant , based on the framework of lossy kernelization [D. Lokshtanov et al., Proceedings of the 49th Annual ACM SIGACT Symposium on Theory of Computing, ACM, 2017, pp. 224–237]. Simply speaking, when given a graph and integer , we show how to compute a graph on vertices so that any -approximate solution to can be lifted to an -approximate solution to , as long as . In order to achieve this, we develop a toolkit for sparsification of planar graphs which approximately preserves all separators and near-separators between subsets of the given terminal set. Our result yields an improvement over the state-of-the-art approximation algorithms for Vertex planarization. The problem admits a polynomial-time -approximation algorithm, for any , and a quasi-polynomial-time -approximation algorithm, where is the input size, both randomized [K. Kawarabayashi and A. Sidiropoulos, Proceedings of the 51st Annual ACM SIGACT Symposium on Theory of Computing, ACM, 2019, pp. 164–175].

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we demonstrate the application of quantum feedback control in creating desired states for atomic and photonic systems utilizing a semi-infinite waveguide coupled with multiple two-level atoms. In this approach, an initially excited atom can emit one photon into the waveguide, and the photon can be reflected by either the terminal mirror of the waveguide or other atoms, establishing various feedback loops through the coherent interactions between the atom and photon. When there are no more than two excitations in the waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) system, the evolution of quantum states can be effectively elucidated through the lens of random graph theory. However, this process is influenced by the environment. We propose that the environment-induced dynamics in the coherent feedback loop can be eliminated by measurement-based feedback control or coherent drives. Consequently, in the atom-waveguide interactions in open quantum systems, measurement-based feedback has the potential to modulate the quantum steady states. Additionally, the homodyne detection noise during the measurement process can induce errors upon quantum states, which can be influenced by the coherent feedback parameter designs.},

This paper considers a risk-sensitive optimal control problem for a field-mediated interconnection of a quantum plant with a coherent (measurement-free) quantum controller. The plant and the controller are multimode open quantum harmonic oscillators governed by linear quantum stochastic differential equations, which are coupled to each other and driven by multichannel quantum Wiener processes modeling the external bosonic fields. The control objective is to internally stabilize the closed-loop system and minimize the infinite-horizon asymptotic growth rate of a quadratic-exponential functional which penalizes the plant variables and the controller output. We obtain first-order necessary conditions of optimality for this problem by computing the partial Fréchet derivatives of the cost functional with respect to the energy and coupling matrices of the controller in the frequency domain and state space. An infinitesimal equivalence between the risk-sensitive and weighted coherent quantum LQG control problems is also established. In addition to variational methods, we employ spectral factorizations and infinite cascades of auxiliary classical systems. Their truncations are applicable to numerical optimization algorithms (such as the gradient descent) for coherent quantum risk-sensitive feedback synthesis.},

Actually, the property that intersections between eigenvalues are conical and that they do not pile up is generic. However, in physical situations, due to symmetry of the system, the spectrum can exhibit intersections that are not conical and possibly pile up. We extend the controllability result to cover these types of situations under the hypothesis that the intersections have at least one conical direction and the piled-up intersections have “rationally unrelated germs.” Finally, we provide a testable first-order sufficient condition for controllability.

  abstract     = {Abstract. The robust manipulation of ensembles of quantum systems exhibiting variations or uncertainties in the system parameters and dynamics has been a long-standing problem in the field of quantum control. Existing methods for addressing quantum ensemble control primarily rely on the use of state-space models that describe the time evolution of quantum states. In this paper, we introduce a distinctive quantum control paradigm by mapping the quantum ensemble control problem to a dual problem defined on a coordinate system established by a moment transform. This transformation introduces a new type of quantization in quantum systems, enabling tractable systems-theoretic analysis and effective optimal control design, which are typically opaque. Subsequently, we develop an iterative computational algorithm to solve the transformed optimal moment control problems. We conduct a convergence analysis for the proposed algorithm and demonstrate its applicability and effectiveness on various challenging pulse design problems in quantum control.},

The dynamical Lie algebra , which determines the controllability properties of the system, is a Lie subalgebra of such a Lie algebra .

In detail, we study when it is possible to control the dynamics of NLS as fast as desired via sufficiently large control signals and . We first show the existence of a family of quantum states for which this property is verified: this extends to the validity of a small-time control property recently shown on by the first author and Nersesyan, and on by Chambrion and the second author. Second, by considering some specific states belonging to this family, as a physical consequence we show the capability of controlling arbitrary changes of energy in bounded regions of the quantum system, in time zero. Our results are proved by exploiting the idea that the nonlinear term in NLS is only a perturbation of the linear problem when the time is as small as desired. The core of the proof, then, is the controllability of the bilinear equation which is tackled by using specific noncommutativity properties of infinite-dimensional propagators.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider the one-dimensional nonlinear Schrödinger equation with bilinear control. In the present paper, we study its local exact controllability near the ground state in the case of Dirichlet boundary conditions. To establish the controllability of the linearized equation, we use a bilinear control acting through four directions: three Fourier modes and one generic direction. The Fourier modes are appropriately chosen so that they satisfy a saturation property. These modes allow one to control approximately the linearzied Schrödinger equation. Then we show that the reachable set for the linearized equation is closed. This is achieved by representing the solution operator as a sum of two linear continuous mappings: one is surjective (here the control in generic direction is used) and the other is compact. A mapping with dense and closed image is surjective, so we conclude that the linearized Schrödinger equation is exactly controllable. The local exact controllability of the nonlinear equation then follows by the inverse mapping theorem.},

Based on this, we develop a distributed extended stochastic gradient algorithm to estimate unknown parameter matrices by integrating the diffusion strategy of extended regression vectors with the consensus strategy of neighbors’ estimates. We introduce cooperative nonpersistent excitation conditions to reflect the temporal and spatial union information condition, under which the almost sure convergence of the proposed distributed algorithm is established. Our results are obtained without assuming the independence, stationarity or persistent excitation conditions for the regressors and the Gaussian property for the system noises.

Specifically, we consider two properties that arise from supervised learning, namely universal interpolation—the ability to match arbitrary input and target training samples—and the closely related notion of universal approximation—the ability to approximate input-target functional relationships via flow maps. Under the assumption of affine invariance of the control family, we give a characterization of universal interpolation, showing that it holds for essentially any architecture with nonlinearity. Furthermore, we elucidate the relationship between universal interpolation and universal approximation in the context of general control systems, showing that the two properties cannot be deduced from each other.

G-Brownian motion and distribution dependence which is defined via the G-expectation prevent us from directly applying the stability analysis techniques developed for G-SDEs and MFSDEs to G-MFSDEs. To overcome these difficulties, we establish the G-Itô formula for G-MFSDEs, then, using this as our basis, we investigate the moment exponential stability and the global stability in probability of G-MFSDEs. We also stabilize an unstable G-MFSDE by adding a discrete-time state observation feedback control into the drift coefficient. Two examples are presented to check our theory results.},

A pioneering method is proposed to deal with heritable hidden information, a stochastic temporal sequence that unavoidably exists in many practical controllers. To capture such information, a gated recurrent unit structure is introduced, in which the gate mechanism is modeled by a Markovian sampling process. Based on that, the semitensor product is applied to formulate the system as a switched LCN with a time-varying dimension. Then, the matrix expansion technique is employed to unify the dimension, and necessary and sufficient criteria for asymptotic stabilization are derived in two typical cases of the heritable hidden information. All of these criteria can be implemented using a newly proposed algorithm that is applicable to general cases. Finally, two illustrative examples are presented to validate the theoretical results.},

Besides its independent interest, the previous result plays a crucial role for establishing the Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) when the ensemble is parametrized by a set consisting of infinitely many points. Namely, we first approximate by finite and increasing-in-size sets for which the PMP is known, and then we derive the PMP for the -limiting problem. The same strategy can be pursued in applications, where we can reduce infinite ensembles to finite ones to compute the minimizers numerically.

By focusing on the adjoint of the Koopman generator in the Hardy space on the polydisk (or on the real hypercube), we define equivalent linear (but infinite-dimensional) switched systems, and we construct a common Lyapunov functional for those systems, under a solvability condition of the Lie algebra generated by the linearized vector fields. A common Lyapunov function for the original switched nonlinear systems is derived from the Lyapunov functional by exploiting the reproducing kernel property of the Hardy space. The Lyapunov function is shown to converge in a bounded region of the state space, which proves global uniform stability of specific switched nonlinear systems on bounded invariant sets.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper we consider the boundary feedback stabilization of a quasi-linear hyperbolic system of balance laws. At one end of the space interval, there is a reflecting boundary condition. At the other end a stabilizing feedback law with a varying time-delay is prescribed. We present sufficient conditions for the exponential stability of the system. We show that exponential stabilization is possible if the product of the length of the interval and an upper bound for the source term is sufficiently small. We also show that if the product of the length of the interval and a lower bound for the source term is sufficiently large, the system is unstable. Our analysis is based on Lyapunov functions with weights that are given by hyperbolic functions that generalize the well-known exponential weights. Compared with previous contributions, we obtain conditions that can be verified more easily in terms of the system parameters. Our results show that for sufficiently short space intervals, and also with varying time-delay, exponential stabilization is possible with appropriately chosen feedback gains that depend on the maximal value of the time-delay and the maximal absolute value of its derivative.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Norm-optimal iterative learning control (NOILC) is effective for repetitive systems in achieving the monotonic decrease of the tracking error with respect to a specified trajectory. However, for classical NOILC, the model information is required, which contradicts the essential data-based characteristic for iterative learning control. Inspired by this contradiction, the current paper aims to establish a data-based design and analysis framework for NOILC, focusing on uncertain linear systems without system constraints. A Gaussian process regression (GPR)-based approach is leveraged to develop a virtual input-output relationship from only the collected system data, with which the design of NOILC can be accomplished without any model information. The monotonic convergence analysis of the proposed GPR-based NOILC is implemented such that the robust tracking task can be achieved in the presence of iteration-varying initial state shifts and disturbances, and the boundedness of all system trajectories can be ensured simultaneously. An example is also included to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the presented GPR-based NOILC methods.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper concerns quasi-stochastic approximation (QSA) to solve root finding problems commonly found in applications to optimization and reinforcement learning. Theory is couched in a continuous time setting, in which parameter estimates are defined via the solution to a -dimensional time-inhomogeneous ordinary differential equation . The conditions imposed imply that the time-varying vector field is almost periodic, so that in particular the time average of defines the time-homogeneous mean vector field , and the goal then is to find the root solving . The primary contribution on which other results are based is the perturbative mean flow representation: in which are identified as functionals of a state process. The representation is based on the application of techniques from Markov processes, for which Poisson’s equation plays a central role. This new representation, combined with new conditions for ultimate boundedness, has many applications for furthering the theory of QSA and its applications, including a proof that the estimation error is of order , but can be reduced to using a second order linear filter. Theory is illustrated using several examples, including applications to quasi-periodic linear systems and stochastic gradient descent.},

When model parameters are known, we formulate the equivalent auxiliary control problem with reflected state dynamics, for which the classical solution of the HJB equation with Neumann boundary condition is obtained explicitly. When model parameters are unknown, we introduce the exploratory formulation for the auxiliary control problem with entropy regularization and develop the continuous-time q-learning algorithm in models of reflected diffusion processes.

The proposed numerical approximation preserves the convexity of the continuous solution as well as the lower and upper obstacle bounds.

In this paper, we develop a space semidiscretized numerical scheme, rooted in the order reduction finite difference method, to uniformly and exponentially approximate the dynamics of an axially moving Euler–Bernoulli beam system under nonlinear boundary feedback control. This systematic approach encompasses the Euler–Bernoulli beam and wave equation under nonlinear boundary control as special cases. The feedback mechanism incorporates a nonlinear function that adheres to a sector condition, thus encompassing a diverse array of nonlinear feedback scenarios. The exponential stability and well-posedness of the continuous system are rigorously established through the application of integral inequality and nonlinear semigroup theory. Parallel to this, we demonstrate that the discrete systems, resulting from our numerical scheme, maintain uniform exponential stability with respect to the discrete step size. This conclusion is reached utilizing the discrete multiplier technique in conjunction with the integral inequality method, mirroring the analysis for the continuous counterpart. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to validate the efficacy and accuracy of the proposed numerical scheme, reinforcing its applicability in simulating and analyzing the behavior of the axially moving Euler–Bernoulli beam system under nonlinear boundary feedback control.},

Since in general the data may not determine the unknown BCN uniquely, such a problem cannot be approached by means of system identification combined with model-based analysis/control. Instead, we use the concept of informativity, which investigates the whole set of BCNs that explain the given data. An analysis/synthesis problem is then naturally solved for the unknown BCN if it is solved for all BCNs in this set. As such, we formulate necessary and sufficient conditions on the given data to be informative for a range of control analysis and synthesis problems. Also, explicit data-dependent formulas to compute control laws are given when the proposed informativity conditions are met. Examples are presented to show that, as expected, the obtained results are useful in situations where the measured data do not contain sufficient information to identify the unknown BCN.},

Our motivation is to study scenarios in which mean field Schrödinger problems arise as the limit of “standard” Schrödinger problems over interacting particles. Due to the stochastic maximum principle and a suitable penalization procedure, the result follows as a consequence of novel (quantitative) propagation of chaos results for forward-backward particle systems. The approach described in the paper seems flexible enough to address other questions in the theory. For instance, our stochastic control technique further allows us to solve the mean field Schrödinger problem and characterize its solution, the mean field Schrödinger bridge, by a forward-backward planning equation.},

Higher order necessary conditions for a minimizer of an optimal control problem—in particular, Goh and Legendre–Clebsch-type conditions—are generally obtained for systems whose dynamics is at least continuously differentiable in the state variable. Here, by making use of the notion of set-valued Lie bracket introduced in [F. Rampazzo and H. J. Sussmann, in Proceedings of the 40th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control, Vol. 3, 2001, pp. 2613–2618] and extended in [E. Feleqi and F.

In order to manage the simultaneous lack of smoothness of the adjoint equation and of the Lie bracket–like variations, we will exploit the notion of Quasi Differential Quotient, introduced in [M. Palladino and F. Rampazzo, [J. Differential Equations, 269 (2020), pp. 10107–10142].

When the coefficients are time-varying matrices, the existence of the solution to the mentioned control system is first proved and the solution can be represented by the Volterra integral where the properties of the kernel function are developed, and then the characterization of the existence and uniqueness of the optimal control under proper conditions is explored by maximum principle type necessary conditions. When the coefficients are constant matrices, the singular Volterra integral equation is reduced to the classical Caputo fractional system. In such cases, using the Mittag-Leffler matrix function and its properties, we show that if , the finiteness of the cost functional implies the initial value must be equal to zero, which results in there being no optimal control whence the initial value is not zero, while the cost functional must be finite if . Moreover, the existence and uniqueness of the optimal control for is characterized, and based on this characterization, an additional interesting finding that the optimal control for linear quadratic optimal control of the fractional system cannot be obtained by linear feedback with a constant gain satisfying an algebraic Riccati equation is concluded.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we present an impulse response identification scheme that incorporates the internal positivity side-information of the system. The realization theory of positive systems establishes specific criteria for the existence of a positive realization for a given transfer function. These transfer function criteria are translated to a set of suitable conditions on the shape and structure of the impulse responses of positive systems. Utilizing these conditions, the impulse response estimation problem is formulated as a constrained optimization in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space equipped with a stable kernel, and suitable constraints are imposed to encode the internal positivity side-information. The optimization problem is infinite-dimensional with an infinite number of constraints. An equivalent finite-dimensional convex optimization in the form of a convex quadratic program is derived. The resulting equivalent reformulation makes the proposed approach suitable for numerical simulation and practical implementation. A Monte Carlo numerical experiment evaluates the impact of incorporating the internal positivity side-information in the proposed identification scheme. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using data from a heating system experiment.},

In this paper, we investigate the two-dimensional extension of a recently introduced set of shallow water models based on a regularized moment expansion of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations [J. Kowalski and M. Torrilhon, Commun. Comput. Phys., 25 (2018), pp. 669–702; J. Koellermeier and M. Rominger, Commun. Comput. Phys., 28 (2020), pp. 1038–1084]. We show the rotational invariance of the proposed moment models with two different approaches. The first proof involves the split of the coefficient matrix into the conservative and nonconservative parts and proves the rotational invariance for each part, while the second one relies on the special block structure of the coefficient matrices. With the aid of rotational invariance, the analysis of the hyperbolicity for the moment model in two dimensions is reduced to the real diagonalizability of the coefficient matrix in one dimension. Then we analyze the real diagonalizability by deriving the analytical form of the characteristic polynomial. We find that the moment model in two dimensions is hyperbolic in most cases and weakly hyperbolic in a degenerate edge case. With a simple modification to the coefficient matrices, we fix this weakly hyperbolicity and propose a new global hyperbolic model. Furthermore, we extend the model to include a more general class of closure relations than the original model and establish that this set of general closure relations retains both rotational invariance and hyperbolicity.},

In this article, we investigate the nonlinear stability of the viscous contact wave for the isentropic compressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations with a free boundary. It is shown that, when time tends to infinity, the fluid part of solutions will asymptotically converge to the viscous contact waves, and more importantly, the magnetic field will converge to a nontrivial wave pattern. This wave phenomenon is different from those of isentropic compressible Navier–Stokes equations, which means the magnetic field truly makes an essential effect on the fluid behavior. The main result is proved by using elaborate wave pattern analysis and elementary energy methods, provided the initial perturbations and wave strength are suitably small.},

It had remained conceivable, though, that axisymmetry of the solution might serve as a selection criterion. Using a surprising link to 2D isentropic compressible Euler equations, we will show that this is not the case: There exists initial data for which there are infinitely many admissible swirl-free axisymmetric weak solutions of the 3D incompressible Euler equations. Moreover, somewhat conversely, we show that there exists an axisymmetric swirl-free initial velocity for which the axisymmetry breaks down instantaneously.},

To overcome this difficulty, we introduce the decomposition , where is a self-similar solution with the same mean as and is a remainder that has better decay. By using the explicit expression for , we are able to get better low-frequency behavior for than we could from dispersive estimates alone.

A long-standing area in materials science is to study the concentration phenomenon of electrostatic, magnetic, and elastic fields in composites with densely packed inclusions whose material properties differ from that of the background. In the context of linear elasticity, if the Lamé parameters of inclusions are of high contrast with those of the matrix, the stress generally blows up in the narrow region between closely located inclusions. The contributions and novelties of this present paper are twofold: (i) We establish pointwise second-order derivative estimates for the solutions to the Lamé system with partially infinite coefficients, modeling hard and strictly convex inclusions in dimensions two and three, which will build a bridge between PDE analysis and numerical computation. (ii) Precise asymptotic characterizations of the gradient are obtained, which capture all the singularities of different orders and improve our earlier results on the upper and lower bound estimates. Additionally, the asymptotic expressions of each element of the strain tensor are derived. We show that some of them may blow up with different rates, while some of them are bounded.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we study small data solutions for the Vlasov–Poisson system with the simplest external potential, for which unstable trapping holds for the associated Hamiltonian flow. First, we provide a new proof of global existence for small data solutions for the Vlasov–Poisson system with the repulsive potential in dimension two. In contrast with the proof in [A. Velozo Ruiz and R. Velozo Ruiz, Comm. Math. Phys., 405 (2024), 80], we do not use modified vector field techniques. Moreover, we obtain small data modified scattering for this nonlinear system. We show that the distribution function converges to a regular distribution function along modifications to the characteristics of the linearized problem. We define the linearly growing corrections to the characteristic system in terms of a precise effective asymptotic force field. We make use of the scattering state to obtain the late-time asymptotic behavior of the spatial density. Finally, we prove that the distribution function (up to normalization) converges weakly to a Dirac mass on the unstable manifold of the origin.},

We present a decomposition of -valued vector fields of -class on the boundary of a Lipschitz domain in that relates to an inverse source problem with a source term in divergence form for the Helmholtz equation. Applications thereof include weak scattering from thin interfaces. The inverse problem is not uniquely solvable, as the forward operator has an infinite-dimensional kernel. The proposed decomposition brings out constraints that can be used to restore uniqueness. This work subsumes the one in [L. Baratchart, C. Gerhards, and A. Kegeles, SIAM J. Math.

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we propose and study the utilization of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map to uniquely identify the discount functions and cost function in a stationary mean field game (MFG) system. This study features several technical novelties that make it highly intriguing and challenging. First, it involves a coupling of two nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations. Second, the simultaneous recovery of multiple parameters poses a significant implementation challenge. Third, there is the probability measure constraint of the coupled equations to consider. Finally, the limited information available from partial boundary measurements adds another layer of complexity to the problem. Considering these challenges and problems, we present an enhanced higher-order linearization method to tackle the inverse problem related to the MFG system. Our proposed approach involves linearizing around a pair of zero solutions and fulfilling the probability measurement constraint by adjusting the positive input at the boundary. It is worth emphasizing that this technique is not only applicable for uniquely identifying multiple parameters using full-boundary measurements but also highly effective for utilizing partial-boundary measurements.

This new system of PDEs is an extension of the Monge–Ampère equation in dimensions, naturally arising from the prescribed curvature problem and closely related to the classical problem of the isometric immersions (II). Our main result achieves density in the set of subsolutions, of the Hölder solutions to the Von Kármán system (VK) which is the weak formulation of (MA). The regularity exponent is any exponent satisfying , where is an arbitrary dimension and an arbitrary codimension of the problem.

Our findings reveal that the behavior of the solution at infinite time is solely determined by the value of , leading to three distinct situations: , or . We specifically focused on investigating the first two situations and gained comprehensive insights into their large time behavior. Furthermore, through the construction of a special solution, we discover that the variation of the parameter “” in the viscosity coefficient , when given , also exerts an influence on the large time behavior of the solution, particularly on the temperature .

We show that the problem of finding the barycenter in the Hellinger–Kantorovich setting admits a least-cost soft multimarginal formulation, provided that a one-sided hard marginal constraint is introduced. The constrained approach is then shown to admit a conic multimarginal reformulation based on defining a single joint multimarginal perspective cost function in the conic multimarginal formulation, as opposed to separate two-marginal perspective cost functions for each two-marginal problem in the coupled-two-marginal formulation, as was studied previously in the literature. We further establish that, as in the Wasserstein metric, the recently introduced framework of unbalanced multimarginal optimal transport can be reformulated using the notion of the least cost. Subsequently, we discuss an example when input measures are Dirac masses and numerically solve an example for Gaussian measures. Finally, we also explore why the constrained approach can be seen as a natural extension of a Wasserstein space barycenter to the unbalanced setting.},

This facilitates tracing the origins of environmental pollutants. Employing the concept of dynamic complex geometrical optics (CGO) solutions, a variational formulation of the inverse source problem is analyzed, leading to a proof of uniqueness result. Our proposed two-step reconstruction algorithm first determines the point source locations and subsequently reconstructs the Fourier components of the emission concentration functions. Numerical experiments on simulated data are conducted. The results demonstrate that the proposed two-step reconstruction algorithm can reliably reconstruct multiple point sources and accurately reconstruct the emission concentration functions. Additionally, by partitioning the algorithm into online and offline computations, and concentrating computational demand offline, real-time pollutant traceability becomes feasible. This method, applicable in various fields, especially those related to water pollution, can identify the source of a contaminant in the environment, thus serving as a valuable tool in environmental protection.},

First, we consider a general bounded domain in dimension , with a restriction, only in dimension , involving its inradius and first Dirichlet eigenvalue. In this general case, we show the existence of a mountain pass solution on the -sphere for belonging to a subset of positive measure of the interval and for a suitable threshold . Next, assuming that is star-shaped, we extend the previous result to all values . With respect to that of local minimizers, already known in the literature, the existence of mountain pass solutions in the Sobolev critical case is much more elusive. In particular, our proofs are based on the sharp analysis of the bounded Palais–Smale sequences, provided by a nonstandard adaptation of the Struwe monotonicity trick that we develop.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper is concerned with asymptotic persistence, extinction, and spreading properties for noncooperative Fisher–KPP systems with space-time periodic coefficients. Results are formulated in terms of a family of generalized principal eigenvalues associated with the linearized problem. When the maximal generalized principal eigenvalue is negative, all solutions to the Cauchy problem become locally uniformly positive in long time, at least one space-time periodic uniformly positive entire solution exists, and solutions with compactly supported initial condition asymptotically spread in space at a speed given by a Freidlin–Gärtner-type formula. When another, possibly smaller generalized principal eigenvalue is nonnegative, then, on the contrary, all solutions to the Cauchy problem vanish uniformly, and the zero solution is the unique space-time periodic nonnegative entire solution. When the two generalized principal eigenvalues differ and zero is in between, the long-time behavior depends on the decay at infinity of the initial condition. The proofs rely on double-sided controls by solutions of cooperative systems. The control from below is new for such systems and makes it possible to shorten the proofs and extend the generality of the system simultaneously.},

Similarly to the work of Bresch and Desjardins in compressible fluid mechanics, we identify the presence of an effective velocity in the system, linking the velocity field of the fluid and the gradient of a suitable function of the density. By use of this effective velocity, we propose a new formulation of the original system of equations, thus highlighting a strong similarity with the equations of the ideal magnetohydrodynamics. By taking advantage of the new formulation of the equations, we establish a local-in-time well-posedness theory in Besov spaces based on and prove a lower bound for the lifespan of the solutions implying “asymptotically global” existence: In the regime of small initial density variations, for small , the corresponding solution is defined up to some time satisfying the property when .},

The model consists of a system of advection-reaction-diffusion equations on concentration, velocity, and pressure, describing the motion of miscible liquids under Darcy’s law in two vertical tubes (real lines) and interflow between them. Our analysis reveals the structure of gravitational fingers in this simple setting — the mixing zone consists of space-time regions of constant intermediate concentrations and the profile of propagation is characterized by two consecutive traveling waves which we call a terrace. We prove the existence of such a propagating terrace for the parameters corresponding to small distances between the tubes. This solution shows the possible mechanism of slowing down the fingers’ growth due to convection in the transverse direction. The main tool in the proof is a reduction to pressure-free transverse flow equilibrium model using geometrical singular perturbation theory and the persistence of stable and unstable manifolds under small perturbations.},

This form of comparison principle closes a significant gap in the convergence analysis of many existing numerical methods for the Monge–Ampère equation.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We introduce discretizations of infinite-dimensional optimization problems with total variation regularization and integrality constraints on the optimization variables. We advance the discretization of the dual formulation of the total variation term with Raviart–Thomas functions, which is known from the literature for certain convex problems. Since we have an integrality constraint, the previous analysis from Caillaud and Chambolle [IMA J. Numer. Anal., 43 (2022), pp. 692–736] no longer holds. Even weaker -convergence results no longer hold because the recovery sequences generally need to attain noninteger values to recover the total variation of the limit function. We solve this issue by introducing a discretization of the input functions on an embedded, finer mesh. A superlinear coupling of the mesh sizes implies an averaging on the coarser mesh of the Raviart–Thomas ansatz, which enables us to recover the total variation of integer-valued limit functions with integer-valued discretized input functions. Moreover, we are able to estimate the discretized total variation of the recovery sequence by the total variation of its limit and an error depending on the mesh size ratio. For the discretized optimization problems, we additionally add a constraint that vanishes in the limit and enforces compactness of the sequence of minimizers, which yields their convergence to a minimizer of the original problem. This constraint contains a degree of freedom whose admissible range is determined. Its choice may have a strong impact on the solutions in practice as we demonstrate with an example from imaging.},

It is popular for researchers to prove the intermittency of the solution, which means that the moments of solution to a stochastic heat equation usually grow to infinity exponentially fast and this hints that the solution to stochastic heat equation is generally not stable in long time. However, quite surprisingly in this paper we show that when the domain is bounded and when the noise is not singular in spatial variables, the system can be long time stable and we also prove that we can approximate the solution by its finite dimensional spectral approximation, which is also long time stable. The idea is to use eigenfunction expansion of the Laplacian on a bounded domain to write a stochastic heat equation as a system of infinite many stochastic differential equations. We also present numerical experiments which are consistent with our theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this work, we propose a numerical method to compute the Wasserstein Hamiltonian flow (WHF), which is a Hamiltonian system on the probability density manifold. Many well-known PDE systems can be reformulated as WHFs. We use the parameterized function as a push-forward map to characterize the solution of WHF, and convert the PDE to a finite-dimensional ODE system, which is a Hamiltonian system in the phase space of the parameter manifold. We establish theoretical error bounds for the continuous time approximation scheme in the Wasserstein metric. For the numerical implementation, neural networks are used as push-forward maps. We design an effective symplectic scheme to solve the derived Hamiltonian ODE system so that the method preserves some important quantities such as Hamiltonian. The computation is done by a fully deterministic symplectic integrator without any neural network training. Thus, our method does not involve direct optimization over network parameters and hence can avoid errors introduced by the stochastic gradient descent or similar methods, which are usually hard to quantify and measure in practice. The proposed algorithm is a sampling-based approach that scales well to higher dimensional problems.

On the other hand, we show how the Cosserat materials can be analyzed by inheriting results from linearized elasticity. Both perspectives give rise to mixed finite element methods, which we refer to as strongly and weakly coupled, respectively. We prove convergence of both classes of methods, with particular attention to improved convergence rate estimates, and stability in the limit of vanishing characteristic length of the micropolar structure.

In this paper, we develop and analyze a multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) scheme for the Dean–Kawasaki equation, a pivotal representative of this class of SPDEs. We prove analytically and demonstrate numerically that our MLMC scheme provides a significant reduction in computational cost (with respect to a standard Monte Carlo method) in the simulation of the Dean–Kawasaki equation. Specifically, we link this reduction in cost to having a sufficiently large average particle density and show that sizeable cost reductions can be obtained even when we have solutions with regions of low density. Numerical simulations are provided in the two-dimensional case, confirming our theoretical predictions. Our results are formulated entirely in terms of the law of distributions rather than in terms of strong spatial norms: this crucially allows for MLMC speed-ups altogether despite the Dean–Kawasaki equation being highly singular.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A space–time–parameters structure of parametric parabolic PDEs motivates the application of tensor methods to define reduced order models (ROMs). Within a tensor-based ROM framework, the matrix SVD—a traditional dimension reduction technique—yields to a low-rank tensor decomposition (LRTD). Such tensor extension of the Galerkin proper orthogonal decomposition ROMs (POD–ROMs) benefits both the practical efficiency of the ROM and its amenability for rigorous error analysis when applied to parametric PDEs. The paper addresses the error analysis of the Galerkin LRTD–ROM for an abstract linear parabolic problem that depends on multiple physical parameters. An error estimate for the LRTD–ROM solution is proved, which is uniform with respect to problem parameters and extends to parameter values not in a sampling/training set. The estimate is given in terms of discretization and sampling mesh properties and LRTD accuracy. The estimate depends on the local smoothness rather than on the Kolmogorov -widths of the parameterized manifold of solutions. Theoretical results are illustrated with several numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) is a data-driven tool for forecasting and model reduction of dynamics, which has been extensively taken up in the physical sciences. While the method is conceptually simple, in deterministic chaos it is unclear what its properties are or even what it converges to. In particular, it is not clear how EDMD’s least-squares approximation treats the classes of differentiable functions on which chaotic systems act. We develop for the first time a general, rigorous theory of EDMD on the simplest examples of chaotic maps: analytic expanding maps of the circle. To do this, we prove a new, basic approximation result in the theory of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle (OPUC) and apply methods from transfer operator theory. We show that in the infinite-data limit, the least-squares projection error is exponentially small for trigonometric polynomial observable dictionaries. As a result, we show that forecasts and Koopman spectral data produced using EDMD in this setting converge to the physically meaningful limits, exponentially fast with respect to the size of the dictionary. This demonstrates that with only a relatively small polynomial dictionary, EDMD can be very effective, even when the sampling measure is not uniform. Furthermore, our OPUC result suggests that data-based least-squares projection may be a very effective approximation strategy more generally.},

Based on these, we derive a set of new geometric partial differential equations for the planar Willmore flow, leading to our new fully discretized and unconditionally energy-stable PFEM.

  abstract     = {Abstract. This work targets the discretization of contact-mechanics accounting for small strains, linear elastic constitutive laws, and fractures or faults represented as a network of co-dimension one planar interfaces. This type of model coupled with Darcy flow plays an important role typically for the simulation of fault reactivation by fluid injection in geological storage or the hydraulic fracture stimulation in enhanced geothermal systems. To simplify the presentation, a frictionless contact behavior at matrix fracture interfaces is considered, although the scheme developed in this work readily extends to more complex contact models such as the Mohr–Coulomb friction. To account for the geometrical complexity of subsurface, our discretization is based on the first order virtual element method (VEM), which generalizes the finite element method to polytopal meshes. Following previous works in the finite element framework, the contact conditions are enforced in a weak sense using Nitsche’s formulation based on additional consistent penalization terms. We perform, in a fully discrete framework, the well-posedness and convergence analysis showing an optimal first order error estimate with minimal regularity assumptions. Numerical experiments confirm our theoretical findings and exhibit the good behavior of the nonlinear semismooth Newton solver.},

In the preasymptotic regime, one expects that if is sufficiently small, then (for physical data) the relative error of the Galerkin solution is controllably small.

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper a streaming weak-SINDy algorithm is developed specifically for compressing streaming scientific data. The production of scientific data, either via simulation or experiments, is undergoing a stage of exponential growth, which makes data compression important and often necessary for storing and utilizing large scientific data sets. As opposed to classical “offline” compression algorithms that perform compression on a readily available data set, streaming compression algorithms compress data “online” while the data generated from simulation or experiments is still flowing through the system. This feature makes streaming compression algorithms well suited for scientific data compression, where storing the full data set offline is often infeasible. This work proposes a new streaming compression algorithm, streaming weak-SINDy, which takes advantage of the underlying data characteristics during compression. The streaming weak-SINDy algorithm constructs feature matrices and target vectors in the online stage via a streaming integration method in a memory efficient manner. The feature matrices and target vectors are then used in the offline stage to build a model through a regression process that aims to recover equations that govern the evolution of the data. For compressing high-dimensional streaming data, we adopt a streaming proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) process to reduce the data dimension and then use the streaming weak-SINDy algorithm to compress the temporal data of the POD expansion. We propose modifications to the streaming weak-SINDy algorithm to accommodate the dynamically updated POD basis. By combining the built model from the streaming weak-SINDy algorithm and a small amount of data samples, the full data flow could be reconstructed accurately at a low memory cost, as shown in the numerical tests.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper we address the importance and the impact of employing structure-preserving neural networks as a surrogate of the analytical physics-based models typically employed to describe the rheology of non-Newtonian fluids in Stokes flows. In particular, we propose and test on real-world scenarios a novel strategy to build data-driven rheological models based on the use of input-convex neural networks (ICNNs), a special class of feedforward neural network scalar-valued functions that are convex with respect to their inputs. Moreover, we show, through a detailed campaign of numerical experiments, that the use of ICNNs is of paramount importance to guarantee the well-posedness of the associated non-Newtonian Stokes differential problem. Finally, building upon a novel perturbation result for non-Newtonian Stokes problems, we study the impact of our data-driven ICNN based rheological model on the accuracy of the finite element approximation.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We introduce a new class of hybrid preconditioners for solving parametric linear systems of equations. The proposed preconditioners are constructed by hybridizing the deep operator network, namely, DeepONet, with standard iterative methods. Exploiting the spectral bias, DeepONet-based components are harnessed to address low-frequency error components, while conventional iterative methods are employed to mitigate high-frequency error components. Our preconditioning framework comprises two distinct hybridization approaches: direct preconditioning (DP) and trunk basis (TB). In the DP approach, DeepONet is used to approximate an action of an inverse operator to a vector during each preconditioning step. In contrast, the TB approach extracts basis functions from the trained DeepONet to construct a map to a smaller subspace, in which the low-frequency component of the error can be effectively eliminated. Our numerical results demonstrate that utilizing the TB approach enhances the convergence of Krylov methods by a large margin compared to standard nonhybrid preconditioning strategies. Moreover, the proposed hybrid preconditioners exhibit robustness across a wide range of model parameters and problem resolutions.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The solution of linear inverse problems arising, for example, in signal and image processing is a challenging problem since the ill-conditioning amplifies, in the solution, the noise present in the data. Recently introduced algorithms based on deep learning overwhelm the more traditional model-based approaches in performance, but they typically suffer from instability with respect to data perturbation. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the trade-off between stability and accuracy of neural networks when used to solve linear imaging inverse problems for cases that are not underdetermined. Moreover, we propose different supervised and unsupervised solutions to increase the network stability and maintain a good accuracy, by means of regularization properties inherited from a model-based iterative scheme during the network training. Extensive numerical experiments on image deblurring confirm the theoretical results and the effectiveness of the proposed deep learning–based approaches to handle noise on the data.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We introduce a data-driven and physics-informed framework for propagating uncertainty in stiff, multiscale random ordinary differential equations (RODEs) driven by correlated (colored) noise. Unlike systems subjected to Gaussian white noise, a deterministic equation for the joint probability density function (PDF) of RODE state variables does not exist in closed form. Moreover, such an equation would require as many phase-space variables as there are states in the RODE system. To alleviate this curse of dimensionality, we instead derive exact, albeit unclosed, reduced-order PDF (RoPDF) equations for low-dimensional observables/quantities of interest. The unclosed terms take the form of state-dependent conditional expectations, which are directly estimated from data at sparse observation times. However, for systems exhibiting stiff, multiscale dynamics, data sparsity introduces regression discrepancies that compound during RoPDF evolution. This is overcome by introducing a kinetic-like defect term to the RoPDF equation, which is learned by assimilating in sparse, low-fidelity RoPDF estimates. Two assimilation methods are considered, namely nudging and deep neural networks, which are successfully tested against Monte Carlo simulations.},

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are widely used to model sequential data in a wide range of areas, such as natural language processing, speech recognition, machine translation, and time series analysis. In this paper, we model the training process of RNNs with the ReLU activation function as a constrained optimization problem with a smooth nonconvex objective function and piecewise smooth nonconvex constraints. We prove that any feasible point of the optimization problem satisfies the no nonzero abnormal multiplier constraint qualification, and any local minimizer is a Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) point of the problem. Moreover, we propose an augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) and design an efficient block coordinate descent (BCD) method to solve the subproblems of the ALM. The update of each block of the BCD method has a closed-form solution. The stop criterion for the inner loop is easy to check and can be stopped in finite steps. Moreover, we show that the BCD method can generate a directional stationary point of the subproblem. Furthermore, we establish the global convergence of the ALM to a KKT point of the constrained optimization problem. Compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, numerical results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the ALM for training RNNs.},

Central to TPT is the committor function, which describes the probability to hit the metastable state prior to from any given starting point of the phase space. Once the committor is computed, the transition channels and the transition rate can be readily found. The committor is the solution to the backward Kolmogorov equation with appropriate boundary conditions. However, solving it is a challenging task in high dimensions due to the need to mesh a whole region of the ambient space. In this work, we explore the finite expression method (FEX, Liang and Yang (2022)) as a tool for computing the committor. FEX approximates the committor by an algebraic expression involving a fixed finite number of nonlinear functions and binary arithmetic operations. The optimal nonlinear functions, the binary operations, and the numerical coefficients in the expression template are found via reinforcement learning. The FEX-based committor solver is tested on several high-dimensional benchmark problems. It gives comparable or better results than neural network-based solvers. Most importantly, FEX is capable of correctly identifying the algebraic structure of the solution which allows one to reduce the committor problem to a low-dimensional one and find the committor with any desired accuracy.},

The new contributions in this study are the novel coupled formulation with the higher-order correction terms for orthogonal periodic configurations and the global error estimation with an explicit rate for higher-order multiscale solutions in the integral norm sense. By combining the multiscale asymptotic technique and the Taylor series approach, the multiscale method is developed for nonlinear time-dependent thermomechanical problems, which can keep the conservation of local energy and momentum for multiscale simulation.

  abstract     = {Abstract. In FEM-based electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) source analysis, the subtraction approach has been proposed to simulate sensor measurements generated by neural activity. While this approach possesses a rigorous foundation and produces accurate results, its major downside is that it is computationally prohibitively expensive in practical applications. To overcome this, we developed a new approach, called the local subtraction approach. This approach is designed to preserve the mathematical foundation of the subtraction approach, while also leading to sparse right-hand sides in the FEM formulation, making it efficiently computable. We achieve this by introducing a cut-off into the subtraction, restricting its influence to the immediate neighborhood of the source. We perform validation in multilayer sphere models where analytical solutions exist. There, we demonstrate that the local subtraction approach is vastly more efficient than the subtraction approach. Moreover, we find that for the EEG forward problem, the local subtraction approach is less dependent on the global structure of the FEM mesh when compared to the subtraction approach. Additionally, we show the local subtraction approach to rival, and in many cases even surpass, the other investigated approaches in terms of accuracy. For the MEG forward problem, we show the local subtraction approach and the subtraction approach to produce highly accurate approximations of the volume currents close to the source. The local subtraction approach thus reduces the computational cost of the subtraction approach to an extent that makes it usable in practical applications without sacrificing the rigorousness and accuracy the subtraction approach is known for.

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper introduces a code generator designed for extreme-scalable, matrix-free finite element operators on hybrid tetrahedral grids. It optimizes the local evaluation of bilinear forms through various techniques including tabulation, relocation of loop invariants, and interelement vectorization—implemented as transformations of an abstract syntax tree. A key contribution is the generator’s ability to optimize not only the local assembly, but also the loop over the underlying grid. To that end, the developed “cubes” loop pattern leverages local structure resulting from grid refinement and significantly enhances arithmetic intensity. Its effectiveness is established during a memory and layer condition analysis. The paper demonstrates the generator’s capabilities through a comprehensive, educational cycle of performance analysis, bottleneck identification, and emission of dedicated optimizations. For three differential operators (, ), the set of most effective optimizations is determined from a larger pool.

We make performance comparisons with a sparse matrix-vector multiplication and operators generated by the Firedrake project at increasing levels of refinement. Finally, the solution of the curl-curl problem with more than a trillion degrees of freedom on 21,504 processes in less than 50 s showcases the generated operators’ performance and extreme scalability as part of a full multigrid solver.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. An adaptive algorithm for computing eigenmodes and propagation constants of optical fibers is proposed. The algorithm is built using a dual-weighted residual error estimator. The residuals are based on the eigensystem for leaky hybrid modes obtained from Maxwell equations truncated to a finite domain after a transformation by a perfectly matched layer. The adaptive algorithm is then applied to compute practically interesting modes for multiple fiber microstructures. Emerging microstructured optical fibers are characterized by complex geometrical features in their transverse cross section. Their leaky modes, useful for confining and propagating light in their cores, often exhibit fine-scale features. The adaptive algorithm automatically captures these features without any expert input. The results also show that confinement losses of these modes are captured accurately on the adaptively found meshes.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The Poisson–Boltzmann equation (PBE) is an implicit solvent continuum model for calculating the electrostatic potential and energies of charged biomolecules in ionic solutions. However, its numerical solution poses significant challenges due to strong singularities in the solution caused by the singular source terms, while in case of the nonlinear PBE (NLPBE) the additional problems arise owing to the exponential nonlinear terms. An efficient method for the treatment of singularities in the linear PBE was introduced in [P. Benner, V. Khoromskaia, B. Khoromskij, C. Kweyu, and M. Stein, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 43 (2021), pp. A415–A445], that is based on the range-separated (RS) tensor decomposition [P. Benner, V. Khoromskaia, and B. N. Khoromskij, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 40 (2018), pp. A1034–A1062] for both the electrostatic potential of the biomolecule of interest and the discretized Dirac delta distributions on the right-hand side [B. N. Khoromskij, J. Comput. Phys., 401 (2020), 108998]. In this paper, we introduce the new regularization method to the NLPBE. We apply the NLPBE only to the regular part of the solution corresponding to the modified right-hand side via extraction of the long-range part in the sum of discretized Dirac delta distributions based on the method in [B. N. Khoromskij, J. Comput. Phys., 401 (2020), 108998]. The total electrostatic potential is obtained by adding the long-range solution to the directly precomputed short-range potential, obtained by simple tensor operations without solving PDE. One of the computational benefits of the approach is the automatic preservation of the continuity in the Cauchy data on the solute-solvent interface. The boundary conditions remain verbatim as for the initial nonregularized formulation. In the numerical experiments, we demonstrate the numerical performance of the tensor-based regularization techniques for the NLPBE.},

For this tumor growth model described by the nonlinear system consisting of a Cahn–Hilliard-type equation coupled with a reaction-diffusion equation, we first prove the existence of its weak solutions. Efficient first- and second-order schemes are then constructed based on the idea of the scalar auxiliary variable, which we show are not only decoupled and easy to implement, but also have the properties of mass conservation and unconditional energy stability. Furthermore, we derive rigorous error estimates for the tumor and nutrient variables of the first-order scheme. Several numerical examples are presented to validate the accuracy and stability of the proposed schemes. It is worth noting that when the scheme is equipped with an adaptive time-stepping strategy, it efficiently simulates the typical phenomena of aggregation of multiple tumors with different shapes and tumor chemotactic growth.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This article focuses on numerical approximations of the ferrohydrodynamic (FHD) Rosensweig model of ferrofluids, which comprises the Navier–Stokes equations, the angular momentum equations, the magnetization equations, and the magnetostatic equation, as well as the simulations of the ferrofluid rotational flow problems. The model’s strong coupling feature, encompassing both linear and nonlinear aspects, poses a significant challenge in the development of efficient numerical algorithms, particularly for fully decoupled-type schemes with unconditional energy stability. A significant new challenge in the Rosensweig model, as opposed to the relatively well-studied Shliomis FHD model, is the coupling with the extra angular momentum equations, particularly seen in the linear coupling between the angular velocity of the particle spinning and the flow velocity, demanding innovative numerical strategies to effectively address this complexity. By introducing a new nonlocal auxiliary variable and constructing an ordinary differential equation with a special structure for it, we can simplify the complex coupling terms in the modified but equivalent governing system via explicit discretization. This novel method, along with the ZEC (zero energy contribution) decoupling method, reconstruction of the magnetostatic equation, the spatial finite element method, and the second-order projection method for hydrodynamics, allows us to obtain a fully discrete scheme that is unconditionally energy stable, fully decoupled, linear, and second-order accurate in time. Only a few independent linear elliptic/parabolic problems with constant coefficients need to be solved at each time step. The unconditional energy stability and well-posedness of the scheme are also established. In addition, simulations, including 2D/3D spin-up and annular flows, are implemented to verify the stability and accuracy of the scheme, with the numerical results exhibiting good agreement with experimental and physical analyses.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We present a novel framework for the development of fourth-order lattice Boltzmann schemes to tackle multidimensional nonlinear systems of conservation laws. As for other numerical schemes for hyperbolic problems, high-order accuracy applies only to smooth solutions. Our numerical schemes preserve two fundamental characteristics inherent in classical lattice Boltzmann methods: a local relaxation phase and a transport phase composed of elementary shifts on a Cartesian grid. Achieving fourth-order accuracy is accomplished through the composition of second-order time-symmetric basic schemes utilizing rational weights. This enables the representation of the transport phase in terms of elementary shifts. Introducing local variations in the relaxation parameter during each stage of relaxation ensures entropy stability of the schemes. This not only enhances stability in the long-time limit but also maintains fourth-order accuracy. To validate our approach, we conduct comprehensive testing on scalar equations and systems in both one and two spatial dimensions.},

RBGS extends the single-vector randomized Gram–Schmidt algorithm and inherits its key characteristics, such as being more efficient and at least as stable as any deterministic (block) Gram–Schmidt algorithm. Block algorithms offer superior performance, as they are based on BLAS3 matrixwise operations and reduce communication cost when executed in parallel. Notably, our low-synchronization variant of RBGS can be implemented in a parallel environment using only one global reduction operation between processors per block. Moreover, the block Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization is the key element in the block Arnoldi procedure for the construction of a Krylov basis, which in turn is used in GMRES, the full orthogonalization method, and the Rayleigh–Ritz method for the solution of linear systems and clustered eigenvalue problems. In this article, we develop randomized versions of these methods, based on RBGS, and validate them on nontrivial numerical examples. Finally, we extend the proposed methodology to Krylov -step methods.},

This paper aims first to perform robust continuous analysis of a mixed nonlinear formulation for stress-assisted diffusion of a solute that interacts with an elastic material, and second to propose and analyze a virtual element formulation of the model problem. The two-way coupling mechanisms between the Herrmann formulation for linear elasticity and the reaction-diffusion equation (written in mixed form) consist of diffusion-induced active stress and stress-dependent diffusion. The two subproblems are analyzed using the extended Babuška–Brezzi–Braess theory for perturbed saddle-point problems. The well-posedness of the nonlinearly coupled system is established using a Banach fixed-point strategy under the smallness assumption on data. The virtual element formulations for the uncoupled subproblems are proven uniquely solvable by a fixed-point argument in conjunction with appropriate projection operators. We derive the a priori error estimates, and test the accuracy and performance of the proposed method through computational simulations. Reproducibility of computational results.

The method and analysis of this work applies well beyond time series analysis, providing an algorithm for extremely accurate solutions to linear systems with a wide variety of symmetric Toeplitz matrices whose entries are generated by a piecewise smooth .

This method is easy to implement computationally and can be very effective for smooth domains and boundary conditions. The main drawback of the MFS is the ill-conditioning of the associated matrices, which may deteriorate the method’s accuracy. We present three methods to reduce the ill-conditioning of the classical MFS for the Laplace equation defined in bounded star-shaped domains in 3D. The idea is to expand the MFS basis functions in terms of spherical harmonics, in order to use the reduced QR factorization and singular value decomposition to deal with the ill-conditioning, leading to a better function basis that spans the same approximation space as the classical MFS. The numerical results illustrate that these approaches significantly decrease the ill-conditioning, allowing higher accuracy when compared to the classical MFS.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Parallel across the method time integration can provide small scale parallelism when solving initial value problems. Spectral deferred corrections (SDCs) with a diagonal sweeper, closely related to iterated Runge–Kutta methods proposed by Van der Houwen and Sommeijer, can use a number of threads equal to the number of quadrature nodes in the underlying collocation method. However, convergence speed, efficiency, and stability depend critically on the coefficients of the used SDC preconditioner. Previous approaches used numerical optimization to find good diagonal coefficients. Instead, we propose an approach that allows one to find optimal diagonal coefficients analytically. We show that the resulting parallel SDC methods provide stability domains and convergence order very similar to those of well established serial SDC variants. Using a model for computational cost that assumes 80% efficiency of an implementation of parallel SDCs, we show that our variants are competitive with serial SDC, previously published parallel SDC coefficients, Picard iteration, and a fourth-order explicit as well as a fourth-order implicit diagonally implicit Runge–Kutta method.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider the inverse problem of reconstructing an unknown function from a finite set of measurements, under the assumption that is the trajectory of a transport-dominated problem with unknown input parameters. We propose an algorithm based on the Parameterized Background Data-Weak method (PBDW), where dynamical sensor placement is combined with approximation spaces that evolve in time. We prove that the method ensures an accurate reconstruction at all times and allows us to incorporate relevant physical properties in the reconstructed solutions by suitably evolving the dynamical approximation space. As an application of this strategy we consider Hamiltonian systems modeling wave-type phenomena, where preservation of the geometric structure of the flow plays a crucial role in the accuracy and stability of the reconstructed trajectory.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We investigate a novel monolithic algebraic multigrid (AMG) preconditioner for the Taylor–Hood and Scott–Vogelius discretizations of the Stokes equations. The algorithm is based on the use of the lower-order operator within a defect-correction setting, in combination with AMG construction of interpolation operators for velocities and pressures. The preconditioning framework is primarily algebraic, though the operator must be provided. We investigate two relaxation strategies in this setting. Specifically, a novel block factorization approach is devised for Vanka patch systems, which significantly reduces storage requirements and computational overhead, and a Chebyshev adaptation of the LSC-DGS relaxation from [54] is developed to improve parallelism. The preconditioner demonstrates robust performance across a variety of two-dimensional and three-dimensional Stokes problems, often matching or exceeding the effectiveness of an inexact block triangular (or Uzawa) preconditioner, especially in challenging scenarios such as elongated-domain problems.

The purpose of these problems is to remove noise or fill in missing parts while preserving important features such as sharp edges. A discrete variant of the total variation of the unit normal vector field serves as a regularizing functional to achieve these goals. In order to solve the resulting problem, we use a version of the split Bregman (ADMM) iteration adapted to the problem. A new formulation of the total variation regularizer, as well as the use of an inexact Newton method for the shape optimization step, brings significant speed-up compared to earlier methods.

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this work, we propose and study an Implicit-Explicit (IMEX) finite volume scheme for the compressible Euler system which preserves the low Mach number limit. IMEX schemes are based on a flux splitting into a part treated explicitly and a part treated implicitly. We choose the flux splitting introduced by Toro and Vázquez-Cendón in [Comput. &amp; Fluids, 70 (2012), pp. 1–12] for ensuring the recognition of contact discontinuities and shear waves. Then, based on this flux splitting, we propose first- and second-order new linear asymptotic preserving (AP) schemes in the low Mach number limit. We prove that the schemes are asymptotically consistent, that is they degenerate into a consistent discretization of the incompressible system when the Mach number is sufficiently small. We perform a Fourier stability analysis on the linearized system around a constant state showing that the first order scheme is stable under a CFL condition independent of the Mach number. This proves the asymptotic stability in the linear case. We show one-dimensional and two-dimensional results which prove the good behavior of our scheme in all-Mach number regimes. Furthermore, following [G. Dimarco et al., J. Comput. Phys., 372 (2018), pp. 178–201], we construct a low-diffusive TVD first-order scheme by interpolating the first-order in time scheme with a second-order one.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider stopping criteria that balance algebraic and discretization errors for the conjugate gradient algorithm applied to high-order finite element discretizations of Poisson problems. First, we introduce a new stopping criterion that suggests stopping when the norm of the linear system residual is less than a small fraction of an error indicator derived directly from the residual. This indicator shares the same mesh size and polynomial degree scaling as the norm of the residual, resulting in a robust criterion regardless of the mesh size, the polynomial degree, and the shape regularity of the mesh. Second, for solving Poisson problems with highly variable piecewise constant coefficients, we introduce a subdomain-based criterion that recommends stopping when the norm of the linear system residual restricted to each subdomain is smaller than the corresponding indicator also restricted to that subdomain. Reliability and efficiency theorems for the first criterion are established. Numerical experiments, including tests with highly variable piecewise constant coefficients and a GPU-accelerated three-dimensional elliptic solver, demonstrate that the proposed criteria efficiently avoid both premature termination and oversolving.},

Moreover, algorithms to compute the velocity, pressure, and vorticity fields as a postprocess of the discrete stream function are proposed. Furthermore, we provide a comparison between our methods and other numerical schemes in terms of computational standpoint, which indicates that the stream function virtual element formulation is an attractive, efficient, and competitive alternative to solve the Navier–Stokes system.

In this paper, we intend to show that it is viable if the outgoing waves are compressed along the radial direction and the resulting oscillatory pattern is extracted explicitly. We therefore construct a perfectly matched layer-type technique for domain reduction of wave scattering problems using RCT, termed as real compressed layer (RCL). Unlike many existing approaches, the RCT transforms the slow, algebraically decaying factor of the outgoing wave into one that decays exponentially fast, and the layer is not “artificial” in the sense that the computed field in the layer can recover the outgoing wave of the original scattering problem in the unbounded domain. Here we demonstrate the essential idea and performance of the RCL for the two-dimensional Helmholtz problem with a bounded scatterer, but this technique can be extended to three dimensions in a similar setting.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Model order reduction provides low-complexity high-fidelity surrogate models that allow rapid and accurate solutions of parametric differential equations. The development of reduced order models for parametric nonlinear Hamiltonian systems is challenged by several factors: (i) the geometric structure encoding the physical properties of the dynamics; (ii) the slowly decaying Kolmogorov -width of conservative dynamics; (iii) the gradient structure of the nonlinear flow velocity; (iv) high variations in the numerical rank of the state as a function of time and parameters. We propose to address these aspects via a structure-preserving adaptive approach that combines symplectic dynamical low-rank approximation with adaptive gradient-preserving hyper-reduction and parameters sampling. Additionally, we propose varying in time the dimensions of both the reduced basis space and the hyper-reduction space by monitoring the quality of the reduced solution via an error indicator related to the projection error of the Hamiltonian vector field. The resulting adaptive hyper-reduced models preserve the geometric structure of the Hamiltonian flow, do not rely on prior information on the dynamics, and can be solved at a cost that is linear in the dimension of the full order model and linear in the number of test parameters. Numerical experiments demonstrate the improved performances of the fully adaptive models compared to the original and reduced models.},

Let us mention Radau5, which is based on the three-stage Radau IIA collocation method, and its extension to problems with discrete delays, Radar5. The aim of the present work is to present a technique that permits a direct application of these codes to problems having a right-hand side with an additional distributed delay term (which is a special case of an integro-differential equation). Models with distributed delays are of increasing importance in pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics for the study of the interaction between drugs and the body. The main idea is to approximate the distribution kernel of the integral term by a sum of exponential functions or by a quasi-polynomial expansion and then to transform the distributed (integral) delay term into a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This set is typically stiff, and, for some distribution kernels (e.g., Pareto distribution), it contains discrete delay terms with constant delay. The original equations augmented by this set of ODEs can have a very large dimension, and a careful treatment of the solution of the arising linear systems is necessary. The use of the codes Radau5 and Radar5 is illustrated with three examples (two test equations and one problem taken from pharmacodynamics). The driver programs for these examples are publicly available from the home pages of the authors.},

Our method aims at minimizing the approximation error in the frequency and parameter domain by an optimization of the reduced order model (ROM) matrices. State-of-the-art PMOR methods often compute several nonparametric ROMs for different parameter samples, which are then combined to a single parametric ROM. However, these parametric ROMs can have a low accuracy between the utilized sample points. In contrast, our optimization-based PMOR method minimizes the approximation error across the entire parameter domain. Moreover, due to our flexible approach of optimizing the system matrices directly, we can enforce favorable features, such as a port-Hamiltonian structure, in our ROMs across the entire parameter domain. Our method is an extension of the recently developed structured optimization-based model order reduction algorithm to parametric systems. We extend both the ROM parameterization and the adaptive sampling procedure to the parametric case. Several numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness and high accuracy of our method in comparison with other PMOR methods.},

In this paper, we introduce a novel class of geometric integrators for linear-gradient systems by incorporating a dimension-extended technique. By introducing a vector-valued function, the original linear-gradient system is transformed into an equivalent system in an extended space. Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates that the numerical solution of the extended system serves as a reliable approximation of the original system and can retain its essential conservative properties. In this dimension-extended framework, the newly derived methods can equivalently recover well-known numerical schemes such as quadratic auxiliary variable methods and energy quadratization methods. We provide numerical examples to illustrate the accuracy, efficiency, and long-term stability of our proposed schemes.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper studies a family of convolution quadratures, a numerical technique for efficient evaluation of convolution integrals. We employ the block generalized Adams method to discretize the underlying initial value problem, departing from the well-established approaches that rely on linear multistep formulas or Runge–Kutta methods. The convergence order of the proposed convolution quadrature can be changed without requiring grid point adjustments, enhancing flexibility. Through strategic selection of the local interpolation polynomial and block size, the method achieves high-order convergence for calculation of convolution integrals with hyperbolic kernels. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis for the proposed convolution quadrature and numerically validate our theoretical findings by calculating a range of convolution integrals.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We analyze a class of energy-stable and linearly well-balanced numerical schemes dedicated to the nonlinear shallow water equations with the Coriolis force. The proposed algorithms rely on colocated finite-difference approximations formulated on Cartesian geometries. They involve appropriate diffusion terms in the numerical fluxes, expressed as discrete versions of the linear geostrophic equilibrium. We show that the resulting methods ensure semidiscrete energy estimates. Among the proposed algorithms, a colocated finite-volume scheme is described. Numerical results show a very clear improvement around the nonlinear geostrophic equilibrium when compared to those of classic Godunov-type schemes.},
