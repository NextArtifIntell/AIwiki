  abstract     = {Regulatory T (T reg ) cells dampen the activity of conventional T (T conv ) cells to limit excessive and inappropriate tissue damage. Klawon et al . used mouse models to investigate the role of T reg cells that recognized the same prostate tissue peptide antigen as T conv cells. In immune responses accompanied by increased availability of prostate antigen, deletion of prostate-specific T reg cells increased the infiltration of the matched T conv cells into the prostate. Thus, in this context, nonmatched T reg cells could not restrain self-reactive T conv cells. Rather, the self-recognizing T reg cells proliferated earlier in response to antigen than their T conv counterparts, helping to curb their activity. —Sarah H. Ross During infections, CD4 + Foxp3 + regulatory T (T reg ) cells must control autoreactive CD4 + conventional T (T conv ) cell responses against self-peptide antigens while permitting those against pathogen-derived “nonself” peptides. We defined the basis of this selectivity using mice in which T reg cells reactive to a single prostate-specific self-peptide were selectively depleted. We found that self-peptide–specific T reg cells were dispensable for the control of T conv cells of matched specificity at homeostasis. However, they were required to control such T conv cells and prevent autoimmunity toward the prostate after exposure to elevated self-peptide during infection. Notably, the T reg cell response to self-peptide did not affect protective T conv cell responses to a pathogen-derived peptide. Thus, self-peptide–specific T reg cells promoted self-nonself discrimination during infection by selectively controlling T conv cells of shared self-specificity.},

The Chang’e-6 spacecraft landed in one of those regions, collected samples of the surface, and returned them to Earth. Che et al . analyzed basalt fragments retrieved by Chang’e-6, using radiometric dating to show that they formed 2.8 billion years ago. The composition of the basalt constrains the properties of the magma source of the volcanism. The authors found both similarities to and differences from samples taken on the near side of the Moon and discuss the implications for geochemical models. —Keith T. Smith Volcanism on the Moon has produced surface basalt deposits, which record lunar interior processes. The Chang’e-6 mission retrieved samples from the South Pole–Aitken basin (SPA) on the Moon’s far side. We analyzed basalt fragments collected by Chang’e-6 and found that their composition resembles that of low-titanium basalts previously sampled by the Apollo missions. Uranium-lead (U-Pb) dating indicated a basalt age of 2823.0 ± 5.9 million years and a source 238 U/ 204 Pb ratio (μ-value) of 480 ± 56. This high μ-value indicates that the source contained materials that formed during the late stages of lunar magma ocean (LMO) crystallization. The results are consistent with the LMO model, but the Chang’e-6 basalt deviates from the trend in Apollo mission samples of younger basalts having higher μ-values. We suggest that this indicates post-LMO modification of the mantle by the SPA impact.},

However, the mechanisms of host-mediated blockage of virulence, especially by metabolites, are not well understood. Miao et al . uncovered a phytoalexin called erucamide that is produced by several plant species and blocks T3SS function in two bacterial species. The target of erucamide is the conserved bacterial type III secretion system syringe protein HrcC. Erucamide accumulation is part of plant defense, and transgenic plants with reduced erucamide were found to be susceptible to bacterial infection. —Ankit Walia Numerous gram-negative bacterial pathogens employ the type III secretion system (T3SS), a multiprotein injectisome, to deliver virulence proteins into host cells and cause diseases. We uncover erucamide as a previously unknown phytoalexin of both dicots and monocots that blocks the T3SS function of multiple bacterial pathogens. Genetically impairing erucamide accumulation or exogenous application in Arabidopsis highlighted erucamide’s role in antibacterial immunity. Erucamide binds Hypersensitive response and conserved C (HrcC), a key T3SS component, to block injectisome assembly. Analyses of erucamide analogs and HrcC mutants indicated that the erucamide-HrcC binding is required for inhibiting T3SS in vitro and antibacterial resistance in plants, suggesting an essential role of erucamide-HrcC binding in disease resistance.

To characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of demyelination in a translationally relevant primate model of MS (an experimental autoimmune encephalitis marmoset model), Lin et al . performed longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)–guided RNA profiling. By correlating MRI-detected lesions with spatial transcriptional changes, the authors identified gene profile microenvironments around the lesions, which enabled them to propose therapeutic targets and potential treatments for MS. —Mattia Maroso Inferring cellular and molecular dynamics of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions from postmortem tissue collected decades after onset is challenging. Using magnetic resonance image (MRI)–guided spatiotemporal RNA profiling in marmoset experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE), we mapped lesion dynamics and modeled molecular perturbations relevant to MS. Five distinct lesion microenvironments emerged, involving neuroglial responses, tissue destruction and repair, and brain border regulation. Before demyelination, MRI identified a high ratio of proton density–weighted signal to T 1 relaxation time, capturing early hypercellularity, and elevated astrocytic and ependymal senescence signals marked perivascular and periventricular areas that later became demyelination hotspots. As lesions expanded, concentric glial barriers formed, initially dominated by proliferating and diversifying microglia and oligodendrocyte precursors, later replaced by monocytes and lymphocytes. We highlight SERPINE1 + astrocytes as a signaling hub underlying lesion onset in both marmoset EAE and MS.},

This finding was further supported by data from additional mouse models, rats, and samples from human patients. The authors investigated the mechanism underlying the role of ALKBH5 in metabolic regulation, identified the key signaling pathways, and demonstrated the beneficial effects of targeting expression of this protein using RNA interference in mouse models, suggesting potential for future therapeutic development. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich Maintaining glucose and lipid homeostasis is crucial for health, with dysregulation leading to metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic dysfunction–associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). This study identifies alkylation repair homolog protein 5 (ALKBH5), an RNA N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A) demethylase, as a major regulator in metabolic disease. ALKBH5 is up-regulated in the liver during obesity and also phosphorylated by protein kinase A, causing its translocation to the cytosol. Hepatocyte-specific deletion of Alkbh5 reduces glucose and lipids by inhibiting the glucagon receptor (GCGR) and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathways. Targeted knockdown of hepatic Alkbh5 reverses T2DM and MAFLD in diabetic mice, highlighting its therapeutic potential.

  abstract     = {Despite decades of research, precisely how the various parts of the solar insolation cycles affect glacial cycles is not known. Barker et al . took a new approach to answering this question by looking at the morphology of glacial inception and deglaciation. They found that those steps depend strongly on the relative phasing of precession versus obliquity, with precession having more influence on deglacial onset and obliquity being more important for reaching peak interglacial conditions and glacial inception. Thus, glacial-interglacial variability in the relevant period, called the 100,000-year world, is largely deterministic. —Jesse Smith Identifying the specific roles of precession, obliquity, and eccentricity in glacial-interglacial transitions is hindered by imprecise age control. We circumvent this problem by focusing on the morphology of deglaciation and inception, which we show depends strongly on the relative phasing of precession versus obliquity. We demonstrate that although both parameters are important, precession has more influence on deglacial onset, whereas obliquity is more important for the attainment of peak interglacial conditions and glacial inception. We find that the set of precession peaks (minima) responsible for terminations since 0.9 million years ago is a subset of those peaks that begin (i.e., the precession parameter starts decreasing) while obliquity is increasing. Specifically, termination occurs with the first of these candidate peaks to occur after each eccentricity minimum. Thus, the gross morphology of 100-thousand-year (100-kyr) glacial cycles appears largely deterministic.},

In this work, we reconstructed the phylogeny for living Mollusca on the basis of metazoan BUSCO (Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs) genes extracted from 77 (13 new) genomes, including multiple members of all eight classes with two high-quality genome assemblies for monoplacophorans.

  abstract     = {Nearly 20 years ago, a study of collective motion in locusts published in Science concluded that animals moving collectively do so in a way similar to particles. This conclusion has set the tone for much thinking about such movement in nature. Sayin et al ., including authors of the original study, combined field and laboratory studies and found that locusts, and likely also other animals moving collectively, do not follow a “self-propelled” particle model (see the Perspective by Buhl and Simpson). Rather, they found that sensory and cognitive mechanisms mediate the interactions. —Sacha Vignieri Collective motion, which is ubiquitous in nature, has traditionally been explained by “self-propelled particle” models from theoretical physics. Here we show, through field, lab, and virtual reality experimentation, that classical models of collective behavior cannot account for how collective motion emerges in marching desert locusts, whose swarms affect the livelihood of millions. In contrast to assumptions made by these models, locusts do not explicitly align with neighbors. While individuals respond to moving-dot stimuli through the optomotor response, this innate behavior does not mediate social response to neighbors. Instead, locust marching behavior, across scales, can be explained by a minimal cognitive framework, which incorporates individuals’ neural representation of bearings to neighbors and internal consensus dynamics for making directional choices. Our findings challenge long-held beliefs about how order can emerge from disorder in animal collectives.},

  abstract     = {Atmospheric aerosols affect climate by either scattering or absorbing solar radiation. Li et al . found that brown nitrogen, the nitrogenous component of organic aerosols, dominates their solar absorption globally. The authors used a model to quantify the atmospheric distribution of brown nitrogen, calculated how chemical aging affects its optical properties, and quantified its radiative impacts. These results will help to improve attribution of the climate effects of organic aerosols. —Jesse Smith Atmospheric organic aerosols (OAs) influence Earth’s climate by absorbing sunlight. However, the link between their evolving composition and their absorptive effects is unclear. We demonstrate that brown nitrogen (BrN), the absorptive nitrogenous component of OAs, dominates their global absorption. Using a global model, we quantified BrN abundance, tracked its optical evolution with chemical aging, and assessed its radiative absorption. BrN contributes 76% of OAs’ surface light absorption over the US and 61% of their global absorptive optical depth. Moreover, the observed variability of OAs’ absorptive capacity is primarily driven by the sources and aging of BrN. BrN represents 18% of the global absorptive direct radiative effect of carbonaceous aerosols, with biomass burning being the largest contributor. Our research establishes a nitrogen-centric framework for attributing the climate impacts of OAs.},

  abstract     = {Pest resistance is one of the major traits introduced into genetically modified crops. Such crops can reduce the need for chemical pesticides. However, when they are planted over entire landscapes, their effectiveness declines, and the cost-benefit ratio shifts as pests develop resistance. Ye et al . investigated how farmers’ choices about how much Bt ( Bacillus thuringiensis ) transgenic maize to plant aligned with the optimum based on field trials (see the Policy Forum by Brown and Reisig). Farmers generally planted more Bt maize than the optimum across the US corn belt, suggesting misperceptions of the costs and benefits. This was especially true in eastern states, where crop rotation is more common and corn rootworm damage was lower in field trials. —Bianca Lopez Widespread use of genetically engineered maize targeting the corn rootworm complex ( Diabrotica species) has raised concerns about insect resistance. Twelve years of university field trial and farm survey data from 10 US Corn Belt states indicate that maize hybrids expressing toxins derived from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt maize) exhibited declining protection from rootworm feeding with increased planting while pest pressures simultaneously decreased. The analysis revealed a tendency to overplant Bt maize, leading to substantial economic losses; this was particularly striking in eastern Corn Belt states. Our findings highlight the need to go beyond the “tragedy of the commons” perspective to protect sustainable use of Bt and other crop biotechnology resources. We propose moving toward a more diversified and transparent seed supply.},

Wan et al . found that superlattice formation from these rare earth fluoride colloids results from globally interlocking self-assembly driven by curvature-guided depletion interactions that are difficult to achieve with conventional convex particles (see the Perspective by Korgel). This method could also stabilize structures with periodic vacancies, such as the chiral Kagome lattice. —Phil Szuromi Shape-anisotropic nanocrystals and patchy particles have been explored to construct complex superstructures, but most studies have focused on convex shapes. We report that nonconvex, dumbbell-shaped nanocrystals (nanodumbbells) exhibit globally interlocking self-assembly behaviors governed by curvature-guided depletion interactions. By tailoring the local curvature of nanodumbbells, we can precisely and flexibly adjust particle bonding directionality, a level of control rarely achievable with conventional convex building blocks. These nanodumbbells can undergo long-range ordered assembly into various intricate two-dimensional superlattices, including the chiral Kagome lattice. Theoretical calculations reveal that the Kagome lattice is a thermodynamically stable phase, with depletion interactions playing a crucial role in stabilizing these non–close-packed structures. The emergence of Kagome lattices and other unusual structures highlights the vast potential of nonconvex nanocrystals for creating sophisticated architectures.},

  abstract     = {Elucidating the structure of ferrocene, an iron ion sandwiched between two carbon rings, was foundational to the theory and practice of organometallic chemistry. In the ensuing decades, numerous analogous metal sandwich compounds have been prepared and applied. Russo et al . now extend the motif to berkelium, a radioactive element heavier than uranium. Their experiments required rapid synthesis and characterization on a submilligram scale to compensate for the ongoing decay. Spectroscopic and theoretical analysis supported covalent interactions between the cyclic ligands and f orbitals of the metal. —Jake S. Yeston Interest in actinide–carbon bonds has persisted since actinide organometallics were first investigated for applications in isotope separation during the Manhattan Project. Transplutonium organometallics are rarely isolated and structurally characterized, likely owing to limited isotope inventories, a scarcity of suitable laboratory infrastructure, and intrinsic difficulties with the anaerobic conditions required. Herein, we report the discovery of an organometallic “berkelocene” complex prepared from 0.3 milligrams of berkelium-249. Single-crystal x-ray diffraction shows a tetravalent berkelium ion between two substituted cyclooctatetraene ligands, resulting in the formation of berkelium–carbon bonds. The coordination in berkelocene resembles that of uranocene, and calculations show that the berkelium 5f orbitals engage in covalent overlap with the δ-symmetry orbitals of the cyclooctatetraenide ligand π system. Charge transfer from the ligands is diminished relative to uranocene and other actinocenes, which maximizes contributions from the stable, half-filled 5f 7 configuration of tetravalent berkelium.},

  abstract     = {The properties of a hydrogel are highly dependent on maintaining their large water content. This can limit their use to temperatures between 0° and 100°C or may require the use of hygroscopic additives or replacing the water with ionic liquids. Zhang et al . explored a different approach that involves binding water molecules to the polymer network (see the Perspective by Yu and Lin). The authors started with a double network structure based on polyacrylate and alginate, which they then treated with concentrated sulfuric acid and heated to convert the alginate to carbon nanoparticles. The incorporated sulfate groups acted as strong binding sites for water, and the carbon nanoparticles provided electrical and mechanical sensitivity to the gels, which enabled their use over a temperature range from −115° to 143°C. —Marc S Lavine Hydrogels consist of cross-linked polymers that are highly swollen with water. Water evaporation or freezing during temperature changes may lead to stiff and brittle hydrogels. We introduce a strategy called “hydro-locking,” which involves immobilizing the water molecules within the polymer network of the hydrogel. This is accomplished by establishing robust connections between water molecules and the polymer by using sulfuric acid. A sacrificial network is introduced to shield the prime polymer network from collapsing. Under the hydro-locking mode, an alginate-polyacrylamide double-network hydrogel remains soft and stretchable within a temperature range that spans from –115° to 143°C. The strategy works with a range of hydrogels and solutions and may enable the preservation and observation of materials or even living organisms at extreme temperatures.},

Quantum mechanics dictates that an analogous type of behavior pertains to molecules, not just to light, but molecular interference tends to be harder to discern. Reilly et al . observed that when methane molecules scatter off a gold surface, an interference effect clearly manifests: Certain final rotational states are entirely suppressed depending on their reflection symmetry relationship to the incoming states. —Jake S. Yeston Although the dynamics of collisions between a molecule and a solid surface are ultimately quantum mechanical, decohering effects owing to the large number of interacting degrees of freedom typically obscure the wavelike nature of these events. However, a partial decoupling of internal molecular motion from external degrees of freedom can reveal striking interference effects despite significant momentum exchange between the molecule and the bath of surface vibrations. We report state-prepared and state-resolved measurements of methane scattering from a room-temperature gold surface that demonstrate total destructive interference between molecular states related by a reflection symmetry operation. High-contrast interference effects prevail for all processes investigated, including vibrationally excited and vibrationally inelastic collisions. The results demonstrate the distinctly quantum mechanical effect of discrete symmetries in molecular collision dynamics.},

McCombe et al . examined the NUDIX family of proteins, which are found in diverse pathogens and target multiple plant species (see the Perspective by Gutjahr). They found that fungal pathogens can use NUDIX proteins to trick plants by disrupting their ability to sense their own inorganic phosphate status. NUDIX proteins hydrolyze inositol pyrophosphate, which is the main phosphate compound monitored by plant cells. If the plant focuses on growth and nutrition, then it may be less able to activate immune responses. —Madeleine Seale Inorganic phosphate (Pi) is essential for life, and plant cells monitor Pi availability by sensing inositol pyrophosphate (PP-InsP) levels. In this work, we describe the hijacking of plant phosphate sensing by a conserved family of Nudix hydrolase effectors from pathogenic Magnaporthe and Colletotrichum fungi. Structural and enzymatic analyses of the Nudix effector family demonstrate that they selectively hydrolyze PP-InsP. Gene deletion experiments of Nudix effectors in Magnaporthe oryzae , Colletotrichum higginsianum , and Colletotrichum graminicola indicate that PP-InsP hydrolysis substantially enhances disease symptoms in diverse pathosystems. Further, we show that this conserved effector family induces phosphate starvation signaling in plants.

However, the capability of electron microscopy to image structures with high spatial resolution and millisecond temporal resolution is often limited by poor signal-to-noise ratios. With an unsupervised deep denoising framework, we observed metal nanoparticle surfaces (platinum nanoparticles on cerium oxide) in a gas environment with time resolutions down to 10 milliseconds at a moderate electron dose. On this timescale, many nanoparticle surfaces continuously transition between ordered and disordered configurations. Stress fields can penetrate below the surface, leading to defect formation and destabilization, thus making the nanoparticle fluxional. Combining this unsupervised denoiser with in situ electron microscopy greatly improves spatiotemporal characterization, opening a new window for the exploration of atomic-level structural dynamics in materials.},

  abstract     = {Greater use of a pesticide usually has two dynamic and countervailing effects on pest populations: (i) To the extent that susceptibility remains in the population, it reduces that population’s growth (population suppression) or crop damage, and (ii) it selects for resistant genotypes, which can increase future crop damage (resistance selection). Because these effects occur simultaneously, it is challenging to disentangle them in field settings. Economists studying pesticide resistance have theorized that two potential market failures inherent to the problem can work in opposing directions; it is an empirical matter whether farms are over- or underusing a pesticide in any given context, compared to what would be optimal for their collective profits. On page 943 of this issue, Ye et al. ( 1 ) describe the use of transgenic Bacillus thuringus (Bt) corn to provide an important example of how to empirically assess the balance of these market failures in an applied, policy-relevant setting.},

In contrast to polymers that transform between different states when heated or cooled, a hydrogel generally does not undergo polymeric phase transition because of its hydration. However, a change in temperature can evaporate or freeze mobile water molecules within the polymer networks, which modifies the hydrogel’s mechanical properties ( 1 ). This compromises elasticity of a hydrogel and makes it easily breakable. On page 967 of this issue, Zhang et al.

Although plants have evolved innate immune responses against pathogens, 10 to 23% of global crop yield is lost every year to fungal pathogens alone ( 1 ). Plantinteracting microorganisms, including pathogenic fungi, translocate effector proteins into plant cells. These effectors enhance pathogen virulence by directly interfering with the plant immune system or by manipulating other cellular functions. On page 955 of this issue, McCombe et al . ( 2 ) report that the pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae (which causes devastating rice blast) and two additional plant disease–causing fungi enhance their pathogenicity by manipulating the plant’s monitoring of phosphate, a phosphorus-containing compound essential for plant growth. The mechanism tricks plants into entering a phosphate starvation response, which alters metabolism but also disrupts immune signaling and responses to infection. These findings represent a mechanism by which fungal pathogens can manipulate plant defense indirectly.},

However, the IPCC’s reported targets are based on the assumption that global net-zero emissions are achieved. Therefore, these CDR targets are reflective of the net-negative CDR required and do not account for the additional CDR that may be needed if it is also used to offset hard-to-abate emissions. To improve transparency, the authors have made the following revisions: (i) They have revised both Fig. 3 and Table 2 to add the total CDR values, alongside the existing net-negative CDR values that they have reported. (ii) They have added a description in the section “Contribution to CDR targets in mitigation scenarios” to clarify the distinction between net-negative CDR targets and total CDR targets.

  abstract     = {Can the capacity to evolve be selected by natural selection for greater ability to evolve? Barnett et al . designed experiments in which lineages of bacteria cycled between two selective environments (see the Perspective by Kussell). In response to changing conditions, a multistep evolutionary dynamic emerged in which selection first acts to elevate transcription rates at a single regulatory gene. An increase in frameshift mutations occurs at the same locus that also allows hitchhiking of secondary, possibly adaptive mutations. This phenomenon provides an evolutionary mechanism for increasing the capacity for evolvability toward specific adaptive outcomes. —Caroline Ash Evolvability—the capacity to generate adaptive variation—is a trait that can itself evolve through natural selection. However, the idea that mutation can become biased toward adaptive outcomes remains controversial. In this work, we report the evolution of enhanced evolvability through localized hypermutation in experimental populations of bacteria. The evolved mechanism is analogous to the mutation-prone sequences of contingency loci observed in pathogenic bacteria. Central to this outcome was a lineage-level selection process, where success depended on the capacity to evolve between two phenotypic states. Subsequent evolution showed that the hypermutable locus is itself evolvable with respect to alterations in the frequency of environmental change. Lineages with localized hypermutability were more likely to acquire additional adaptive mutations, revealing an unanticipated benefit.},

In this study, we demonstrated that mice exhibit rescue-like social behaviors toward unresponsive conspecifics, characterized by intense physical contact and grooming directed at the recipient’s facial and mouth areas, which expedite their recovery from unresponsiveness. We identified the medial amygdala (MeA) as a key region that encodes the unresponsive state of others and drives this head-directed physical contact. Notably, the behavioral responses toward unresponsive conspecifics differed from those directed at awake, stressed individuals, and these responses were differentially represented in the MeA.

We report that mice exhibit stereotypic behaviors toward unconscious or dead social partners, which escalate from sniffing and grooming to more forceful actions such as mouth or tongue biting and tongue pulling. The latter intense actions, more prominent in familiar pairs, begin after prolonged immobility and unresponsiveness and cease when the partner regains activity. Their consequences, including improved airway opening and clearance and accelerated recovery from unconsciousness, suggest rescue-like efforts. Oxytocin neurons in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus respond differentially to the presence of unconscious versus active partners, and their activation, along with oxytocin signaling, is required for the reviving-like actions.

During training, six representations of sequence features of BCRs and TCRs were compared between healthy and ill individuals to learn commonalities, and these features were combined in a single model to predict disease status. This approach was able to distinguish controls, individuals with distinct autoimmune diseases or viral infections, and those who had received an influenza vaccine. —Sarah H.

Wu et al . investigated the mechanisms mediating the uptake of α-synuclein in neurons using in vitro and in vivo models. The product of the recently identified PD-risk gene FAM171A2 was found to be the neuronal receptor for α-synuclein fibrils, mediating their internalization through endocytosis. In silico screening identified an approved drug, bemcentinib, that is able to inhibit α-synuclein internalization in vitro and in vivo by blocking its binding to FAM171A2. The results provide insights into PD pathogenesis and identify a potential therapeutic target. —Mattia Maroso Neuronal accumulation and spread of pathological α-synuclein (α-syn) fibrils are key events in Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD) pathophysiology. However, the neuronal mechanisms underlying the uptake of α-syn fibrils remain unclear. In this work, we identified FAM171A2 as a PD risk gene that affects α-syn aggregation. Overexpressing FAM171A2 promotes α-syn fibril endocytosis and exacerbates the spread and neurotoxicity of α-syn pathology. Neuronal-specific knockdown of FAM171A2 expression shows protective effects. Mechanistically, the FAM171A2 extracellular domain 1 interacts with the α-syn C terminus through electrostatic forces, with &gt;1000 times more selective for fibrils. Furthermore, we identified bemcentinib as an effective blocker of FAM171A2–α-syn fibril interaction with an in vitro binding assay, in cellular models, and in mice. Our findings identified FAM171A2 as a potential receptor for the neuronal uptake of α-syn fibrils and, thus, as a therapeutic target against PD.},

  abstract     = {Most chemical reactions that manipulate carbon centers change just one or two bonds at a time. Recently, a reagent with carbon sandwiched between phosphorus and nitrogen proved adept at releasing the carbon atom alone to form four new bonds. However, these reactions tended to produce linear, triple-bonded molecules as products. Sun et al . now report that upon swapping out the phosphorus for sulfur, the carbon transfer reactivity shifted to deliver three-dimensional products with four single bonds. Reactions with successive olefins produced a range of strained spiro compounds that are otherwise challenging to access. —Jake S. Yeston The introduction of a single C-atom into organic substrates typically results in the formation of flat molecules containing unsaturated C(sp)-centers. Adding a single C(sp 3 )-atom surrounded by four σ-C–C bonds, which opens up the three-dimensional space, is an unresolved problem in synthetic chemistry. We report the synthesis and application of the diazosulfur ylide Ph 2 S=C=N 2 reagent that combines the reactivity of both sulfur ylides and diazo compounds to create carbon spiro-centers in a general fashion by the sequential or single-step installation of a C(sp 3 )-atom. New C–C and C–X (where X is O or N) bonds can be created around the C(sp 3 )-atom, which can ultimately be extended to four C–C σ-bonds in one step without resorting to transition metal catalysis. Ph 2 SCN 2 can also be used to access highly strained frameworks containing (oxa)spiro[2.2]pentanes as well as tricyclic spiro-compounds.},

  abstract     = {One vision for robotics is to design groups of simple robots that work together, for example, like a colony of ants that can move like a flowing fluid but can also form a solid structure such as a bridge for an unpassable span. Devlin et al . designed a robot collective that can switch between a “fluidizing” state and a solid state based on the rotational state of the robot. Drawing from embryonic morphogenesis, the authors identified three important components of the biological process, interunit force, polarization, and adhesion, and developed their robotic counterparts. These elements enable locally tunable mechanical properties that can be exploited to change the collective’s shape and strength. —Marc S. Lavine The vision of robotic materials—cohesive collectives of robotic units that can arrange into virtually any form with any physical properties—has long intrigued both science and fiction. Yet, this vision requires a fundamental physical challenge to be overcome: The collective must be strong, to support loads, yet flow, to take new forms. We achieve this in a material-like robotic collective by modulating the interunit tangential forces to control topological rearrangements of units within a tightly packed structure. This allows local control of rigidity transitions between solid and fluid-like states in the collective and enables spatiotemporal control of shape and strength. We demonstrate structure-forming and healing and show the collective supporting 700 newtons (500 times the weight of a robot) before “melting” under its own weight.},

  abstract     = {Most current plastic-recycling methods rely on macroscopic mechanical shredding, cleaning, and reprocessing. As a result, the properties of the recycled material degrade relative to the virgin polymer. Chemical decomposition to the original monomer would enable more thorough purification and then repolymerization to restore ideal performance. Wang et al . report the surprising discovery that in dichlorobenzene solvent, violet light irradiation can cleanly break down polymethacrylates such as plexiglass to their original monomers. The process appears to involve hydrogen abstraction from the backbone by small quantities of chlorine radicals liberated from the solvent. —Jake S. Yeston The reversion of vinyl polymers with carbon-carbon backbones to their monomers represents an ideal path to alleviate the growing plastic waste stream. However, depolymerizing such stable materials remains a challenge, with state-of-the-art methods relying on “designer” polymers that are neither commercially produced nor suitable for real-world applications. In this work, we report a main chain–initiated, visible light–triggered depolymerization directly applicable to commercial polymers containing undisclosed impurities (e.g., comonomers, additives, or dyes). By in situ generation of chlorine radicals directly from the solvent, near-quantitative (&gt;98%) depolymerization of polymethacrylates could be achieved regardless of their synthetic route (e.g., radical or ionic polymerization), end group, and molecular weight (up to 1.6 million daltons). The possibility to perform multigram-scale depolymerizations and confer temporal control renders this methodology a versatile and general route to recycling.},

  abstract     = {Traces of nickel can increase the selectivity of supported silver ethylene epoxidation catalysts to levels comparable to that of added alkyl chloride promoters. Theoretical studies by Jalil et al . showed that nickel dopants on silver could activate molecular oxygen, and surface science experiments showed that nickel could stabilize nucleophilic oxygen that would otherwise react unselectively. Parts per million addition of nickel enhanced selectivity by 25%, and added chlorine could also boost the effect of nickel by an additional 10%. —Phil Szuromi Over the last 80 years, chlorine (Cl) has been the primary promoter of the ethylene epoxidation reaction valued at ~40 billion USD per year, providing a ~25% selectivity increase over unpromoted silver (Ag) (~55%). Promoters such as cesium, rhenium, and molybdenum each add a few percent of selectivity enhancements to achieve 90% overall, but their codependence on Cl makes optimizing and understanding their function complex. We took a theory-guided, single-atom alloy approach to identify nickel (Ni) as a dopant in Ag that can facilitate selective oxidation by activating molecular oxygen (O 2 ) without binding oxygen (O) too strongly. Surface science experiments confirmed the facile adsorption/desorption of O 2 on NiAg, as well as demonstrating that Ni serves to stabilize unselective nucleophilic oxygen. Supported Ag catalyst studies revealed that the addition of Ni in a 1:200 Ni to Ag atomic ratio provides a ~25% selectivity increase without the need for Cl co-flow and acts cooperatively with Cl, resulting in a further 10% initial increase in selectivity.},

  abstract     = {Laser-based additive manufacturing of metals is a complex process that often leads to the introduction of voids through what are called keyhole instabilities. Fan et al . sought to understand how this pore-forming process is modified with magnetic fields using high-speed x-ray imaging. They found that a flow driven by the thermoelectric effect can either improve or degrade keyhole formation depending on the direction of the field. These observations reveal one way to modulate the formation of pores, which is important for controlling the mechanical properties of the alloy. —Marc S. Lavine Keyhole instability during laser welding and laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) can cause keyhole collapse and pore formation. Using high-speed x-ray imaging, we demonstrate that the flow vortex–induced protrusion on the rear keyhole wall is crucial in initiating keyhole instability. Applying a transverse magnetic field suppresses the keyhole instability by driving a secondary thermoelectric magnetohydrodynamics (TEMHD) flow that alters the net flow vortex. This minimizes protrusions and large-amplitude keyhole oscillations. The suppression effectiveness depends on the laser scanning direction relative to the magnetic field orientation because this controls the Seebeck effect–induced Lorentz force’s direction. We show that at LPBF length scales, electromagnetic damping is weak, and for alloys with a large Seebeck coefficient, TEMHD becomes the dominant mechanism controlling flow behind the keyhole.},

Using measurements made with fiber-optic cables, Fichtner et al . report observations of brittle deformation in the Greenland Ice Sheet that reveal a nonviscous flow mechanism caused by englacial ice quake cascades. This effect should help to reconcile results from current ice sheet models and observations. —Jesse Smith Ice streams are major regulators of sea level change. However, standard viscous flow simulations of their evolution have limited predictive power owing to incomplete understanding of involved processes. On the Greenland ice sheet, borehole fiber-optic observations revealed a brittle deformation mode that is incompatible with viscous flow, over length scales similar to the resolution of modern ice sheet models: englacial ice quake cascades that are unobservable at the surface. Nucleating near volcanism-related impurities that promote grain boundary cracking, the ice quake cascades appear as a macroscopic form of crystal-scale wild plasticity. A conservative estimate indicates that seismic cascades are likely to produce strain rates that are comparable in amplitude with those measured geodetically, providing a plausible missing link between current ice sheet models and observations.},

Xu et al . developed bismuth antimony telluride and silver selenide inks for extrusion printing that avoid degradation in properties after sintering (see the Perspective by Perren and Yarema). Careful choices for the binders in the inks resulted in a printed thermoelectric device capable of generating a 50°C gradient with a good coefficient of performance. —Brent Grocholski Thermoelectric coolers (TECs) are pivotal in modern heat management but face limitations in efficiency and manufacturing scalability. We address these challenges by using an extrusion-based 3D printing technique to fabricate high-performance thermoelectric materials. Our ink formulations ensure the integrity of the 3D-printed structure and effective particle bonding during sintering, achieving record-high figure of merit ( zT ) values of 1.42 for p-type bismuth antimony telluride [(Bi,Sb) 2 Te 3 ] and 1.3 for n-type silver selenide (Ag 2 Se) materials at room temperature. The resulting TEC demonstrates a cooling temperature gradient of 50°C in air. Moreover, this scalable and cost-effective method circumvents energy-intensive and time-consuming steps, such as ingot preparation and subsequently machining processes, offering a transformative solution for thermoelectric device production and heralding a new era of efficient and sustainable thermoelectric technologies.},

  abstract     = {Over the past four decades, high-performance computing (HPC) has enabled considerable advances in scientific discovery and engineering, spurring technological development across the globe. However, with the demand for precision and fidelity of computational models continuing to grow, HPC faces bottlenecks in data handling, algorithm efficiency, and the scalability of new architectures, especially in fields such as chemistry and biology, where molecular simulations increasingly strain hardware and software limits. Governments worldwide are heavily investing in HPC infrastructure to support research, industrial innovation, and national security, each adopting distinct approaches shaped by national interests and regulatory landscapes. Conversely, in the US, there is no long-term plan or comprehensive vision for the next era of HPC advancements, leaving the future trajectory of US HPC and scientific and technological leadership uncertain.},

  abstract     = {People who witness someone collapse and who subsequently perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) report that they intervene because they intuitively understand that the person would otherwise die ( 1 ). Humans are not alone in this instinct. Animals as diverse as elephants [ Loxodonta africana and Loxodonta cyclotis ( 2 )], chimpanzees [ Pan troglodytes ( 3 )], and dolphins [ Tursiops truncatus ( 4 )] can recognize and intervene by touching, nudging, and even carrying an incapacitated individual. On pages 843 and 842 of this issue, Sun et al. ( 5 ) and Sun et al. ( 6 ), respectively, provide information on the neurobiology underlying this impulse. They report that mice ( Mus musculus ) have an instinct to revive an unresponsive mouse and identify two distinct brain regions that are crucial for this behavior. These findings add to the evidence that an impulse to help others in states of extreme distress is shared by many species and highlight neural mechanisms that drive instinctive rescue.},

For energy technologies such as thermoelectric cooling, however, 3D printing is notably less integrated because of the intricate specifications required of functional semiconductors. Characteristics of a material, such as charge carrier mobility, level of impurities (dopants), and microstructural defects, as well as surface and interfacial properties, must be precisely engineered to achieve desired performance. 3D printed semiconductor devices often demonstrate lesser performance compared to their thin-film counterparts because of imperfections in the functional layer that are introduced during printing ( 2 , 3 ). On page 845 of this issue, Xu et al. ( 4 ) report additive manufacturing of a thermoelectric cooler with a cooling efficiency surpassing that of existing devices. This demonstrates potential use of 3D printing for large-scale production of semiconductor devices.},

  abstract     = {Evolvability, or the capacity to generate adaptive phenotypic variation, can itself evolve in response to selection ( 1 ). Species that evolve too slowly may be unable to adapt to environmental change and are more likely to go extinct than faster-evolving species. Yet what it takes to get evolvability to evolve, in nature or in the lab, has remained puzzling. For example, many generations might be needed for natural selection to change a species’ ability to adapt. Higher evolvability can result in lower heritability, a cornerstone of natural selection’s ability to act, and the same degree of evolvability might not suit all traits equally. On page 840 of this issue, Barnett et al. ( 2 ) describe how experimental evolution can yield increased evolvability by localized hypermutation in populations of bacteria exposed to an alternating selection regime, akin to the regularly fluctuating conditions that pathogenic bacteria experience moving from one host to another.},

Whereas excitatory neuron types in amniote hippocampal regions show evolutionary conservation, those in other pallial regions have diverged. Neurons in the avian mesopallium display gene expression profiles akin to the mammalian claustrum and deep cortical layers, while certain nidopallial cell types resemble neurons in the piriform cortex. Lastly, we observed substantial gene expression convergence between the dorsally located hyperpallium and ventrally located nidopallium during late development, suggesting that topological location does not always dictate gene expression programs determining functional properties in the adult avian pallium.},

Conformational ensembles built from 1231 structures of 17 serine proteases revealed atomic-level changes across their reaction states. By comparing the enzymatic and solution reaction, we identified molecular features that provide catalysis and quantified their energetic contributions to catalysis. Serine proteases precisely position their reactants in destabilized conformers, creating a downhill energetic gradient that selectively favors the motions required for reaction while limiting off-pathway conformational states. The same catalytic features have repeatedly evolved in proteases and additional enzymes across multiple distinct structural folds.

Fagerberg et al . combined CRISPR/Cas9-gene editing with single-cell RNA sequencing to examine how the deletion of genes in mouse T cells affected the formation of these different states during immune responses. The transcription factor KLF2 was required to maintain the availability of cells with the potential to form functional effectors and suppressed cells from acquiring an exhausted phenotype after infection with acute lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. In the context of tumors, KLF2 expression was linked to maintaining stem-like T cells and limiting terminal dysfunction. — Sarah H. Ross Naïve CD8 T cells have the potential to differentiate into a spectrum of functional states during an immune response. How these developmental decisions are made and what mechanisms exist to suppress differentiation toward alternative fates remains unclear. We employed in vivo CRISPR-Cas9–based perturbation sequencing to assess the role of ~40 transcription factors (TFs) and epigenetic modulators in T cell fate decisions. Unexpectedly, we found that knockout of the TF Klf2 resulted in aberrant differentiation to exhausted-like CD8 T cells during acute infection. KLF2 was required to suppress the exhaustion-promoting TF TOX and to enable the TF TBET to drive effector differentiation. KLF2 was also necessary to maintain a polyfunctional tumor-specific progenitor state. Thus, KLF2 provides effector CD8 T cell lineage fidelity and suppresses the exhaustion program.},

  abstract     = {The efficiency of the oxygen evolution reaction, the anodic process in commercial electrochemical hydrogen production, is often constrained by the durability of catalysts, especially under acidic conditions. By controlling the nucleation of iridium nanocatalysts on a continuously ripening cerium oxide support through sonication and thermal treatment, Shi et al . effectively embedded the nanocatalysts within the oxide matrix. This approach prevents nanocatalysts from detaching and agglomerating during operation, yielding exceptional efficiency and ultrastable performance (see the Perspective by Pendergast and Boettcher). Moreover, the strategy is adaptable to other compound systems, opening avenues for the development of additional high-performance catalysts. —Jack Huang The future deployment of terawatt-scale proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) technology necessitates development of an efficient oxygen evolution catalyst with low cost and long lifetime. Currently, the stability of the most active iridium (Ir) catalysts is impaired by dissolution, redeposition, detachment, and agglomeration of Ir species. Here we present a ripening-induced embedding strategy that securely embeds the Ir catalyst in a cerium oxide support. Cryogenic electron tomography and all-atom kinetic Monte Carlo simulations reveal that synchronizing the growth rate of the support with the nucleation rate of Ir, regulated by sonication, is pivotal for successful synthesis. A PEMWE using this catalyst achieves a cell voltage of 1.72 volts at a current density of 3 amperes per square centimeter with an Ir loading of just 0.3 milligrams per square centimeter and a voltage degradation rate of 1.33 microvolts per hour, as demonstrated by a 6000-hour accelerated aging test.},

  abstract     = {Plasmonics offers a route to shrink light wavelengths down to the nanoscale using collective electronic excitations. Intuitively, highly conducting metals are the materials of choice, providing for long plasmon lifetime. Ruta et al . looked at the so-called “bad metal” molybdenum oxide dichloride, in which electronic correlations give rise to high resistivity. Surprisingly, they observed plasmons with very long lifetimes. The unexpected finding of long-lifetime plasmons may provide a route to expanding the choice of materials for nanophotonic applications. —Ian S. Osborne Correlated metals may exhibit unusually high resistivity that increases linearly in temperature, breaking through the Mott-Ioffe-Regel bound, above which coherent quasiparticles are destroyed. The fate of collective charge excitations, or plasmons, in these systems is a subject of debate. Several studies have suggested that plasmons are overdamped, whereas other studies have detected propagating plasmons. In this work, we present direct nano-optical images of low-loss hyperbolic plasmon polaritons (HPPs) in the correlated van der Waals metal MoOCl 2 . HPPs are plasmon-photon modes that waveguide through extremely anisotropic media and are remarkably long-lived in MoOCl 2 . Photoemission data presented here reveal a highly anisotropic Fermi surface, reconstructed and made partly incoherent, likely through electronic interactions as explained by many-body theory. HPPs remain long-lived despite this, revealing previously unseen imprints of many-body effects on plasmonic collective modes.},

Prancevic et al . used a semimechanistic model combined with stream gauge measurements and topographical data to estimate the variability of stream network length across the entire contiguous United States. This approach allowed them to conclude that the median US stream network is six times longer during annual high-flow conditions than during annual low-flow conditions. —Jesse Smith The aggregate length of flowing streams in a drainage network lengthens and shortens as landscapes become wetter and drier. However, direct measurements of stream network variability have been limited to a handful of small drainage basins. We estimated the variability of stream network length for 14,765 gauged basins across the contiguous United States using measured streamflow distributions and topography-based estimates of how sensitive each stream network is to changing landscape wetness (the network’s elasticity). We find that the median US stream network is five times longer during annual high-flow conditions than during annual low-flow conditions. Stream networks are more dynamic in some regions than in others, driven by regional differences in both hydroclimatology and the networks’ elasticity in response to hydroclimatic forcing.},

  abstract     = {A key challenge in the field of membrane technology for separating water from ions is the formation of uniform nanopores over large areas on robust two-dimensional materials. Shen et al . prepared molybdenum disulfide membranes by aligning seeds along the 60-degree grain boundaries (also known as mirror twin boundaries) during the chemical vapor deposition process to form eight-membered ring pores. The physical size of the intrinsic eight-membered rings allows only water molecules to pass through while blocking a wide range of hydrated ions due to their larger size. The performance can be tuned by controlling the density of the eight-membered rings. Optimized membranes demonstrate both ultrahigh water-to-sodium chloride selectivity and exceptional water permeance. —Marc S. Lavine Two-dimensional (2D) materials have long been considered as ideal platforms for developing separation membranes. However, it is difficult to generate uniform subnanometer pores over large areas on 2D materials. We report that the well-defined eight-membered ring (8-MR) pores, typically formed at the boundaries of two antiparallel grains of monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ), can serve as molecular sieves for efficient water-ion separation. The density of grain boundaries and, consequently, the number of 8-MR pores can be tuned by regulating the grain size. Optimized MoS 2 membranes outperformed the state-of-the-art membranes in forward osmosis tests by demonstrating both ultrahigh water/sodium chloride selectivity and exceptional water permeance. Creating precise pore structures on atomically thin films through grain boundary engineering presents a promising route for producing membranes suitable for various applications.},

Using foraging patterns and success linked to ocean conditions, the authors were able to successfully hindcast twilight zone fish abundance. Such hindcasting success facilitated future predictions. Elephant seals can thus provide insight into how this hidden but essential system responds to external changes. —Sacha Vignieri The open ocean twilight zone holds most of the global fish biomass but is poorly understood owing to difficulties of measuring subsurface ecosystem processes at scale. We demonstrate that a wide-ranging carnivore—the northern elephant seal—can serve as an ecosystem sentinel for the twilight zone. We link ocean basin–scale foraging success with oceanographic indices to estimate twilight zone fish abundance five decades into the past, and into the future. We discovered that a small variation in maternal foraging success amplified into larger changes in offspring body mass and enormous variation in first-year survival and recruitment. Worsening oceanographic conditions could shift predator population trajectories from current growth to sharp declines.

The amount of water going to groundwater reservoirs is far less clear, in part because this volume is difficult to measure. Mao et al . showed that seismic ambient field interferometry could be used in the greater Los Angeles area to track groundwater (see the Perspective by Taira and Bürgmann). The authors found that only about 25% of the groundwater lost since 2006 was replenished by a very wet 2023. These observations highlight the need for more continuous monitoring and provide a different way to estimate groundwater resources. —Brent Grocholski In early 2023, a series of intense atmospheric-river storms eased California’s historic drought, yet the spatiotemporal extent of groundwater recovery remains poorly understood. We tracked two-decadal changes in groundwater in Greater Los Angeles using seismic ambient-field interferometry. The derived seismic hydrographs reveal distinct expressions of groundwater and surficial water droughts: Whereas surface and near-surface water storage nearly fully recovered in the epic wet season of 2023, only about 25% of the groundwater lost since 2006 was restored. On a decadal scale, we find substantial depletion in aquifers below 50-meter depth, with only limited storm-related recovery.

  abstract     = {Although overall food intake is attenuated when we feel sated or full, this state is associated with an increased desire to eat sweet foods such as desserts. It is unclear why sugar appetite is selectively stimulated in satiety states. Minère et al . found that pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons from the arcuate nucleus send projections to the paraventricular thalamus. Unlike most other POMC neuron projections, these do not release α-melanocyte–stimulating hormone. Rather, they produce the appetite-stimulating opioid β⁠-endorphin, which selectively inhibits postsynaptic neurons in the paraventricular thalamus expressing µ-opioid receptors, and this drives sugar consumption in the fed state (see the Perspective by Farooqi). Blocking this opioid transmission could thus reduce sugar intake and potentially combat binge eating and obesity. —Peter Stern High sugar–containing foods are readily consumed, even after meals and beyond fullness sensation (e.g., as desserts). Although reward-driven processing of palatable foods can promote overeating, the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie the selective appetite for sugar in states of satiety remain unclear. Hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons are principal regulators of satiety because they decrease food intake through excitatory melanocortin neuropeptides. We discovered that POMC neurons not only promote satiety in fed conditions but concomitantly switch on sugar appetite, which drives overconsumption. POMC neuron projections to the paraventricular thalamus selectively inhibited postsynaptic neurons through mu-opioid receptor signaling. This opioid circuit was strongly activated during sugar consumption, which was most notable in satiety states. Correspondingly, inhibiting its activity diminished high-sugar diet intake in sated mice.},

Lattice oxygen removed by combustion could be regenerated over many cycles by reaction with molecular oxygen. This alternative purification route to semihydrogenation of acetylene does not require elevated pressures and is tolerant to carbon dioxide and water impurities. —Phil Szuromi The requirement for C 2 H 2 concentrations below 2 parts per million (ppm) in gas streams for C 2 H 4 polymerization necessitates its semihydrogenation to C 2 H 4 .

To understand how increased transcription might contribute to cancer progression, Henikoff et al . investigated RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) activity across different tumor types. Mapping RNAPII activity across the whole genome in tumor and normal tissues, the authors found widespread transcriptional changes. They also discovered that RNAPII occupancy at histone genes correlated with tumor aggressiveness, particularly in meningiomas and breast cancers. Elevated RNAPII at histone genes predicted rapid cancer recurrence and corresponded to chromosome losses, suggesting that histone gene hypertranscription may drive overproliferation and genomic instability in cancer. —Di Jiang Genome-wide hypertranscription is common in human cancer and predicts poor prognosis. To understand how hypertranscription might drive cancer, we applied our formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)–cleavage under targeted accessible chromatin method for mapping RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) genome-wide in FFPE sections. We demonstrate global RNAPII elevations in mouse gliomas and assorted human tumors in small clinical samples and discover regional elevations corresponding to de novo HER2 amplifications punctuated by likely selective sweeps. RNAPII occupancy at S-phase-dependent histone genes correlated with WHO grade in meningiomas, accurately predicted rapid recurrence, and corresponded to whole-arm chromosome losses. Elevated RNAPII at histone genes in meningiomas and diverse breast cancers is consistent with histone production being rate-limiting for S-phase progression and histone gene hypertranscription driving overproliferation and aneuploidy in cancer, with general implications for precision oncology.},

These off-site damages may be less than on-site gains—in which case the action is still beneficial but less so than it superficially seems. However, if activities are displaced to more biodiverse (or less productive) places, leakage impacts may exceed local benefits, so that well-intentioned efforts cause net harm. There is a pressing need for leakage effects like this to be acknowledged and as far as possible avoided or mitigated—through demand reduction, careful selection of conservation or restoration sites, or compensatory increases in production in lower-impact areas.},

Proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs) are the highest-performing commercialized technology ( 1 ). These devices split water into oxygen gas and hydrogen ions (protons) at the anode. The protons then migrate through an ion-conducting polymer membrane (ionomer) to be reduced to hydrogen gas at the cathode. The anode reaction’s harsh environment requires the use of precious-metal catalysts, such as iridium oxide (IrO x ). Given the expense and scarcity, the design of electrodes that minimize the use of precious metals without compromising the requisite stability and activity is desired for large-scale hydrogen production ( 2 , 3 ). On page 791 of this issue, Shi et al. ( 4 ) report that anchoring IrO x catalysts onto porous cerium-oxide (CeO x ) supports maintains performance even with much reduced precious metal use.},

Although in many societies, readily available, cheap foods promote overconsumption, the sensory properties of food also influence the amount and type of food eaten. Sensory-specific satiety (fullness) describes the decline in pleasantness of a food as it is eaten, relative to uneaten foods that have different sensory qualities—for example, the desire for a sweet dessert after a meal ( 2 ). However, the neural mechanisms that mediate this preference for sweet food are incompletely understood. On page 750 of this issue, Minère et al . ( 3 ) report a neural circuit that regulates the preference for sweet food after the consumption of a standard meal in mice ( Mus musculus ). This circuit is formed by neurons that project from the hypothalamus to the paraventricular thalamus, a region involved in sensing pleasantness and driving motivated behaviors. This work advances understanding of the drive to eat sweet food when already full.},

Unsustainable groundwater use can have detrimental effects such as aquifer depletion, loss of storage capacity, chemical and waste contamination, saltwater intrusion, and rapid land subsidence. Thus, it is essential to accurately track changes in the distribution of groundwater to manage the use and replenishment of these water systems below Earth’s surface. However, conventional groundwater measurements are limited in their ability to map out the spatiotemporal state of aquifers, which makes it challenging to track groundwater storage. On page 758 of this issue, Mao et al . ( 1 ) report how groundwater storage distribution can be monitored in both space and time through measurements of seismic ground vibrations or noise. This approach should enable surveillance of the amounts of subsurface water and enhance the management of sustainable groundwater use.},

We generated more than 175,000 transposon insertions in the Plasmodium knowlesi genome, averaging an insertion every 138 base pairs, and used this “supersaturation” mutagenesis to score essentiality for 98% of genes. The density of mutations allowed mapping of putative essential domains within genes, providing a completely new level of genome annotation for any Plasmodium species. Although gene essentiality was largely conserved across P. knowlesi , Plasmodium falciparum , and rodent malaria model Plasmodium berghei , a large number of shared genes are differentially essential, revealing species-specific adaptations. Our results indicated that Plasmodium essential gene evolution was conditionally linked to adaptive rewiring of metabolic networks for different hosts.},

To help address this problem in a comprehensive way, Liu et al . compiled a massive resource consisting of genetic data on more than 2 million human patients and detailed examination of the kidneys for hundreds of individuals, with a subset studied at single-cell precision. In addition to identifying a multitude of genetic variants that contribute to various types of kidney disease, the authors have devised a genetic scorecard to assist in the identification of additional relevant genes, cell types, and potential therapeutic targets. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich Kidney dysfunction is a major cause of mortality, but its genetic architecture remains elusive. In this study, we conducted a multiancestry genome-wide association study in 2.2 million individuals and identified 1026 (97 previously unknown) independent loci. Ancestry-specific analysis indicated an attenuation of newly identified signals on common variants in European ancestry populations and the power of population diversity for further discoveries. We defined genotype effects on allele-specific gene expression and regulatory circuitries in more than 700 human kidneys and 237,000 cells. We found 1363 coding variants disrupting 782 genes, with 601 genes also targeted by regulatory variants and convergence in 161 genes. Integrating 32 types of genetic information, we present the “Kidney Disease Genetic Scorecard” for prioritizing potentially causal genes, cell types, and druggable targets for kidney disease.},

Meneu et al . have shown that, depending on their GC content, large DNA sequences from bacteria and eukaryotes introduced into budding yeast either mingle with other active yeast chromosomes or segregate into an inactive globular compartment (see the Perspective by Fudenberg and Ramani). This spontaneous segregation requires active transcription of the host genome, which is accurately predicted by the underlying DNA sequence. This suggests that chromatin compartmentalization emerged from acquired genomic sequence diversity. —Di Jiang In eukaryotes, DNA-associated protein complexes coevolve with genomic sequences to orchestrate chromatin folding. We investigate the relationship between DNA sequence and the spontaneous loading and activity of chromatin components in the absence of coevolution. Using bacterial genomes integrated into Saccharomyces cerevisiae , which diverged from yeast more than 2 billion years ago, we show that nucleosomes, cohesins, and associated transcriptional machinery can lead to the formation of two different chromatin archetypes, one transcribed and the other silent, independently of heterochromatin formation. These two archetypes also form on eukaryotic exogenous sequences, depend on sequence composition, and can be predicted using neural networks trained on the native genome. They do not mix in the nucleus, leading to a bipartite nuclear compartmentalization, reminiscent of the organization of vertebrate nuclei.},

  abstract     = {It has been proposed that one of the many functions of the sensory cortex is to modify the vigor of instinctive responses by modulation of subcortical circuits. Mederos et al . uncovered a subcortical synaptic plasticity mechanism for learning to suppress instinctive defensive behavior. The critical pathway was the projection from higher-order visual areas posterolateral of the primary visual cortex (area V1) to the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus (vLGN), which modulated instinctive fear responses based on experience. After learning, this pathway was no longer needed. This learning-induced plasticity involved endocannabinoid-mediated long-term suppression of inhibitory synapses onto vLGN neurons activated by posterolateral higher-order visual areas, which decreased presynaptic release probability. —Peter Stern Fast instinctive responses to environmental stimuli can be crucial for survival but are not always optimal. Animals can adapt their behavior and suppress instinctive reactions, but the neural pathways mediating such ethologically relevant forms of learning remain unclear. We found that posterolateral higher visual areas (plHVAs) are crucial for learning to suppress escapes from innate visual threats through a top-down pathway to the ventrolateral geniculate nucleus (vLGN). plHVAs are no longer necessary after learning; instead, the learned behavior relies on plasticity within vLGN populations that exert inhibitory control over escape responses. vLGN neurons receiving input from plHVAs enhance their responses to visual threat stimuli during learning through endocannabinoid-mediated long-term suppression of their inhibitory inputs. We thus reveal the detailed circuit, cellular, and synaptic mechanisms underlying experience-dependent suppression of fear responses.},

  abstract     = {Insulin resistance, often induced by obesity, is the underlying abnormality for type 2 diabetes. Most studies looking at mechanisms for obesity and insulin resistance have examined cells known to play key roles in metabolism, such as those in the liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue. Cho et al . shifted their focus to the vasculature, more specifically, endothelial insulin signaling. The authors discovered that adrenomedullin, a peptide hormone that increases in concentration in the setting of obesity, inhibits insulin signaling in the endothelium of both humans and mice. In addition to examining the underlying mechanism, the authors showed in mouse models that an adrenomedullin receptor antagonist has beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity, suggesting a potential direction for future therapeutic approaches. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich Insulin resistance is a hallmark of obesity-associated type 2 diabetes. Insulin’s actions go beyond metabolic cells and also involve blood vessels, where insulin increases capillary blood flow and delivery of insulin and nutrients. We show that adrenomedullin, whose plasma levels are increased in obese humans and mice, inhibited insulin signaling in human endothelial cells through protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B–mediated dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor. In obese mice lacking the endothelial adrenomedullin receptor, insulin-induced endothelial nitric oxide–synthase activation and skeletal muscle perfusion were increased. Treating mice with adrenomedullin mimicked the effect of obesity and induced endothelial and systemic insulin resistance. Endothelial loss or blockade of the adrenomedullin receptor improved obesity-induced insulin resistance. These findings identify a mechanism underlying obesity-induced systemic insulin resistance and suggest approaches to treat obesity-associated type 2 diabetes.},

  abstract     = {In a heterogeneous soil landscape, plant root systems must locate water. Scharwies et al . found that some maize varieties produce lateral roots at locations where water is limited, whereas others more efficiently direct growth toward water. Uncovering the genetic basis for this trait variance, the authors found that auxin, ethylene, and an arabinogalactan protein work together to encourage lateral root development where water is present while suppressing lateral roots from forming on drier parts of the root. Variation in genes underlying these components leads to variation in root hydropatterning, potentially affecting the success of some maize varieties in drier environments. —Madeleine Seale Plants grow complex root systems to extract unevenly distributed resources from soils. Spatial differences in soil moisture are perceived by root tips, leading to the patterning of new root branches toward available water in a process called hydropatterning. Little is known about hydropatterning behavior and its genetic basis in crop plants. Here, we developed an assay to measure hydropatterning in maize and revealed substantial differences between tropical/subtropical and temperate maize breeding germplasm that likely resulted from divergent selection. Genetic analysis of hydropatterning confirmed the regulatory role of auxin and revealed that the gaseous hormone ethylene locally inhibits root branching from air-exposed tissues. Our results demonstrate how distinct signaling pathways translate spatial patterns of water availability to developmental programs that determine root architecture.},

  abstract     = {The mantis shrimp is known for its ability to rapidly and forcefully strike its prey, both directly and due to the rapid collapse of cavitation bubbles, without sustaining significant damage. Much of this ability has been attributed to the complex multiscale organization of the structure of the shrimp’s dactyl club and its resultant mechanical properties. Alderete et al . used fast spectroscopy techniques to disclose the effect of the club structure in terms of its phononic shielding abilities (see the Perspective by Zavattieri), showing that it can effectively filter shear waves to mitigate impact forces during strikes. —Marc S. Lavine The powerful strikes generated by the smasher mantis shrimp require it to possess a robust protection mechanism to withstand the resultant forces. Although recent studies have suggested that phononic bandgaps complement the mantis shrimp’s defensive suite, direct experimental evidence for this mechanism has remained elusive. In this work, we explored the phononic properties of the mantis shrimp’s dactyl club using laser ultrasonic techniques and numerical simulations. Our results demonstrate that the dactyl club’s periodic region functions as a dispersive, high-quality graded system, exhibiting Bloch harmonics, flat dispersion branches, ultraslow wave modes, and wide Bragg bandgaps in the lower megahertz range. These features effectively shield the shrimp from harmful high-frequency stress waves generated by cavitation bubble collapse events during impact.},

This distribution pertains to the frequency of relative word use and is believed to reflect cultural transmission of language. This pattern has also been found in infants during the beginnings of language production. The approach used to study these preverbal patterns allows for the study of songs and calls in other species. Arnon et al . used this approach to study humpback whale song collected over 8 years (see the Perspective by Whiten and Youngblood). They found clear evidence of a Zipf distribution in this song, as well as other hallmarks of human language such as statistical coherence and brevity of subsequences. —Sacha Vignieri Humpback whale song is a culturally transmitted behavior. Human language, which is also culturally transmitted, has statistically coherent parts whose frequency distribution follows a power law. These properties facilitate learning and may therefore arise because of their contribution to the faithful transmission of language over multiple cultural generations. If so, we would expect to find them in other culturally transmitted systems. In this study, we applied methods based on infant speech segmentation to 8 years of humpback recordings, uncovering in whale song the same statistical structure that is a hallmark of human language. This commonality, in two evolutionarily distant species, points to the role of learning and cultural transmission in the emergence of properties thought to be unique to human language.},

  abstract     = {The symmetry and topology of physical systems are closely related to the symmetries governing the topological properties. Quasicrystals are ordered systems but have no translation or rotational symmetries. Theoretical work has shown that quasicrystals can be understood as the projection of a higher-dimensional crystal onto a lower-dimensional space. Tsesses et al . developed a plasmonic-based system in which to study the implications of that projection for topological invariants. When going into four-dimensional space and projecting it down into two dimensions, the complex dynamics of light waves on the plasmonic quasicrystal exhibited motions of four-dimensional topological charge vectors and associated topological charge conservation laws. This approach allows the study of topological systems in higher dimensions. — Ian S. Osborne According to Noether’s theorem, symmetries in a physical system are intertwined with conserved quantities. These symmetries often determine the system topology, which is made ever more complex with increased dimensionality. Quasicrystals have neither translational nor global rotational symmetry, yet they intrinsically inhabit a higher-dimensional space in which symmetry resurfaces. Here, we discovered topological charge vectors in four dimensions (4D) that govern the real-space topology of 2D quasicrystals and reveal their inherent conservation laws. We demonstrate control over the topology in pentagonal plasmonic quasilattices, mapped by both phase-resolved and time-domain near-field microscopy, showing that their temporal evolution continuously tunes the 2D projections of their distinct 4D topologies. Our work provides a route to experimentally probe the thermodynamic properties of quasicrystals and topological physics in 4D and above.},

  abstract     = {Antarctica harbors many distinctive features of life, yet much about the diversity and functioning of Antarctica’s life remains unknown. Evolutionary histories and functional ecology are well understood only for vertebrates, whereas research on invertebrates is largely limited to species descriptions and some studies on environmental tolerances. Knowledge on Antarctic vegetation cover showcases the challenges of characterizing population trends for most groups. Recent community-level microbial studies have provided insights into the functioning of life at its limits. Overall, biotic interactions remain largely unknown across all groups, restricted to basic information on trophic level placement. Insufficient knowledge of many groups limits the understanding of ecological processes on the continent. Remedies for the current situation rely on identifying the caveats of each ecological discipline and finding targeted solutions. Such precise delimitation of knowledge gaps will enable a more aware, representative, and strategic systematic conservation planning of Antarctica.},

  abstract     = {Antarctica is a vital component of Earth’s climate system, influencing global sea level, ocean circulation, and planetary albedo. Major knowledge gaps in critical processes—spanning the atmosphere, ocean, ice sheets, underlying beds, ice shelves, and sea ice—create uncertainties in future projections, hindering climate adaptation and risk assessments of ice intervention strategies. Antarctica’s ice sheet could contribute 28 centimeters to sea level by 2100, and potentially more if we surpass warming thresholds that trigger instabilities and rapid retreat. We review recent advances in understanding the changing stability of the ice sheet margins and identify key processes that require further research. Progress requires high-resolution satellite data, targeted field campaigns, improved modeling, and refined theory. Increased investment and interdisciplinary collaboration are essential to uncovering Antarctica’s hidden processes and reducing uncertainties in future projections.},

In the Arctic, as in the rest of the world, these issues are complex, interconnected, and compounding each other. In what follows, we elaborate on three central issues: current scientific understanding of the regional and global impacts of Arctic climate change, ensuring that Arctic research addresses the needs of Arctic peoples and communities, and the importance of sustaining Arctic cooperation in challenging geopolitical times.},

Sung only by males, the songs penetrate the ocean for many miles and are suspected to attract females for mating through their musical complexity. Year by year, the songs may become more complex and perhaps more alluring to females. However, in the southwestern Pacific, a totally new song emerges every few years that is adopted across the ocean ( 2 ). The rapidity with which new songs and variations are copied demonstrates that they are culturally transmitted, but the evolutionary forces that shape the complex song structures over time have remained mysterious. On page 649 of this issue, Arnon et al . ( 3 ) report that fundamental laws identified in quantitative linguistics and in the culturally evolved learnability of human languages apply to whale song.},

  abstract     = {As molecular geneticist François Jacob wrote, living organisms reflect “the very nature of a historical process full of contingency” ( 1 ). Evolutionary contingency constrains relationships between genome sequence, organization, and function. However, technologies for engineering ever-larger stretches of DNA now enable synthetic regulatory reconstitution experiments ( 2 – 4 ) in which foreign DNA, freed from historical contingency, can be placed directly into a host cell. Such “in hostia” reconstitutions complement classic in vitro approaches for determining the rules of genomic regulation. Notably, in hostia reconstitutions assess the regulatory “ground state” of a host cellular environment—that is, the propensity for inserted DNA to be active or silent. On page 627 of this issue, Meneu et al. ( 5 ) describe what happens when bacterial DNA is introduced into yeast cell nuclei as synthetic chromosomes. The spontaneous formation of active or inactive chromatin, dependent on sequence composition of the exogenous chromosomes, has implications for synthetic chromosome design.},

A subset of metamaterials called phononic bandgap materials can reflect, scatter, or absorb energy by manipulating the way mechanical waves interact with the periodic structures of the material. Waves within a specific frequency range cannot travel through such a material, creating a phononic bandgap. This effect is useful for technologies such as acoustic imaging, acoustic cloaking, shock proofing, and energy harvesting. Architected metamaterials are artificially made; does a similar phenomenon exist in nature? On page 659 of this issue, Alderete et al. ( 1 ) report that a mantis shrimp’s dactyl club has phononic bandgaps in which stress waves of specific frequency ranges are filtered. This demonstrates that natural ma terials can exhibit phononic behavior that is observed in artificial metamaterials, opening the possibility for designing bioinspired and biohybrid phononic bandgap materials.},
