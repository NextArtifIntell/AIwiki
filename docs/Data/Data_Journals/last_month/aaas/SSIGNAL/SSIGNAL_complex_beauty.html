  abstract     = {Genetic screens for suppressors of mutant phenotypes are valuable tools for identifying components of signaling pathways. Schwartz and Sternberg developed a screening method on the basis of genome sequencing that does not require the recovery of viable animals. Using this approach, they identified mutations that partially suppressed the lethality caused by loss of the epidermal growth factor receptor homolog LET-23 in Caenorhabditis elegans . The suppressing mutations included those that affected genes encoding regulators of the small guanosine triphosphatase Rho and nuclear proteins that protect against DNA damage. This method can be used to screen for modifiers that may suppress a phenotype in only a subset of tissues but do not fully restore function to enable the recovery of fertile adults. —Annalisa M. VanHook Suppressor screens can identify genetic modifiers of biochemical pathways but generally require that the suppressed mutant be viable and fertile. We developed a screening method that obviated this requirement and enabled the identification of mutations that partially suppressed the early developmental arrest and lethality caused by loss of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor ortholog LET-23 in Caenorhabditis elegans . We chemically mutagenized animals carrying the loss-of-function allele let-23 ( sy15 ), recovered let-23 ( sy15 ) homozygotes that escaped early developmental arrest but were nevertheless inviable, and sequenced their genomes. Testing of candidate causal mutations identified 11 genes that, when mutated, mitigated the early lethality caused by loss of EGF signaling. These included genes encoding homologs of the small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Ras ( let-60 ), which is a downstream effector of LET-23, and of regulators of the small GTPase Rho, including the homolog of the phosphotyrosine-binding protein TENSIN ( tns-1 ). We also recovered suppressing mutations in genes encoding nuclear proteins that protect against DNA damage, including the homolog of MutS homolog 4 ( him-14 ). Genetic experiments were consistent with the repression of Rho activity or the activation of the DNA damage response compensating for the loss of EGF signaling. This sequencing-based, whole-animal screening method may be adapted to other organisms to enable the identification of mutations for which the phenotype does not allow the recovery of viable animals.},

  abstract     = {The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is made up of multicellular contacts referred to as the neurovascular unit (NVU) that mediate the exchange of fluid and nutrients in the brain. Sona et al. found that tight control of the abundance of the phosphatase PTEN in excitatory neurons is critical to the postnatal development of the NVU in mice. Mice lacking the mRNA regulator Ago2 in glutamatergic neurons had decreased NVU development and defective BBB integrity. These effects were mediated through loss of Ago2-dependent suppression of Pten , leading to decreases in signaling that support neuronal survival and migration. Thus, Ago2 in excitatory neurons supports brain development through formation of the BBB. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Proper formation of the complex neurovascular unit (NVU) along with the blood-brain barrier is critical for building and sustaining a healthy, functioning central nervous system. The RNA binding protein argonaute2 (Ago2) mediates microRNA (miRNA)–mediated gene silencing, which is critical for many facets of brain development, including NVU development. Here, we found that Ago2 in glutamatergic neurons was critical for NVU formation in the developing cortices of mice. Glutamatergic neuron–specific loss of Ago2 diminished synaptic formation, neuronal-to-endothelial cell contacts, and morphogenesis of the brain vasculature, ultimately compromising the integrity of the blood-brain barrier. Ago2 facilitated miRNA targeting of phosphatase and tensin homolog ( Pten ) mRNA, which encodes a phosphatase that modulates reelin-dependent phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)–Akt signaling within the glutamatergic subpopulation. Conditionally deleting Pten in Ago2 -deficient neurons restored Akt2 phosphorylation as well as postnatal development and survival. Several mutations in AGO2 impair small RNA silencing and are associated with Lessel-Kreienkamp syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder. When expressed in a neuronal cell line, these human AGO2 loss-of-function variants failed to suppress PTEN, resulting in attenuated PI3K-Akt signaling, further indicating that dysregulation of Ago2 function may contribute to both impaired development and neurological disorders. Together, these results identify Ago2 as central to the engagement of neurons with blood vessels in the developing brain.},

  abstract     = {The chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) ensures appropriate chromosome-microtubule attachments during mitosis and includes the kinase Aurora-B and the microtubule-binding protein Borealin. The ubiquitin ligase APC/C and its cofactor Cdh1 (APC/C Cdh1 ) can trigger the degradation of the CPC in somatic cells, but its activity is constitutively low during mitosis in stem cells. Tsunematsu et al. investigated the stability of the CPC in human embryonic carcinoma (hEC) cells. In hEC cells undergoing mitosis, a stable CPC depended on the low activity of APC/C Cdh1 , and depletion of Aurora-B and Borealin by APC/C Cdh1 resulted in spontaneous hEC cell differentiation. These findings indicate a mechanism of holding hEC cells in a pluripotent state on the basis of APC/C Cdh1 activity. —Amy E. Baek Human embryonic carcinoma (hEC) cells are derived from teratocarcinomas, exhibit robust proliferation, have a high differentiation potential, are the malignant counterparts of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), and are considered hESC-like. The chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), made up of the microtuble binding protein Borealin, the kinase Aurora-B, the CPC-stabilizing inner centromere protein (INCENP), and the inhibitor of apoptosis family member Survivin, regulates cell division and is active exclusively during mitosis in somatic cells. The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome and its cofactor Cdh1 (APC/C Cdh1 ) is a ubiquitylating complex that catalyzes the degradation of Aurora-B and Borealin in somatic cells but has low activity during interphase in hESCs. Here, we found that Borealin and Aurora-B exhibited sustained stability throughout the cell cycle of hEC cells due to low APC/C Cdh1 activity. In contrast with somatic cells, CPC activity persisted across the cell cycle of hEC cells because of diminished APC/C Cdh1 activity. Disrupting the CPC complex by depleting its constituents triggered spontaneous differentiation in hEC cells. As hEC cells differentiated, APC/C Cdh1 activation curtailed CPC activity. Inactivating the CPC by pharmacologically inhibiting Aurora-B induced hEC cell differentiation by activating the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program. Hence, APC/C Cdh1 -mediated termination of CPC activity triggered hEC cell differentiation. Collectively, these findings demonstrate a role for the CPC in governing hESC cell fate.},

  abstract     = {The vasopressin type 2 receptor (V 2 R) is a G protein–coupled receptor that regulates fluid balance and can be activated by the ligands arginine vasopressin and oxytocin. Teixeira et al. found that sustained V 2 R signaling depended on the identity of the activating ligand but was independent of receptor internalization by the scaffolding protein β-arrestin. V 2 R-induced signaling occurred primarily at the plasma membrane, and its duration depended on the residence time of the ligand on the receptor, which was longer after activation with arginine vasopressin than with oxytocin. Moreover, V 2 R internalization into endosomes induced by β-arrestin helped to terminate V 2 R signaling due to ligand dissociation from V 2 R caused by acidified endosomal pH. These results show that the overall duration of V 2 R signaling at the plasma membrane is determined by ligand residence time on the receptor. —Wei Wong The canonical model of G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling comprises G protein activation at the plasma membrane, followed by receptor phosphorylation and β-arrestin recruitment, which leads to receptor desensitization and endocytosis. However, the activation of some GPCRs results in sustained G protein signaling from intracellular compartments in a manner reportedly dependent on β-arrestin and receptor endocytosis. The vasopressin type 2 receptor (V 2 R) can be activated by two structurally similar hormones, arginine vasopressin and oxytocin, both of which stimulate the production of the second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). In this study, we showed that sustained V 2 R signaling and endosomal Gα s (stimulatory G protein alpha subunit) translocation could occur without β-arrestin–mediated receptor endocytosis and was primarily controlled by the residence time of the ligand on the receptor. β-Arrestin had opposing effects on sustained signaling: It facilitated receptor internalization into endosomes, where it activated Gα s , and promoted cAMP production from this compartment. However, β-arrestin–mediated receptor endocytosis also induced ligand dissociation due to the acidic endosomal environment, thereby limiting the signal. Overall, our data suggest that signals originating at the plasma membrane play a dominant role in sustained V 2 R signaling stimulated by arginine vasopressin.},

Funk et al. found that these oncogenes can be disrupted in HNSCCs by targeting the kinase LZK, another commonly overexpressed protein encoded by MAP3K13 . LZK stabilized c-MYC through kinase-dependent activity, whereas LZK stabilized mutant p53 through a kinase-independent physical interaction. A PROTAC drug that degraded LZK resulted in the destabilization of both proteins, and a catalytic inhibitor of LZK slowed the growth of MAP3K13 -amplified HNSCCs in mice, highlighting LZK as a target for treating HNSCC. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli The worldwide annual frequency and lethality of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is not improving, and thus, new therapeutic approaches are needed. Approximately 70% of HNSCC cases have either amplification or overexpression of MAP3K13 , which encodes the kinase LZK. Here, we found that LZK is a therapeutic target in HNSCC and that small-molecule inhibition of its catalytic function decreased the viability of HNSCC cells with amplified MAP3K13 . Inhibition of LZK suppressed tumor growth in MAP3K13 -amplified xenografts derived from HNSCC patients. LZK stabilized the transcription factor c-MYC through its kinase activity and gain-of-function mutants of p53 in a kinase-independent manner. We designed a proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) that induced LZK degradation, leading to decreased abundance of both c-MYC and gain-of-function p53, and reduced the viability of HNSCC cells. Our findings demonstrate that LZK-targeted therapeutics, particularly PROTACs, may be effective in treating HNSCCs with MAP3K13 amplification.},

We know that an individual’s risk for addiction is determined by interactions between genetics and environment and that only a minute fraction of chemical agents share the ability to act on this vulnerability to induce a state of addiction. Repeated exposure to these drugs causes addiction through repeated activation of dopaminergic transmission (and many other actions) in the brain, inducing changes at the molecular, cellular, and synaptic levels that, over time, rewire the circuitry throughout the limbic system. In this Review, I discuss how we are gaining a clearer picture of this drug-induced plasticity—some of which is shared by all addictive drugs, whereas other aspects are specific to certain drug classes—and of the ways in which these adaptations mediate the range of behavioral abnormalities that define the addicted state. Despite the challenges, there is reason for optimism in translating this rich biological understanding of addiction into improved treatments for the many individuals burdened by this illness around the world.},

  abstract     = {Ghrelin is a peptide hormone that acts on its G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) to stimulate appetite and food intake. Signal transduction by GPCRs requires activation of intracellular G proteins in a process involving transient conformational changes in both the receptor and the Gα subunit. Mannes et al . developed synthetic peptides that mimicked the stabilizing effect of Gα q -containing heterotrimers on the active conformation of the ghrelin receptor. Biochemical assays using these peptidomimetics demonstrated that G protein coupling allosterically increased the receptor’s affinity for ghrelin and that G protein activation occurred through a series of distinct interactions with the receptor. The findings demonstrate that G protein activation is a multistep process that may also affect the sensitivity of the ghrelin receptor. —Annalisa M. VanHook G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling is a dynamic process involving various conformational intermediates in addition to those captured in static three-dimensional structures. Here, we used newly developed G protein peptidomimetics to characterize the interactions of the ghrelin receptor (GHSR) with G proteins. Coupling to the G protein peptidomimetic not only affected the conformational features of the cytoplasmic regions of the receptor where the G protein binds but also allosterically affected the extracellular ligand-binding pocket. These conformational and allosteric changes increased the affinity of G protein–coupled GHSR for the endogenous agonist ghrelin. In addition, our data identified different complexes along the G protein activation pathway that differed in the engagement of the Gα q C-terminal helix. Given that this helix is the main link between the activated receptor and the Gα nucleotide-binding pocket, these findings suggested a stepwise process involving distinct states in GPCR-catalyzed G protein activation. Collectively, our results provide evidence for the dynamic behavior of GPCR–G protein signaling complexes, with such dynamics most likely contributing to signaling selectivity and/or efficacy.},
