  abstract     = {3D organization of the genome plays a critical role in regulating gene expression. How 3D-genome organization differs among different cell types and relates to cell type–dependent transcriptional regulation remains unclear. Here, we used genome-scale DNA and RNA imaging to investigate 3D-genome organization in transcriptionally distinct cell types in the mouse cerebral cortex. We uncovered a wide spectrum of differences in the nuclear architecture and 3D-genome organization among different cell types, ranging from the size of the cell nucleus to higher-order chromosome structures and radial positioning of chromatin loci within the nucleus. These cell type–dependent variations in nuclear architecture and chromatin organization exhibit strong correlations with both the total transcriptional activity of the cell and transcriptional regulation of cell type–specific marker genes. Moreover, we found that the methylated DNA binding protein MeCP2 promotes active-inactive chromatin segregation and regulates transcription in a nuclear radial position–dependent manner that is highly correlated with its function in modulating active-inactive chromatin compartmentalization.},

To address these issues, we conducted genome mining of terpene synthases from the sea whip coral Paramuricea clavata , resulting in the discovery of a biflorane synthase Pc TS1. We performed a series of isotope labeling, crystallography, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations, and mutagenesis studies toward Pc TS1 to investigate the mechanism. Isotopic labeling studies, together with calculations, elucidate a cascade of 1,10-cyclization, 1,3-hydride shift, 1,6-cyclization, 1,2-hydride shift, 2,6-cyclization, cyclopropane ring opening, and deprotonation by the generated pyrophosphate, forming the biflorane scaffold. Crystallography, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics, and mutagenesis studies confirmed the cascade and produced different terpene scaffolds.

However, the postselection (PS) effect may also introduce unintended biases in precision measurements. Here, we investigate the influence of PS in the precision spectroscopy of the 2 3 S − 2 3 P transition of helium ( 4 He) using an atomic beam. We directly observe that PS based on atomic positions causes a shift in the measured transition frequency, amounting to approximately −55 kHz. After accounting for this PS shift, we obtain a corrected frequency of 276,764,094,712.45 ± 0.86 kHz for the 2 3 S 1 − 2 3 P 0 transition. Combining this result with existing data for 3 He, we derive a value for the difference in squared nuclear charge radii, which shows a σ deviation from measurements of muonic helium ions, potentially pointing to new physics that challenges lepton universality in quantum electrodynamics.},

However, the regulation and selectivity of NINJ1-mediated DAMP release remain unexplored. Here, we uncover that murine norovirus (MNoV) strategically co-opts NINJ1 to selectively release the intracellular viral protein NS1, while NINJ1-mediated plasma membrane rupture simultaneously bulk-releases various cellular DAMPs. Host caspase-3 cleaves the precursor NS1/2, leading to NS1 secretion via an unconventional pathway. An unbiased CRISPR screen identifies NINJ1 as an essential factor for NS1 secretion. During infection, NINJ1 is recruited to the viral replication site, where it oligomerizes and forms speckled bodies, directly interacting with NS1. Subsequent mutagenesis studies identify critical amino acid residues of NS1 necessary for its interaction with NINJ1 and selective secretion. Genetic ablation or pharmaceutical inhibition of caspase-3 inhibits oral MNoV infection in mice. This study underscores the co-option of NINJ1 for controlled release of an intracellular viral protein.},

Here, we report that components involved in lagging strand synthesis, DNA polymerases α and δ, have substantially reduced levels in stem cells compared to progenitor cells, and this promotes local asymmetry of parental histone incorporation at the replication fork. Compromising Polα genetically induces the local replication-coupled histone incorporation pattern in progenitor cells to resemble that in stem cells, seen by both nuclear localization patterns and chromatin fibers. This is recapitulated using a Polα inhibitor in a concentration-dependent manner. The local old versus new histone asymmetry is comparable between stem cells and progenitor cells at both S phase and M phase. Together, these results indicate that developmentally programmed expression of key DNA replication components is important to shape stem cell chromatin. Furthermore, manipulating one crucial DNA replication component can induce replication-coupled histone dynamics in nonstem cells to resemble those in stem cells.},

However, neither theory fully accounts for their abundance and multiplicity. Here, we show via hydrodynamic simulations that free-floating PMOs have a unique formation channel via the fragmentation of tidal bridges between encountering circumstellar disks. This process can be highly productive in dense clusters like Trapezium forming metal-poor PMOs with disks. Free-floating multiple PMOs also naturally emerge when neighboring PMOs are caught by their mutual gravity. PMOs may thus form a distinct population that is fundamentally different from stars and planets.},

These textured lithium ceramic electrolytes exhibit large columnar grains perpendicular to the surface. The textured electrodes indicate an out-of-plane crystallographic texture. As a result, the Li-ion transport pathways across the grain boundary plane are avoided in the textured lithium ceramic with low tortuosity, resulting in great ionic conductivity enhancement by 42 times compared to its traditional equiaxed counterpart. In addition, both Monte Carlo simulation and finite element analysis support the experimental results. This innovative gas-solid reactive sintering technique can extend to prepare various structured and functional ceramics with tailored structures and properties.},

We previously proposed that the Escherichia coli S2P RseP unwinds helical substrate segments before cleavage, but the mechanism for accommodating a full-length membrane-spanning substrate remained unclear. Our present cryo-EM analysis of Aquifex aeolicus RseP ( Aa RseP) revealed that a substrate-like membrane protein fragment from the expression host occupied the active site while spanning a transmembrane cavity that is inaccessible via lateral diffusion. Furthermore, in vivo photocrosslinking supported that this substrate accommodation mode is recapitulated on the cell membrane.

Here, we introduce the concept of metal blackbody microcavities, comprising thousands of microscale periodic pores created on metals, demonstrating excellent emissivity across visible and infrared (IR) ranges (exceeding 0.94 on average from 0.25 to 20 μm). In the long-wavelength IR (8 to 14 μm) region, near-unity emissivity was successfully achieved by 100-μm-deep metal microcavities with ultralow structural aspect ratios, facilitated by laser-textured multiscale surface morphologies that substantially enhance the light-trapping capabilities. Our findings demonstrate that microcavity-based patterns can produce local emissivity, tunable radiative intensity gradients, wide-angle feasibility, and high-temperature resistance, thereby enabling diverse applications in thermal IR displays such as thermal illusion, IR encryption, and grayscale thermal imaging. Notably, these blackbody microcavities are applicable to various metals, presenting considerable potential for use in extreme environments.},

We demonstrate that the herbicide adjuvant Triton CG-110 is more toxic to fungal cells than pure glyphosate. It limits nitrogen uptake, which induces the expression of proteinase YPS1 to catalyze the shedding of the MSB2 extracellular domain from the plasma membrane, leading to the activation of the MAPK TMK1 pheromone pathway. The downstream B2H2-type transcription factor STE12 directly regulates ergosterol biosynthesis, affecting membrane fluidity and stability.

Crucially, the canonical ultrastructure of the synaptonemal complex is altered upon weakening this interface using charge-reversal mutations. We developed a thermodynamic model that recapitulates our experimental observations, indicating that the liquid-like central region can assemble by wetting the axes without active energy consumption.

Corpuscles are composed of a mechanoreceptor afferent surrounded by lamellar Schwann cells (LSCs), enclosed by a multilayered outer core. The spatial arrangement of these components and their contribution to sensory tuning are unclear. We report the three-dimensional architecture of the Pacinian corpuscle and reveal the role of its cellular components in touch detection. In the prevailing model, the outer core acts as a mechanical filter that limits static and low-frequency stimuli from reaching the afferent terminal—the presumed sole site of touch detection. We show that the outer core is dispensable for the sensory tuning to transient touch and vibration; instead, these properties arise from the inner core. By acting as additional touch sensors, LSCs potentiate mechanosensitivity of the terminal, which detects touch via fast inactivating ion channels.

  abstract     = {Increased cardiac excitability and reduced electrical coupling promote cardiac arrhythmia and can be quantified by input resistance ( R m ), pacing threshold ( I thr ), and cardiac space constant (λ). However, their measurement in the heart was not feasible because the required homogenous current injection cannot be performed with electrical stimulation. We overcame this problem by optogenetic current injection into all illuminated cardiomyocytes of mouse hearts in different action potential phases. Precisely triggered and patterned illumination enabled measuring R m and λ, which both were smallest at diastole. Pharmacological and depolarization-induced reduction of inwardly rectifying K + currents ( I K1 ), gap junction block, and cardiac infarction reduced I thr , showing the importance of high I K1 density and intact cardiomyocyte coupling for preventing arrhythmia initiation. Combining optogenetic current injection and computer simulations was used to classify pro- and anti-arrhythmic mechanisms based on their effects on R m and I thr and allowed to quantify I K1 inward rectification in the intact heart, identifying reduced I K1 rectification as anti-arrhythmic concept.},

One key challenge that these quantum sensors face is improving the sensitivity within a given timeframe while preserving a high dynamic range. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an adaptive entanglement-free cold-atom magnetometry with both superior sensitivity and high dynamic range. Using a tailored adaptive Bayesian quantum estimation algorithm designed for Ramsey interferometry using coherent population trapping (CPT), cold-atom magnetometry facilitates adaptive high-precision detection of a dc magnetic field with high dynamic range. Through implementing a sequence of correlated CPT-Ramsey interferometry, the sensitivity significantly surpasses the standard quantum limit with respect to total interrogation time. We yield a sensitivity of 6.8 ± 0.1 picotesla per square root of hertz over a range of 145.6 nanotesla, exceeding the conventional frequentist protocol by 3.3 ± 0.1 decibels. Our study opens avenues for the next generation of adaptive cold-atom quantum sensors, wherein real-time measurement history is leveraged to improve their performance.},

The wireless sensor could be integrated with complex structures in surgical scenarios involving lateral collateral ligament injury and anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, enabling distinct responses to graft stretching, reinjury, and loosening.

Here, we used synchrotron-based vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry to study the pyrolysis of a representative PFAS—perfluorohexanoic acid—and provide direct evidence of fluorocarbon radicals and intermediates. A key reaction pathway from perfluorocarboxylic acids to ketenes via acyl fluorides is proposed. We furthermore propose CF 2 /CF 3 radical–centered pyrolysis mechanisms and explain their roles in the formation of other products that may form in full-scale incinerators.

We apply a statistical physics model—concurrence percolation—to uncover the origin of stronger connectivity on hierarchical scale-free networks, the ( U , V ) flowers. These networks allow full analytical control over path connectivity through two adjustable path-length parameters, ≤ V . This precise control enables us to determine critical exponents well beyond current simulation limits, revealing that classical and concurrence percolations, while both satisfying the hyperscaling relation, fall into distinct universality classes. This distinction arises from how they “superpose” parallel, nonshortest path contributions into overall connectivity. Concurrence percolation, unlike its classical counterpart, is sensitive to nonshortest paths and shows higher resilience to detours as these paths lengthen. This enhanced resilience is also observed in real-world hierarchical, scale-free internet networks. Our findings highlight a crucial principle for QN design: When nonshortest paths are abundant, they notably enhance QN connectivity beyond what is achievable with classical percolation.},

A210-CAART incorporating a CD8α transmembrane domain (TMD8α) showed functional but unstable surface expression, partially restored by inhibiting lysosomal degradation. A210-CAART with a CD28 TMD showed sustained surface expression, independent of TMD dimerization motifs. In a mouse xenograft model, A210.TMD8α-CAART demonstrated early control of anti-AChR B cell outgrowth but subsequent rebound and loss of surface CAAR expression, whereas A210.TMD28-CAART induced sustained surface CAAR expression and target cell elimination.

However, recent estimates on younger OJN eruption ages cast doubt on the link between OJN volcanism and OAE1a. Here, we further demonstrate the synchroneity between OJN volcanism and OAE1a by refining the chronology of Pacific volcanogenic sedimentary records on Magellan Rise, nearby OJN, with detailed osmium and carbon isotopic stratigraphy. Our geochemical data reveal that a thick tuffaceous interval at this site was deposited during OAE1a. Furthermore, multisite compilation of osmium isotopes, Pacific volcanic ash beds, and paleontological data just above OJN basalts illustrate that explosive OJN eruptions spanned ~5 million years, peaking around OAE1a. Their synchroneity strongly indicates that OJN volcanism most likely caused OAE1a and relevant late Barremian to mid-Aptian environmental perturbations.},

Here, we present a high–numerical aperture, lens-based resonator that pushes the single-atom single-photon absorption probability near its fundamental limit, reducing the mode size at the atom to order λ. This resonator provides a single-atom cooperativity of 1.6 in a cavity where the light circulates ∼10 times. We load single 87 Rb atoms into this cavity, observe strong coupling, and demonstrate cavity-enhanced atom detection with fidelity of 99.55(6)% and survival of 99.89(4)% in 130 μs. Introducing intracavity imaging systems will enable cavity arrays compatible with Rydberg atom array computing technologies, expanding the applicability of the cavity QED toolbox.},

Here, we systematically benchmark regional gene expression in macaque cortex against (i) macaque cortical receptor density and in vivo and ex vivo microstructure and (ii) human cortical gene expression. We find moderate cortex-wide correspondence between macaque gene expression and protein density, which improves by considering layer-specific gene expression. Half of the examined genes exhibit significant correlation between macaque and human across the cortex. Interspecies correspondence of gene expression is greater in unimodal than in transmodal cortex, recapitulating evolutionary cortical expansion and gene-protein correspondence in the macaque.

Here, we demonstrate a conceptually unique thermal diffusivity microscope capable of performing high-resolution local measurements of anisotropic thermal diffusivity. The microscope features a unique micro four-point probe for fast, nondestructive scanning without calibration or extra sample preparation. It measures anisotropic thermal diffusivity based on thermal delay from a single heater. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that the anisotropy of the measured thermal diffusivity correlates excellently with the crystallographic direction of prototypical Bi 2 Te 3 . The anisotropic heat transport shows that the lattice contribution dominates the heat transport for both in- and out-of-plane directions.},

Aequorin-based examinations disclosed dual cytosolic Ca 2+ peaks shortly after flg22 application, which corresponded with two voltage shifts from the epidermis to SEs. These signals were converted into rapid long-range action potentials (APs) or slower short-range variation potentials (VPs). Modified phytohormone-levels demonstrated systemic AP effects. Jasmonic acid up-regulation was significantly higher in wild-type than Atseor1/2 mutants. Abundant Ca 2+ influx associated with VPs was responsible for transient sieve element occlusion (SEO) near the flg22 perception site, whereas SEO was absent in Atseor1/2 and Atfls2 mutants. Biological relevance of SEO was demonstrated by higher susceptibility of Atseor1/2 mutants to Pseudomonas syringae than wild-type plants.},

Perovskites have superior optoelectronic properties and structural diversity, making them ideal candidates for high-performing direct full-stokes polarimetry. However, perovskite suffers low chiroptical activity due to inefficient chiral transfer, which greatly limits its circular-polarization-vector discrimination. These issues urgently require remedy. Here, we demonstrate that perovskites’ chiroptical activity is highly related to their structural chiral-distortion extent. We propose using halide mixing to construct asymmetric chiral transfer to heighten its structural chiral-distortion extent. Accordingly, we report a 16-fold increment in the optical chiroptical activity. Further ab initio calculations verify that the enhancement is due to the strengthened magnetic transition dipole in mixed-halide structures. We herein report a self-powered, direct full-Stokes polarimetry with a high detectivity up to 1.2 × 10 12 Jones and low detection errors (Δ S 1–3 ≤ 5.0%). We further showcase their application in full-stokes imaging polarimetry with the lowest detection errors yet.},

  abstract     = {Naturally occurring extracellular vesicles (EVs) and synthetic nanoparticles like liposomes have revolutionized precision diagnostics and medicine. EVs excel in biocompatibility and cell targeting, while liposomes offer enhanced drug loading capacity and scalability. The clinical translation of EVs is hindered by challenges including low yield and heterogeneity, whereas liposomes face rapid immune clearance and limited targeting efficiency. To bridge these gaps, biomimetic synthetic vesicles (SVs) have emerged as innovative platforms, combining the advantageous properties of EVs and liposomes. This review emphasizes critical aspects of EV biology, such as mechanisms of EV-cell interaction and source-dependent functionalities in targeting, immune modulation, and tissue regeneration, informing biomimetic SV engineering. We reviewed a broad array of biomimetic SVs, with a focus on lipid bilayered vesicles functionalized with proteins. These include cell-derived nanovesicles, protein-functionalized liposomes, and hybrid vesicles. By addressing current challenges and highlighting opportunities, this review aims to advance biomimetic SVs for transformative biomedical applications.},

However, the cause of this trend in the BKS atmospheric circulation remains unknown. Here we show that anthropogenic greenhouse gases are the primary driver of the strengthening of the BKS anticyclonic circulation, with anthropogenic aerosols playing a secondary role, both together accounting for about 86% of the observed circulation trend. Both forcings induce an amplified BKS low-tropospheric warming through coupling with strong sea ice loss. This amplified warming raises geopotential height aloft through thermal expansion, causing an anomalous anticyclonic anomaly, which in turn enhances warming and sea ice loss, forming a positive feedback loop. Our work provides a theoretical framework for understanding Arctic atmospheric circulation responses to anthropogenic warming and may have implications for climate and environment in the Arctic and beyond.},

Here, we resolve in combined ground- and excited-state spatiospectral ultrafast nanoimaging how structural characteristics are related to both molecular cation and polaron dynamics. We use the observed nanoscale spatial variations of the formamidinium (FA) cation transient vibrational blue shifts as a local probe of the nonlocal polaron-cation coupling. From the correlation with nanomovies of the polaron dynamics, we then infer how a softer more polarizable lattice supports stable polarons and longer-lived residual carriers. This, together with a relative intragrain homogeneity in contrast to high intergrain heterogeneity, suggests pathways for improved synthesis and device engineering, and that perovskite photonics performance is still far from any fundamental limits.},

Here, we realized the entangled antiferromagnetic quantum spin-1/2 Heisenberg model with diazahexabenzocoronene oligomers (up to 7 units) on Au(111). Extensive low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy measurements and density functional theory and many-body calculations show that even-numbered spin chains host a collective state with gapped excitations, while odd-numbered chains feature a Kondo excitation. We found that a given antiferromagnetic coupling J value between first neighbors in the entangled quantum states is responsible for the quantum phenomena, strongly relating to their parities of the chain.

We confirmed these findings in newborn, inflammation-free samples of a CF animal model and further identified ultrastructural alterations in the olfactory epithelium and bulbs of these animals. We established that CFTR, the anion channel whose dysfunction causes CF, is dispensable for odor-evoked signaling in sensory neurons, yet CF animals displayed defective odor-guided behaviors consistent with the morphological and molecular alterations.

Elevated spike-specific IgG4 reduced binding to FcγRIIIa and decreased antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. However, in individuals with lower total spike-specific IgG, IgG4 acted in synergy with other IgG subclasses to improve FcγRI and FcγRIIa binding and consequently antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis. Furthermore, this trend was more pronounced with more recent SARS-CoV-2 variants where vaccination induced comparably lower total spike-specific titers. These observations were further confirmed by in silico modeling where antibody subclass concentrations and FcγR polymorphisms were modulated. Collectively, we illustrate that the impact of elevated IgG4 titers upon Fc functions is dependent on multiple interconnected antibody and antigen factors, which should be taken into consideration when dissecting the mechanisms driving an effective Fc-mediated response following vaccination.},

The highly efficient anodic oxygen evolving catalyst, consisting of an iron oxide/nickel (oxy)hydroxide (Fe 2 O 3 -NiO x H y ) composite, enables the customized AW electrolyzer with unprecedented catalytic performance (e.g., 1 A cm −2 at 1.8 V and 0.37 kgH 2 /m −2 hour −1 at 48 kWh/kgH 2 ). Benefiting from the superior water electrolysis performance, the integrated CPV-AW electrolyzer system reaches a very high STH efficiency of up to 29.1% (refer to 30.3% if the lead resistance losses are excluded) at large current densities, surpassing all previously reported PV-electrolysis systems.},

However, the molecular mechanisms of the vesicle fusion arrest and how vesicle fusion is rescued from the arrest remain not fully understood. We have previously shown that as a lipid catalyst, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) electrostatically triggers vesicle fusion by lowering the hydration energy, and masking PIP2 arrests vesicle fusion in a state of the partial SNARE assembly. In this study, we show that calmodulin and protein kinase C–epsilon unmask PIP2 through the dissociation of myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate from membranes and, thus, rescue basal fusion and potentiate synaptotagmin-1–mediated Ca 2+ -dependent vesicle fusion.

Here, high-resolution cryo–electron microscopy revealed how two clinically relevant inhibitors block CDK7 function. In cells, CDK7 inhibition rapidly suppressed transcription, but constitutively active genes were disproportionately affected versus stimulus-responsive. Distinct transcription factors (TFs) regulate constitutive versus stimulus-responsive genes. Accordingly, stimulus-responsive TFs were refractory to CDK7 inhibition whereas constitutively active “core” TFs were repressed. Core TFs (n = 78) are predominantly promoter associated and control cell cycle and proliferative gene expression programs across cell types. Mechanistically, rapid suppression of core TF function can occur through CDK7-dependent phosphorylation changes in core TFs and RB1. Moreover, CDK7 inhibition depleted core TF protein levels within hours, consistent with durable target gene suppression. Thus, a major but unappreciated biological function for CDK7 is regulation of a TF cohort that drives proliferation, revealing an apparent universal mechanism by which CDK7 coordinates RNAPII transcription with cell cycle CDK regulation.},

Our results present evidence for localized, anisotropic structures with a near-zero Poisson’s ratio in the medium surrounding 1 to 2 kilometer–sized earthquake clusters, suggesting that the fault medium is damaged, foliated, and enriched with fluid. Such localized structures may cause stress perturbations on faults that in turn favor the frequent occurrence of deep interplate earthquakes at depths of 60 to 70 kilometers. Therefore, identifying the distribution and properties of fault material heterogeneity is important for more informed assessment of earthquake hazards.},

G 1 -β subunit, a homolog of the F 1 -ATPase catalytic subunit, exhibited a specific N-terminal region that incorporates the glycolytic enzyme, phosphoglycerate kinase into the complex. Structural features of the ATPase displayed strong similarities to F 1 -ATPase, suggesting a rotation based on the rotary catalytic mechanism.

By implementing a corresponding dynamical decoupling strategy, we are able to surpass the empirical limit and approach the upper physical limit T 2 = 2 T 1 for NVs, from room temperature down to 220 kelvin. Our observations, including the independence across different spatial sites and its dependence on temperature in the same way as spin-lattice relaxation, suggest an emerging decoherence mechanism dominated by spin-lattice interaction.

  abstract     = {Seed dormancy determines germination timing, influencing seed plant adaptation and overall fitness. DELAY OF GERMINATION 1 (DOG1) is a conserved central regulator of dormancy cooperating with the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) through negative regulation of ABA HYPERSENSITIVE GERMINATION (AHG) 1 and AHG3 phosphatases. The current molecular mechanism of DOG1 signaling proposes it regulates the activation of central ABA-related SnRK2 kinases. Here, we unveil DOG1’s functional autonomy from the regulation of ABA core signaling components and unravel its pivotal control over the activation of ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE FIVE BINDING PROTEINs (AFPs). Our data revealed a molecular relay in which AFPs’ genuine activation by AHG1 is contained by DOG1 to prevent the breakdown of maturation-imposed ABA responses independently of ABA-related kinase activation status. This work offers a molecular understanding of how plants fine-tune germination timing, while preserving seed responsiveness to adverse environmental cues, and thus represents a milestone in the realm of conservation and breeding programs.},

  abstract     = {The warming climate is creating increased levels of climate risk because of changes to the hazards to which human and natural systems are exposed. Projections of how those hazards will change are affected by uncertainties in the climate sensitivity of climate models, among other factors. While the level-of-global-warming approach can circumvent model climate sensitivity uncertainties in some applications, practitioners faced with specific adaptation responsibilities often find such projections difficult to use because they generally require time-oriented information. Earth system projections following specified emissions scenarios can, however, be constrained by applying the level-of-global-warming approach to observationally constrained warming projections to yield more reliable time-oriented projections for adaption planning and implementation. This approach also allows individual groups to produce consistent and comparable assessments of multifaceted climate impacts and causal mechanisms, thereby benefiting climate assessments at national and international levels that provide the science basis for adaptation action.},

However, the neural mechanisms mediating these effects and the role of endogenous central GLP-1 signaling in cocaine seeking remain unknown. Here, we show that voluntary cocaine taking decreased plasma GLP-1 levels in rats and that chemogenetic activation of GLP-1–producing neurons in the nucleus tractus solitarius that project to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) decreased cocaine seeking. Single-nuclei transcriptomics and FISH studies revealed that GLP-1Rs are expressed primarily on GABA neurons in the VTA. Using in vivo fiber photometry, we found that the efficacy of a systemic GLP-1R agonist to attenuate cocaine seeking was associated with increased activity of VTA GABA neurons and decreased activity of VTA dopamine neurons. Together, these findings suggest that targeting central GLP-1 circuits may be an effective strategy toward reducing cocaine relapse and highlight a functional role of GABAergic GLP-1R–expressing midbrain neurons in drug seeking.},

This system facilitates remote perception and replication of taste sensations through the coupling of physically separated sensors and actuators with wireless communication modules. By using chemicals representing five basic tastes, systematic codesign of key functional components yields reliable performance including tunability, versatility, safety, and mechanical robustness.

We also identified BtMEDOR6 as a key whitefly olfactory receptor of β-myrcene involved in the distinct preference of B. tabaci MED for TYLCV-infected plants. TYLCV inhibits the expression of BtMEDOR6, canceling this preference and thereby facilitating TYLCV transmission to uninfected plants. Greenhouse experiments corroborated the role of β-myrcene in whitefly attraction. These findings reveal a sophisticated viral strategy whereby TYLCV modulates both host plant attractiveness and vector olfactory perception to enhance its spread.},

We show that SIC-induced radiation anomalies at the top of the atmosphere are sensitive to the location of SIC reduction in each season, which qualitatively explains how and why the effect of sea ice loss on Earth’s energy budget is determined by its spatial pattern. Idealized experiments indicate that SIC-induced surface warming is greater in the Arctic regions, resulting in a more negative Planck feedback. Global low-level cloud cover responses to Arctic and Antarctic SIC reduction are also distinct, leading to more negative SIC-cloud feedback in Arctic regions. SIC-induced albedo feedback is sensitive to latitude due to inhomogeneous solar radiation at the surface. As a result, the simulated radiative effect of SIC anomalies during 1980–2019 is dominated by variations in the spatial pattern of SIC.},

Without any prior learning, a circuit of synaptic resistors integrating ferroelectric HfZrO materials was demonstrated to navigate a drone toward a target position while avoiding obstacles in a simulated environment, exhibiting significantly superior learning speed, performance, power consumption, and adaptability compared to computer-based artificial neural networks.

Under depolarizing conditions, it accumulates on mitochondria where it becomes activated, phosphorylating both ubiquitin and the ubiquitin E3 ligase Parkin, at Ser 65 . Our experiments reveal that in retinal pigment epithelial cells, only a fraction of PINK1 becomes stabilized after depolarization by electron transport chain inhibitors. Furthermore, the observed accrual of PINK1 cannot be completely accounted for without an accompanying increase in biosynthesis. We have used a ubiquitylation inhibitor TAK-243 to accumulate cleaved PINK1. Under these conditions, generation of unconjugated “free” phospho-ubiquitin serves as a proxy readout for PINK1 activity. This has enabled us to find a preconditioning phenomenon, whereby an initial depolarizing treatment leaves a residual pool of active PINK1 that remains competent to seed the activation of nascent cleaved PINK1 following a 16-hour recovery period.},

Multilevel regression models are used to predict PCPhenoAge acceleration, PCGrimAge acceleration, and DunedinPACE.

In this study, we investigated the fundamentals of applying a solid-state electrolyte (SSE), typically used in battery technologies, as a membrane material for aqueous lithium extraction. We find that the anhydrous hopping of lithium ions through the ordered and confined SSE lattice is highly distinct from ion migration through the hydrated free volumes of conventional nanoporous membranes, thus culminating in unique membrane transport properties. Notably, we reveal that the SSE provides unparalleled performance with respect to ion-ion selectivity, consistently demonstrating lithium ion selectivity values that are immeasurable by even the part-per-billion detection limit of mass spectrometry. Such exceptional selectivity is shown to be the result of the characteristic size and charge exclusion mechanisms of solid-state ion transport, which may be leveraged in the design of next-generation membranes for resource recovery.},

  abstract     = {Nuclear hyperpolarization is a known method to enhance the signal in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) by orders of magnitude. The present work addresses the 13 C hyperpolarization in diamond micro- and nanoparticles, using the optically pumped nitrogen-vacancy center (NV) to polarize 13 C spins at room temperature. Consequences of the small particle size are mitigated by using a combination of surface treatment improving the 13 C relaxation ( T 1 ) time, as well as that of NV, and applying a technique for NV illumination based on a microphotonic structure. Adjustments to the dynamical nuclear polarization sequence (PulsePol) are performed, as well as slow sample rotation, to improve the NV- 13 C polarization transfer rate. The hyperpolarized 13 C NMR signal is observed in particles of 2-micrometer and 100-nanometer median sizes, with enhancements over the thermal signal (at 0.29-tesla magnetic field) of 1500 and 940, respectively. The present demonstration of room-temperature hyperpolarization anticipates the development of agents based on nanoparticles for sensitive magnetic resonance applications.},

  abstract     = {Transcription factor ubiquitination is a decisive regulator of growth and development. The DET1-DDB1-DDA1 (DDD) complex associates with the Cullin-4 ubiquitin ligase (CRL4) and a second ubiquitin ligase, COP1, to control ubiquitination of transcription factors involved in neurological, metabolic, and immune cell development. Here, we report the structure of the human DDD complex, revealing a specific segment of DET1 that can recruit ubiquitin-conjugating (E2) enzymes. Structural variability analysis, mass spectrometry, and mutagenesis based on AlphaFold predictions suggest that dynamic closure of DET1, stabilized by DDA1, underlies coordinated recruitment of E2 enzymes and COP1. Biochemical assays suggest that the E2 acts as a recruitment factor to bring COP1 to DET1 for more effective substrate ubiquitination, which parallels a catalytically inactive E2 enzyme (COP10) in plant DDD complexes. This work provides a clear architecture for regulation and cooperative CRL4 DET1-COP1 complex assembly, which can affect degradation of diverse targets by COP1 complexes.},

However, the roles of mechanically heterogeneous primary tumor microenvironment in metastatic organotropism remain an enigma. This study reports that persistent priming in soft but not stiff niches that mimic primary tumor mechanical heterogeneity induces transcriptional reprogramming reminiscent of neuron and promotes the acquisition of brain metastatic potential. Soft-primed cells generate brain metastases in vivo through enhanced transendothelial migration across blood-brain barrier and brain colonization, which is further supported by the findings that tumor cells residing in local soft niches of primary xenografts exhibit brain metastatic tropism. Mechanistically, soft niches suppress cytoskeleton-nucleus–mediated mechanotransduction, which promotes histone deacetylase 3 activity. Inhibiting histone deacetylase 3 abolishes niche softness-induced brain metastatic ability. Collectively, this study uncovers a previously unappreciated role of local niche softness within primary tumors in brain metastasis, highlighting the significance of primary tumor mechanical heterogeneity in metastatic organotropism.},

The auxin-inducible degron (AID) system is a powerful tool for analyzing inducible protein loss in vitro, but it is toxic to mice. Here, we use an optimized second-generation AID system to achieve the conditional and reversible loss of the essential centrosomal protein CEP192 in live mice. We show that the auxin derivative 5-phenyl-indole-3-acetic acid is well tolerated over 2 weeks and drives near-complete CEP192 degradation in less than 1 hour in vivo. CEP192 loss did not affect centriole duplication but decreased γ-tubulin recruitment to centrosomes impairing mitotic spindle assembly. Sustained CEP192 loss in vivo led to cell division failure and cell death in proliferative tissues. Thus, the second-generation AID system is well suited for rapid and/or sustained protein depletion in live mice to study essential functions in vivo.},

The tumoroids recapitulate genomic and transcriptomic characteristics of the corresponding patient tumors and capture intrapatient tumor heterogeneity. Organoid drug profiling using a library of 153 clinical compounds identified methotrexate as an effective and selective drug against SCCOHTs with a clinically relevant IC 50 of 35 nanomolars.

In this study, we used Gi-based designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (Gi-DREADD) to selectively and temporally modulate microglial Gi signaling pathway. By integrating this chemogenetic approach with in vivo two-photon imaging, we observed that exogenous activation of microglial Gi signaling transiently inhibited microglial process dynamics, reduced neuronal activity, and impaired neuronal synchronization. These altered neuronal functions were associated with a decrease in interactions between microglia and neuron somata. Together, this study demonstrates that acute, exogenous activation of microglial Gi signaling regulates neuronal circuit function, offering a potential pharmacological target for the neuromodulation through microglia.},

Directional dichroism is the nonreciprocal phenomenon of light; the light transmittance varies depending on the direction of light propagation. It arises from interference between electromagnetic fields of light, resulting in the nonreciprocal transmittance determined by the resonance light absorption. For the maximum interference, it shows one-way transparency, and achieving this is an outstanding experimental challenge. Concerning energy dispersion, the resonance generally occurs only at a specific energy with a narrow bandwidth. When the excited state of the magnon spontaneously decays into lower energy states, the absorption linewidth gets broader. Here, using electron spin resonance, we identify the specific absorption mode in a multiferroic material Sr 2 CoSi 2 O 7 with the spontaneous magnon decay accompanied by the maximum interference, achieving the broadband one-way transparency.},

We found that less than half the species’ estimates were in agreement with diel classifications from the reference literature and that species commonly used more than one diel classification. Species diel activity was highly plastic when exposed to anthropogenic change. Furthermore, body size and distributional extent were strongly associated with whether a species is diurnal or nocturnal. Our findings provide essential knowledge of species behavior in an era of rapid global change and suggest the need for a new, quantitative framework that defines diel activity logically and consistently while capturing species plasticity.},

Nevertheless, inherent shortcomings of short half-life, activation of regulatory T (T reg ) cells, and systemic toxicity limit its application. To tackle these, a circular RNA (cRNA)–based IL-2 therapy using immunomodulatory lipid nanoparticles [ursodeoxycholic acid lipid nanoparticles (ULNPs)] and sustained-release hydrogel was developed. Fusing fragment crystallizable (Fc) region into IL-2 and encoding this fusion protein IL-2-Fc (IL-2F) in cRNA (cRNA IL-2F ) greatly extend the half-life. ULNPs containing ursodeoxycholic acid, a transforming growth factor-β1 inhibitor, suppress the function of T reg cells. Consequently, the ULNPs-cRNA IL-2F formulation promotes CD8 + T cells and suppresses T reg cells, increasing the CD8 + /T reg ratio for effective immunotherapy. Furthermore, a locally administrated hydrogel loading with ULNPs-cRNA IL-2F sustains the release, enhancing efficacy and reducing toxicity. This innovative approach achieves remarkable tumor inhibition in both melanoma and orthotopic glioma models with or without surgery, offering a promising future for cancer immunotherapy.},

  abstract     = {Glycosylation chemistry plays a pivotal role in glycoscience. Recent substantial developments have poised the field to address emerging challenges related to sustainability, cost efficiency, and robust applicability in complex substrate settings. The transition from stoichiometric activation to metal-catalyzed methods promises enhanced chemoselectivity and greater precision in controlling glycosidic bond breakage and formation, key to overcoming existing obstacles. Here, we report a nitrene-mediated glycosylation strategy using regular aryl sulfide glycosyl donors and easily accessible 3-methyl dioxazolone as an activator under the catalysis of iron or ruthenium. The iron-catalyzed system demonstrates exceptional catalytic reactivity, requiring as little as 0.1 mole % of catalyst at room temperature, and works well for complex peptide substrates. The ruthenium-catalyzed system can accommodate acid-sensitive functional groups and challenging low-reactivity acceptors. Mechanistic investigations have unveiled unusual multistep pathways involving sulfur imidation of sulfide donors via nitrene transfer and sulfur-to-oxygen rearrangement of N -acyl sulfilimines for the nitrene-mediated activation of sulfide donors.},

  abstract     = {Rising temperatures and water scarcity caused by climate change are increasingly exposing our cells and tissues to ionic stress, a consequence of elevated cytoplasmic ionic strength that can disrupt protein, organelle, and genome function. Here, we unveil a single-protein mechanism for ionic strength sensing and mitigation in animal cells, one that is notably different from the analogous high osmolarity glycerol kinase cascade in yeast. The Rel family transcription factor NFAT5 directly senses intracellular ionic strength using a C-terminal prion-like domain (PLD). In response to elevated intracellular ionic strength, this PLD is necessary and sufficient to coordinate an adaptive gene expression program by recruiting the transcriptional coactivator BRD4. The purified NFAT5 PLD forms condensates in response to elevated solution ionic strength in vitro, and human NFAT5 alone is sufficient to reconstitute a mammalian transcriptional response to ionic stress in yeast. We propose that ion-sensitive conformational changes in a PLD directly regulate transcription to maintain ionic strength homeostasis in animal cells.},

Mto1 deficiency was shown to induce proteostress in embryonic stem cells. A recent finding that a patient with MTO1 gene mutation showed severe anemia led us to hypothesize that Mto1 dysfunctions may result in defective erythropoiesis. Hematopoietic-specific Mto1 conditional knockout (cKO) mice were embryonic lethal and showed niche-independent defect in erythroblast proliferation and terminal differentiation. Mechanistically, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complexes were severely impaired in the Mto1 cKO fetal liver, and this was followed by cytosolic iron accumulation. Overloaded cytosolic iron promoted heme biosynthesis, which induced an unfolded protein response (UPR) in Mto1 cKO erythroblasts. An iron chelator or UPR inhibitor rescued erythroid terminal differentiation in the Mto1 cKO fetal liver in vitro. This mitochondrial regulation of iron homeostasis revealed the indispensable role of mitochondrial tRNA modification in fetal hematopoiesis.},

However, its existence remains under debate despite several experimental reports. In this study, we investigated the infrared transitions of methane embedded in clusters of parahydrogen molecules at 0.4 K using high-resolution helium nanodroplet spectroscopy. Our results revealed fully quantized rotational states of methane with minimal interference from surrounding H 2 molecules, enabling precise determination of the rotational constant for each hydrogen cluster. The cluster-size dependence of the determined rotational constant aligns with behavior predicted by path-integral Monte Carlo simulations, indicating that more than 60% of the hydrogen molecules in the clusters participate in quantum bosonic exchanges, a characteristic feature of superfluidity. This work provides strong experimental evidence for the existence of a superfluid phase of molecular hydrogen at 0.4 K, representing a major step forward in understanding quantum behaviors in molecular systems.},

However, QSDC suffers from large losses and short communication distances, thus being impractical for applications. Here, we have proposed a one-way quasi-QSDC protocol with single photons. This protocol enables the simultaneous transmission of information and key exchange using the same single photons and is robust against loss and error because it uses error correction and spectrum expansion techniques. In a proof-of-principle demonstration using weak coherent pulses, the system achieved a real-time secure transmission rate of 2.38 kilobits per second over a 104.8-kilometer standard telecommunication fiber, which set world records in both aspects. This system paved the way for the practical application of QSDC and offers a unique method to detect eavesdropping online, which is crucial in certain circumstances.},

To test this proposal, we introduced algal particulate matter (APM) to marine sediments underlying a modern marine oxygen minimum zone with bottom-water oxygen concentrations approximating those of the late Neoproterozoic water column. We found that under anoxia, APM significantly stimulated microbial eukaryote gene expression, particularly genes involved in anaerobic energy metabolism and phagocytosis, and increased the relative abundance of 18 S rRNA from known predatory clades. We additionally confirmed that APM promoted the reproduction of benthic foraminifera under anoxia with higher-than-expected net growth efficiencies. Overall, our findings suggest that algal biomass exported to the Neoproterozoic benthos stimulated the ecology of benthic predatory protists under anoxia, thereby creating more modern food webs by enhancing the transfer of fixed carbon and energy to eukaryotes occupying higher trophic levels, including the earliest benthic metazoans.},

They rely on inventories of past landslide locations, which are difficult to collect and often nonrepresentative. Furthermore, susceptibility maps are most needed in regions without the means to assemble an inventory. To overcome these challenges, we develop a method for assessing shallow landslide susceptibility based on a probabilistic morphometric analysis of the landscape’s topography, rather than the characteristics of landslides. The model assumes that hillslopes with higher relief and gradient compared to the surrounding landscape are more prone to landslides. We demonstrate the superior performance of this approach over contrasting data-driven models across the northwestern United States. As our morphometric model only requires elevation data, it overcomes the major limitations of data-driven models and facilitates the creation of effective susceptibility models in areas where it was previously unfeasible.},

These states are associated with destructive behaviors in layered oxide cathodes, including local structural distortion, cationic disordering, and oxygen gas evolution. In this study, we suppress first-cycle voltage hysteresis and irreversible O 2 evolution in Li-rich oxide cathodes through covalency competition induced by the substitution of electropositive groups. We found that the nonequivalent electron distribution within an asymmetric M A -O-M B backbone (metal-to-metal charge transfer via oxygen ligands) increases electron density on electronegative transition metal ions, preventing them from reaching unstable oxidation states within an operating voltage range. This phenomenon is observed across diverse transition metal combinations, providing insights into controlling unnecessary oxygen redox activity. Our findings open new avenues for controlling intrinsic redox chemistry and enabling the rational design of high–energy density Li-rich oxide cathodes.},

However, the mechanisms regulating this conversion remain unclear. In this study, we showed that removal of toxic and bitter SGAs is under the control of DNA demethylation, ethylene, and key transcription factors by forming a feedback loop that governs the expression of key GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM ( GAME ) genes during ripening. Moreover, the ethylene-inducible transcription factors NON-RIPENING, RIPENING INHIBITOR, and FRUITFULL1 coordinately regulate the expression of GAME31 , GAME40 , GAME5 , and the glycoalkaloid transporter gene GORKY , whereas jasmonic acid–induced MYC2 modulates the transcription of GAME36 .

To address this, we used immunopeptidomic analysis and RNA sequencing on five metastatic OC samples, which identified 311 cryptic peptides (40 to 83 per patient). Despite comprising less than 1% of total peptides, cryptic peptides from noncoding transcripts emerged as the predominant antigen class when compared to the other major classes of known tumor-specific and tumor-associated antigens in OC samples. Notably, nearly 70% of the prioritized cryptic peptides elicited T cell activation, as evidenced by increased 4-1BB and IFN-γ expression in autologous CD8 + T cells.

By engineering diagnostic glycosylation sites around test peptide sequences inserted into a host protein, we devised a system that can differentiate between water-soluble, surface-bound, and transmembrane (TM) states of the sequence based on its glycosylation pattern. Using this system, we determined the sequence-dependent propensities for transfer from the translocon to a TM, interfacial, or extramembrane space and compared these propensities with the corresponding probability distributions determined from the sequences and structures of experimentally determined proteins.},

  abstract     = {Implantable medical devices (IMDs) provide effective medical solutions for diverse health care applications. Electrical circuits are crucial for implantable devices due to the requirement of intended functions, such as communication with external devices. Circuits have several risks, such as biocompatibility issues, power limitations, or size constraints. In this work, we propose a passive modulated ultrasound (PMU) principle for IMDs and develop a circuit-free ultrasonic system (CUS) for thoracic pressure monitoring. The PMU principle can passively modulate monitored physiological signals into ultrasound pulses without using electrical circuits or power supply. The size of the developed CUS is only 2.5 millimeters in radius and 850 micrometers in height. Animal experiments demonstrated that the CUS, with a high sensitivity (−22.96 millivolts per kilopascal), can monitor thoracic pressure to assist in diagnosing different heart diseases, including cardiac arrest and myocardial infarction. The PMU provides a human-friendly wireless sensing and communication strategy for IMDs, which promotes advancements in health care applications within the human body.},

Herein, we theoretically propose a form of electromagnetic toroidal vortex solutions that uniquely integrates both scalar and vector characteristics, challenging the prevailing notion of their mutual exclusivity. We also present an experimental generation of hybrid toroidal vortex pulses by a compact coaxial horn emitter augmented with a radial metasurface. These topological pulses exhibit peculiar electromagnetic features, such as vortex streets, skyrmions, and transverse orbital angular momentum, and may present advantages when propagating through perturbations, opening avenues for enhanced free-space information transmission, topologically nontrivial light-matter interaction, and microscopy techniques.},

Among them, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), known for their superior electrical properties, are ideal for ultrathin semiconductor applications. Their unique epitaxial characteristics enable seamless integration with 3D materials, facilitating the development of gate stacks and heterojunction devices. In this regard, developing a process for growing high-quality 3D epitaxial materials before and after the growth of 2D TMDs and understanding the 2D/3D interface are crucial. This study demonstrates the sequential growth of fully epitaxial ZnSe/MoSe 2 /ZnSe heterostructures using metal-organic chemical vapor deposition. ZnSe and MoSe 2 , sharing chalcogen elements, enable large-area quasi van der Waals epitaxy with sharp interfaces without intermediate phase. Multiscale analysis involving transmission electron microscopy and density functional theory calculation reveals lattice commensurability, van der Waals gaps, termination, and interfacial reconstruction.

Typically, the industrially zeolite-catalyzed methanol dehydration to DME occurs at temperatures above 423 kelvin. Improving catalytic reactivity and reducing energy consumption are urgently needed but remain challenging. Here, we report an unexplored associative strategy to realize DME formation at room temperature and the generation of olefins even at 413 kelvin, which is achieved by coinjecting basic acetone to manipulate the local chemical microenvironment of the methanol reactant inside the H-ZSM-5 zeolite. The crucial role of acetone in accelerating methanol direct dehydration to DME is highlighted as the obvious destabilization effect for the adsorbed methanol cluster with strong hydrogen bonds and the subsequent traction of water during DME formation. These findings offer more insights into the rational design of reaction systems by manipulating the local surroundings to regulate catalytic performances and should represent a large step forward in methanol conversion technology.},

In this study, we experimentally demonstrate the generation of pairs of polarization-entangled photons using a plasmonic metasurface strongly coupled to an epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) material. By engineering a resonance at the pump wavelength and leveraging the field enhancement provided by the ENZ effect, the photon pair generation efficiency of the 68-nanometer-thick metasurface is substantially boosted compared to that of an unpatterned indium tin oxide film. More notably, the ENZ metasurface platform facilitates versatile manipulation of the system’s anisotropic second-order nonlinear susceptibility tensor, enabling direct control over the polarization states of the photon pairs and generating a polarization-entangled Bell state without additional components. This approach enables simultaneous photon pair generation and quantum state engineering in a compact platform.},

Leveraging this strategy, we have developed four distinct types of soft actuators: the double twisting weaving actuator (DTWA), the circular four-strand weaving actuator (CFWA), the orthogonal weaving actuator (OWA), and the diagonal weaving actuator (DWA). These weaving fiber soft actuators can be readily assembled in various soft robots, granting multiple functionalities, including surface shape programmability, biomimetic blood pumping inspired by the cardiac muscle, and versatile locomotion modes such as crawling and swimming.

This analysis revealed a restricted pattern of neuronal differentiation defects at discrete subsets of anatomical scales, including a novel role of cadherins in experience-dependent electrical synapse formation.

Herein, we invent a transmissive electro-interference-color device based on two-dimensional titania liquid crystals (2D TiO 2 LCs), demonstrating a record-high electroresponse sensitivity of ~1.5 × 10 −7 square meters per square volt among all wide-bandgap media. Consequently, the device works under an electric field of 6 × 10 3 volts per meter (three orders of magnitude lower than that of conventional LCs), operates in a transmissive mode with ~85% transparency, and displays pure and tunable interference colors.

Thus, in the context of assisted reproduction, oocyte selection based on their mechanical properties has great potential to improve the quality of the resulting embryos and the success rate of these procedures. However, using mechanical properties as a quantifiable selective criterion requires robust and nondestructive measurement tools. This study developed a constriction-based microfluidic device that monitors the deformation of mouse oocytes under controlled pressure. The device can distinguish mechanically aberrant oocyte groups from healthy control ones. On the basis of a mathematical model, we propose that deformability measurements infer both oocyte tension and elasticity, elasticity being the most discriminating factor in our geometry. Despite force transmission during oocyte deformation, no long-term damage was observed. This noninvasive characterization of mouse oocyte deformability in microconstrictions allows for a substantial advance in assessing the mechanical properties of mammalian oocytes and has potential application as a quantifiable selective criterion in medically assisted reproduction.},

We integrated three pigment types into a global ecosystem model: a green-light specialist, a blue-light specialist, and a chromatic acclimator. Laboratory studies defined each type’s specific absorption properties. Our results indicate that chromatic acclimation offers an evolutionary advantage by enabling Synechococcus to adapt to varying light environments. This ability to mimic blue- and green-light specialists and enhance absorption at intermediate states, particularly in areas with high seasonal light variations, increases Synechococcus distribution and biomass. Thus, chromatic acclimation affects ecosystem functioning and biogeochemical processes in the ocean.},

Leveraging the intrinsic tumor-targeting and BBB traversing capability of human H-ferritin, we designed a series of ferritin variants with positively charged cavity and truncated carboxyl terminus, termed tHFn(+). These nanocarriers respond to weak acid and disassemble in endosomal compartments, exposing the internal positive charges to facilitate the lysosomal escape of loaded small interfering RNA (siRNA). Functioning as universal siRNA nanocarriers, tHFn(+) significantly enhanced the uptake of different siRNAs and suppressed gene expressions associated with GBM progression. Furthermore, tHFn(+) traversed the BBB and targeted glioma in vivo by binding to its receptors (e.g., transferrin receptor 1). tHFn(+)-delivered siRNAs exhibited exceptional therapeutic effects against glioma in vivo, advancing RNAi therapeutics beyond GBM for the treatment of various diseases.},

Here, we show a fully biobased hair conditioner based on micellar lignin gels that stabilize emulsions with triglyceride oils. We demonstrate competitive emulsion stability, rheological properties, and performance relative to an off-the-shelf commercial product. Lignin gel emulsion with a 6% weight fraction of coconut oil effectively lubricates damaged hair, confirmed by a 13% reduction in wet combing force and validated through multiscale microscopy analysis. Notably, organic solvent-free production simplifies the ingredient list and offers an environmentally benign route for lignin utilization in hair care.},

Here, we identify various polariton states via electrical bias within a monolayer of n-type MoS 2 . The MoS 2 channel was squeezed within a distributed Bragg reflector microcavity which was combined with a transparent graphene gate-electrode and a hexagonal boron nitride insulator. We observe trion polaritons with distinct lower polariton branch (LPB) and upper polariton branch (UPB). This allows us to modulate the intensity and energy switchings via gate bias: At gate bias below threshold voltage, both polaritons are decoupled, and above threshold voltage, they are coupled to form LPB-UPB pair, and at high bias, complex polaritons (CPB) emerge due to polariton screening, a phenomenon consistent with Rabi splitting. Further, we observe a peculiar nonlinearity at intermediate power regime.},

Here, we reveal the meiosis-specific Skp1–Cul1–F-box-protein (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase SCF RMF as a key regulator of this reorganization in Arabidopsis . We find that the nuclear lamina proteins of the CRWN family are degraded in an SCF RMF -dependent manner in this process.

Furthermore, we establish that human TLCD protein CLN8, mutations of which cause fatal neurodegenerative Batten disease, is a lysophosphatidylglycerol acyltransferase.

We study this serpentinization-related H 2 generation during rifting and subsequent rift-inversion orogen development using numerical geodynamic models. Serpentinization-related H 2 generation is best known from rifted margins and spreading ridges. However, because orogens are colder than rift environments, conditions for serpentinization and natural H 2 generation are considerably better in orogenic settings: We find that yearly H 2 generation capacity from serpentinization in the overriding mantle wedge during rift inversion may be up to 20 times larger than during rifting. Moreover, suitable reservoirs and seals required for economic H 2 accumulations to form are readily available in rift-inversion orogens but are likely absent during bulk serpentinization in rift settings. Together with indications of ongoing natural H 2 generation in the Balkans and Pyrenees, our model results provide a first-order motivation for natural H 2 exploration in rift-inversion orogens.},

The reaction produces TPE-OH, which, in turn, increases reactive oxygen species levels within the senescent cells, leading to noninflammatory apoptosis of senescent cells. This targeted clearance mechanism helps to alleviate osteoporosis symptoms and promotes bone injury healing. Moreover, apoptotic vesicles, which are generated during the process, are partly phagocytosed by macrophages, mimicking physiological metabolic processes. This study opens new avenues for addressing bone health issues through the designed bioclearance of senescent cells, aligning with the body’s natural pathways for maintaining homeostasis.},

Disrupting histone recycling to either the leading or lagging strand induces asymmetric histone inheritance, affecting epigenome maintenance and cellular identity. However, the order and kinetics of these effects remain elusive. Here, we use inducible mutants to dissect the early and late consequences of impaired histone recycling. Simultaneous disruption of both leading (POLE4) and lagging strand (MCM2-2A) recycling pathways impairs the transmission of parental histones to newly synthesized DNA, releasing some parental histones to the soluble pool. Subsequently, H3K27me3 accumulates aberrantly during chromatin restoration in a manner preceding gene expression changes. Loss of histone inheritance and the ensuing chromatin restoration defects alter gene expression in embryonic stem cells and challenge differentiation programs and cell viability. Our findings demonstrate the importance of efficient transmission of histone-based information during DNA replication for maintaining chromatin landscapes, differentiation potential, and cellular viability.},

These activated APCs effectively initiate the TLS de novo neogenesis by acting as lymphoid tissue inducer cells that secrete lymphotoxin α and tumor necrosis factor α while normalizing the intratumoral vasculatures. In addition, they induce robust in situ adaptive immune responses by presenting the antigens released from the M1 cell–destroyed tumors and transporting them to the nearby TLS. Therefore, the development of tumors in mice, especially immune-cold tumors, was efficiently prevented, providing a promising strategy for promoting cancer immunotherapy.},

One well-explored example is nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, where experimental development is grounded in decades-old theory, but structural dynamics are not easily integrated into this picture. Here, we introduce an approach that selectively excites NMR resonances that undergo chemical exchange while suppressing the signal arising from nondynamic components of the system. We show that for exchange rates spanning more than four orders of magnitude, one can still selectively excite spins undergoing exchange while suppressing static resonances. Generalizing this approach, to selectively excite (or selectively preserve) only members of an ensemble that have undergone exchange or rearrangement, has the potential to improve the analytical power of many spectroscopic techniques.},

Furthermore, we observe that atlantification is extending far beyond the Lomonosov Ridge into the Makarov Basin of the Arctic Ocean where upper ocean ventilation creates a new and unique ecological environment. The eastern part of the Siberian Arctic Ocean is still strongly stratified, but the atlantification-driven shoaling of warm, salty, and nutrient-rich intermediate waters already has important ecological consequences there.

Consequently, establishing the appropriate microglial numbers during development is crucial for ensuring normal cortical function. Here, we uncovered a dynamic relationship between pyramidal cells and microglia that tunes microglial numbers and development through distinct phases of mouse postnatal development. Changes in pyramidal cell activity during development induce differential release of activity-dependent proteins such as Activin A, which, in turn, adjusts microglial numbers accordingly. Decoupling of this relationship not only changes microglial numbers but has a long-term consequence on their role as synaptic organizers, which ultimately affects cortical function. Our findings reveal that microglia adapt their numbers to changes in pyramidal cell activity during a critical time window in development, consequently adjusting their numbers and function to the demands of the developing local circuits.},

However, the mechanisms enabling heterotrophic diazotrophs to thrive in cold high-latitude waters and their contribution to the global nitrogen budget are unknown. Using a data-driven cell-based metabolic model, we show that heterotrophic bacteria inside sinking particles can fix N 2 over a wide range of temperatures, explaining their ubiquitous presence in the oceans. We estimate that heterotrophic diazotrophs account for about 10% of global marine N 2 fixation, with the highest contribution in oxygen minimum zones.

  abstract     = {Internal tides profoundly influence diapycnal mixing and marine ecosystems in oceans worldwide. Previous estimates on internal tides focused regionally spanning a decade, leaving a knowledge gap regarding their long-term global behavior, especially over centuries. Because of limited long-term observations, a critical question arises: How will global warming affect internal tides? Using the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) and the High-Resolution Empirical Tidal (HRET) model, we identify a robust accelerating trend in globally averaged internal tide speeds. This trend, increasing from historical rates (0.4 centimeters per second per decade) to future projections (2.0 centimeters per second per decade), is primarily driven by intensified upper-ocean stratification, with background currents playing a secondary role. Our findings suggest that internal tides propagate faster in a warming climate, potentially influencing energy cascade and marine biological productivity.},

  abstract     = {Intense rain can trigger flashfloods in Arabia. Torrential rains in 2024 sowed widespread chaos in the region. Sediment-loaded plumes discharged by flashfloods deposit onto the seabed. Burrowing animals disrupt these flood layers, erasing the paleorainfall record. Fortuitously, we discovered an anoxic deep-sea brine pool sited close enough to shore to chronicle floods, yet be otherwise undisturbed by animals. Cores retrieved from the pool delivered a 1600-year rainfall record. We merge these core-layer histories with modern rainfall statistics, satellite observations, and simulations to deliver a high-resolution quantitative Late Holocene hydroclimate record for Arabia. We find that the modern era is 2.5 times drier than the last 1.6 thousand years. The Little Ice Age stands out as particularly wet. That period experienced a fivefold increase in rainfall intensity compared to today. Though hyperarid now, the flood layers demonstrate that climate shifts can generate weather conditions unwitnessed in the modern era. Such long-range insight is crucial for framing uncertainties surrounding future hydroclimate forecasts.},

  abstract     = {Cytosolic aggregation of the RNA binding protein TDP-43 (transactive response DNA-binding protein 43) is a hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. Here, we report that during oxidative stress, TDP-43 becomes SUMO2/3-ylated by the SUMO E3 ligase protein PIAS4 (protein inhibitor of activated STAT 4) and enriches in cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs). Upon pharmacological inhibition of TDP-43 SUMO2/3-ylation or PIAS4 depletion, TDP-43 enrichment in SGs is accompanied by irreversible aggregation. In cells that are unable to assemble SGs, SUMO2/3-ylation of TDP-43 is strongly impaired, supporting the notion that SGs are compartments that promote TDP-43 SUMO2/3-ylation during oxidative stress. Binding of TDP-43 to UG-rich RNA antagonizes PIAS4-mediated SUMO2/3-ylation, while RNA dissociation promotes TDP-43 SUMO2/3-ylation. We conclude that SUMO2/3 protein conjugation is a cellular mechanism to stabilize cytosolic RNA-free TDP-43 against aggregation.},

However, in the wound-induced hair neogenesis (WIHN) model of skin regeneration, wounds regenerate hair follicles if tissue rigidity is optimal. Although WIHN depends on Wnt signaling, whether Wnt performs a mechanoregulatory role that contributes to regeneration remains uncharacterized. Here, we demonstrate that Wnt signaling affects mechanosensitivity at both cellular and tissue levels to drive WIHN. Atomic force microscopy revealed an attenuated substrate rigidity response in epidermal but not dermal cells of healing wounds. Super-resolution microscopy and nanoneedle probing of intracellular compartments in live human keratinocytes revealed that Wnt-induced chromatin remodeling triggers a 10-fold drop in nuclear rigidity without jeopardizing the nucleocytoskeletal mechanical coupling. Mechanistically, Wnt signaling orchestrated a massive reorganization of actin architecture and recruited adherens junctions to generate a mechanical syncytium—a cohesive contractile unit with superior capacity for force coordination and collective durotaxis. Collectively, our findings unveil Wnt signaling’s mechanoregulatory role that manipulates the machinery of mechanotransduction to drive regeneration.},

However, it is not clear whether prebiotic P uptake in such settings would then have been sustainable. We show that large closed-basin lakes can combine high P concentrations at steady state with extremely high rates of biological productivity. Our case study is Mono Lake in California, which has close to 1 millimolar dissolved P at steady state despite extremely high rates of biological productivity, in contrast to smaller closed basins where life is scarce. Hence, large closed-basin lakes offer an environment where high rates of prebiotic P productivity can plausibly coexist with high steady-state P concentrations. Such lakes should have readily formed on the heavily cratered and volcanically active surface of early Earth.},

However, the exact time course and regional distribution of reinstatement and transformation during recognition memory have remained unclear. We applied representational similarity analysis to human intracranial electroencephalography to track the spatiotemporal dynamics underlying the reinstatement and transformation of memory traces. Specifically, we examined how reinstatement and transformation of item-specific representations across occipital, ventral visual, and lateral parietal cortices contribute to successful memory formation and recognition. Our findings suggest that reinstatement in temporal cortex and transformation in parietal cortex coexist and provide complementary strategies for recognition. Further, we find that generalization and differentiation of neural representations contribute to memory and probe memory-specific correspondence with deep neural network (DNN) model features. Our results suggest that memory formation is particularly supported by generalized and mnemonic representational formats beyond the visual features of a DNN.},

Yet, wildfires rely on the availability of ignition and fuel, which are underrepresented in fire forecast and prediction practices. By analyzing satellite measurements and atmospheric reanalysis, here we show that near-surface weather only partially captures wildfire occurrence and intensity across the daily to seasonal timescales. Beyond near-surface weather, convection and fuel abundance play a complementary role in regulating burning processes. Specifically, enhanced atmospheric convection is identified for over 40% of the low-human-impact regions and 61% of global burnable areas during wildfire ignition and spreading periods. Meanwhile, 56% of shrublands and 54% of grasslands see higher fuel load with actual occurrence of fire. Our results highlight the role of convection and fuel in wildfire forecast, prompting a revisit of wildfire prediction under intertwined atmospheric and terrestrial changes.},

However, the function and mechanism of posttranscriptional chemical modifications, especially the newly identified N 4 -acetylcytidine (ac 4 C) modification catalyzed by N -acetyltransferase 10 (NAT10), are unknown. In this study, we developed a low-input ac 4 C sequencing technology, ac 4 C LACE-seq, and mapped 8241 ac 4 C peaks at the whole-transcriptome level using 50 mouse oocytes at the germinal vesicle stage. Oocyte-specific Nat10 knockout wiped out ac 4 C signals in oocytes and caused severe defects in meiotic maturation and female infertility. Mechanically, Nat10 deletion led to a failure of ac 4 C deposition on mRNAs encoding key maternal factors, which regulate transcriptome stability and maternal-to-zygotic transition. Nat10 -deleted oocytes showed decreased mRNA translation efficiency due to the direct inhibition of ac 4 C sites on specific transcripts during meiotic maturation. In summary, we developed a low-input, high-sensitivity mRNA ac 4 C profiling approach and highlighted the important physiological function of ac 4 C in the precise regulation of oocyte meiotic maturation by enhancing translation efficiency.},

TLISA uses a split T7 RNA polymerase fused to affinity domains against a protein. The target antigen drives polymerase reassembly, inducing reporter expression. We characterize the platform and then demonstrate its modularity by using 16 affinity domains against four different antigens with minimal protocol optimization. We show that TLISA is suitable for POC use by sensing human biomarkers in serum and saliva with a colorimetric readout within 1 hour and by demonstrating functionality after lyophilization. Altogether, this technology has the potential to enable truly rapid, reconfigurable, modular, and equipment-free detection of diverse classes of proteins.},

We show that this rule, capitalizing on high-dimensional neural activity with restricted transitions, naturally stores episodes as paths through complex state spaces like those underlying a world model. The resulting memory traces, which we term path vectors, are highly expressive and decodable with an odor-tracking algorithm. We show that path vectors are robust alternatives to Hebbian traces, support one-shot sequential and associative recall, along with policy learning, and shed light on specific hippocampal plasticity rules. Thus, non-Hebbian plasticity is sufficient for flexible memory and learning and well-suited to encode episodes and policies as paths through a world model.},

Using a multiplexed CRISPR knockout screen in colorectal cancer cells, we show that the loss of several altered ncUCEs significantly affects cell proliferation. In-depth functional studies in vitro and in vivo further reveal that specific ncUCEs can be enhancers of tumor suppressors (such as ARID1B) and silencers of oncogenic proteins (such as RPS13). Moreover, several miRNAs located in ncUCEs are recurrently mutated. Mutations in miR-142 locus can affect the Drosha-mediated processing of precursor miRNAs, resulting in the down-regulation of the mature transcript.

Our analysis revealed the CD43+CD71+IgG+ activated B cell subset, highly enriched for SARS-CoV-2 specificities, as a juncture for ASC and MBC differentiation, with CD86+ phenotypically similar to ASCs and CD86− to IgG+ MBCs. Moreover, subpopulations within IgG+ MBCs were further identified based on CD73 and CD24 expression. Activated MBCs (CD73−/CD24lo) were predominantly SARS-CoV-2-specific, while resting MBCs (CD73+/CD24hi) recognized prepandemic antigens. A CD95− subcluster within resting MBCs accounted for over 40% of prepandemic-specific cells, indicating long-lasting memory. These findings advance our understanding of IgG+ MBC and ASC development stages, shedding light on the decision-making process guiding their differentiation.},

For pediatric IBD (PIBD) patients, wireless, biodegradable miniaturized bioelectronic devices are crucial to prevent neural damage and support neural development during and after therapy. Here we demonstrate a battery-free, miniaturized neurostimulator based on biodegradable materials and capacitive-coupling wireless power transfer. The biodegradable capacitive-coupling (BCC) neurostimulator consists of molybdenum (Mo) electronic components and self-healing biodegradable polyurethane elastomer (SBPUE) encapsulations. The self-healing property of SBPUE enables a stable neural interface. Capacitive coupling wirelessly transfers high-frequency electric fields through a single capacitor between wearable transmitters and implanted BCC neurostimulators. Programmed electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve alleviates PIBD symptoms by restoring CD4 + T cell balance, enhancing anti-inflammatory effects and suppressing pro-inflammatory effects in the intestines.},

  abstract     = {Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are some of the most prescribed drugs in the world. While they are used for their ability to increase serotonergic signaling in the brain, SSRIs are also known to have a broad range of effects beyond the brain, including immune and metabolic effects. Recent studies have demonstrated that SSRIs are protective in animal models and humans against several infections, including sepsis and COVID-19; however, the mechanisms underlying this protection are largely unknown. Here, we mechanistically link two previously described effects of the SSRI fluoxetine in mediating protection against sepsis. We show that fluoxetine-mediated protection is independent of peripheral serotonin and instead increases levels of circulating interleukin-10 (IL-10). IL-10 is necessary for protection from sepsis-induced hypertriglyceridemia, preventing cardiac effects including impairment of glucose oxidation, ectopic lipid accumulation, ventricular stretch and possibly cardiac failure. Our work reveals a beneficial “off-target” effect of fluoxetine, and reveals a protective immunometabolic defense mechanism with therapeutic potential.},

Mechanical force and auxiliary binding partners converge to stabilize the cadherin-catenin complex’s inherently weak binding to actin filaments (F-actin) through unclear mechanisms. Here, we show that afadin’s coiled-coil (CC) domain and vinculin synergistically enhance the cadherin-catenin complex’s F-actin engagement. The cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of an E-cadherin–β-catenin–αE-catenin–vinculin–afadin-CC supra-complex bound to F-actin reveals that afadin-CC bridges adjacent αE-catenin actin-binding domains along the filament, stabilizing flexible αE-catenin segments implicated in mechanical regulation. These cooperative binding contacts promote the formation of supra-complex clusters along F-actin. Additionally, cryo-EM variability analysis links supra-complex binding along individual F-actin strands to nanoscale filament curvature, a deformation mode associated with cytoskeletal forces. Collectively, this work elucidates a mechanistic framework by which vinculin and afadin tune cadherin-catenin complex–cytoskeleton coupling to support AJ function across varying mechanical regimes.},

However, current nanosystems inducing cuproptosis rely on exogenous toxic copper ions, limiting the scope of biomaterials. Developing nanoplatforms that induce cuproptosis without exogenous copper holds substantial promise. Here, we engineered a two-dimensional iron (Fe) single-atom–doped molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) piezocatalyst (Fe-MoS 2 ) for tumor therapy. Incorporating single Fe atoms enhances MoS 2 piezoelectric polarization via charge redistribution and modulates Fe and Mo oxidation states, enabling multifaceted enzymatic activities, including peroxidase-, glutathione oxidase–, oxidase-, and catalase-like activities. Upon ultrasound stimulation, the Fe-MoS 2 nanocatalyst generates reactive oxygen species and depletes glutathione via synergistic piezocatalytic and enzyocatalytic effects, disrupting copper ion homeostasis and inducing cuproptosis, concurrently triggering ferroptosis and ferritinophagy, which collectively enhances tumor suppression. This study represents the first paradigm to introduce a copper-free piezocatalyst for initiating cuproptosis, substantially advancing the applications of cuproptosis in tumor therapy.},

Here, we conceive and demonstrate shortcut to adiabatic (STA) braiding of light in three-dimensional silicon photonic chips. Our device comprises trilayer silicon waveguides embedded in the SU-8 polymer, using an STA strategy to expedite the braiding operations, resulting in compact devices that function as photonic quantum X, Y, and Z gates. We further experimentally observed non-Abelian braiding behaviors based on this STA-braiding scheme. Our work represents a compact braiding apparatus with a size reduction of nearly three orders of magnitude compared to previous works.

To date, model limitations have prevented quantifying climate-lightning-wildfire interactions comprehensively. We exploit advances in Earth System modeling to examine these three-way interactions and their sensitivities to idealized CO 2 forcing in 140-year simulations. Lightning sensitivity to global temperature change (+1.6 ± 0.1% per kelvin) is mitigated by compensating atmospheric effects. Global burned area sensitivity to temperature (+13.8 ± 0.3% per kelvin) is largely driven by intensified fire weather and increased biomass but marginally by lightning changes. We find a universal law characterizing regional-scale modeled fire activity and its CO 2 sensitivity, consistent with basic principles of statistical mechanics. Last, a negative climate feedback through intensified aerosol direct effect from fire emissions reaches an equivalent decrease of 0.91 ± 0.01% in CO 2 radiative forcing. However, this feedback contributes to polar amplification. Our analysis shows that climate-lightning-wildfire interactions involve multiple compensating and amplifying feedbacks, which are sensitive to anthropogenic CO 2 forcing.},

A tissue-engineered epithelialized CRP (E-CRP) was further developed to enhance in situ reepithelialization. The CRP demonstrated reliable structural stability and facilitated effective tissue regeneration and functional reconstruction of TF defects in a large animal model. Furthermore, the customized CRPs might be preloaded into a bronchoscope and precisely delivered to TF defects via noninvasive implantation. Consequently, the proposed CRP/E-CRP represents a promising scaffold for TF treatment, with substantial transformative potential in clinical practice.},

  abstract     = {Continuous biosensing provides real-time information about biochemical processes and holds great potential for health monitoring. Aptamers have emerged as promising alternatives over traditional biorecognition elements. However, the underlying aptamer-target binding interactions are often poorly understood. Here, we present a technique that can decode aptamer-protein binding interactions at the single-molecule level. We demonstrate that our single-molecule assay is able to decode the underlying binding kinetics of aptamers despite their similar binding affinity. Guided by computational simulations and validated with quartz crystal microbalance experiments, we show that the quantitative insights generated by this single-molecule technique enabled the rational understanding of biosensor performance (i.e., the sensitivity and limit of detection). This capability was demonstrated with thrombin as the analyte and the structurally similar aptamers HD1, RE31, and NU172 as the biorecognition elements. This work decodes aptamer-protein interactions with high temporal resolution, paving the way for the rational design of aptamer-based biosensors.},

Photoferroelectric semiconductors exhibit immense potential in capturing multimodal nonvolatile states, attributed to their spontaneous and reversible in-plane and out-of-plane polarizations. Herein, we uncover an unprecedented nonvolatile, zero-bias, ultrafast photocurrent hysteresis response with an innovative all-optical approach, discerned by analyzing in-plane and out-of-plane terahertz (THz) waves emitted from photoferroelectric α-In 2 Se 3 . The mechanism underlying such ultrafast photocurrent hysteresis arises from anomalous linear and circular photovoltaic effects synchronously fueled by a localized rearrangement of polarization. By harnessing the anisotropic photoferroelectric kinetics–induced relative phase between the in-plane and out-of-plane polarizations, we further demonstrate the flexible selection of chirality, tunable rotational angle, and optimizable ellipticity of THz waves. Our findings present a unique ultrafast and nondestructive strategy for investigating photoferroelectric hysteresis, empowering dynamic polarization manipulation of THz waves for a wide range of THz applications.},

We implemented a stable external field for each Ising spin as an interaction between a DOPO pulse and a group of ferromagnetically coupled auxiliary pulses. Consequently, the CIM delivered independent sets for dense graphs with up to 40,000 nodes. We compared the performance of the CIM with that of optimized simulated annealing algorithm implemented on a digital computer and found that the CIM outperformed the central processing unit (CPU) in terms of the time needed to obtain good approximate solutions when the graph size exceeded several thousand nodes.},

This model similarly predicts that technological life analogous to human life on Earth is “exceedingly rare” in the Universe. Here, we critically reevaluate core assumptions of the hard-steps model through the lens of historical geobiology. Specifically, we propose an alternative model where there are no hard steps, and evolutionary singularities required for human origins can be explained via mechanisms outside of intrinsic improbability. Furthermore, if Earth’s surface environment was initially inhospitable not only to human life, but also to certain key intermediate steps required for human existence, then the timing of human origins was controlled by the sequential opening of new global environmental windows of habitability over Earth history.},

Among them, OAT1 plays a pivotal role in the pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions of a wide range of prescription medications. Despite extensive structural investigations, the molecular structure, and basis of polyspecific anionic drug recognition of human OAT1 (hOAT1) have remained elusive. Here, we present cryogenic electron microscopy structures of hOAT1 and its complexes with the antiviral drug cidofovir and an FDA-approved type II diabetes medication glibenclamide, respectively. Our findings reveal that both cidofovir and glibenclamide bind to a central binding site, capturing the transporter in inward-facing conformations. These structures elucidate how specific residues within the central site orchestrate the binding of chemically diverse inhibitors and provide a structural basis for the drug recognition mechanism of hOAT1.},

We found a bacilysin transmembrane transporter ( Tg MFS4) in Tg , critical during cross-kingdom dialogue with B v. Deleting Tgmfs4 (Δ Tgmfs4 ) mitigated Bv - Tg antagonism, reduced bacilysin import into Tg , and elevated its level in the coculture environment.

In addition, the Tg -WT+ Bv consortium up-regulated antimycotic secretion pathways, whereas the Δ Tgmfs4 + Bv consortium enriched the CAZyme (carbohydrate-active enzyme) family gene expression in the rhizosphere, potentiating plant immune responses.

Our findings indicated increased plant tolerance when neighboring plants were present, suggesting bidirectional plant communication. Furthermore, we established a model to explore the role of signals from receiver plants, identifying squalene as a crucial feedback signal enhancing the cold tolerance in emitter plants by up-regulating CsCBF5 expression. Further analysis using yeast one-hybrid analysis coupled with inhibition of brassinosteroid pathways suggested that squalene-induced castasterone (CS) accumulation directly activated CsCBF5 expression modulated by CsBES1/BZR1 .

The EB disruption is accompanied by the alternations in permeability and even the breakdown of tight junctions (TJs), leading to the leakage of albumin; thus, albumin can serve as a biomarker for EB disruption. Herein, we develop an albumin-specific, covalently tagged near-infrared II (NIR-II) dye, with its high selectivity for endogenous albumin, for targeted imaging EB disruption. Our albumin-tagging dye serves as a chromophore to construct NIR-II fluorescent proteins in situ, with substantially improved brightness. Thus, through in situ dye tagging of endogenous albumin as the efficient “targeting agent,” we can precisely image disruptions in various endothelial barriers. Unlike the traditional exogenous targeting agents (e.g., dye-labeled antibodies) with enzymatic degradation or immune system capture issues, in situ albumin tagging demonstrates superhigh performance for targeted imaging.},

We found that expression of MAGE-A4 was highly associated with the loss of PTEN , a tumor suppressor, in human non–small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). Here, we show that constitutive expression of human MAGE-A4 with Pten loss in mouse airway epithelia results in metastatic adenocarcinoma. Tumors showed distinct enrichment in IgA + CD138 + CXCR4 + plasma cells (PCs) and increased expression of CXCL12 in endothelial cells. Consistently, human NSCLC expressing MAGE-A4 showed increased CD138 + IgA + PCs surrounding tumors. Abrogation of PCs decreased tumor burden, increased activated T cell infiltration, and reduced CD163 + CD206 + macrophages in the MAGE-A4–induced lung tumors. These findings suggest MAGE-A4 promotes NSCLC tumorigenesis, in part, through the recruitment and retention of IgA + PCs in the lungs.},

Microtubule reorganization supports plant survival in saline-rich soils, but the underlying molecular mechanism in tree species remains unclear.

This mechanism involves regulation of microtubule dynamics by the microtubule-associated protein PLASMA MEMBRANE–ASSOCIATED CATION BINDING PROTEIN 1a (PagPCaP1a). Salinity stress induced PagPCaP1a expression and phase separation of PagPCaP1a protein to form PagPCaP1a condensates in a calcium-dependent manner. The formation of PagPCaP1a condensates was partially driven by the VEEEKK motif within the carboxyl terminus of the protein, which rapidly depolymerizes microtubules under salinity stress. Our study reveals that the liquid-liquid phase separation of PagPCaP1a represents an additional regulatory layer for microtubule depolymerization, and we propose an effective strategy to manipulate the phase separation of PagPCaP1a to improve plant stress tolerance.},

Diabetes-associated immune cell dysfunction plays a minor role in the emergence of resistance, while hyperglycemia plays a dominant role facilitating the expansion and takeover of resistant mutants in diabetic infections. Furthermore, vancomycin intermediate resistant isolates display a pronounced fitness defect in nondiabetic mice but not in diabetic mice. Together, these data suggest that the diabetic infection environment represents an ideal reservoir for the emergence and proliferation of antibiotic resistance.

In this study, we used scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) combined with a nickelocene molecule to sense the spin of a hydrogen-loaded nanoscale Co island grown on Cu(111). Magnetic exchange maps obtained from the molecular tip revealed the presence of a hydrogen superstructure and a 90° rotation of the magnetization compared to the pristine island. Ab initio calculations corroborate these observations, indicating that hydrogen hybridization with Co atoms on the island surface drives the spin reorientation of the island. This reorientation is further reinforced by hydrogen penetration into the island that locates at the Co/Cu interface. However, the subsurface sensitivity of the magnetic exchange maps indicates that this effect is limited.

  abstract     = {Chemical separations are costly in terms of energy, time, and money. Separation methods are optimized with inefficient trial-and-error approaches that lack insight into the molecular dynamics that lead to the success or failure of a separation and, hence, ways to improve the process. We perform super-resolution imaging of fluorescent analytes in five different commercial liquid chromatography materials. Unexpectedly, we observe that chemical functionalization can block more than 50% of the material’s porous interior, rendering it inaccessible to small-molecule analytes. Only in situ imaging unveils the inaccessibility when compared to the industry-accepted ex situ characterization methods. Selectively removing some of the functionalization with solvent restores pore access without substantially altering the single-molecule kinetics that underlie the separation and agree with bulk chromatography measurements. Our molecular results determine that commercial “fully porous” stationary phases are over-functionalized and provide an alternative avenue to characterize and direct separation material design from the bottom-up.},

However, their practical use is limited by the inability to deliver high forces at low voltages, primarily due to a lack of understanding of their mechanics. We introduce a novel deformable body fracture mechanics approach and high-resolution strain field imaging to reveal that nonuniform stress distributions cause EA clutches to fail through delamination and crack propagation. Using this insight, we developed EA clutches sustaining 22 newtons over 1 square centimeter at 100 volts, achieving the highest stress per voltage among similar clutches. This was achieved by incorporating a soft interlayer and peeling stopper for uniform stress distribution and mitigating the failure modes. These EA clutches were integrated into a lightweight ring-based wearable system for finger rehabilitation and haptics. Our findings lay the groundwork for designing low-voltage, high-performance EA clutches for next-generation motion and force control applications.},

  abstract     = {Defects in cell wall integrity (CWI) profoundly affect plant growth, although, underlying mechanisms are not well understood. We show that in Arabidopsis mur1 mutant, CWI defects from compromising dimerization of RG-II pectin, a key component of cell wall, attenuate the expression of auxin response factors ARF7-ARF19 . As a result, polar auxin transport components are misexpressed, disrupting auxin response asymmetry, leading to defective apical hook development. Accordingly, mur1 hook defects are suppressed by enhancing ARF7 expression. In addition, expression of brassinosteroid biosynthesis genes is down-regulated in mur1 mutant, and supplementing brassinosteroid or enhancing brassinosteroid signaling suppresses mur1 hook defects. Intriguingly, brassinosteroid enhances RG-II dimerization, showing hormonal feedback to the cell wall. Our results thus reveal a previously unrecognized link between cell wall defects from reduced RG-II dimerization and growth regulation mediated via modulation of auxin-brassinosteroid pathways in early seedling development.},

Recently demonstrated using phonon polaritons in twisted van der Waals (vdW) layers of α-MoO 3 , it offers unprecedented possibilities for controlling light-matter interactions at the nanoscale. However, practical applications have been hindered by the complex sample fabrication of twisted stacks. In this work, we introduce a previously unexplored canalization phenomenon in a single-thin vdW layer (α-MoO 3 ) interfaced with a substrate exhibiting a given negative permittivity. This enables a proof-of-concept application of polariton canalization: super-resolution nanoimaging (~λ 0 /220). Canalization-based imaging transcends conventional projection constraints, allowing the super-resolution images to be obtained at any desired location in the image plane. This versatility stems from the synergetic manipulation of three key parameters: incident frequency, rotation angle of the thin vdW layer, and thickness. Our results provide insights into the properties of canalization and constitute a seminal step toward multifaceted photonic applications, including imaging, data transmission, and ultracompact photonic integration.},

Here, we uncover the dominant role of electron correlations in the dynamics of the giant plasmon resonance (GPR) of the subnanometer system C 60 by using attosecond photoemission chronoscopy. We find a characteristic photoemission delay of up to about 300 attoseconds that is purely induced by coherent large-scale electron correlations in the plasmonic potential.

Retromer (VPS26/VPS35/VPS29) binds multiple sorting nexin (SNX) proteins on endosomal membranes, but assembly mechanisms of metazoan SNX/Retromer complexes remain elusive. We combine biochemical and biophysical approaches with AlphaFold modeling to identify a previously unidentified direct interaction between SNX27 and VARP. A full biochemical reconstitution system using purified proteins systematically tests how and when coats are recruited to membranes to generate tubules. We demonstrate and measure how specific combinations of Retromer with SNX27, ESCPE-1 (SNX2/SNX6), or both complexes, remodel membranes containing physiological cargo and phospholipids. SNX27, alone and with Retromer, remodels membranes with PI(3)P and PDZbm cargo. ESCPE-1 deforms membranes with bis-phosphoinositides and CI-MPR cargo but surprisingly does not recruit Retromer. VARP co-immunoprecipitates all coat components in cells and is required to reconstitute a proposed endosomal “supercomplex” (SNX27, ESCPE-1, and Retromer) in vitro. These data suggest VARP regulates metazoan endosomal coat assembly to promote cargo sorting out of endosomes.},

In this study, we established a streamlined and diverse toolbox for methods that predict amino acid probabilities inside the Rosetta software framework that allows for the side-by-side comparison of these models. Subsequently, existing protein fitness landscapes were used to benchmark novel ML methods in realistic protein design settings. We focused on the traditional problems of protein design: sampling and scoring. A major finding of our study is that ML approaches are better at purging the sampling space from deleterious mutations. Nevertheless, scoring resulting mutations without model fine-tuning showed no clear improvement over scoring with Rosetta. We conclude that ML now complements, rather than replaces, biophysical methods in protein design.},

Our approach facilitates rapid approximate solutions with a scalable circuit topology and expedites the high-precision refinement process by substantially reducing the digital-to-analog conversion overhead. We experimentally validated this methodology using a heterogeneous computing system. We performed simulations of multiple scientific problems on these circuits, including solving the diffusion equation and modeling equilibration in silicon P-N junctions. Notably, our memristive solver, combined with digital refinement, achieved software-equivalent precision (with an error of 10 −12 ). Compared to conventional digital processing units, this approach offered a 128-fold improvement in solution speed and a 160-fold reduction in energy consumption.

However, this mutation type has not been studied in other cancer genes. Here, we explore somatic nonstop mutations in the tumor suppressor genes BRCA1 Associated Protein 1 ( BAP1 ) and Von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL ) enriched in renal cell carcinoma. For BAP1 , nonstop mutations generate an extremely long extension. Instead of proteasomal degradation, the extension decreases translation and depletes BAP1 messenger RNA from heavy polysomes. For VHL , the short extension leads to proteasomal degradation. Unexpectedly, the mutation alters the selection of the translational start site shifting VHL isoforms. We identify germline VHL nonstop mutations in patients leading to the early onset of severe disease manifestations. In summary, nonstop extension mutations inhibit the expression of renal tumor suppressor genes with pleiotropic effects on translation and protein stability.},

We showed that this platform profoundly restored SERCA activity, augmented cardiac function, and ameliorated adverse heart remodeling.

Functional assays, including activation-induced intracellular cytokine staining and enzyme-linked immunospot for interferon-γ, revealed diverse mechanisms of HIV-1 adaptation to HLA-II–associated immune pressure, ranging from loss to sustained antigen recognition. T cell receptor and RNA sequencing demonstrated variable clonotype overlap of T cell clones to recognize adapted versus non-adapted peptides, with cells targeting adapted peptides exhibiting a dysfunctional transcriptomic state. Moreover, incorporating HLA-II–associated adaptation strengthened the correlation between Gag-specific viral adaptation and poor disease outcomes.

  abstract     = {Evolution in profound darkness often leads to predictable, convergent traits, such as the loss of vision. Yet, the consequences of such repeated evolutionary experiments remain obscure, especially regarding fundamental regulatory behaviors like circadian rhythms. We studied circadian clocks of blind cave spiders and their sighted relatives. In the field, cave spiders exhibit low per expression and maintain constant activity levels. Curiously, their clocks are not permanently lost; exposure to monochromatic blue light restores both circadian gene expression and behavioral rhythms. Conversely, blocking blue light in sighted relatives induces an arrhythmic “cave phenotype.” Our RNA interference experiments suggest that clock genes regulate the rhythmicity of the huddle response, establishing a link between circadian gene networks and this behavioral rhythm. We demonstrate that circadian regulation is readily toggled and may play a latent role, even in constant darkness. Overall, our study expands understanding of circadian clock variations and paves the way for future research on the maintenance of silent phenotypes.},

  abstract     = {Regeneration is a unique feature of postembryonic development extensively observed in plants. The capacity to induce regeneration exogenously is limited and usually confined to meristematic-like tissues. We show that bacterial cellulose (BC), but not other structurally similar matrixes, induces postwounding regeneration in nonmeristematic plant tissues via a distinctive route to callus-mediated regenerative programs. The BC-specific program involves cytokinin operating concurrently with strongly activated plant biotic response genes to induce plant regeneration. A reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst, normally associated with defense responses, is sustained upon BC application, involving a network of tightly interconnected transcription factors, where WRKY8, known for regulating stress responses, shows a clustering and hierarchical prevalence. WRKY8 regulates BC-mediated plant regeneration and ROS homeostasis, including superoxide anion accumulation, to potentially promote cell proliferation after wounding. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the cytokinin- and ROS-associated defense responses can be targeted by BC application to promote plant wound regeneration through alternative regenerative programs.},

  abstract     = {Synapses are endowed with the flexibility to change through experience, but must be sufficiently stable to last a lifetime. This tension is illustrated at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ), where two motor inputs that differ in structural and functional properties coinnervate most muscles to coordinate locomotion. To stabilize NMJ activity, motor neurons augment neurotransmitter release following diminished postsynaptic glutamate receptor functionality, termed presynaptic homeostatic potentiation (PHP). How these distinct inputs contribute to PHP plasticity remains enigmatic. We have used a botulinum neurotoxin to selectively silence each input and resolve their roles in PHP, demonstrating that PHP is input specific: Chronic (genetic) PHP selectively targets the tonic MN-Ib, where active zone remodeling enhances Ca 2+ influx to promote increased glutamate release. In contrast, acute (pharmacological) PHP selectively increases vesicle pools to potentiate phasic MN-Is. Thus, distinct homeostatic modulations in active zone nanoarchitecture, vesicle pools, and Ca 2+ influx collaborate to enable input-specific PHP expression.},

The interpretation of many of these experiments relies on understanding how the spin of unpaired electrons exchanges energy with their environment, or lattice, and relaxes to equilibrium. Here, we overcome the common use of effective spin Hamiltonians to describe spin-lattice relaxation in spin-1/2 and apply ab initio open quantum systems theory to their full molecular electronic wavefunction. Simulations for two Cr(V) coordination compounds under this framework show a marked improvement in accuracy and demonstrate that relaxation in spin-1/2 molecules is enabled by virtual transitions to molecular excited states with energy approaching 20,000 cm –1 . This work establishes a connection between the original theory of Van Vleck and modern electronic structure methods, ultimately exemplifying the urgency of further advancing an ab initio approach to spin-lattice relaxation.},

An association of pathological tissue remodeling with a biglycan fragment 344 YWEVQPATFR, termed Bgm1, has been reported, however its role is yet to be defined. Using a custom antibody, we detected Bgm1 in human and mouse nucleus pulposus, with prominent intracellular expression in notochordal cells. Proteomic analysis revealed that Bgm1 interacts with eukaryotic translation initiation factor 6 (eIF6), a key player in ribosome biogenesis. Bgm1 dysregulates eIF6 localization in notochordal cells, affecting nucleocytoplasmic transport. Induced IDD in mice showed elevated nuclear eIF6 expression and reduced Bgm1 in degenerating nucleus pulposus. Transcriptome analysis suggests that Bgm1 regulates fatty acid metabolism and glycolysis in a transforming growth factor–β–dependent manner, highlighting its potential role in metabolic control in spinal joint homeostasis.},

Based on the skin, we design a soft mask that allows switching between at least eight human faces at a time. The soft mask is lightweight, thin, and fits the wearer’s head. Its actuation is silent and safe, and can realize facial switching, including facial color and shape. By wearing the soft mask, robots can show facial changes and expression modulation, and humans can change their faces as needed.

Rituximab in vasculitis exacerbates neutralization deficits over standard immunosuppressive therapy, although impairment resolves over time since dosing. We observed discordance between detectable IgG binding and neutralizing activity specifically in the context of rituximab use, with high proportions of individuals showing reasonable IgG titer but no neutralization. ADCC response was more frequently detectable compared to neutralization in the context of rituximab, indicating that a notable proportion of binding antibodies are non-neutralizing.

This method is capable of detecting nonlinear and joint effects of temperature and rainfall to dengue incidence. We found that temperature consistently increased dengue incidence throughout all the regions, while rainfall effects differed depending on the variation in dry season length, a factor previously overlooked. Specifically, our results showed that regions with low variation in dry season length experience a negative impact of rainfall on dengue incidence likely due to strong flushing effect on mosquito habitats, while regions with high variation in dry season length experience a positive impact, likely due to increased mosquito breeding sites. Our findings emphasize the need for tailored prevention strategies based on local climate conditions, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.},

To demonstrate the feasibility of TACAP, we analyzed the meprin β R238Q variant.

In this study, we found that the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) system plays a crucial role in capturing and facilitating the degradation of ubiquitinated α-syn. The E3 ubiquitin ligase Listerin was found to promote K27-linked polyubiquitination of α-syn, directing it to the endosome for subsequent degradation. We showed that the deletion of the Listerin gene exacerbates the neurodegenerative progression in a mouse model of PD, whereas the overexpression of Listerin effectively mitigates disease progression in PD mice.

That IgA may amplify postimmune IgG production is suggested by the impaired IgG response to pneumococcal vaccines in some IgA-deficient patients. Here, we found that antipneumococcal but not total IgG production was impaired in mice with IgA deficiency. The positive effect of gut IgA on antipneumococcal IgG responses started very early in life and could implicate gut bacteria, as these responses were attenuated in germ-free mice recolonized with gut microbes from IgA-deficient donors. IgA could exert this effect by constraining the systemic translocation of gut antigens, which was associated with chronic immune activation, including T cell overexpression of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). This inhibitory receptor may attenuate antipneumococcal IgG production by causing B cell hyporesponsiveness, which improved upon anti–PD-1 treatment.

  abstract     = {The loss of ecosystem carbon (the sum of vegetation, litter, and soil carbon) may occur in a permafrost region under mitigation pathways, which could reduce the efficiency of carbon dioxide removal. Here, we investigate changes in permafrost under net-zero and negative emissions, based on idealized emission-driven simulations using a state-of-the-art Earth system model. While acting as a net ecosystem carbon sink during most of the positive emission phase, permafrost becomes a net ecosystem carbon source just before reaching net-zero and negative emissions. Permafrost slowly recovers, especially in regions with high organic carbon content, and net ecosystem carbon loss persists until the end of simulations, resulting in a cumulative net ecosystem carbon loss of approximately 14 petagrams of carbon (PgC) in both scenarios. In addition, methane emissions increase under net-zero and negative emissions, due to the irreversibility of the inundated areas. We conclude that the permafrost ecosystem carbon loss may continue under net-zero and negative emissions, which could hinder climate change mitigation efforts.},

While the genetic contribution to these diseases is well established, important environmental factors have been less studied at molecular and cellular levels. Here, we used single-cell and cell type–specific techniques to investigate the effect of glucocorticoid (GC) exposure, a mediator of antenatal environmental risk, on gene regulation and lineage specification in unguided human neural organoids. We characterized the transcriptional response to chronic GC exposure during neural differentiation and studied the underlying gene regulatory networks by integrating single-cell transcriptomics with chromatin accessibility data. We found lasting cell type–specific changes that included autism risk genes and several transcription factors associated with neurodevelopment. Chronic GC exposure influenced lineage specification primarily by priming the inhibitory neuron lineage through transcription factors like PBX3 . We provide evidence for convergence of genetic and environmental risk factors through a common mechanism of altering lineage specification.},

Here, we present the direct laboratory experimental evidence of ion energization from single reflection off a supercritical collisionless shock, an essential component of Fermi acceleration, in a laser-produced magnetized plasma. A quasi-monoenergetic ion beam with two to four times the shock velocity was observed, which is consistent with the fast ion component observed in the Earth’s bow shock. Our simulations reproduced the energy gain and showed that ions were accelerated mainly by the motional electric field during reflection. The results identify shock drift acceleration as the dominant ion energization mechanism, which is consistent with satellite observation in the Earth’s bow shock. Our observations pave the way for laboratory investigations of the cosmic accelerators, also be beneficial to laser fusion and laser-driven ion accelerator.},

While these cool intervals correspond to lower atmospheric CO 2 , it is unclear why CO 2 levels fell, with hypotheses suggesting changes in CO 2 degassing rates or modification of silicate weathering through changing continental lithology or paleogeography. Here, we construct an Earth System Model that integrates these proposed cooling mechanisms in detail. The model can reproduce the broad geologic record of ice cap expansion, allowing us to infer the primary drivers of long-term climate change. Our results indicate that recent icehouse climates required a combination of different cooling mechanisms acting simultaneously and were not driven by a single known process, potentially explaining why icehouses have been rarer than greenhouses over Earth history.},

We leverage this insight to propose a precise definition of a gene regulatory relationship and implement a new tool, CIMLA (Counterfactual Inference by Machine Learning and Attribution Models), to identify differences in gene regulatory networks between biological conditions, a problem that has received great attention in recent years. Using extensive benchmarking on simulated data, we show that CIMLA is more robust to confounding variables and is more accurate than leading methods.

Furthermore, most systems have carrier mean free paths l mfp shorter than their spin moiré lattice constant a spin , inhibiting miniband formation. Here, we discover that the layered magnetic semimetal EuAg 4 Sb 2 overcomes these challenges by forming an interface with J ~ 100 milli–electron volts transferred between a Eu triangular lattice and anionic Ag 2 Sb bilayers hosting a two-dimensional electron band in the ballistic regime ( l mfp &gt;&gt; a spin ). The system realizes an SMS with a spin commensurate with the Fermi momentum, leading to a marked quenching of the transport response from miniband formation.

These models may enable a detailed investigation of the gut-specific homing mechanisms of MAIT cells.

Analysis of cod otoliths recovered during archaeological excavations of Icelandic fish processing sites revealed that cod in the 10th to 12th centuries were 25% larger and up to 300% older than modern, despite slower density-dependent growth rates attributed to the sixfold increase in abundance. Fishing mortality came to dominate a time-invariant natural mortality rate and other population characteristics after the 14th century, with minimal evidence of environmental effects at the century scale. Despite the absence of catch records and surveys, biological reference points based on pristine fish populations are now possible where otolith collections are available.},

Besides, materials require combinations of performance such as load bearing and energy dissipation. However, improving one performance of a material often sacrifices another performance, making it difficult to create materials with optimal performance profiles. Here we report a liquid-infused porous piezoelectric scaffold (LIPPS) that simultaneously enhances its load-bearing and energy dissipation capability under cyclic loading. For example, after 12 million loading cycles, LIPPS increases its modulus by 3600% and hysteresis by 3000%. From a CT study, this behavior is attributed to the self-recoverable mineralization under mechanical loading. Moreover, LIPPS shows a reprogrammable stiffness distribution based on the loading distribution, which enables the material to generate multiple shapes by self-folding. Our findings can contribute toward unprecedented opportunities in soft robotics, vehicles, infrastructure, and tissue engineering and contribute to the new paradigm of material selection with improved resilience and sustainability.},

These features are thought to promote the formation and maintenance of an “open” chromatin environment that is suitable for transcription. However, recent reports have drawn conflicting conclusions about whether these histone modifications depend on active transcription. To further interrogate this relationship, we inhibited transcription initiation using triptolide, which triggered degradation of RNA polymerase II, and examined the impact on histone modifications. Transcription initiation was not required for either hormone-induced or steady-state active histone modifications at transcription start sites (TSSs) and enhancers. Rather, blocking transcription initiation increased the levels of histone acetylation and H2AZ incorporation at active TSSs. P300 activity was dispensable for this effect, but inhibition of histone deacetylases masked the increased acetylation. Together, our results demonstrate that active histone modifications occur independently of transcription. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the process of transcription coordinates the removal of these modifications to limit gene activity.},

  abstract     = {Marine reserves deliver impressive increases in the abundance and size of exploited species on protected reefs, but larval dispersal makes it difficult to estimate their wider benefits. Australia’s Great Barrier Reef (GBR) contains an extensive network of marine reserves. By combining GBR-wide fish surveys, larval dispersal models, and commercial fishery catch data, we calculate the system-wide ecological and economic contributions of these reserves for coral groupers ( Plectropomus spp.), the region’s most important line fishery. Despite covering only 30% of reef habitat, the GBR’s marine reserve network contains half of the species’ biomass and generates most of its reproductive output (55%), half of the system’s larval settlement (50%), and almost half of the total fishery yield (47%).},

  abstract     = {Light detection and ranging (LIDAR) has emerged as an indispensable tool in autonomous technology. Among its various techniques, frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) LIDAR stands out due to its capability to operate with ultralow return power, immunity to unwanted light, and simultaneous acquisition of distance and velocity. However, achieving a rapid update rate with submicrometer precision remains a challenge for FMCW LIDARs. Here, we present such a LIDAR with a sub–10-nanometer precision and a 24.6-kilohertz update rate by combining a broadband Fourier domain mode-locked (FDML) laser with a silicon nitride soliton microcomb. An ultrahigh-frequency chirp rate up to 320 petahertz per second is linearized by a 50-gigahertz microcomb to reach this performance. Our theoretical analysis also contributes to resolving the challenge of FMCW velocity measurements with nonlinear frequency sweeps and enables us to realize velocity measurement with an uncertainty below 0.4 millimeter per second. Our work shows how microcombs can unlock the potential of ultrafast frequency sweeping lasers.},

Advanced fabrication and assembling strategies enable the heterogeneous integration of transparent microelectrodes, light-emitting diodes, photodiodes, and optical filters into a multilayer array structure on soft substrates. The microelectrodes exhibit superior electrochemical performance for measuring electrical potentials and excellent transparency for co-localized fluorescence measurement. The device shows excellent biocompatibility and records the fluorescence of calcium reporter with performance comparable to imaging cameras. Multiparametric in vivo mapping of electrical excitation, calcium dynamics, and their combined effects on cardiac excitation-contraction coupling is demonstrated during normal rhythm, arrhythmia, and treatment.

Dinoflagellates play pivotal roles in marine ecosystems, particularly as major contributors of harmful algal blooms. Despite vital roles of cysts in blooming cycles and dinoflagellate ecology, the molecular processes controlling cyst dormancy have largely remained unexplored due to technological difficulties. Using DinoSL as a dinoflagellates-specific mRNA “hook” and SMRT sequencing, we analyzed metatranscriptomes of sediment-buried dinoflagellate cyst assemblages. The data show that most major metabolic and regulatory pathways, except photosynthesis, were transcriptionally active. This suggests the crucial importance of broad metabolic pathways in sustaining cyst viability and germination potential. Further expression analyses of 11 genes (relevant to autophagy and phytohormone gibberellin), lysosome/autolysosome staining, and germination experiments revealed vital roles of autophagy in energy generation, nutrient recycling, and of phytohormones abscisic acid/gibberellin in modulating dormancy/germination of resting cysts. Our findings lay a cornerstone for elucidating the molecular machinery regulating dinoflagellate cyst dormancy.},

Here, we assessed the evidence for both laws in cetaceans by analyzing vocal sequences from 16 baleen and toothed whale species and comparing them to 51 human languages. Eleven whale species exhibit Menzerath’s law, sometimes with greater effect sizes than human speech. Two of the five whale species with categorized element types exhibit Zipf’s law of abbreviation. On average, whales also tend to shorten elements and intervals toward the end of sequences, although this varies by species. Overall, the results of this study suggest that the vocalizations of many cetacean species have undergone compression for increased efficiency in time.},

GATA6 protein also physically interacts with CTCF, suggesting its critical role in 3D genome organization. The ablation of GATA6 through AID and CRISPR systems severely impaired cancer cell clonogenicity and proliferation. Mechanistically, GATA6 knockout induced global loss of CRC-specific open chromatins and extensive alterations of critical enhancer-promoter interactions for CRC oncogenes.

It enables modular synthesis of functionally and structurally diverse tertiary amines, ethers, esters, phosphine oxides, etc., as well as related pesticides, drug intermediates, and pharmaceuticals. Compared to phosphorus-mediated name reactions, this strategy firstly transformed C═O bonds into C-element single bonds. Mechanistically, phosphinates are formed as intermediates, which undergo unconventional nucleophilic substitution at the C atom within their C─O─P unit.

The optimal nanopeptides, F3FT and N3FT, exhibited potent antibacterial activity and excellent biocompatibility. Crucially, F3FT and N3FT are able to efficiently penetrate cells and eliminate intracellular bacteria and sniping inflammation. Moreover, F3FT and N3FT kill bacteria mainly by disrupting bacterial cell membranes and inducing excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species. F3FT and N3FT have exhibited good safety and potent therapeutic potential in vivo.

Using chemical genetics, here, we report the identification of a small molecule, kC9, that triggers excessive stomatal differentiation by inhibiting the canonical ERECTA pathway. kC9 binds to and inhibits the downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase MPK6, perturbing its substrate interaction. Notably, activation of immune signaling by a bacterial flagellin peptide nullified kC9’s effects on stomatal development. This cross-regulation depends on the immune receptor FLS2 (FLAGELLIN SENSING 2) and occurs even in the absence of kC9 if the ERECTA family receptor population becomes suboptimal. Proliferating stomatal lineage cells are vulnerable to this immune signal penetration. Our findings suggest that the signal specificity between development and immunity can be ensured by mitogen-activated protein kinase homeostasis, reflecting the availability of upstream receptors, thereby providing an unanticipated view on signal specificity.},

This scenario was first studied experimentally at Calspan University of Buffalo Research Center’s test facility. DMS is a particle method that uses quantum mechanically derived interaction potentials to simulate molecular collisions within a flow field. Since these interaction potentials are the only modeling inputs used in the simulation, all flow features can solely be attributed to the ab initio potential energy surfaces. Hence, providing a comparison of a hypersonic ground test and numerical data anchored to quantum mechanics.

Mechanistic models fit under a Bayesian framework, which enabled joint inference from serological and molecular data, showed that common vampire bats maintain BIV independently of the now assumed fruit bat reservoir through immune waning and seasonal transmission pulses. A large-scale vampire bat cull targeting rabies incidentally halved BIV transmission, confirming vampire bats as maintenance hosts.

When the metamorphosis is initiated, 20E up-regulated carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A ( Cpt1a ) through transcription factor Krüppel-like factor 15 (KLF15), thus increasing the level of IDE succinylation on K179. Succinylated IDE translocated from cytoplasm to nucleus, combined with ecdysone receptor to promote 20E signaling pathway, causing larval tissue destruction, while IGF-2-like was released to promote adult tissue proliferation. That is, succinylation alters subcellular localization of IDE so that it can bind to different target proteins and act as a hub of metamorphosis.},

  abstract     = {Conformational isomerism determines the performance of materials and the activity of biomolecules. However, a complete dynamic study of conformational isomerization is still a formidable challenge at the single-molecule level. In this work, we present real-time in situ electrical monitoring of the full rotation dynamics of a single aromatic chain covalently embedded in graphene electrodes with single-event resolution. We reveal that the dynamic process of phenyl ring rotations at low temperature is dominated by quantum rotation tunneling rather than the quasi-free rotation process. The emergent complexity of different intramolecular rotations in a single aromatic molecule is demonstrated, including the alternating unidirectional rotation with multi-, single-, and half-circle delays driven by inelastic electron tunneling, which has not been previously adequately considered at the macroscopic level. This work builds a bridge between macroscopic and microscopic worlds and improves our understanding of structure-activity relationships, potentially bringing different functions to ordinary materials.},

In this paper, we introduce a dual closed-loop robotic system that integrates biodegradable, sustainable materials such as plasticized cellulose films and NaCl-infused ionic conductive gelatin organogels. These materials undergo a closed-loop ecological cycle from processing to biodegradation, contributing to new growth, while the self-sensing, origami-based robot supports a seamless human-in-the-loop teleoperation system.

Here, we measure inelastic collision probabilities for Sr + + Rb and use them to calibrate a comprehensive theoretical model of ion-atom collisions. Our theoretical results, compared with experimental observations, confirm that quantum interference effects persist to the multiple-partial-wave regime, leading to the pronounced state and mass dependence of the collision rates. Using our model, we go beyond interference and identify a rich spectrum of Feshbach resonances at moderate magnetic fields with the Rb atom in its lower ( f = 1) hyperfine state, which persist at temperatures as high as 1 millikelvin. Future observation of these predicted resonances should allow precise control of the short-range dynamics in Sr + + Rb collisions under unprecedentedly warm conditions.},

A fundamental question in understanding the plasma dynamics is how energy is transported and dissipated across scales. Here, we present spacecraft measurements in the terrestrial foreshock, a region upstream of the bow shock where the solar wind population coexists with the reflected ions. In this region, the fluid-scale, ultralow-frequency waves resonate with the reflected ions to modify the velocity distributions, which in turn cause the growth of the ion-scale, magnetosonic-whistler waves. The latter waves then resonate with the electrons, and the accelerated electrons contribute to the excitation of electron-scale, high-frequency whistler waves. These observations demonstrate that the chain of wave-particle resonances is an efficient mechanism for cross-scale energy transfer, which could redistribute the kinetic energy and accelerate the particles upstream of the shocks.},

Bacteria are encapsulated into the core of core-shell microgels via two-step light-initiated emulsion polymerization of gelatin methacrylate. NMTS is versatile for biocontainment of diverse strains, showing near complete encapsulation and negligible influence on bacterial activity. As a proof-of-concept study on probiotic transplantation to the gut microbiota, NMTS demonstrates the shielding effect to protect sealed bacteria from intraluminal insults of low pH and bile acid, the toughness to prevent bacterial leakage during entire gastrointestinal passage and reduce infection risk, and the permeability to release beneficial metabolites and reconstruct a balanced intestinal microbial structure, proposing a contactless fashion for advanced microbiota transplantation.},

Coincident with the range expansion of an invasive predatory crab in the Gulf of Maine, we document rapid changes in shell thickness—a key defense against shell crushing predators—of an intertidal snail. Field experiments, conducted 20 years apart, revealed that temporal shifts in shell thickness were driven by the evolution of increased trait means and erosion of thickness plasticity. The virtual elimination of the trade-off in tissue mass that often accompanies thicker shells is consistent with the evolution of fixed defenses under increasingly certain predation risk.},

The resistance of the ECRAM was effective in tuning the temporal dynamics of the membrane potential, contributing to flexible reconfiguration of various bio-plausible firing modes, such as phasic and burst spiking, and exhibiting adaptive spiking behaviors in changing environment.

A more positive potential of zero charge enhances CO 2 R activity only on Au with similar surface coordination.

These von Willebrand factor–bound platelets specifically recruit neutrophils in a manner that is dependent on platelet-activated α IIb β 3 , neutrophil SLC44A2, and endothelial P-selectin. The interaction of SLC44A2 with activated α IIb β 3 promotes formation of prothrombotic neutrophil extracellular traps.

In our work, we demonstrate that an anomalous logarithmic behavior in the entanglement entropy (EE) persists in a class of models analogous to the DQCP. On the basis of quantum Monte Carlo computation of the EE on SU( N ) DQCP spin models, we show that for a series of N smaller than a critical value, the anomalous logarithmic behavior always exists, which implies that previously determined DQCPs in these models do not belong to conformal fixed points. In contrast, when N ≥ N c with an N c we evaluate to lie between 7 and 8, DQCPs are consistent with conformal fixed points that can be understood within the Abelian Higgs field theory.},

  abstract     = {Mitotic centrosomes assemble when centrioles recruit large amounts of pericentriolar material (PCM) around themselves. The PCM comprises hundreds of proteins, and there is much debate about its physical nature. Here, we show that Drosophila Spd-2 (human CEP192) fluxes out from centrioles, recruiting Polo and Aurora A kinases to catalyze the assembly of two distinct mitotic-PCM scaffolds: a Polo-dependent Cnn scaffold, and an Aurora A–dependent TACC scaffold, which exhibit solid- and liquid-like behaviors, respectively. Both scaffolds can independently recruit PCM proteins, but both are required for proper centrosome assembly, with the Cnn scaffold providing mechanical strength, and the TACC scaffold concentrating centriole and centrosome proteins. Recruiting Spd-2 to synthetic beads injected into early embryos reconstitutes key aspects of mitotic centrosome assembly on the bead surface, and this depends on Spd-2’s ability to recruit Polo and Aurora A. Thus, Spd-2 orchestrates the assembly of two scaffolds, with distinct biophysical properties, that cooperate to build mitotic centrosomes in flies.},

  abstract     = {The DNA damage response in mycobacteria is controlled by the heterodimeric transcription factor PafBC, a member of the WYL domain–containing protein family. It has been shown that PafBC induces transcription of its regulon by reprogramming the housekeeping RNA polymerase holoenzyme to recognize PafBC-dependent promoters through sigma adaptation. However, the mechanism by which DNA damage is sensed and translated into PafBC activation has remained unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the binding of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) to the WYL domains of PafBC activates the transcription factor. Our cryo–electron microscopy structure of full-length PafBC in its active conformation, bound to the transcription initiation complex, reveals a previously unknown mode of interaction between the ssDNA and the WYL domains. Using biochemical experiments, we show that short ssDNA fragments bind to PafBC dynamically, resulting in deactivation as ssDNA levels decrease postrepair. Our findings shed light on the mechanism linking DNA damage to PafBC activation and expand our understanding of WYL domain–containing proteins.},

In this study, we use magmatic iron meteorites to reconstruct the MVE inventory of the earliest inner [noncarbonaceous (NC)] and outer [carbonaceous (CC)] Solar System planetesimals. We show that several NC and CC iron meteorite parent bodies (IMPBs) exhibit chondrite-like MVE abundances, indicating that “first-generation” inner Solar System planetesimals were remarkably MVE rich. Consistent with isotopic signatures of MVEs in Earth and Mars, these planetesimals made a substantial contribution to the MVE inventories of terrestrial planets. Variations in MVE abundances among IMPBs, particularly the two volatile-depleted NC and CC IMPBs (IVA and IVB), reflect secondary volatile loss after disruption of their parent bodies. Consequently, MVE depletion in terrestrial planets is more closely linked to the protracted history of MVE loss during planetesimal collisions rather than incomplete condensation or MVE loss during planetesimal differentiation.},

This study investigated the role of lipid metabolism in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) by assessing the contribution of LD-loaded brain macrophages, including microglia and border-associated macrophages (BAMs), in an AD mouse model. Particularly, BAMs and activated CD11c + microglia localized near β amyloid (Aβ) plaques exhibited a pronounced lipid-associated gene signature and a high LD load. Having observed that elevated intracellular LD content correlated inversely with microglial phagocytic activities, we subsequently inhibited LD formation specifically in CX3CR1 + brain macrophages using an inducible APP-KI/ Fit2 i Δ M φ transgenic mouse model. We demonstrated that reducing LD content in microglia and CX3CR1 + BAMs remarkably improved their phagocytic ability. Furthermore, lowering microglial LDs consistently enhanced their efferocytosis capacities and notably reduced Aβ deposition in the brain parenchyma. Therefore, mitigating LD accumulation in brain macrophages provides perspectives for AD treatment.},

Here, we found that a specific organ (such as a mature leaf) could function as a nutrient sensor, subsequently promoting or suppressing nonautonomous regulation of trichome initiation and development in response to alternations in nutrient levels. This physical phenomenon was regulated by a sucrose ⟶ ACS7 ⟶ ethylene ⟶ EIN3 ⟶ SUC4 ⟶ sucrose pathway in mature leaves, with a remote control of trichome production in newly developing leaves via a sucrose ⟶ ACS7 ⟶ ethylene ⟶ EIN3 ⟶ TTG1 pathway. These data provide insights into how mature leaves function as nutrient sensors that control trichome formation within distant developing leaves through a nutrient sensor–relay mechanism.

Our simulations, which inject up to 400 million tons of dust into the stratosphere, show marked disruptions in climate, atmospheric chemistry, and global photosynthesis. Global mean temperatures are projected to drop by 4°C, and global precipitation decreases by 15% in our simulations. The largest relative reductions in global terrestrial and marine net primary productivity reach 36 and 25%, respectively.

This process is monitored by the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), which delays anaphase onset until all chromosomes are properly attached to the mitotic spindle. The kinetochore protein KNL1 plays a critical role in recruiting SAC proteins. Here, we reveal that Arabidopsis KNL1 regulates SAC silencing through the direct recruitment of type one protein phosphatase (TOPP) to kinetochores. We show that KNL1 interacts with all nine TOPPs via a conserved RVSF motif in its N terminus, and this interaction is required for the proper localization of TOPPs to kinetochores during mitosis. Disrupting KNL1-TOPP interaction leads to persistent SAC activation, resulting in a severe metaphase arrest and defects in plant growth and development. Our findings highlight the evolutionary conservation of KNL1 in coordinating kinetochore-localized phosphatase to ensure timely SAC silencing and faithful chromosome segregation in Arabidopsis .},

Building on this and our previous research into PI3K and AR signaling interactions, we aimed to define the mechanisms of response and resistance to Akt inhibition. We discovered that restoration of mTOR signaling was the early dominant driver of resistance to Akt inhibition. Mechanistically, this can be achieved through molecular alterations, resulting in loss of negative regulators of mTOR. Unexpectedly, we discovered that this was dominated by restoration of mTOR signaling through the nutrient sensing arm. This can be achieved by loss of the components of the GATOR/KICSTOR complexes or through cellular processes, leading to the recycling of amino acids. The addition of an mTOR inhibitor restored sensitivity to Akt inhibition and represents a precision-based strategy to overcome resistance in the clinic.},

Here, we develop a biologically plausible dimensionality reduction algorithm compatible with t -SNE, which uses a simple three-layer feedforward network mimicking the Drosophila olfactory circuit. The proposed learning rule, described as three-factor Hebbian plasticity, is effective for datasets such as entangled rings and MNIST, comparable to t -SNE. We further show that the algorithm could be working in olfactory circuits in Drosophila by analyzing the multiple experimental data in previous studies. We lastly suggest that the algorithm is also beneficial for association learning between inputs and rewards, allowing the generalization of these associations to other inputs not yet associated with rewards.},

This led to studies in a murine model where the same events occur and cause neuroinflammation with cognitive dysfunction. All events are recapitulated when F-actin MPs are injected intravenously, which establishes a blood-to-brain-to-blood inflammatory cycle that persists for weeks. All changes, including cognitive dysfunction, can be abrogated by an injection of human recombinant pGSN within 2 weeks after CO poisoning. These findings demonstrate that CO-induced neurological injury has an inflammatory etiology. Because of MP-mediated communications between the brain and systemic circulation, CO-induced cognitive deficits may be reversible with a pharmaceutical intervention.},

Previous assessments of temperature-related mortality, however, lack a comprehensive analysis of distinct impacts of temperature change across different timescales and characteristics. Using a longitudinal survey of 27,233 elderly Chinese citizens from 2005 to 2018, we establish connections between rising temperatures, temperature variability, and extreme heat with increased mortality risk, assessed through four annual metrics that combine temperature and humidity. The intensity and prolonged duration of extreme heat are found to have the greatest impact on mortality risk. Furthermore, by identifying heterogeneous impacts based on location, sex, age, obesity, income, and diet, we reveal the pathways through which temperature metrics are likely to influence mortality risk. Our study highlights the compound effects of rising temperatures for elderly populations, and it could be expanded to other countries and regions experiencing similar challenges due to an aging population experiencing warming conditions.},

However, existing VS catheters with phase-changing materials are slow in softening and stiffening rates (≈90 s), which can lead to substantial increase in surgery duration. To address the slow stiffness change, we propose a VS catheter based on fiber jamming (FJ) that achieves instant stiffness changes (≤300 ms), enabling seamless catheter operations without delays. Moreover, our catheter, incorporating hundreds of ultrathin fibers into a slender 2.3-mm catheter body, achieves up to 6.5-fold stiffness changes. With adequate stiffness change, our two-segment catheter achieves complex bending profiles within seconds. In addition, the FJ-based design does not require electric currents or heating inside the human body, minimizing patient risks. This FJ-based VS catheter, with instantaneous response, adequate stiffness change, and enhanced safety, can potentially establish benchmarks in MIS, allowing medical practitioners to effectively address formidable diseases.},

In low-CO 2 scenarios (1.5° and 2°C warming pathways), the suppressive effect of sulfate deposition on wetland methane emissions largely diminishes by 2100 due to clean air policies, with resulting emission increases (7 ± 2 Tg a −1 ) being 35 and 22% of total wetland emission changes.

However, a satellite’s dissipation rate, parameterized by k 2 /Q , is hard to measure and is only known for the Moon and Io. Here, we use Titan’s measured departure from its expected rotation state to infer k 2 /Q and its boundary layer dissipation parameter K/C s . Over the likely range of ocean and ice shell thicknesses, we infer a K / C s of 6.3 × 10 −14 s −1 to 2.4 × 10 −10 s −1 , a k 2 /Q of 0.058 to 0.12, and a minimum dissipation factor Q ≈ 5 . Titan’s dissipation parameters are one to two orders of magnitude larger than the Moon’s and suggest an interior with a low effective viscosity. Titan’s dissipation rate implies that its eccentricity and inclination are damping rapidly, consistent with an excitation within the last ~350 Myr. The forthcoming Dragonfly lander could measure Titan’s tidal response, and JUICE could use our approach to determine Ganymede’s k 2 /Q .},

Klawon et al . used mouse models to investigate the role of T reg cells that recognized the same prostate tissue peptide antigen as T conv cells. In immune responses accompanied by increased availability of prostate antigen, deletion of prostate-specific T reg cells increased the infiltration of the matched T conv cells into the prostate. Thus, in this context, nonmatched T reg cells could not restrain self-reactive T conv cells. Rather, the self-recognizing T reg cells proliferated earlier in response to antigen than their T conv counterparts, helping to curb their activity. —Sarah H. Ross During infections, CD4 + Foxp3 + regulatory T (T reg ) cells must control autoreactive CD4 + conventional T (T conv ) cell responses against self-peptide antigens while permitting those against pathogen-derived “nonself” peptides. We defined the basis of this selectivity using mice in which T reg cells reactive to a single prostate-specific self-peptide were selectively depleted. We found that self-peptide–specific T reg cells were dispensable for the control of T conv cells of matched specificity at homeostasis. However, they were required to control such T conv cells and prevent autoimmunity toward the prostate after exposure to elevated self-peptide during infection. Notably, the T reg cell response to self-peptide did not affect protective T conv cell responses to a pathogen-derived peptide. Thus, self-peptide–specific T reg cells promoted self-nonself discrimination during infection by selectively controlling T conv cells of shared self-specificity.},

Che et al . analyzed basalt fragments retrieved by Chang’e-6, using radiometric dating to show that they formed 2.8 billion years ago. The composition of the basalt constrains the properties of the magma source of the volcanism. The authors found both similarities to and differences from samples taken on the near side of the Moon and discuss the implications for geochemical models. —Keith T. Smith Volcanism on the Moon has produced surface basalt deposits, which record lunar interior processes. The Chang’e-6 mission retrieved samples from the South Pole–Aitken basin (SPA) on the Moon’s far side. We analyzed basalt fragments collected by Chang’e-6 and found that their composition resembles that of low-titanium basalts previously sampled by the Apollo missions. Uranium-lead (U-Pb) dating indicated a basalt age of 2823.0 ± 5.9 million years and a source 238 U/ 204 Pb ratio (μ-value) of 480 ± 56. This high μ-value indicates that the source contained materials that formed during the late stages of lunar magma ocean (LMO) crystallization. The results are consistent with the LMO model, but the Chang’e-6 basalt deviates from the trend in Apollo mission samples of younger basalts having higher μ-values. We suggest that this indicates post-LMO modification of the mantle by the SPA impact.},

Analyses of erucamide analogs and HrcC mutants indicated that the erucamide-HrcC binding is required for inhibiting T3SS in vitro and antibacterial resistance in plants, suggesting an essential role of erucamide-HrcC binding in disease resistance.

By correlating MRI-detected lesions with spatial transcriptional changes, the authors identified gene profile microenvironments around the lesions, which enabled them to propose therapeutic targets and potential treatments for MS. —Mattia Maroso Inferring cellular and molecular dynamics of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions from postmortem tissue collected decades after onset is challenging. Using magnetic resonance image (MRI)–guided spatiotemporal RNA profiling in marmoset experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE), we mapped lesion dynamics and modeled molecular perturbations relevant to MS. Five distinct lesion microenvironments emerged, involving neuroglial responses, tissue destruction and repair, and brain border regulation. Before demyelination, MRI identified a high ratio of proton density–weighted signal to T 1 relaxation time, capturing early hypercellularity, and elevated astrocytic and ependymal senescence signals marked perivascular and periventricular areas that later became demyelination hotspots. As lesions expanded, concentric glial barriers formed, initially dominated by proliferating and diversifying microglia and oligodendrocyte precursors, later replaced by monocytes and lymphocytes. We highlight SERPINE1 + astrocytes as a signaling hub underlying lesion onset in both marmoset EAE and MS.},

ALKBH5 is up-regulated in the liver during obesity and also phosphorylated by protein kinase A, causing its translocation to the cytosol. Hepatocyte-specific deletion of Alkbh5 reduces glucose and lipids by inhibiting the glucagon receptor (GCGR) and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathways.

  abstract     = {Despite decades of research, precisely how the various parts of the solar insolation cycles affect glacial cycles is not known. Barker et al . took a new approach to answering this question by looking at the morphology of glacial inception and deglaciation. They found that those steps depend strongly on the relative phasing of precession versus obliquity, with precession having more influence on deglacial onset and obliquity being more important for reaching peak interglacial conditions and glacial inception. Thus, glacial-interglacial variability in the relevant period, called the 100,000-year world, is largely deterministic. —Jesse Smith Identifying the specific roles of precession, obliquity, and eccentricity in glacial-interglacial transitions is hindered by imprecise age control. We circumvent this problem by focusing on the morphology of deglaciation and inception, which we show depends strongly on the relative phasing of precession versus obliquity. We demonstrate that although both parameters are important, precession has more influence on deglacial onset, whereas obliquity is more important for the attainment of peak interglacial conditions and glacial inception. We find that the set of precession peaks (minima) responsible for terminations since 0.9 million years ago is a subset of those peaks that begin (i.e., the precession parameter starts decreasing) while obliquity is increasing. Specifically, termination occurs with the first of these candidate peaks to occur after each eccentricity minimum. Thus, the gross morphology of 100-thousand-year (100-kyr) glacial cycles appears largely deterministic.},

This fundamental knowledge is essential for the design of more efficient and stable catalysts. Because the nature of the active site (metal, oxide, carbide) is the main factor that determines the catalytic activity of the catalysts, this Review focuses on various types of heterogeneous catalysts that have been recently reported in the literature as efficient for CO 2 conversion to C1 [carbon monoxide (CO), methanol (CH 3 OH), methane (CH 4 )], and higher hydrocarbons.

Chen et al . sequenced 13 new complete genomes from across the phylum to assemble a new phylogeny for Mollusca . They resolved several highly debated nodes and provide additional genomes for future study of this highly diverse and genomically complex phylum. —Corinne Simonti Extreme morphological disparity within Mollusca has long confounded efforts to reconstruct a stable backbone phylogeny for the phylum. Familiar molluscan groups—gastropods, bivalves, and cephalopods—each represent a diverse radiation with myriad morphological, ecological, and behavioral adaptations. The phylum further encompasses many more unfamiliar experiments in animal body-plan evolution. In this work, we reconstructed the phylogeny for living Mollusca on the basis of metazoan BUSCO (Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs) genes extracted from 77 (13 new) genomes, including multiple members of all eight classes with two high-quality genome assemblies for monoplacophorans. Our analyses confirm a phylogeny proposed from morphology and show widespread genomic variation. The flexibility of the molluscan genome likely explains both historic challenges with their genomes and their evolutionary success.},

This conclusion has set the tone for much thinking about such movement in nature. Sayin et al ., including authors of the original study, combined field and laboratory studies and found that locusts, and likely also other animals moving collectively, do not follow a “self-propelled” particle model (see the Perspective by Buhl and Simpson). Rather, they found that sensory and cognitive mechanisms mediate the interactions. —Sacha Vignieri Collective motion, which is ubiquitous in nature, has traditionally been explained by “self-propelled particle” models from theoretical physics. Here we show, through field, lab, and virtual reality experimentation, that classical models of collective behavior cannot account for how collective motion emerges in marching desert locusts, whose swarms affect the livelihood of millions. In contrast to assumptions made by these models, locusts do not explicitly align with neighbors. While individuals respond to moving-dot stimuli through the optomotor response, this innate behavior does not mediate social response to neighbors. Instead, locust marching behavior, across scales, can be explained by a minimal cognitive framework, which incorporates individuals’ neural representation of bearings to neighbors and internal consensus dynamics for making directional choices. Our findings challenge long-held beliefs about how order can emerge from disorder in animal collectives.},

These results will help to improve attribution of the climate effects of organic aerosols. —Jesse Smith Atmospheric organic aerosols (OAs) influence Earth’s climate by absorbing sunlight. However, the link between their evolving composition and their absorptive effects is unclear. We demonstrate that brown nitrogen (BrN), the absorptive nitrogenous component of OAs, dominates their global absorption. Using a global model, we quantified BrN abundance, tracked its optical evolution with chemical aging, and assessed its radiative absorption. BrN contributes 76% of OAs’ surface light absorption over the US and 61% of their global absorptive optical depth. Moreover, the observed variability of OAs’ absorptive capacity is primarily driven by the sources and aging of BrN. BrN represents 18% of the global absorptive direct radiative effect of carbonaceous aerosols, with biomass burning being the largest contributor. Our research establishes a nitrogen-centric framework for attributing the climate impacts of OAs.},

Ye et al . investigated how farmers’ choices about how much Bt ( Bacillus thuringiensis ) transgenic maize to plant aligned with the optimum based on field trials (see the Policy Forum by Brown and Reisig). Farmers generally planted more Bt maize than the optimum across the US corn belt, suggesting misperceptions of the costs and benefits. This was especially true in eastern states, where crop rotation is more common and corn rootworm damage was lower in field trials. —Bianca Lopez Widespread use of genetically engineered maize targeting the corn rootworm complex ( Diabrotica species) has raised concerns about insect resistance. Twelve years of university field trial and farm survey data from 10 US Corn Belt states indicate that maize hybrids expressing toxins derived from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt maize) exhibited declining protection from rootworm feeding with increased planting while pest pressures simultaneously decreased. The analysis revealed a tendency to overplant Bt maize, leading to substantial economic losses; this was particularly striking in eastern Corn Belt states. Our findings highlight the need to go beyond the “tragedy of the commons” perspective to protect sustainable use of Bt and other crop biotechnology resources.

This method could also stabilize structures with periodic vacancies, such as the chiral Kagome lattice. —Phil Szuromi Shape-anisotropic nanocrystals and patchy particles have been explored to construct complex superstructures, but most studies have focused on convex shapes. We report that nonconvex, dumbbell-shaped nanocrystals (nanodumbbells) exhibit globally interlocking self-assembly behaviors governed by curvature-guided depletion interactions. By tailoring the local curvature of nanodumbbells, we can precisely and flexibly adjust particle bonding directionality, a level of control rarely achievable with conventional convex building blocks. These nanodumbbells can undergo long-range ordered assembly into various intricate two-dimensional superlattices, including the chiral Kagome lattice. Theoretical calculations reveal that the Kagome lattice is a thermodynamically stable phase, with depletion interactions playing a crucial role in stabilizing these non–close-packed structures.

In the ensuing decades, numerous analogous metal sandwich compounds have been prepared and applied. Russo et al . now extend the motif to berkelium, a radioactive element heavier than uranium. Their experiments required rapid synthesis and characterization on a submilligram scale to compensate for the ongoing decay. Spectroscopic and theoretical analysis supported covalent interactions between the cyclic ligands and f orbitals of the metal. —Jake S. Yeston Interest in actinide–carbon bonds has persisted since actinide organometallics were first investigated for applications in isotope separation during the Manhattan Project. Transplutonium organometallics are rarely isolated and structurally characterized, likely owing to limited isotope inventories, a scarcity of suitable laboratory infrastructure, and intrinsic difficulties with the anaerobic conditions required. Herein, we report the discovery of an organometallic “berkelocene” complex prepared from 0.3 milligrams of berkelium-249. Single-crystal x-ray diffraction shows a tetravalent berkelium ion between two substituted cyclooctatetraene ligands, resulting in the formation of berkelium–carbon bonds. The coordination in berkelocene resembles that of uranocene, and calculations show that the berkelium 5f orbitals engage in covalent overlap with the δ-symmetry orbitals of the cyclooctatetraenide ligand π system. Charge transfer from the ligands is diminished relative to uranocene and other actinocenes, which maximizes contributions from the stable, half-filled 5f 7 configuration of tetravalent berkelium.},

Zhang et al . explored a different approach that involves binding water molecules to the polymer network (see the Perspective by Yu and Lin). The authors started with a double network structure based on polyacrylate and alginate, which they then treated with concentrated sulfuric acid and heated to convert the alginate to carbon nanoparticles. The incorporated sulfate groups acted as strong binding sites for water, and the carbon nanoparticles provided electrical and mechanical sensitivity to the gels, which enabled their use over a temperature range from −115° to 143°C. —Marc S Lavine Hydrogels consist of cross-linked polymers that are highly swollen with water. Water evaporation or freezing during temperature changes may lead to stiff and brittle hydrogels. We introduce a strategy called “hydro-locking,” which involves immobilizing the water molecules within the polymer network of the hydrogel. This is accomplished by establishing robust connections between water molecules and the polymer by using sulfuric acid. A sacrificial network is introduced to shield the prime polymer network from collapsing. Under the hydro-locking mode, an alginate-polyacrylamide double-network hydrogel remains soft and stretchable within a temperature range that spans from –115° to 143°C.

We report state-prepared and state-resolved measurements of methane scattering from a room-temperature gold surface that demonstrate total destructive interference between molecular states related by a reflection symmetry operation.

McCombe et al . examined the NUDIX family of proteins, which are found in diverse pathogens and target multiple plant species (see the Perspective by Gutjahr). They found that fungal pathogens can use NUDIX proteins to trick plants by disrupting their ability to sense their own inorganic phosphate status. NUDIX proteins hydrolyze inositol pyrophosphate, which is the main phosphate compound monitored by plant cells. If the plant focuses on growth and nutrition, then it may be less able to activate immune responses. —Madeleine Seale Inorganic phosphate (Pi) is essential for life, and plant cells monitor Pi availability by sensing inositol pyrophosphate (PP-InsP) levels. In this work, we describe the hijacking of plant phosphate sensing by a conserved family of Nudix hydrolase effectors from pathogenic Magnaporthe and Colletotrichum fungi. Structural and enzymatic analyses of the Nudix effector family demonstrate that they selectively hydrolyze PP-InsP. Gene deletion experiments of Nudix effectors in Magnaporthe oryzae , Colletotrichum higginsianum , and Colletotrichum graminicola indicate that PP-InsP hydrolysis substantially enhances disease symptoms in diverse pathosystems. Further, we show that this conserved effector family induces phosphate starvation signaling in plants.

  abstract     = {Continuous transitions of the surfaces of metal nanoparticles in a gas environment have been revealed with transmission electron microscopy. Crozier et al . used unsupervised deep denoising to overcome the poor signal-to-noise ratios inherent in imaging with both high spatial and millisecond time resolution. Stress fields that penetrated below the surface of platinum nanoparticles supported on cerium oxide destabilized the nanoparticles and led to a series of transitions between ordered and disordered configurations. —Phil Szuromi Materials functionalities may be associated with atomic-level structural dynamics occurring on the millisecond timescale. However, the capability of electron microscopy to image structures with high spatial resolution and millisecond temporal resolution is often limited by poor signal-to-noise ratios. With an unsupervised deep denoising framework, we observed metal nanoparticle surfaces (platinum nanoparticles on cerium oxide) in a gas environment with time resolutions down to 10 milliseconds at a moderate electron dose. On this timescale, many nanoparticle surfaces continuously transition between ordered and disordered configurations. Stress fields can penetrate below the surface, leading to defect formation and destabilization, thus making the nanoparticle fluxional. Combining this unsupervised denoiser with in situ electron microscopy greatly improves spatiotemporal characterization, opening a new window for the exploration of atomic-level structural dynamics in materials.},

  abstract     = {On its first day, the Trump administration released several executive orders terminating diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, calling them “illegal,” “immoral,” and “discriminatory” (1, 2). DEI programs include racial affinity groups, which counter the systemic barriers to inclusion and advancement that Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) face in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines (3, 4). These organizations provide a welcoming space for underrepresented scientists to give and receive culturally aware mentorship (5). Given that diverse teams produce more innovative science (6), racial affinity groups benefit not only BIPOC scientists but also their employers and the public. Racial affinity groups do not violate US antisegregation or antidiscrimination laws; they enable equitable access to resources that support academic advancement for all. To protect scientists and scientific output, US stakeholders must work to protect affinity groups from government interference.},

  abstract     = {Greater use of a pesticide usually has two dynamic and countervailing effects on pest populations: (i) To the extent that susceptibility remains in the population, it reduces that population’s growth (population suppression) or crop damage, and (ii) it selects for resistant genotypes, which can increase future crop damage (resistance selection). Because these effects occur simultaneously, it is challenging to disentangle them in field settings. Economists studying pesticide resistance have theorized that two potential market failures inherent to the problem can work in opposing directions; it is an empirical matter whether farms are over- or underusing a pesticide in any given context, compared to what would be optimal for their collective profits. On page 943 of this issue, Ye et al. ( 1 ) describe the use of transgenic Bacillus thuringus (Bt) corn to provide an important example of how to empirically assess the balance of these market failures in an applied, policy-relevant setting.},

In contrast to polymers that transform between different states when heated or cooled, a hydrogel generally does not undergo polymeric phase transition because of its hydration. However, a change in temperature can evaporate or freeze mobile water molecules within the polymer networks, which modifies the hydrogel’s mechanical properties ( 1 ). This compromises elasticity of a hydrogel and makes it easily breakable. On page 967 of this issue, Zhang et al. ( 2 ) report a way to control water molecules in polymer networks and produce a temperature-tolerant hydrogel that maintains its elasticity across a wide range of temperatures from –115° to 143°C.

Although plants have evolved innate immune responses against pathogens, 10 to 23% of global crop yield is lost every year to fungal pathogens alone ( 1 ). Plantinteracting microorganisms, including pathogenic fungi, translocate effector proteins into plant cells. These effectors enhance pathogen virulence by directly interfering with the plant immune system or by manipulating other cellular functions. On page 955 of this issue, McCombe et al . ( 2 ) report that the pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae (which causes devastating rice blast) and two additional plant disease–causing fungi enhance their pathogenicity by manipulating the plant’s monitoring of phosphate, a phosphorus-containing compound essential for plant growth. The mechanism tricks plants into entering a phosphate starvation response, which alters metabolism but also disrupts immune signaling and responses to infection. These findings represent a mechanism by which fungal pathogens can manipulate plant defense indirectly.},

Nanoparticles of metals, semiconductors, and magnets have been ordered into periodic patterns—so-called superlattice structures ( 3 ).

However, the IPCC’s reported targets are based on the assumption that global net-zero emissions are achieved. Therefore, these CDR targets are reflective of the net-negative CDR required and do not account for the additional CDR that may be needed if it is also used to offset hard-to-abate emissions. To improve transparency, the authors have made the following revisions: (i) They have revised both Fig. 3 and Table 2 to add the total CDR values, alongside the existing net-negative CDR values that they have reported. (ii) They have added a description in the section “Contribution to CDR targets in mitigation scenarios” to clarify the distinction between net-negative CDR targets and total CDR targets. (iii) Data S7 now includes the raw data for the revised Fig. 3. A typographical error in Fig. 1 has also been corrected.},

  abstract     = {Can the capacity to evolve be selected by natural selection for greater ability to evolve? Barnett et al . designed experiments in which lineages of bacteria cycled between two selective environments (see the Perspective by Kussell). In response to changing conditions, a multistep evolutionary dynamic emerged in which selection first acts to elevate transcription rates at a single regulatory gene. An increase in frameshift mutations occurs at the same locus that also allows hitchhiking of secondary, possibly adaptive mutations. This phenomenon provides an evolutionary mechanism for increasing the capacity for evolvability toward specific adaptive outcomes. —Caroline Ash Evolvability—the capacity to generate adaptive variation—is a trait that can itself evolve through natural selection. However, the idea that mutation can become biased toward adaptive outcomes remains controversial. In this work, we report the evolution of enhanced evolvability through localized hypermutation in experimental populations of bacteria. The evolved mechanism is analogous to the mutation-prone sequences of contingency loci observed in pathogenic bacteria. Central to this outcome was a lineage-level selection process, where success depended on the capacity to evolve between two phenotypic states. Subsequent evolution showed that the hypermutable locus is itself evolvable with respect to alterations in the frequency of environmental change. Lineages with localized hypermutability were more likely to acquire additional adaptive mutations, revealing an unanticipated benefit.},

How other animals react to unresponsive conspecifics—and the neural mechanisms driving such behaviors—remain largely unexplored. In this study, we demonstrated that mice exhibit rescue-like social behaviors toward unresponsive conspecifics, characterized by intense physical contact and grooming directed at the recipient’s facial and mouth areas, which expedite their recovery from unresponsiveness. We identified the medial amygdala (MeA) as a key region that encodes the unresponsive state of others and drives this head-directed physical contact. Notably, the behavioral responses toward unresponsive conspecifics differed from those directed at awake, stressed individuals, and these responses were differentially represented in the MeA. These findings shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying prosocial responses toward unresponsive individuals.},

We report that mice exhibit stereotypic behaviors toward unconscious or dead social partners, which escalate from sniffing and grooming to more forceful actions such as mouth or tongue biting and tongue pulling. The latter intense actions, more prominent in familiar pairs, begin after prolonged immobility and unresponsiveness and cease when the partner regains activity. Their consequences, including improved airway opening and clearance and accelerated recovery from unconsciousness, suggest rescue-like efforts. Oxytocin neurons in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus respond differentially to the presence of unconscious versus active partners, and their activation, along with oxytocin signaling, is required for the reviving-like actions. This tendency to assist unresponsive members may enhance group cohesion and survival of social species.},

Zaslavsky et al . developed a framework, Mal-ID (machine learning for immunological diagnosis), to interpret the variable sequences of B and T cell receptors (BCRs and TCRs) from human blood samples. During training, six representations of sequence features of BCRs and TCRs were compared between healthy and ill individuals to learn commonalities, and these features were combined in a single model to predict disease status. This approach was able to distinguish controls, individuals with distinct autoimmune diseases or viral infections, and those who had received an influenza vaccine. —Sarah H. Ross Clinical diagnosis typically incorporates physical examination, patient history, various laboratory tests, and imaging studies but makes limited use of the human immune system’s own record of antigen exposures encoded by receptors on B cells and T cells. We analyzed immune receptor datasets from 593 individuals to develop MAchine Learning for Immunological Diagnosis, an interpretive framework to screen for multiple illnesses simultaneously or precisely test for one condition. This approach detects specific infections, autoimmune disorders, vaccine responses, and disease severity differences. Human-interpretable features of the model recapitulate known immune responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, influenza, and human immunodeficiency virus, highlight antigen-specific receptors, and reveal distinct characteristics of systemic lupus erythematosus and type-1 diabetes autoreactivity. This analysis framework has broad potential for scientific and clinical interpretation of immune responses.},

Wu et al . investigated the mechanisms mediating the uptake of α-synuclein in neurons using in vitro and in vivo models. The product of the recently identified PD-risk gene FAM171A2 was found to be the neuronal receptor for α-synuclein fibrils, mediating their internalization through endocytosis. In silico screening identified an approved drug, bemcentinib, that is able to inhibit α-synuclein internalization in vitro and in vivo by blocking its binding to FAM171A2. The results provide insights into PD pathogenesis and identify a potential therapeutic target. —Mattia Maroso Neuronal accumulation and spread of pathological α-synuclein (α-syn) fibrils are key events in Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD) pathophysiology. However, the neuronal mechanisms underlying the uptake of α-syn fibrils remain unclear. In this work, we identified FAM171A2 as a PD risk gene that affects α-syn aggregation. Overexpressing FAM171A2 promotes α-syn fibril endocytosis and exacerbates the spread and neurotoxicity of α-syn pathology. Neuronal-specific knockdown of FAM171A2 expression shows protective effects. Mechanistically, the FAM171A2 extracellular domain 1 interacts with the α-syn C terminus through electrostatic forces, with &gt;1000 times more selective for fibrils. Furthermore, we identified bemcentinib as an effective blocker of FAM171A2–α-syn fibril interaction with an in vitro binding assay, in cellular models, and in mice.

  abstract     = {Most chemical reactions that manipulate carbon centers change just one or two bonds at a time. Recently, a reagent with carbon sandwiched between phosphorus and nitrogen proved adept at releasing the carbon atom alone to form four new bonds. However, these reactions tended to produce linear, triple-bonded molecules as products. Sun et al . now report that upon swapping out the phosphorus for sulfur, the carbon transfer reactivity shifted to deliver three-dimensional products with four single bonds. Reactions with successive olefins produced a range of strained spiro compounds that are otherwise challenging to access. —Jake S. Yeston The introduction of a single C-atom into organic substrates typically results in the formation of flat molecules containing unsaturated C(sp)-centers. Adding a single C(sp 3 )-atom surrounded by four σ-C–C bonds, which opens up the three-dimensional space, is an unresolved problem in synthetic chemistry. We report the synthesis and application of the diazosulfur ylide Ph 2 S=C=N 2 reagent that combines the reactivity of both sulfur ylides and diazo compounds to create carbon spiro-centers in a general fashion by the sequential or single-step installation of a C(sp 3 )-atom. New C–C and C–X (where X is O or N) bonds can be created around the C(sp 3 )-atom, which can ultimately be extended to four C–C σ-bonds in one step without resorting to transition metal catalysis. Ph 2 SCN 2 can also be used to access highly strained frameworks containing (oxa)spiro[2.2]pentanes as well as tricyclic spiro-compounds.},

  abstract     = {One vision for robotics is to design groups of simple robots that work together, for example, like a colony of ants that can move like a flowing fluid but can also form a solid structure such as a bridge for an unpassable span. Devlin et al . designed a robot collective that can switch between a “fluidizing” state and a solid state based on the rotational state of the robot. Drawing from embryonic morphogenesis, the authors identified three important components of the biological process, interunit force, polarization, and adhesion, and developed their robotic counterparts. These elements enable locally tunable mechanical properties that can be exploited to change the collective’s shape and strength. —Marc S. Lavine The vision of robotic materials—cohesive collectives of robotic units that can arrange into virtually any form with any physical properties—has long intrigued both science and fiction. Yet, this vision requires a fundamental physical challenge to be overcome: The collective must be strong, to support loads, yet flow, to take new forms. We achieve this in a material-like robotic collective by modulating the interunit tangential forces to control topological rearrangements of units within a tightly packed structure. This allows local control of rigidity transitions between solid and fluid-like states in the collective and enables spatiotemporal control of shape and strength. We demonstrate structure-forming and healing and show the collective supporting 700 newtons (500 times the weight of a robot) before “melting” under its own weight.},

  abstract     = {Most current plastic-recycling methods rely on macroscopic mechanical shredding, cleaning, and reprocessing. As a result, the properties of the recycled material degrade relative to the virgin polymer. Chemical decomposition to the original monomer would enable more thorough purification and then repolymerization to restore ideal performance. Wang et al . report the surprising discovery that in dichlorobenzene solvent, violet light irradiation can cleanly break down polymethacrylates such as plexiglass to their original monomers. The process appears to involve hydrogen abstraction from the backbone by small quantities of chlorine radicals liberated from the solvent. —Jake S. Yeston The reversion of vinyl polymers with carbon-carbon backbones to their monomers represents an ideal path to alleviate the growing plastic waste stream. However, depolymerizing such stable materials remains a challenge, with state-of-the-art methods relying on “designer” polymers that are neither commercially produced nor suitable for real-world applications. In this work, we report a main chain–initiated, visible light–triggered depolymerization directly applicable to commercial polymers containing undisclosed impurities (e.g., comonomers, additives, or dyes). By in situ generation of chlorine radicals directly from the solvent, near-quantitative (&gt;98%) depolymerization of polymethacrylates could be achieved regardless of their synthetic route (e.g., radical or ionic polymerization), end group, and molecular weight (up to 1.6 million daltons). The possibility to perform multigram-scale depolymerizations and confer temporal control renders this methodology a versatile and general route to recycling.},

Theoretical studies by Jalil et al . showed that nickel dopants on silver could activate molecular oxygen, and surface science experiments showed that nickel could stabilize nucleophilic oxygen that would otherwise react unselectively. Parts per million addition of nickel enhanced selectivity by 25%, and added chlorine could also boost the effect of nickel by an additional 10%. —Phil Szuromi Over the last 80 years, chlorine (Cl) has been the primary promoter of the ethylene epoxidation reaction valued at ~40 billion USD per year, providing a ~25% selectivity increase over unpromoted silver (Ag) (~55%). Promoters such as cesium, rhenium, and molybdenum each add a few percent of selectivity enhancements to achieve 90% overall, but their codependence on Cl makes optimizing and understanding their function complex. We took a theory-guided, single-atom alloy approach to identify nickel (Ni) as a dopant in Ag that can facilitate selective oxidation by activating molecular oxygen (O 2 ) without binding oxygen (O) too strongly. Surface science experiments confirmed the facile adsorption/desorption of O 2 on NiAg, as well as demonstrating that Ni serves to stabilize unselective nucleophilic oxygen. Supported Ag catalyst studies revealed that the addition of Ni in a 1:200 Ni to Ag atomic ratio provides a ~25% selectivity increase without the need for Cl co-flow and acts cooperatively with Cl, resulting in a further 10% initial increase in selectivity.},

  abstract     = {Laser-based additive manufacturing of metals is a complex process that often leads to the introduction of voids through what are called keyhole instabilities. Fan et al . sought to understand how this pore-forming process is modified with magnetic fields using high-speed x-ray imaging. They found that a flow driven by the thermoelectric effect can either improve or degrade keyhole formation depending on the direction of the field. These observations reveal one way to modulate the formation of pores, which is important for controlling the mechanical properties of the alloy. —Marc S. Lavine Keyhole instability during laser welding and laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) can cause keyhole collapse and pore formation. Using high-speed x-ray imaging, we demonstrate that the flow vortex–induced protrusion on the rear keyhole wall is crucial in initiating keyhole instability. Applying a transverse magnetic field suppresses the keyhole instability by driving a secondary thermoelectric magnetohydrodynamics (TEMHD) flow that alters the net flow vortex. This minimizes protrusions and large-amplitude keyhole oscillations. The suppression effectiveness depends on the laser scanning direction relative to the magnetic field orientation because this controls the Seebeck effect–induced Lorentz force’s direction. We show that at LPBF length scales, electromagnetic damping is weak, and for alloys with a large Seebeck coefficient, TEMHD becomes the dominant mechanism controlling flow behind the keyhole.},

However, standard viscous flow simulations of their evolution have limited predictive power owing to incomplete understanding of involved processes. On the Greenland ice sheet, borehole fiber-optic observations revealed a brittle deformation mode that is incompatible with viscous flow, over length scales similar to the resolution of modern ice sheet models: englacial ice quake cascades that are unobservable at the surface. Nucleating near volcanism-related impurities that promote grain boundary cracking, the ice quake cascades appear as a macroscopic form of crystal-scale wild plasticity.

For energy technologies such as thermoelectric cooling, however, 3D printing is notably less integrated because of the intricate specifications required of functional semiconductors. Characteristics of a material, such as charge carrier mobility, level of impurities (dopants), and microstructural defects, as well as surface and interfacial properties, must be precisely engineered to achieve desired performance. 3D printed semiconductor devices often demonstrate lesser performance compared to their thin-film counterparts because of imperfections in the functional layer that are introduced during printing ( 2 , 3 ). On page 845 of this issue, Xu et al. ( 4 ) report additive manufacturing of a thermoelectric cooler with a cooling efficiency surpassing that of existing devices. This demonstrates potential use of 3D printing for large-scale production of semiconductor devices.},

  abstract     = {Evolvability, or the capacity to generate adaptive phenotypic variation, can itself evolve in response to selection ( 1 ). Species that evolve too slowly may be unable to adapt to environmental change and are more likely to go extinct than faster-evolving species. Yet what it takes to get evolvability to evolve, in nature or in the lab, has remained puzzling. For example, many generations might be needed for natural selection to change a species’ ability to adapt. Higher evolvability can result in lower heritability, a cornerstone of natural selection’s ability to act, and the same degree of evolvability might not suit all traits equally. On page 840 of this issue, Barnett et al. ( 2 ) describe how experimental evolution can yield increased evolvability by localized hypermutation in populations of bacteria exposed to an alternating selection regime, akin to the regularly fluctuating conditions that pathogenic bacteria experience moving from one host to another.},

We therefore scrutinized its cellular composition and evolution using cell type atlases from chicken, mouse, and nonavian reptiles. We found that the avian pallium shares most inhibitory neuron types with other amniotes. Whereas excitatory neuron types in amniote hippocampal regions show evolutionary conservation, those in other pallial regions have diverged. Neurons in the avian mesopallium display gene expression profiles akin to the mammalian claustrum and deep cortical layers, while certain nidopallial cell types resemble neurons in the piriform cortex. Lastly, we observed substantial gene expression convergence between the dorsally located hyperpallium and ventrally located nidopallium during late development, suggesting that topological location does not always dictate gene expression programs determining functional properties in the adult avian pallium.},

To this end, we generated single-cell multiome and spatially resolved transcriptomics data of the chicken telencephalon. Enhancer codes of orthologous nonneuronal and γ-aminobutyric acid–mediated (GABAergic) cell types show a high degree of similarity across amniotes, whereas excitatory neurons of the mammalian neocortex and avian pallium exhibit varying degrees of similarity. Enhancer codes of avian mesopallial neurons are most similar to those of mammalian deep-layer neurons.

  abstract     = {Despite vast diversity in behavior and cognition across the tree of life, there is surprising similarity in brain structures and even gene expression across amniotes, the largest group of vertebrates that includes reptiles, birds, and mammals. Three papers in this issue explore the development and evolution of the brain telencephalon across this group (also see the Perspective by Gattoni and Tosches). Rueda-Alana et al . integrated transcriptional analysis at single-cell resolution and mathematical modeling to investigate the development of sensory circuits in chicken, gecko, and mouse. Zaremba et al . generated a spatially resolved cell atlas in chicken pallium and compared it with mouse, two lizards, and turtle to interrogate the conservation of cell states. Hecker et al . developed deep learning models to identify shared and divergent regulatory signatures across telencephalon cell types in chicken, human, and mouse. These studies together increase our understanding of the evolution and development of the amniote brain. —Corinne Simonti and Mattia Maroso The amniote pallium contains sensory circuits that are structurally and functionally equivalent, yet their evolutionary relationship remains unresolved. We used birthdating analysis, single-cell RNA and spatial transcriptomics, and mathematical modeling to compare the development and evolution of known pallial circuits across birds (chick), lizards (gecko), and mammals (mouse). We reveal that neurons within these circuits’ stations are generated at varying developmental times and brain regions across species and found an early developmental divergence in the transcriptomic progression of glutamatergic neurons. Our research highlights developmental distinctions and functional similarities in the sensory circuit between birds and mammals, suggesting the convergence of high-order sensory processing across amniote lineages.},

Building on decades of enzymology and structural biology, Du et al . analyzed more than 1000 structures of serine proteases to develop a comprehensive and quantitative framework for the origins of rate acceleration in this enzyme family. The authors highlight precise positioning of catalytic residues, ground state destabilization, and motion that is flexible but restricted along a productive path as key factors in rate acceleration by serine proteases. —Michael A. Funk Enzymes exist in ensembles of states that encode the energetics underlying their catalysis. Conformational ensembles built from 1231 structures of 17 serine proteases revealed atomic-level changes across their reaction states. By comparing the enzymatic and solution reaction, we identified molecular features that provide catalysis and quantified their energetic contributions to catalysis. Serine proteases precisely position their reactants in destabilized conformers, creating a downhill energetic gradient that selectively favors the motions required for reaction while limiting off-pathway conformational states. The same catalytic features have repeatedly evolved in proteases and additional enzymes across multiple distinct structural folds. Our ensemble-function analyses revealed previously unknown catalytic features, provided quantitative models based on simple physical and chemical principles, and identified motifs recurrent in nature that may inspire enzyme design.},

Fagerberg et al . combined CRISPR/Cas9-gene editing with single-cell RNA sequencing to examine how the deletion of genes in mouse T cells affected the formation of these different states during immune responses. The transcription factor KLF2 was required to maintain the availability of cells with the potential to form functional effectors and suppressed cells from acquiring an exhausted phenotype after infection with acute lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. In the context of tumors, KLF2 expression was linked to maintaining stem-like T cells and limiting terminal dysfunction. — Sarah H. Ross Naïve CD8 T cells have the potential to differentiate into a spectrum of functional states during an immune response. How these developmental decisions are made and what mechanisms exist to suppress differentiation toward alternative fates remains unclear. We employed in vivo CRISPR-Cas9–based perturbation sequencing to assess the role of ~40 transcription factors (TFs) and epigenetic modulators in T cell fate decisions. Unexpectedly, we found that knockout of the TF Klf2 resulted in aberrant differentiation to exhausted-like CD8 T cells during acute infection. KLF2 was required to suppress the exhaustion-promoting TF TOX and to enable the TF TBET to drive effector differentiation. KLF2 was also necessary to maintain a polyfunctional tumor-specific progenitor state. Thus, KLF2 provides effector CD8 T cell lineage fidelity and suppresses the exhaustion program.},

  abstract     = {The efficiency of the oxygen evolution reaction, the anodic process in commercial electrochemical hydrogen production, is often constrained by the durability of catalysts, especially under acidic conditions. By controlling the nucleation of iridium nanocatalysts on a continuously ripening cerium oxide support through sonication and thermal treatment, Shi et al . effectively embedded the nanocatalysts within the oxide matrix. This approach prevents nanocatalysts from detaching and agglomerating during operation, yielding exceptional efficiency and ultrastable performance (see the Perspective by Pendergast and Boettcher). Moreover, the strategy is adaptable to other compound systems, opening avenues for the development of additional high-performance catalysts. —Jack Huang The future deployment of terawatt-scale proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) technology necessitates development of an efficient oxygen evolution catalyst with low cost and long lifetime. Currently, the stability of the most active iridium (Ir) catalysts is impaired by dissolution, redeposition, detachment, and agglomeration of Ir species. Here we present a ripening-induced embedding strategy that securely embeds the Ir catalyst in a cerium oxide support. Cryogenic electron tomography and all-atom kinetic Monte Carlo simulations reveal that synchronizing the growth rate of the support with the nucleation rate of Ir, regulated by sonication, is pivotal for successful synthesis. A PEMWE using this catalyst achieves a cell voltage of 1.72 volts at a current density of 3 amperes per square centimeter with an Ir loading of just 0.3 milligrams per square centimeter and a voltage degradation rate of 1.33 microvolts per hour, as demonstrated by a 6000-hour accelerated aging test.},

Intuitively, highly conducting metals are the materials of choice, providing for long plasmon lifetime. Ruta et al . looked at the so-called “bad metal” molybdenum oxide dichloride, in which electronic correlations give rise to high resistivity. Surprisingly, they observed plasmons with very long lifetimes. The unexpected finding of long-lifetime plasmons may provide a route to expanding the choice of materials for nanophotonic applications. —Ian S. Osborne Correlated metals may exhibit unusually high resistivity that increases linearly in temperature, breaking through the Mott-Ioffe-Regel bound, above which coherent quasiparticles are destroyed. The fate of collective charge excitations, or plasmons, in these systems is a subject of debate. Several studies have suggested that plasmons are overdamped, whereas other studies have detected propagating plasmons. In this work, we present direct nano-optical images of low-loss hyperbolic plasmon polaritons (HPPs) in the correlated van der Waals metal MoOCl 2 . HPPs are plasmon-photon modes that waveguide through extremely anisotropic media and are remarkably long-lived in MoOCl 2 . Photoemission data presented here reveal a highly anisotropic Fermi surface, reconstructed and made partly incoherent, likely through electronic interactions as explained by many-body theory. HPPs remain long-lived despite this, revealing previously unseen imprints of many-body effects on plasmonic collective modes.},

However, direct measurements of stream network variability have been limited to a handful of small drainage basins. We estimated the variability of stream network length for 14,765 gauged basins across the contiguous United States using measured streamflow distributions and topography-based estimates of how sensitive each stream network is to changing landscape wetness (the network’s elasticity). We find that the median US stream network is five times longer during annual high-flow conditions than during annual low-flow conditions. Stream networks are more dynamic in some regions than in others, driven by regional differences in both hydroclimatology and the networks’ elasticity in response to hydroclimatic forcing.},

The physical size of the intrinsic eight-membered rings allows only water molecules to pass through while blocking a wide range of hydrated ions due to their larger size. The performance can be tuned by controlling the density of the eight-membered rings. Optimized membranes demonstrate both ultrahigh water-to-sodium chloride selectivity and exceptional water permeance. —Marc S. Lavine Two-dimensional (2D) materials have long been considered as ideal platforms for developing separation membranes. However, it is difficult to generate uniform subnanometer pores over large areas on 2D materials. We report that the well-defined eight-membered ring (8-MR) pores, typically formed at the boundaries of two antiparallel grains of monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ), can serve as molecular sieves for efficient water-ion separation. The density of grain boundaries and, consequently, the number of 8-MR pores can be tuned by regulating the grain size. Optimized MoS 2 membranes outperformed the state-of-the-art membranes in forward osmosis tests by demonstrating both ultrahigh water/sodium chloride selectivity and exceptional water permeance.

Using foraging patterns and success linked to ocean conditions, the authors were able to successfully hindcast twilight zone fish abundance. Such hindcasting success facilitated future predictions. Elephant seals can thus provide insight into how this hidden but essential system responds to external changes. —Sacha Vignieri The open ocean twilight zone holds most of the global fish biomass but is poorly understood owing to difficulties of measuring subsurface ecosystem processes at scale. We demonstrate that a wide-ranging carnivore—the northern elephant seal—can serve as an ecosystem sentinel for the twilight zone. We link ocean basin–scale foraging success with oceanographic indices to estimate twilight zone fish abundance five decades into the past, and into the future. We discovered that a small variation in maternal foraging success amplified into larger changes in offspring body mass and enormous variation in first-year survival and recruitment.

We tracked two-decadal changes in groundwater in Greater Los Angeles using seismic ambient-field interferometry. The derived seismic hydrographs reveal distinct expressions of groundwater and surficial water droughts: Whereas surface and near-surface water storage nearly fully recovered in the epic wet season of 2023, only about 25% of the groundwater lost since 2006 was restored.

  abstract     = {Although overall food intake is attenuated when we feel sated or full, this state is associated with an increased desire to eat sweet foods such as desserts. It is unclear why sugar appetite is selectively stimulated in satiety states. Minère et al . found that pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons from the arcuate nucleus send projections to the paraventricular thalamus. Unlike most other POMC neuron projections, these do not release α-melanocyte–stimulating hormone. Rather, they produce the appetite-stimulating opioid β⁠-endorphin, which selectively inhibits postsynaptic neurons in the paraventricular thalamus expressing µ-opioid receptors, and this drives sugar consumption in the fed state (see the Perspective by Farooqi). Blocking this opioid transmission could thus reduce sugar intake and potentially combat binge eating and obesity. —Peter Stern High sugar–containing foods are readily consumed, even after meals and beyond fullness sensation (e.g., as desserts). Although reward-driven processing of palatable foods can promote overeating, the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie the selective appetite for sugar in states of satiety remain unclear. Hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons are principal regulators of satiety because they decrease food intake through excitatory melanocortin neuropeptides. We discovered that POMC neurons not only promote satiety in fed conditions but concomitantly switch on sugar appetite, which drives overconsumption. POMC neuron projections to the paraventricular thalamus selectively inhibited postsynaptic neurons through mu-opioid receptor signaling. This opioid circuit was strongly activated during sugar consumption, which was most notable in satiety states. Correspondingly, inhibiting its activity diminished high-sugar diet intake in sated mice.},

  abstract     = {Trace acetylene can be removed from ethylene feedstocks by selective combustion of acetylene. Jacob et al . found that the lattice oxygen of bismuth oxide can combust acetylene with more than 99% selectivity for gas streams containing equimolar or dilute amounts acetylene in ethylene. Lattice oxygen removed by combustion could be regenerated over many cycles by reaction with molecular oxygen. This alternative purification route to semihydrogenation of acetylene does not require elevated pressures and is tolerant to carbon dioxide and water impurities. —Phil Szuromi The requirement for C 2 H 2 concentrations below 2 parts per million (ppm) in gas streams for C 2 H 4 polymerization necessitates its semihydrogenation to C 2 H 4 . We demonstrate selective chemical looping combustion of C 2 H 2 in C 2 H 4 -rich streams by Bi 2 O 3 as an alternative catalytic pathway to reduce C 2 H 2 concentration below 2 ppm. Bi 2 O 3 combusts C 2 H 2 with a first-order rate constant that is 3000 times greater than the rate constant for C 2 H 4 combustion. In successive redox cycles, the lattice O of Bi 2 O 3 can be fully replenished without discernible changes in local Bi coordination or C 2 H 2 combustion selectivity. Heterolytic activation of C–H bonds across Bi–O sites and the higher acidity of C 2 H 2 results in lower barriers for C 2 H 2 activation than C 2 H 4 , enabling selective catalytic hydrocarbon combustion leveraging differences in molecular deprotonation energies.},

  abstract     = {Cancer often exhibits genome-wide hypertranscription, but the mechanisms driving this phenomenon remain unclear. To understand how increased transcription might contribute to cancer progression, Henikoff et al . investigated RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) activity across different tumor types. Mapping RNAPII activity across the whole genome in tumor and normal tissues, the authors found widespread transcriptional changes. They also discovered that RNAPII occupancy at histone genes correlated with tumor aggressiveness, particularly in meningiomas and breast cancers. Elevated RNAPII at histone genes predicted rapid cancer recurrence and corresponded to chromosome losses, suggesting that histone gene hypertranscription may drive overproliferation and genomic instability in cancer. —Di Jiang Genome-wide hypertranscription is common in human cancer and predicts poor prognosis. To understand how hypertranscription might drive cancer, we applied our formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)–cleavage under targeted accessible chromatin method for mapping RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) genome-wide in FFPE sections. We demonstrate global RNAPII elevations in mouse gliomas and assorted human tumors in small clinical samples and discover regional elevations corresponding to de novo HER2 amplifications punctuated by likely selective sweeps. RNAPII occupancy at S-phase-dependent histone genes correlated with WHO grade in meningiomas, accurately predicted rapid recurrence, and corresponded to whole-arm chromosome losses. Elevated RNAPII at histone genes in meningiomas and diverse breast cancers is consistent with histone production being rate-limiting for S-phase progression and histone gene hypertranscription driving overproliferation and aneuploidy in cancer, with general implications for precision oncology.},

These off-site damages may be less than on-site gains—in which case the action is still beneficial but less so than it superficially seems. However, if activities are displaced to more biodiverse (or less productive) places, leakage impacts may exceed local benefits, so that well-intentioned efforts cause net harm. There is a pressing need for leakage effects like this to be acknowledged and as far as possible avoided or mitigated—through demand reduction, careful selection of conservation or restoration sites, or compensatory increases in production in lower-impact areas.},

Unsustainable groundwater use can have detrimental effects such as aquifer depletion, loss of storage capacity, chemical and waste contamination, saltwater intrusion, and rapid land subsidence. Thus, it is essential to accurately track changes in the distribution of groundwater to manage the use and replenishment of these water systems below Earth’s surface. However, conventional groundwater measurements are limited in their ability to map out the spatiotemporal state of aquifers, which makes it challenging to track groundwater storage. On page 758 of this issue, Mao et al . ( 1 ) report how groundwater storage distribution can be monitored in both space and time through measurements of seismic ground vibrations or noise. This approach should enable surveillance of the amounts of subsurface water and enhance the management of sustainable groundwater use.},

Large-scale genome engineering methods effective in model organisms are frequently inapplicable, and systematic studies of gene function are few. We generated more than 175,000 transposon insertions in the Plasmodium knowlesi genome, averaging an insertion every 138 base pairs, and used this “supersaturation” mutagenesis to score essentiality for 98% of genes. The density of mutations allowed mapping of putative essential domains within genes, providing a completely new level of genome annotation for any Plasmodium species. Although gene essentiality was largely conserved across P. knowlesi , Plasmodium falciparum , and rodent malaria model Plasmodium berghei , a large number of shared genes are differentially essential, revealing species-specific adaptations. Our results indicated that Plasmodium essential gene evolution was conditionally linked to adaptive rewiring of metabolic networks for different hosts.},

To help address this problem in a comprehensive way, Liu et al . compiled a massive resource consisting of genetic data on more than 2 million human patients and detailed examination of the kidneys for hundreds of individuals, with a subset studied at single-cell precision. In addition to identifying a multitude of genetic variants that contribute to various types of kidney disease, the authors have devised a genetic scorecard to assist in the identification of additional relevant genes, cell types, and potential therapeutic targets. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich Kidney dysfunction is a major cause of mortality, but its genetic architecture remains elusive. In this study, we conducted a multiancestry genome-wide association study in 2.2 million individuals and identified 1026 (97 previously unknown) independent loci. Ancestry-specific analysis indicated an attenuation of newly identified signals on common variants in European ancestry populations and the power of population diversity for further discoveries. We defined genotype effects on allele-specific gene expression and regulatory circuitries in more than 700 human kidneys and 237,000 cells. We found 1363 coding variants disrupting 782 genes, with 601 genes also targeted by regulatory variants and convergence in 161 genes. Integrating 32 types of genetic information, we present the “Kidney Disease Genetic Scorecard” for prioritizing potentially causal genes, cell types, and druggable targets for kidney disease.},

  abstract     = {The sequence composition, chromatin structure, and transcriptional activity of a genome reflect billions of years of evolution. The introduction of foreign DNA, which can differ substantially from the host genome, often perturbs this evolutionary process. Meneu et al . have shown that, depending on their GC content, large DNA sequences from bacteria and eukaryotes introduced into budding yeast either mingle with other active yeast chromosomes or segregate into an inactive globular compartment (see the Perspective by Fudenberg and Ramani). This spontaneous segregation requires active transcription of the host genome, which is accurately predicted by the underlying DNA sequence. This suggests that chromatin compartmentalization emerged from acquired genomic sequence diversity. —Di Jiang In eukaryotes, DNA-associated protein complexes coevolve with genomic sequences to orchestrate chromatin folding. We investigate the relationship between DNA sequence and the spontaneous loading and activity of chromatin components in the absence of coevolution. Using bacterial genomes integrated into Saccharomyces cerevisiae , which diverged from yeast more than 2 billion years ago, we show that nucleosomes, cohesins, and associated transcriptional machinery can lead to the formation of two different chromatin archetypes, one transcribed and the other silent, independently of heterochromatin formation. These two archetypes also form on eukaryotic exogenous sequences, depend on sequence composition, and can be predicted using neural networks trained on the native genome. They do not mix in the nucleus, leading to a bipartite nuclear compartmentalization, reminiscent of the organization of vertebrate nuclei.},

  abstract     = {It has been proposed that one of the many functions of the sensory cortex is to modify the vigor of instinctive responses by modulation of subcortical circuits. Mederos et al . uncovered a subcortical synaptic plasticity mechanism for learning to suppress instinctive defensive behavior. The critical pathway was the projection from higher-order visual areas posterolateral of the primary visual cortex (area V1) to the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus (vLGN), which modulated instinctive fear responses based on experience. After learning, this pathway was no longer needed. This learning-induced plasticity involved endocannabinoid-mediated long-term suppression of inhibitory synapses onto vLGN neurons activated by posterolateral higher-order visual areas, which decreased presynaptic release probability. —Peter Stern Fast instinctive responses to environmental stimuli can be crucial for survival but are not always optimal. Animals can adapt their behavior and suppress instinctive reactions, but the neural pathways mediating such ethologically relevant forms of learning remain unclear. We found that posterolateral higher visual areas (plHVAs) are crucial for learning to suppress escapes from innate visual threats through a top-down pathway to the ventrolateral geniculate nucleus (vLGN). plHVAs are no longer necessary after learning; instead, the learned behavior relies on plasticity within vLGN populations that exert inhibitory control over escape responses. vLGN neurons receiving input from plHVAs enhance their responses to visual threat stimuli during learning through endocannabinoid-mediated long-term suppression of their inhibitory inputs. We thus reveal the detailed circuit, cellular, and synaptic mechanisms underlying experience-dependent suppression of fear responses.},

  abstract     = {Insulin resistance, often induced by obesity, is the underlying abnormality for type 2 diabetes. Most studies looking at mechanisms for obesity and insulin resistance have examined cells known to play key roles in metabolism, such as those in the liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue. Cho et al . shifted their focus to the vasculature, more specifically, endothelial insulin signaling. The authors discovered that adrenomedullin, a peptide hormone that increases in concentration in the setting of obesity, inhibits insulin signaling in the endothelium of both humans and mice. In addition to examining the underlying mechanism, the authors showed in mouse models that an adrenomedullin receptor antagonist has beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity, suggesting a potential direction for future therapeutic approaches. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich Insulin resistance is a hallmark of obesity-associated type 2 diabetes. Insulin’s actions go beyond metabolic cells and also involve blood vessels, where insulin increases capillary blood flow and delivery of insulin and nutrients. We show that adrenomedullin, whose plasma levels are increased in obese humans and mice, inhibited insulin signaling in human endothelial cells through protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B–mediated dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor. In obese mice lacking the endothelial adrenomedullin receptor, insulin-induced endothelial nitric oxide–synthase activation and skeletal muscle perfusion were increased. Treating mice with adrenomedullin mimicked the effect of obesity and induced endothelial and systemic insulin resistance. Endothelial loss or blockade of the adrenomedullin receptor improved obesity-induced insulin resistance. These findings identify a mechanism underlying obesity-induced systemic insulin resistance and suggest approaches to treat obesity-associated type 2 diabetes.},

  abstract     = {In a heterogeneous soil landscape, plant root systems must locate water. Scharwies et al . found that some maize varieties produce lateral roots at locations where water is limited, whereas others more efficiently direct growth toward water. Uncovering the genetic basis for this trait variance, the authors found that auxin, ethylene, and an arabinogalactan protein work together to encourage lateral root development where water is present while suppressing lateral roots from forming on drier parts of the root. Variation in genes underlying these components leads to variation in root hydropatterning, potentially affecting the success of some maize varieties in drier environments. —Madeleine Seale Plants grow complex root systems to extract unevenly distributed resources from soils. Spatial differences in soil moisture are perceived by root tips, leading to the patterning of new root branches toward available water in a process called hydropatterning. Little is known about hydropatterning behavior and its genetic basis in crop plants. Here, we developed an assay to measure hydropatterning in maize and revealed substantial differences between tropical/subtropical and temperate maize breeding germplasm that likely resulted from divergent selection. Genetic analysis of hydropatterning confirmed the regulatory role of auxin and revealed that the gaseous hormone ethylene locally inhibits root branching from air-exposed tissues. Our results demonstrate how distinct signaling pathways translate spatial patterns of water availability to developmental programs that determine root architecture.},

Much of this ability has been attributed to the complex multiscale organization of the structure of the shrimp’s dactyl club and its resultant mechanical properties. Alderete et al . used fast spectroscopy techniques to disclose the effect of the club structure in terms of its phononic shielding abilities (see the Perspective by Zavattieri), showing that it can effectively filter shear waves to mitigate impact forces during strikes. —Marc S. Lavine The powerful strikes generated by the smasher mantis shrimp require it to possess a robust protection mechanism to withstand the resultant forces. Although recent studies have suggested that phononic bandgaps complement the mantis shrimp’s defensive suite, direct experimental evidence for this mechanism has remained elusive. In this work, we explored the phononic properties of the mantis shrimp’s dactyl club using laser ultrasonic techniques and numerical simulations. Our results demonstrate that the dactyl club’s periodic region functions as a dispersive, high-quality graded system, exhibiting Bloch harmonics, flat dispersion branches, ultraslow wave modes, and wide Bragg bandgaps in the lower megahertz range. These features effectively shield the shrimp from harmful high-frequency stress waves generated by cavitation bubble collapse events during impact.},

This distribution pertains to the frequency of relative word use and is believed to reflect cultural transmission of language. This pattern has also been found in infants during the beginnings of language production. The approach used to study these preverbal patterns allows for the study of songs and calls in other species. Arnon et al . used this approach to study humpback whale song collected over 8 years (see the Perspective by Whiten and Youngblood). They found clear evidence of a Zipf distribution in this song, as well as other hallmarks of human language such as statistical coherence and brevity of subsequences. —Sacha Vignieri Humpback whale song is a culturally transmitted behavior. Human language, which is also culturally transmitted, has statistically coherent parts whose frequency distribution follows a power law. These properties facilitate learning and may therefore arise because of their contribution to the faithful transmission of language over multiple cultural generations. If so, we would expect to find them in other culturally transmitted systems. In this study, we applied methods based on infant speech segmentation to 8 years of humpback recordings, uncovering in whale song the same statistical structure that is a hallmark of human language. This commonality, in two evolutionarily distant species, points to the role of learning and cultural transmission in the emergence of properties thought to be unique to human language.},

  abstract     = {The symmetry and topology of physical systems are closely related to the symmetries governing the topological properties. Quasicrystals are ordered systems but have no translation or rotational symmetries. Theoretical work has shown that quasicrystals can be understood as the projection of a higher-dimensional crystal onto a lower-dimensional space. Tsesses et al . developed a plasmonic-based system in which to study the implications of that projection for topological invariants. When going into four-dimensional space and projecting it down into two dimensions, the complex dynamics of light waves on the plasmonic quasicrystal exhibited motions of four-dimensional topological charge vectors and associated topological charge conservation laws. This approach allows the study of topological systems in higher dimensions. — Ian S. Osborne According to Noether’s theorem, symmetries in a physical system are intertwined with conserved quantities. These symmetries often determine the system topology, which is made ever more complex with increased dimensionality. Quasicrystals have neither translational nor global rotational symmetry, yet they intrinsically inhabit a higher-dimensional space in which symmetry resurfaces. Here, we discovered topological charge vectors in four dimensions (4D) that govern the real-space topology of 2D quasicrystals and reveal their inherent conservation laws. We demonstrate control over the topology in pentagonal plasmonic quasilattices, mapped by both phase-resolved and time-domain near-field microscopy, showing that their temporal evolution continuously tunes the 2D projections of their distinct 4D topologies. Our work provides a route to experimentally probe the thermodynamic properties of quasicrystals and topological physics in 4D and above.},

To test hypotheses about their evolution, we sequenced the genome of Silene latifolia , in which giant heteromorphic sex chromosomes were first discovered in 1923. It has long been known that the Y chromosome consists mainly of a male-specific region that does not recombine with the X chromosome and carries the sex-determining genes and genes with other male functions. However, only with a whole Y chromosome assembly can candidate genes be validated experimentally and their locations determined and related to the suppression of recombination. We describe the genomic changes as the ancestral chromosome evolved into the current XY pair, testing ideas about the evolution of large nonrecombining regions and the mechanisms that created the present recombination pattern.},

However, the dioecious plant Silene latifolia has a giant ~550-megabase Y chromosome, which has remained unsequenced so far. We used a long- and short-read hybrid approach to obtain a high-quality male genome. Comparative analysis of the sex chromosomes with their homologs in outgroups showed that the Y is highly rearranged and degenerated. Recombination suppression between X and Y extended in several steps and triggered a massive accumulation of repeats on the Y as well as in the nonrecombining pericentromeric region of the X, leading to giant sex chromosomes. Using sex phenotype mutants, we identified candidate sex-determining genes on the Y in locations consistent with their favoring recombination suppression events 11 and 5 million years ago.},

In this review, we show that at such a level of warming, the Arctic would be transformed beyond contemporary recognition: Virtually every day of the year would have air temperatures higher than preindustrial extremes, the Arctic Ocean would be essentially ice free for several months in summer, the area of Greenland that reaches melting temperatures for at least a month would roughly quadruple, and the area of permafrost would be roughly half of what it was in preindustrial times. These geophysical changes go along with widespread ecosystem disruptions and infrastructure damage, which, as we show here, could be substantially reduced by increased efforts to limit global warming.},

Evolutionary histories and functional ecology are well understood only for vertebrates, whereas research on invertebrates is largely limited to species descriptions and some studies on environmental tolerances. Knowledge on Antarctic vegetation cover showcases the challenges of characterizing population trends for most groups. Recent community-level microbial studies have provided insights into the functioning of life at its limits. Overall, biotic interactions remain largely unknown across all groups, restricted to basic information on trophic level placement. Insufficient knowledge of many groups limits the understanding of ecological processes on the continent. Remedies for the current situation rely on identifying the caveats of each ecological discipline and finding targeted solutions. Such precise delimitation of knowledge gaps will enable a more aware, representative, and strategic systematic conservation planning of Antarctica.},

Major knowledge gaps in critical processes—spanning the atmosphere, ocean, ice sheets, underlying beds, ice shelves, and sea ice—create uncertainties in future projections, hindering climate adaptation and risk assessments of ice intervention strategies. Antarctica’s ice sheet could contribute 28 centimeters to sea level by 2100, and potentially more if we surpass warming thresholds that trigger instabilities and rapid retreat. We review recent advances in understanding the changing stability of the ice sheet margins and identify key processes that require further research. Progress requires high-resolution satellite data, targeted field campaigns, improved modeling, and refined theory. Increased investment and interdisciplinary collaboration are essential to uncovering Antarctica’s hidden processes and reducing uncertainties in future projections.},

Sung only by males, the songs penetrate the ocean for many miles and are suspected to attract females for mating through their musical complexity. Year by year, the songs may become more complex and perhaps more alluring to females. However, in the southwestern Pacific, a totally new song emerges every few years that is adopted across the ocean ( 2 ). The rapidity with which new songs and variations are copied demonstrates that they are culturally transmitted, but the evolutionary forces that shape the complex song structures over time have remained mysterious. On page 649 of this issue, Arnon et al . ( 3 ) report that fundamental laws identified in quantitative linguistics and in the culturally evolved learnability of human languages apply to whale song.},

Evolutionary contingency constrains relationships between genome sequence, organization, and function. However, technologies for engineering ever-larger stretches of DNA now enable synthetic regulatory reconstitution experiments ( 2 – 4 ) in which foreign DNA, freed from historical contingency, can be placed directly into a host cell. Such “in hostia” reconstitutions complement classic in vitro approaches for determining the rules of genomic regulation. Notably, in hostia reconstitutions assess the regulatory “ground state” of a host cellular environment—that is, the propensity for inserted DNA to be active or silent.

  abstract     = {Architected metamaterials—artificial structures with unusual properties that arise from tailored geometry—can guide deformation and energy flow in desirable ways. A subset of metamaterials called phononic bandgap materials can reflect, scatter, or absorb energy by manipulating the way mechanical waves interact with the periodic structures of the material. Waves within a specific frequency range cannot travel through such a material, creating a phononic bandgap. This effect is useful for technologies such as acoustic imaging, acoustic cloaking, shock proofing, and energy harvesting. Architected metamaterials are artificially made; does a similar phenomenon exist in nature? On page 659 of this issue, Alderete et al. ( 1 ) report that a mantis shrimp’s dactyl club has phononic bandgaps in which stress waves of specific frequency ranges are filtered. This demonstrates that natural ma terials can exhibit phononic behavior that is observed in artificial metamaterials, opening the possibility for designing bioinspired and biohybrid phononic bandgap materials.},

For biohybrid robotic swimmers assembled with tissue engineering, this is problematic because most devices operate at different length scales than their naturally occurring counterparts, resulting in reduced performance. To overcome these challenges, here, we demonstrate how machine learning–directed optimization (ML-DO) can be used to inform the design of a biohybrid robot, outperforming other nonlinear optimization techniques, such as Bayesian optimization, in the selection of high-performance geometries. We show how this approach can be used to maximize the thrust generated by a tissue-engineered mobuliform miniray. This results in devices that can swim at the millimeter scale while more closely preserving natural locomotive scaling laws. Overall, this work provides a quantitatively rigorous approach for the engineering design of muscular structure-function relationships in an automated fashion.},

The MuMuTA can provide linear actuation with high contractile force (~8 millinewtons) and high contractile length (~4 millimeters), which can be converted into the flexion of multijointed fingers by a cable-driven mechanism. We successfully powered the biohybrid hand achieving individual control of fingers and a variety of motions using different signaling controls.

We report a fast (5.1 centimeters per second translation and 195 degrees per second rotation), centimeter-scale swimming robot with high maneuverability and autonomous untethered operation. Locomotion is enabled by a pair of soft, millimeter-thin, undulating pectoral fins, in which traveling waves are electrically excited to generate propulsion. The actuators, robot design, and power supply are codesigned to enable high-performance locomotion in a scaled-down system. A single soft electrohydraulic actuator per side generates the traveling wave. A compact and lightweight power supply enables untethered operation, made possible by decreasing the operating voltage of the electrohydraulic actuators to below 500 volts and their power consumption to 35 milliwatts. By an experimental study and by modeling, we determined optimum dimensions and operating conditions across designs and size scales. The robots navigate through narrow spaces and through grassy plants and push objects weighing more than 16 times their body weight. Such robots can allow exploration of complex environments as well as continuous measurement of plant and water parameters for aquafarming.},

Facilitated by fast physical reasoning, humans are able to rapidly alter their compliance, enhancing robustness and safety in active environments. Transferring these capabilities to robotics is of utmost importance particularly as major space agencies begin investigating the potential of cooperative robotic teams in space. In this scenario, robots in orbit or on planetary surfaces are meant to support astronauts in exploration, maintenance, and habitat building to reduce costs and risks of space missions. A major challenge for interactive robot teams is establishing the capability to act in and interact with dynamic environments. Analogous to humans, the robot should be not only particularly compliant in case of unexpected collisions with other systems but also able to cooperatively handle objects requiring accurate pose estimation and fast trajectory planning. Here, we show that these challenges can be attenuated through an enhancement of active robot compliance introducing a virtual plastic first-order impedance component. We present how elasto-plastic compliance can be realized via energy-based detection of active environments and how evasive motions can be enabled through adaptive plastic compliance. Two space teleoperation experiments using different robotic assets confirm the potential of the method to enhance robustness in interaction with articulated objects and facilitate robot cooperation. An experiment in a health care facility presents how the same method analogously solidifies robotic interactions in human-robot shared environments by giving the robot a subordinate role.},

  abstract     = {Although legged robots have demonstrated effective mobility in some natural settings, as robot size decreases, obstacles in their environment become challenging to overcome. Small arthropods scale obstacles many times their size through jumps powered by mechanisms that overcome speed and power limitations of muscle alone. The motivation for this study was to explore the marriage of impulsive (jumping) and nonimpulsive (cyclic legged ambulation) behaviors in a centimeter-scale robot. Here, jumping is achieved by striking the ground with a bioinspired appendage connected to a parallel linkage. As the linkage configuration passes through the singularity, a torque reversal occurs whereby elastic energy slowly stored by force-dense velocity-limited shape memory alloy actuators is rapidly released. A passively driven elastic hinge is introduced in the striking arm to mediate ground contact forces and direct jumping. High-speed video recording of the 14-millisecond launch phase reveals previously undocumented takeoff dynamics closely resembling those of springtails. A dynamic model was derived, and an experimentally validated simulation was used to optimize the design of key components. The 2.2-gram, 6.1-centimeter-long mechanism achieved a maximum horizontal jumping distance of 1.4 meters (23 body lengths), surpassing that of similarly sized insects. The mechanism was integrated with an agile quadrupedal microrobot with leg articulation suitable to achieve the ideal jumping posture. The platform demonstrated repeatable directional takeoffs and upright landings, enabling complex maneuvers to overcome obstacles and gaps. Last, we used this bioinspired robot to offer reflection on hypotheses related to springtail jumping behavior.},

Excessive or insufficient indentation of the injection cannula into the retina or motion of the cannula with respect to the retina can result in retinal trauma or incorrect placement of the therapeutic product. Robotic assistance can potentially enable the surgeon to more precisely position the injection cannula and maintain its position for a prolonged period of time. However, head motion is common among patients undergoing eye surgery, complicating subretinal injections, yet it is often not considered in the evaluation of robotic assistance. No prior study has both included head motion during an evaluation of robotic assistance and demonstrated a significant improvement in the ability to perform subretinal injections compared with the manual approach. In a hybrid ex vivo and in situ study in which an enucleated eye was mounted on a human volunteer, we demonstrate that head-mounting a high-precision teleoperated surgical robot to passively reduce undesirable relative motion between the robot and the eye results in a bleb-formation success rate on moving eyes that is significantly higher than the manual success rates reported in the literature even on stationary enucleated eyes.},

  abstract     = {Robotic locomotion has shown substantial advancements, yet robots still lack the versatility and agility shown by animals navigating complex terrains. This limits their applicability in complex environments where they could be highly beneficial. Unlike existing robots that rely on intricate perception systems to construct models of both themselves and their surroundings, a more bioinspired approach leverages reconfiguration to adapt a robot’s morphology to its environment. Although interest in such multimodal, terrain-adaptive robots is increasing, their capacity for morphological reconfiguration often remains confined to specific body parts or comes at the expense of increased system complexity and reduced locomotion efficiency. Our study seeks to enhance robotic locomotion by developing robots that can actively reconfigure their morphology, altering their physical properties and leveraging their adaptability to navigate efficiently in diverse environments. We demonstrate how combining a compliant structure with morphological reconfiguration allowed a robot to transition between flat and spherical forms, enabling autonomous, multimodal locomotion—driving, rolling, and swimming—across complex terrains with minimal sensing. By actively reconfiguring its morphology to adapt physical properties for compliant interactions, the robot enhanced locomotion across rough, diverse environments. Leveraging its adaptability in different locomotion modes to navigate a 4.5-kilometer path across mountainous, aquatic, and urban terrains, the robot outperformed traditional and multimodal robots in terms of versatility, energy efficiency, and robustness. Developing versatile, energy-efficient, compliant robots capable of reconfiguring their morphology could substantially enhance autonomous navigation, opening up broader applications in unstructured environments, from environmental monitoring to disaster response and extraterrestrial exploration.},

  abstract     = {Genetic screens for suppressors of mutant phenotypes are valuable tools for identifying components of signaling pathways. Schwartz and Sternberg developed a screening method on the basis of genome sequencing that does not require the recovery of viable animals. Using this approach, they identified mutations that partially suppressed the lethality caused by loss of the epidermal growth factor receptor homolog LET-23 in Caenorhabditis elegans . The suppressing mutations included those that affected genes encoding regulators of the small guanosine triphosphatase Rho and nuclear proteins that protect against DNA damage. This method can be used to screen for modifiers that may suppress a phenotype in only a subset of tissues but do not fully restore function to enable the recovery of fertile adults. —Annalisa M. VanHook Suppressor screens can identify genetic modifiers of biochemical pathways but generally require that the suppressed mutant be viable and fertile. We developed a screening method that obviated this requirement and enabled the identification of mutations that partially suppressed the early developmental arrest and lethality caused by loss of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor ortholog LET-23 in Caenorhabditis elegans . We chemically mutagenized animals carrying the loss-of-function allele let-23 ( sy15 ), recovered let-23 ( sy15 ) homozygotes that escaped early developmental arrest but were nevertheless inviable, and sequenced their genomes. Testing of candidate causal mutations identified 11 genes that, when mutated, mitigated the early lethality caused by loss of EGF signaling. These included genes encoding homologs of the small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Ras ( let-60 ), which is a downstream effector of LET-23, and of regulators of the small GTPase Rho, including the homolog of the phosphotyrosine-binding protein TENSIN ( tns-1 ). We also recovered suppressing mutations in genes encoding nuclear proteins that protect against DNA damage, including the homolog of MutS homolog 4 ( him-14 ). Genetic experiments were consistent with the repression of Rho activity or the activation of the DNA damage response compensating for the loss of EGF signaling. This sequencing-based, whole-animal screening method may be adapted to other organisms to enable the identification of mutations for which the phenotype does not allow the recovery of viable animals.},

  abstract     = {The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is made up of multicellular contacts referred to as the neurovascular unit (NVU) that mediate the exchange of fluid and nutrients in the brain. Sona et al. found that tight control of the abundance of the phosphatase PTEN in excitatory neurons is critical to the postnatal development of the NVU in mice. Mice lacking the mRNA regulator Ago2 in glutamatergic neurons had decreased NVU development and defective BBB integrity. These effects were mediated through loss of Ago2-dependent suppression of Pten , leading to decreases in signaling that support neuronal survival and migration. Thus, Ago2 in excitatory neurons supports brain development through formation of the BBB. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Proper formation of the complex neurovascular unit (NVU) along with the blood-brain barrier is critical for building and sustaining a healthy, functioning central nervous system. The RNA binding protein argonaute2 (Ago2) mediates microRNA (miRNA)–mediated gene silencing, which is critical for many facets of brain development, including NVU development. Here, we found that Ago2 in glutamatergic neurons was critical for NVU formation in the developing cortices of mice. Glutamatergic neuron–specific loss of Ago2 diminished synaptic formation, neuronal-to-endothelial cell contacts, and morphogenesis of the brain vasculature, ultimately compromising the integrity of the blood-brain barrier. Ago2 facilitated miRNA targeting of phosphatase and tensin homolog ( Pten ) mRNA, which encodes a phosphatase that modulates reelin-dependent phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)–Akt signaling within the glutamatergic subpopulation. Conditionally deleting Pten in Ago2 -deficient neurons restored Akt2 phosphorylation as well as postnatal development and survival. Several mutations in AGO2 impair small RNA silencing and are associated with Lessel-Kreienkamp syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder. When expressed in a neuronal cell line, these human AGO2 loss-of-function variants failed to suppress PTEN, resulting in attenuated PI3K-Akt signaling, further indicating that dysregulation of Ago2 function may contribute to both impaired development and neurological disorders. Together, these results identify Ago2 as central to the engagement of neurons with blood vessels in the developing brain.},

The ubiquitin ligase APC/C and its cofactor Cdh1 (APC/C Cdh1 ) can trigger the degradation of the CPC in somatic cells, but its activity is constitutively low during mitosis in stem cells. Tsunematsu et al. investigated the stability of the CPC in human embryonic carcinoma (hEC) cells. In hEC cells undergoing mitosis, a stable CPC depended on the low activity of APC/C Cdh1 , and depletion of Aurora-B and Borealin by APC/C Cdh1 resulted in spontaneous hEC cell differentiation. These findings indicate a mechanism of holding hEC cells in a pluripotent state on the basis of APC/C Cdh1 activity. —Amy E. Baek Human embryonic carcinoma (hEC) cells are derived from teratocarcinomas, exhibit robust proliferation, have a high differentiation potential, are the malignant counterparts of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), and are considered hESC-like. The chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), made up of the microtuble binding protein Borealin, the kinase Aurora-B, the CPC-stabilizing inner centromere protein (INCENP), and the inhibitor of apoptosis family member Survivin, regulates cell division and is active exclusively during mitosis in somatic cells. The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome and its cofactor Cdh1 (APC/C Cdh1 ) is a ubiquitylating complex that catalyzes the degradation of Aurora-B and Borealin in somatic cells but has low activity during interphase in hESCs. Here, we found that Borealin and Aurora-B exhibited sustained stability throughout the cell cycle of hEC cells due to low APC/C Cdh1 activity. In contrast with somatic cells, CPC activity persisted across the cell cycle of hEC cells because of diminished APC/C Cdh1 activity. Disrupting the CPC complex by depleting its constituents triggered spontaneous differentiation in hEC cells. As hEC cells differentiated, APC/C Cdh1 activation curtailed CPC activity. Inactivating the CPC by pharmacologically inhibiting Aurora-B induced hEC cell differentiation by activating the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program. Hence, APC/C Cdh1 -mediated termination of CPC activity triggered hEC cell differentiation. Collectively, these findings demonstrate a role for the CPC in governing hESC cell fate.},

  abstract     = {The vasopressin type 2 receptor (V 2 R) is a G protein–coupled receptor that regulates fluid balance and can be activated by the ligands arginine vasopressin and oxytocin. Teixeira et al. found that sustained V 2 R signaling depended on the identity of the activating ligand but was independent of receptor internalization by the scaffolding protein β-arrestin. V 2 R-induced signaling occurred primarily at the plasma membrane, and its duration depended on the residence time of the ligand on the receptor, which was longer after activation with arginine vasopressin than with oxytocin. Moreover, V 2 R internalization into endosomes induced by β-arrestin helped to terminate V 2 R signaling due to ligand dissociation from V 2 R caused by acidified endosomal pH. These results show that the overall duration of V 2 R signaling at the plasma membrane is determined by ligand residence time on the receptor. —Wei Wong The canonical model of G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling comprises G protein activation at the plasma membrane, followed by receptor phosphorylation and β-arrestin recruitment, which leads to receptor desensitization and endocytosis. However, the activation of some GPCRs results in sustained G protein signaling from intracellular compartments in a manner reportedly dependent on β-arrestin and receptor endocytosis. The vasopressin type 2 receptor (V 2 R) can be activated by two structurally similar hormones, arginine vasopressin and oxytocin, both of which stimulate the production of the second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). In this study, we showed that sustained V 2 R signaling and endosomal Gα s (stimulatory G protein alpha subunit) translocation could occur without β-arrestin–mediated receptor endocytosis and was primarily controlled by the residence time of the ligand on the receptor. β-Arrestin had opposing effects on sustained signaling: It facilitated receptor internalization into endosomes, where it activated Gα s , and promoted cAMP production from this compartment. However, β-arrestin–mediated receptor endocytosis also induced ligand dissociation due to the acidic endosomal environment, thereby limiting the signal. Overall, our data suggest that signals originating at the plasma membrane play a dominant role in sustained V 2 R signaling stimulated by arginine vasopressin.},

Funk et al. found that these oncogenes can be disrupted in HNSCCs by targeting the kinase LZK, another commonly overexpressed protein encoded by MAP3K13 . LZK stabilized c-MYC through kinase-dependent activity, whereas LZK stabilized mutant p53 through a kinase-independent physical interaction. A PROTAC drug that degraded LZK resulted in the destabilization of both proteins, and a catalytic inhibitor of LZK slowed the growth of MAP3K13 -amplified HNSCCs in mice, highlighting LZK as a target for treating HNSCC. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli The worldwide annual frequency and lethality of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is not improving, and thus, new therapeutic approaches are needed. Approximately 70% of HNSCC cases have either amplification or overexpression of MAP3K13 , which encodes the kinase LZK. Here, we found that LZK is a therapeutic target in HNSCC and that small-molecule inhibition of its catalytic function decreased the viability of HNSCC cells with amplified MAP3K13 . Inhibition of LZK suppressed tumor growth in MAP3K13 -amplified xenografts derived from HNSCC patients. LZK stabilized the transcription factor c-MYC through its kinase activity and gain-of-function mutants of p53 in a kinase-independent manner. We designed a proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) that induced LZK degradation, leading to decreased abundance of both c-MYC and gain-of-function p53, and reduced the viability of HNSCC cells. Our findings demonstrate that LZK-targeted therapeutics, particularly PROTACs, may be effective in treating HNSCCs with MAP3K13 amplification.},

We know that an individual’s risk for addiction is determined by interactions between genetics and environment and that only a minute fraction of chemical agents share the ability to act on this vulnerability to induce a state of addiction. Repeated exposure to these drugs causes addiction through repeated activation of dopaminergic transmission (and many other actions) in the brain, inducing changes at the molecular, cellular, and synaptic levels that, over time, rewire the circuitry throughout the limbic system. In this Review, I discuss how we are gaining a clearer picture of this drug-induced plasticity—some of which is shared by all addictive drugs, whereas other aspects are specific to certain drug classes—and of the ways in which these adaptations mediate the range of behavioral abnormalities that define the addicted state. Despite the challenges, there is reason for optimism in translating this rich biological understanding of addiction into improved treatments for the many individuals burdened by this illness around the world.},

  abstract     = {Ghrelin is a peptide hormone that acts on its G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) to stimulate appetite and food intake. Signal transduction by GPCRs requires activation of intracellular G proteins in a process involving transient conformational changes in both the receptor and the Gα subunit. Mannes et al . developed synthetic peptides that mimicked the stabilizing effect of Gα q -containing heterotrimers on the active conformation of the ghrelin receptor. Biochemical assays using these peptidomimetics demonstrated that G protein coupling allosterically increased the receptor’s affinity for ghrelin and that G protein activation occurred through a series of distinct interactions with the receptor. The findings demonstrate that G protein activation is a multistep process that may also affect the sensitivity of the ghrelin receptor. —Annalisa M. VanHook G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling is a dynamic process involving various conformational intermediates in addition to those captured in static three-dimensional structures. Here, we used newly developed G protein peptidomimetics to characterize the interactions of the ghrelin receptor (GHSR) with G proteins. Coupling to the G protein peptidomimetic not only affected the conformational features of the cytoplasmic regions of the receptor where the G protein binds but also allosterically affected the extracellular ligand-binding pocket. These conformational and allosteric changes increased the affinity of G protein–coupled GHSR for the endogenous agonist ghrelin. In addition, our data identified different complexes along the G protein activation pathway that differed in the engagement of the Gα q C-terminal helix. Given that this helix is the main link between the activated receptor and the Gα nucleotide-binding pocket, these findings suggested a stepwise process involving distinct states in GPCR-catalyzed G protein activation. Collectively, our results provide evidence for the dynamic behavior of GPCR–G protein signaling complexes, with such dynamics most likely contributing to signaling selectivity and/or efficacy.},
