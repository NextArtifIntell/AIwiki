  abstract     = {Data clones are defined as multiple copies of the same data among datasets. The presence of data clones between datasets can cause issues such as difficulties in managing data assets and data license violations when using datasets with clones to build AI software. However, detecting data clones is not trivial. The majority of the prior studies in this area rely on structural information to detect data clones (e.g., font size, column header). However, tabular datasets used to build AI software are typically stored without any structural information. In this article, we propose a novel method called SimClone for data clone detection in tabular datasets without relying on structural information. SimClone method utilizes value similarities for data clone detection. We also propose a visualization approach as a part of our SimClone method to help locate the exact position of the cloned data between a dataset pair. Our results show that our SimClone outperforms the current state-of-the-art method by at least 20% in terms of both F1-score and AUC. In addition, SimClone’s visualization component helps identify the exact location of the data clone in a dataset with a Precision@10 value of 0.80 in the top 20 true positive predictions.},

  abstract     = {Infrastructure as Code (IaC) automates IT infrastructure deployment, which is particularly beneficial for continuous releases, for instance, in the context of microservices and cloud systems. Despite its flexibility in application architecture, neglecting security can lead to vulnerabilities. The lack of comprehensive architectural security guidelines for IaC poses challenges in adhering to best practices. We studied how developers interpret IaC scripts (source code) in two IaC technologies, Ansible and Terraform, compared to semi-formal IaC deployment architecture models and metrics regarding design-level security understanding. In a controlled experiment involving ninety-four participants, we assessed the understandability of IaC-based deployment architectures through source code inspection compared to semi-formal representations in models and metrics. We hypothesized that providing semi-formal IaC deployment architecture models and metrics as supplementary material would significantly improve the comprehension of IaC security-related practices, as measured by task correctness . Our findings suggest that semi-formal IaC deployment architecture models and metrics as supplementary material enhance the understandability of IaC security-related practices without significantly increasing duration . We also observed a significant correlation between task correctness and duration when models and metrics were provided.},

  abstract     = {Smart contract-based applications are executed in a blockchain environment, and they cannot directly access data from external systems, which is required for the service provision of these applications. Instead, smart contracts use agents known as blockchain oracles to collect and provide data feeds to the contracts. The functionality and compatibility with smart contract applications need to be considered when selecting the best-fit oracle platform. As the number of oracle alternatives and their features increases, the decision-making process becomes increasingly complex. Selecting the wrong or sub-optimal oracle is costly and may lead to severe security risks. This article provides a decision support model for the oracle selection problem. The model supports smart contract decision-makers in selecting a secure, cost-effective, and feasible oracle platform for their applications. We interviewed oracle co-founders and smart contracts experts to refine and validate the decision model. Two real-world smart contract application case studies were used to evaluate the model. Our model prioritises and suggests more than one possible oracle platform based on the developer’s required criteria, security assessment and cost analysis. Moreover, this guided decision model serves to reveal issues that may go unnoticed if done haphazardly, reduce decision-making efforts and provide a cost-effective solution.},
