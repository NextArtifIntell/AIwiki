  abstract     = {We consider distributed systems of autonomous robots operating in the plane under synchronous Look - Compute - Move ( LCM ) cycles. Prior research on four distinct models assumes robots have unlimited energy. We remove this assumption and investigate systems where robots have limited but renewable energy, requiring inactivity for energy restoration. We analyze the computational impact of this constraint, fully characterizing the relationship between energy-restricted and unrestricted robots. Surprisingly, we show that energy constraints can enhance computational power. Additionally, we study how memory persistence and communication capabilities influence computation under energy constraints. By comparing the four models in this setting, we establish a complete characterization of their computational relationships. A key insight is that energy-limited robots can be modeled as unlimited-energy robots controlled by an adversarial activation scheduler. This provides a novel equivalence framework for analyzing energy-constrained distributed systems.},

  abstract     = {Traditionally, to verify the consistency of a multi-relation database with respect to a set of functional dependencies, one applies the well-known Chase algorithm, which derives new tuples as long as no conflict with some dependency arises. Therefore, the Chase algorithm uses dependencies both as inference rules and as tools to check consistency. If no conflicts occur, the database is declared consistent else inconsistent. If the database is consistent then query answering proceeds as usual, otherwise extracting consistent information from the inconsistent database is an issue, known as consistent query answering. To address this issue, we consider the set T of all tuples built from constants occurring in the database, and we use set theoretic semantics to characterize tuples in T in two orthogonal ways: true/false and conflicting/non-conflicting. Calling ‘consistent’ a tuple which is true and non-conflicting, a ‘repair’ is defined to be a maximal subset of true tuples that satisfies the dependencies and in which as many consitent tuples as possible are true. A query Q is of the form select X where C o n d i t i o n , and a tuple x of T is in the consistent answer of Q if x is in the answer of Q in every repair. Our main contributions are: (a) a novel approach to consistent query answering in multi-relation databases; (b) a modified Chase algorithm to compute true/false and conflicting/non-conflicting tuples; (c) for acyclic functional dependencies, a polynomial-time algorithm computing the exact or approximate consistent answers; (d) a detailed discussion comparing our approach with other related approaches.},

Exploiting this connection, we show that in contrast to the continuous case, adding ‘punctual’ predicates into Q2MLO is still insufficient for the full expressive power of the Monadic First-Order Logic of Order and Metric ( FO[ &lt; , + 1 ] ); as a remedy, we propose a generalisation of the recently proposed Pnueli automata modalities and show that the resulting metric temporal logic is expressively complete for FO[ &lt; , + 1 ] .

In this paper, we consider (the complexity of decision problems related to) the generalisation of this MIS algorithm wherein any starting set is allowed. Two main approaches are leveraged. Firstly, we view the MIS algorithm as a sequential update of a Boolean network according to a permutation of the vertex set. Secondly, we introduce the concept of a constituency of a graph: a set of vertices that is dominated by an independent set. Recognizing a constituency is NP -complete, a fact we leverage repeatedly in our investigation. Our contributions are multiple: we establish that deciding whether all maximal independent sets can be reached from some configuration is coNP -complete; that fixing words (which reach a MIS from any starting configuration) and fixing permutations (briefly, permises) are coNP -complete to recognize; and that permissible graphs (graphs with a permis) are coNP -hard to recognize. We also exhibit large classes of permissible and non-permissible graphs, notably near-comparability graphs which may be of independent interest. Lastly, we extend our study to digraphs, where we search for kernels. Since the natural generalisation of our approach may not necessarily find a kernel, we introduce two further Boolean networks for digraphs: one always finds an independent set, and the other always finds a dominating set.},

  abstract     = {We study the fair allocation of indivisible resources under knapsack constraints, where a set of items with varied costs and values are to be allocated among a group of agents. Each agent has a budget constraint on the total cost of items she can receive. The goal is to compute a budget-feasible allocation that is envy-free (EF), in which the agents do not envy each other for the items they receive, nor do they envy a charity, which is endowed with all the unallocated items. Since EF allocations barely exist (even without the budget constraints), we are interested in the relaxed notion of envy-freeness up to one item (EF1). Our results are twofold. Firstly, for the general setting where agents have heterogeneous valuations and budgets, we show that a budget-feasible allocation that maximizes the Nash social welfare (NSW) achieves a 1/4-approximation of EF1. This approximation ratio carries to the general case of arbitrary monotone subadditive valuations. The approximation ratio improves gracefully when the items have small cost compared with the agents&#39; budgets; it converges to 1/2 when the budget-cost ratio approaches infinity, and to 1 if the agents further have identical valuations. Secondly, when agents have identical valuations, we design a polynomial-time algorithm that computes a 1/2-approximate EF1 allocation for an arbitrary number of agents. For the case of identical agents and the case of two agents, we propose polynomial-time algorithms for computing EF1 allocations.},

We also impose constraints on the computation of both deterministic and non-deterministic Turing machines: both have two tapes, the input tape is read-only and one-way, and once a certain stop point in the input tape is reached, no additional writing on the work tape is allowed. We consider two cases for the position of the stop point: immediately after the number of graph nodes and the size of the clique are specified, or controlled by a parameter q that indicates what portion of the graph nodes&#39; edge specifications have been scanned. The parameter q may be arbitrarily close to 1, e.g., q = 0.99999 . We show, for both cases in our setting, that a non-deterministic Turing machine can solve the problem in O ( n 3 ) time whereas no deterministic Turing machine can solve the problem in polynomial time. However, we exhibit an exponential time deterministic single work tape, two-heads Turing machine that solves the clique problem in our setting.},

We study the behavior of matrix sequences produced during key exchange, looking for any almost linear periodicity property that could affect the cryptanalysis. We provide the algorithm and an example to illustrate our attack, demonstrating that this key exchange protocol is not secure. Additionally, we examine how different parameter selections and matrix sizes impact the protocol&#39;s security.

In the special case where f = id + c (with id being the identity function and c a constant), this is referred to as cl-reducibility. In a work by Barmpalias, Fang, and Lewis-Pye, it was proven that there exist two left-c.e. reals such that no left-c.e. real ( id + g ) -bT-computes both of them whenever g is computable, nondecreasing, and satisfies ∑ n 2 − g ( n ) = ∞ . Moreover, such maximal pairs exist precisely within every array noncomputable degree. This result generalizes a prior result on cl-reducibility, which states that there exist two left-c.e. reals such that no left-c.e. real cl-computes both of them. An open question remained as to whether a similar extension could apply to another result on cl-reducibility, which asserts that there exists a left-c.e. real not cl-reducible to any random left-c.e. real. We answer this question affirmatively, providing a simpler proof compared to previous works. Additionally, we streamline the proof of the initial extension.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study ltl f synthesis under environment specifications for arbitrary reachability and safety properties. We consider both kinds of properties for both agent tasks and environment specifications, providing a complete landscape of synthesis algorithms. For each case, we devise a specific algorithm (optimal wrt complexity of the problem) and prove its correctness. The algorithms combine common building blocks in different ways. While some cases are already studied in literature others are studied here for the first time.},

  abstract     = {We consider the Maximum Weight Independent Set problem, with a focus on obtaining good approximations for graphs of small maximum degree Δ. We give deterministic local algorithms running in time poly ( Δ , log ⁡ n ) that come close to matching the best centralized results known and improve the previous distributed approximations by a factor of about 2. More precisely, we obtain approximations below Δ + 1 / 2 2 , and a further improvement to 8 / 5 + ε when Δ = 3 . Technically, this is achieved by leveraging the fractional local ratio technique, for a first application in a distributed setting.},

  abstract     = {A parallel algorithm for computing the number of parse trees of a given string according to a fixed context-free grammar is defined. More generally, the algorithm applies to computing the weight of a string in a weighted grammar over any semiring. The algorithm is first implemented on an arithmetic circuit of depth at most 6 ( log 2 ⁡ n ) 2 + O ( log ⁡ n ) and with O ( n 6 ) elements, where the constant factors in the big-O notation depend on the grammar. Then, the circuit is improved using fast matrix multiplication to use only O ( n 5.38 ) elements, while preserving depth O ( ( log ⁡ n ) 2 ) .},
