  abstract     = {In this work, we address the problem of ( n , f ) -evacuation on a circle, which involves evacuating n robots, with f of them being faulty, from a hidden exit located on the perimeter of a unit radius circle. The robots commence at the center of the circle and possess a speed of 1. We introduce algorithms for both the Wireless and Face-to-Face communication models tolerating f Byzantine faults. We set constraints on f and we analyze the time requirements of these algorithms and we establish upper bounds on their performance. We propose an algorithm for the Wireless communication model, proving the following upper bound E ( n , f ) ≤ 1 + ( f + 1 ) ⋅ 2 π n + max ⁡ { G e ( k ⁎ ) , H e ( k ⁎ ) } where G e ( k ⁎ ) and H e ( k ⁎ ) is the time needed to evacuate two crucial groups of robots, during the execution of our algorithm. For the Face-to-Face communication model we propose an algorithm and we prove an upper bound of E ( n , f ) ≤ 3 + ( f + 1 ) ⋅ 2 π n + max 2 ≤ k ≤ n ⁡ { 2 ( k − 1 ) ⋅ sin ⁡ ( f − k + 2 k − 1 ⋅ π n ) } where k is the number of conflicting accounts of the exit position.},

  abstract     = {When describing the behavior of systems, state variables are typically modeled using complex data types. This use of data types allows for concise models that are easy to read. However, model checking tools that aim to automatically establish the correctness of such models use static analyses of state variables to improve their performance. Therefore, the use of complex data types in behavioral models negatively affects the performance of model checking tools. To address this, in this article we revisit a technique by Groote and Lisser that can be used to replace a single state variable of a complex data type by multiple state variables of simpler data types. We introduce and study several extensions in the context of the process algebraic specification language mCRL2, and establish their correctness. We demonstrate that our technique typically reduces the verification times when using symbolic model checking, and show that sometimes it enables static analysis to reduce the underlying state space from infinite to finite.},

  abstract     = {Arbitrary pattern formation (APF) is a well-studied problem in swarm robotics. To the best of our knowledge, the problem has been considered in two different settings: one in a euclidean plane and another in an infinite grid. This work deals with the problem in an infinite rectangular grid setting. The previous works in literature dealing with the APF problem in an infinite grid had a fundamental issue. These deterministic algorithms use a lot of spatial area in the grid to solve the problem, mainly to maintain the asymmetry of the configuration and avoid any collision. These solution techniques cannot be useful if there is a spatial constraint in the application field. In this work, we consider luminous robots (each robot equipped with a light that can take three colors) to avoid symmetry, but we carefully designed a deterministic algorithm that solves the APF problem using the minimal required spatial area in the grid if the initial pattern is asymmetric. The robots are autonomous, identical, and anonymous, and they operate in Look-Compute-Move cycles under a fully-asynchronous scheduler. The APF algorithm proposed in [1] by Bose et al. can be modified using luminous robots so that it uses minimal spatial area, but that algorithm is not move-optimal. The algorithm proposed in this paper not only uses minimal spatial area but is also asymptotically move-optimal.},

  abstract     = {Parent divorcing is a commonly used technique to reduce the complexity of Bayesian models. In particular, this transformation decreases the number of parents of some nodes in a given Bayesian Network (BN). Such transformations must be done in such a way that solutions to inference problems for the original BN can be readily obtained from the solutions to the new BN. Despite its wide use in practice, there have been no attempts to formally analyze these transformations. In this work, we present a first step towards the development of theoretical foundations for the use of divorce transformations in BNs and establish analytical results. Specifically, we develop a formalism that captures a structural relationship between the original BN and the new BN. Using this formalism, we present an algorithm for parent divorcing which ensures that the treewidth of the modified BN is within a constant factor of that of the original BN. We also present an algorithm that carries out parent divorcing while preserving the domain size of each node. Further, we present lower bound results to prove that there are BNs for which parent divorcing transformations can cause an exponential increase in the domain size or lead to an exponentially large new BN.},

Existing protocols for proving such statements often incur significant communication costs, especially when demonstrating that p and q are of nearly equal size. We leverage the MPC-in-the-head paradigm, a cryptographic technique that transforms secure multi-party computation protocols into efficient zero-knowledge proof systems. In our protocol, the prover uses additive sharing of p and q over the integers. This approach simplifies proving the size relationship p ≃ q ≃ n and the congruence p ≡ q ≡ 3 mod 4 without requiring costly range proofs. To verify the primality of p and q , we employ the Boneh-Franklin biprimality test. Our protocol achieves a significant reduction in communication complexity. For a 2048-bit integer n and 128-bit security, we construct an argument as small as 6.3 KB, with prover and verifier computational costs comparable to existing protocols that require over 131 KB.},

The problem has previously been studied in various scenarios with both tractability and NP-hardness results obtained. However, the data center and interconnection networks to which the problem is most relevant are almost always such that the static network is highly structured (and often node-symmetric) whereas all previous results assume that the static network can be arbitrary (which makes existing computational hardness results less technologically relevant and also easier to obtain). In this paper, and for the first time, we prove various intractability results for RRP where the underlying static network is highly structured, for example consisting of a hypercube, and also extend some existing tractability results.},

In each case it was proven that the class induces a notion of randomness equivalent to MLR. In all of those proofs, it was shown that the class contains a finite set of betting strategies such that for any given bound, when betting on a binary sequence contained in an effective open set of small enough measure, at least one of the betting strategies in the set earns capital larger than the bound.

  abstract     = {Cops and Robbers is a type of pursuit-evasion game played on a graph where a set of cops try to capture a single robber. The cops first choose their initial vertex positions, and later the robber chooses a vertex. The cops and robbers make their moves in alternate turns: in the cops&#39; turn, every cop can either choose to move to an adjacent vertex or stay on the same vertex, and likewise the robber in his turn. If the cops can capture the robber in a finite number of rounds, the cops win, otherwise the robber wins. The cop-number of a graph is the minimum number of cops required to catch a robber in the graph. It has long been known that graphs embedded on surfaces (such as planar graphs and toroidal graphs) have a small cop-number. Recently, Durocher et al. [21] investigated the problem of cop-number for the class of 1-planar graphs, which are graphs that can be embedded in the plane such that each edge is crossed at most once. They showed that unlike planar graphs which require just three cops, 1-planar graphs have an unbounded cop-number. On the positive side, they showed that maximal 1-planar graphs require only three cops by crucially using the fact that the endpoints of every crossing in an embedded maximal 1-planar graph induce a K 4 . In this paper, we show that the cop-number remains bounded even under the relaxed condition that the endpoints induce at least three edges. More precisely, let an ×-crossing of an embedded 1-planar graph be a crossing whose endpoints induce a matching; i.e., there is no edge connecting the endpoints apart from the crossing edges themselves. We show that any 1-planar graph that can be embedded without ×-crossings has cop-number at most 21. Moreover, any 1-planar graph that can be embedded with at most γ ×-crossings has cop-number at most γ + 21 .},

  abstract     = {We study symmetric tensor decompositions, i.e., decompositions of the form T = ∑ i = 1 r u i ⊗ 3 where T is a symmetric tensor of order 3 and u i ∈ C n . In order to obtain efficient decomposition algorithms, it is necessary to require additional properties from the u i . In this paper we assume that the u i are linearly independent. This implies r ≤ n , i.e., the decomposition of T is undercomplete . We will moreover assume that r = n (we plan to extend this work to the case r &lt; n in a forthcoming paper). We give a randomized algorithm for the following problem: given T , an accuracy parameter ε , and an upper bound B on the condition number of the tensor, output vectors u i ′ such that | | u i − u i ′ | | ≤ ε (up to permutation and multiplication by phases) with high probability. The main novel features of our algorithm are: • We provide the first algorithm for this problem that works in the computation model of finite arithmetic and requires only poly-logarithmic (in n , B and 1 ε ) many bits of precision. • Moreover, this is also the first algorithm that runs in linear time in the size of the input tensor. It requires O ( n 3 ) arithmetic operations for all accuracy parameters ε = 1 poly ( n ) . In order to obtain these results, we rely on a mix of techniques from algorithm design and algorithm analysis. The algorithm is a modified version of simultaneous diagonalisation algorithm for symmetric tensors. In terms of algorithm design, our main contribution lies in replacing the usual appeal to resolution of a linear system of equations [30] , [7] by a matrix trace-based method. The analysis of the algorithm depends on the following components: 1. We use the fast and numerically stable diagonalisation algorithm from [9] . We provide better guarantees for the approximate solution returned by the diagonalisation algorithm when the input matrix is diagonalisable. 2. We show strong anti-concentration bounds for certain families of polynomials when the randomness is sampled uniformly from a discrete grid.},

  abstract     = {The class of Ga lled- T ree Ex plainable ( GaTEx ) graphs has recently been discovered as a natural generalization of cographs. Cographs are precisely those graphs that can be uniquely represented by a rooted tree where the leaves correspond to the vertices of the graph. As a generalization, GaTEx graphs are precisely those that can be uniquely represented by a particular rooted acyclic network, called a galled-tree. This paper explores the use of galled-trees to solve combinatorial problems on GaTEx graphs that are, in general, NP-hard. We demonstrate that finding a maximum clique, an optimal vertex coloring, a perfect order, as well as a maximum independent set in GaTEx graphs can be efficiently done in linear time. The key idea behind the linear-time algorithms is to utilize the galled-trees that explain the GaTEx graphs as a guide for computing the respective cliques, colorings, perfect orders, or independent sets.},

Currently there are only four convex shapes for which the exact spanning ratio of their Delaunay graph is known: the equilateral triangle, the square, the regular hexagon and the rectangle. We add a fifth convex shape by proving the exact spanning ratio of the parallelogram Delaunay graph. The worst-case spanning ratio is exactly 2 1 + A 2 + 2 A cos ⁡ ( θ 0 ) + ( A + cos ⁡ ( θ 0 ) ) 1 + A 2 + 2 A cos ⁡ ( θ 0 ) sin ⁡ ( θ 0 ) , where A is the aspect ratio and θ 0 is the non-obtuse angle of the parallelogram.},

  abstract     = {We report some further developments regarding the language theory of higher-dimensional automata (HDAs). Regular languages of HDAs are sets of finite interval partially ordered multisets (pomsets) with interfaces. We show a pumping lemma which allows us to expose a class of non-regular languages. Concerning decision and closure properties, we show that inclusion of regular languages is decidable (hence is emptiness), and that intersections of regular languages are again regular. Yet complements of regular languages are not always regular. We introduce a width-bounded complement and show that width-bounded complements of regular languages are again regular. We also study determinism and ambiguity. We show that it is decidable whether a regular language is accepted by a deterministic HDA and that there exist regular languages with unbounded ambiguity. Finally, we characterize one-letter deterministic languages in terms of ultimately periodic functions.},

  abstract     = {The research on distributed computing by robot swarms has formalized different models where robots act through a sequence of Look-Compute-Move cycles in the Euclidean plane. Models mostly under study differ for (i) the possibility of storing constant-size information, (ii) the possibility of communicating constant-size information, (iii) the synchronization mode, and (iv) the visibility of robots. By varying features (i) and (ii) , we obtain the noted four base models: OBLOT (silent and oblivious robots), FSTA (silent and finite-state robots), FCOM (oblivious and finite-communication robots), and LUMI (finite-state and finite-communication robots). Feature (iii) comprehends the three main synchronization modes: fully synchronous , semi-synchronous , and asynchronous . According to robot visibility (iv) , models can assume robots to be transparent (thus enjoying complete visibility ) or opaque (thus experiencing obstructed visibility in case of collinearities). By combining features (i-iv) , we obtain 24 models. Extensive research has studied the computational power of the 12 transparent models, proving the hierarchical relations among them; to this regard, it is worth noticing that robots have been assumed to be collision-tolerant. In this work, we assume our robots to be collision-intolerant and we lay down the computational hierarchy by considering all 24 models. Firstly, we study the relations between the transparent and the opaque framework, focusing on how obstructed visibility affects the computational power of a model. Then, we introduce five witness problems that prove most of the computational relations among the 24 models.},

While previous work has shown that no nontrivial multiplicative MMS approximation can be guaranteed in this setting for general group sizes, we demonstrate that ordinal relaxations are much more useful. For example, we show that if n agents are distributed equally across g groups, there exists a 1-out-of- k MMS allocation for k = O ( g log ⁡ ( n / g ) ) , while if all but a constant number of agents are in the same group, we obtain k = O ( log ⁡ n / log ⁡ log ⁡ n ) . We also establish the tightness of these bounds and provide non-asymptotic results for the case of two groups. Our proofs leverage connections to combinatorial covering designs.},

  abstract     = {Many research works in computational social choice assume a fixed set of voters in an election and study the resistance of different voting rules against electoral manipulation. In recent years, however, a new technique known as random sample voting has been adopted in many multi-agent systems. One of the most prominent examples is blockchain. Many proof-of-stake based blockchain systems like Algorand will randomly select a subset of participants of the system to form a committee, and only the committee members will be involved in the decision of some important system parameters. This can be viewed as running an election where the voter committee (i.e., the voters whose votes will be counted) is randomly selected. It is generally expected that the introduction of such randomness should make the election more resistant to electoral manipulation, despite the lack of theoretical analysis. In this paper, we present a systematic study on the resistance of an election with a randomly selected voter committee against bribery. Since the committee is randomly generated, by bribing any fixed subset of voters, the designated candidate may or may not win. Consequently, we consider the problem of finding a feasible solution that maximizes the winning probability of the designated candidate. We show that for most voting rules, this problem becomes extremely difficult for the briber as even finding any non-trivial solution with non-zero objective value becomes NP-hard. However, for plurality and veto, there exists a polynomial time approximation scheme that computes a near-optimal solution efficiently. The algorithm builds upon a novel integer programming formulation together with techniques from n -fold integer programming, which may be of separate interest.},

  abstract     = {A matching M of a graph is a P -matching if the subgraph induced by the endpoints of the edges of M satisfies property P . As examples, for appropriate choices of P , the problems Induced Matching , Uniquely Restricted Matching , Connected Matching and Disconnected Matching arise. For many of these problems, finding a P -matching of a given size is a known problem, with few exceptions, such as Connected Matching , which has the same time complexity as the usual Maximum Matching problem. The weighted variant of Maximum Matching has been studied for decades, with many applications, including the well-known Assignment problem. Motivated by this fact and by some recent research in weighted versions of acyclic and induced matchings, we study Maximum Weight Connected Matching and its decision version, Weighted Connected Matching . The former problem asks for a matching M such that the endpoints of its edges induce a connected subgraph and the sum of the edge weights of M is maximum, while the latter asks if there is an M of at least a given weight. Unlike the unweighted Connected Matching problem, which is in ¶ for general graphs, we show that Weighted Connected Matching is even for bounded diameter bipartite graphs, starlike graphs, planar bipartite graphs, and 3-regular planar graphs, while solvable in linear time for trees and for graphs of maximum degree at most two. When we restrict edge weights to be non-negative, we show that the problem turns out to be polynomially solvable for chordal graphs, while it remains for most of the other cases. In addition, we consider the parameterized complexity of the problem. On the positive side, we present a single-exponential time algorithm when parameterized by treewidth. As for kernelization, we show that, even when restricted to binary weights, Weighted Connected Matching does not admit a polynomial kernel when parameterized by vertex cover number under standard complexity-theoretical hypotheses.},

Or rather, we prove that a quasi-metric space is Smyth-complete if and only if every d -net has a d -limit and converges to its d -limit. For a local Yoneda-complete quasi-metric space, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition such that the open ball topology coincides with the Scott topology on its formal ball space. In addition, we show that local Yoneda-completeness is preserved by some constructions, such as coproducts, products, function spaces, formal ball spaces and so on. Finally, we prove that the formal ball construction B induces the monads on the categories of Smyth-complete quasi-metric spaces with 1-Lipschitz maps, local Yoneda-complete quasi-metric spaces with 1-Lipschitz maps, Smyth-complete quasi-metric spaces with Y-continuous maps and local Yoneda-complete quasi-metric spaces with Y-continuous maps.},

  abstract     = {Influence maximization (IM) involves choosing an initial group of users within a social network to optimize the expected spread of influence across other users. Recently, learning-based combinatorial optimization (CO) methods have been developed to learn generalized policies for specific CO problems on graphs. However, current learning-based algorithms struggle with diverse diffusion patterns, which restricts their generalization ability. In this paper, we apply reverse influence sampling to simplify the IM problem, reducing it to a stochastic maximum coverage problem using hyperedges. We then model this as a Markov decision process and propose two sequential decision-based learning methods. These methods leverage the symmetry of solutions with respect to sequence order and utilize the submodular reward function. By jointly training on multiple graphs, our approach learns a transferable seed selection policy that generalizes effectively to previously unseen test graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms recent learning-based approaches as well as traditional methods on both real and synthetic datasets for the IM problem.},
