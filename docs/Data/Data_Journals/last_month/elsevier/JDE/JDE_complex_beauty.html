The first class consists of equations with constant coefficients, derived from linear differential equations, with a specific focus on the Mikhailov–Novikov equation and Satsuma–Mimura equation. The second class involves BO-type equations with variable coefficients linked to orthogonal polynomials, including Hermite, Jacobi, and Laguerre polynomials. A key aspect of transforming these differential equations into BO-type equations is that the zeros of the polynomial or periodic solutions must lie in the upper half-plane. For linear and quadratic polynomials, we directly analyze their zeros to determine the solutions of corresponding BO-type equations. For higher-order polynomials, we use the pole expansion method to derive the governing many-body systems of the zeros. This study deepens our understanding of the relationship between the zeros of polynomials and the solutions of BO-type equations.},

We show that the basic reproduction number R 0 alone cannot determine the existence of the EEs and the model may have multiple EEs when the repulsive movement rate χ is large. We prove that the set of EEs forms a simple and unbounded curve bifurcating from the curve of disease free equilibria at R 0 = 1 as R 0 varies from zero to infinity, where the bifurcation curve can be forward or backward. We find conditions under which a forward bifurcation curve is of S-shaped and show that a large χ tends to induce backward bifurcation curves. Results on the asymptotic profiles of the EEs are obtained as the repulsive movement rate is large or the random movement rates are small. Finally, we perform numerical simulations to illustrate the results.},

  abstract     = {We derive the electromagnetic medium equivalent to a collection of all-dielectric nano-particles (enjoying high refractive indices) distributed locally non-periodically, precisely the medium is periodic with a unit cell composed of a cluster of multiple nano-particles, in a smooth domain Ω. Such distributions are used to model well-known structures in material sciences as the Van-der-Waals heterostructures. Since the nano-particles are all-dielectric, then the permittivity remains unchanged with respect to the background while the permeability is altered by this effective medium. This permeability is given in terms of three parameters. The first one is the polarization tensors of the used nano-particles. The second one is the averaged Magnetization matrix | Ω 0 | − 1 ∫ Ω 0 ∇ x ∫ Ω 0 ∇ y Φ 0 ( x , y ) ⋅ I 3 d y d x , where Φ 0 ( x , y ) : = 1 4 π | x − y | , I 3 is the identity matrix and Ω 0 is the unit cell. The third one is ∇ ∇ Φ 0 ( z i , z j ) , where z i &#39;s are locations of the local nano-particles distributed in the unit cell. This last tensor models the local strong interaction of the nano-particles. To our best knowledge, such tensors are new in both the mathematical and engineering oriented literature. This equivalent medium describes, in particular, the effective medium of 2 dimensional type Van-der-Waals heterostructures. These structures are 3 dimensional which are built as superposition of identical (2D)-sheets each supporting locally non-periodic distributions of nano-particles. An explicit form of this effective medium is provided for the particular case of honeycomb heterostructures. At the mathematical analysis level, we propose a new approach to derive the effective medium when the subwavelength nano-particles are distributed non-periodically. The first step consists in deriving the point-interaction approximation, also called the Foldy-Lax approximation. The scattered field is given as a superposition of dipoles (or poles for other models) multiplied by the elements of a vector which is itself solution of an algebraic system. This step is done regardless of the way how the particles are distributed. As a second step, which is the new and critical step, we rewrite this algebraic system according to the way how these nano-particles are locally distributed. The new algebraic system will then fix the related continuous Lippmann-Schwinger system which, in its turn, indicates naturally the equivalent medium.},

First, we prove that the logarithmic Musielak-Orlicz Sobolev spaces W 1 , H log ( Ω ) and W 0 1 , H log ( Ω ) with H log ( x , t ) = t p ( x ) + μ ( x ) t q ( x ) log ⁡ ( e + t ) for ( x , t ) ∈ Ω ‾ × [ 0 , ∞ ) are separable, reflexive Banach spaces and W 0 1 , H log ( Ω ) can be equipped with the equivalent norm inf ⁡ { λ &gt; 0 : ∫ Ω [ | ∇ u λ | p ( x ) + μ ( x ) | ∇ u λ | q ( x ) log ⁡ ( e + | ∇ u | λ ) ] d x ≤ 1 } .

The second part is devoted to the properties of the operator and it turns out that it is bounded, continuous, strictly monotone, of type (S + ), coercive and a homeomorphism. Also, the related energy functional is of class C 1 . As a result of independent interest we also present a new version of Young&#39;s inequality for the product of a power-law and a logarithm. In the last part of this work we consider equations of the form G u = f ( x , u ) in Ω , u = 0 on ∂ Ω with superlinear right-hand sides. We prove multiplicity results for this type of equation, in particular about sign-changing solutions, by making use of a suitable variation of the corresponding Nehari manifold together with the quantitative deformation lemma and the Poincaré-Miranda existence theorem.},

In this situation, the divergence free condition for the magnetic field can be inherited from the initial value.

We first establish the asymptotic annihilation of solutions under several appropriate assumptions. In order to avoid the tedious asymptotic spectral radius analysis of the solution map without compactness, we then transform the issues corresponding to forced wave for the original system into a fixed point problem of traveling wave map. Notably, such traveling wave map possesses compactness, enabling us to establish the existence and uniqueness of fixed points in terms of asymptotic spectral radius. Finally, these, together with the theory of asymptotic spectral radius again, yield the threshold dynamics of the original system.},

We first establish the variational characterization of the ground state and derive the threshold for global well-posedness and scattering. We then demonstrate the global well-posedness and scattering below the threshold using the concentration-compactness/rigidity method. The almost periodic solution is excluded by adapting the argument used in the proof of the focusing mass-critical nonlinear Schrödinger equations (NLS) by B. Dodson. As a byproduct of the scattering of the cubic focusing infinitely coupled nonlinear Schrödinger system, we obtain the scattering of the cubic focusing nonlinear Schrödinger equation on the small cylinder. We also show the global well-posedness and scattering of the two dimensional N -coupled focusing cubic nonlinear Schrödinger system in ( L 2 ( R 2 ) ) N .},

We identify sufficient conditions on the principal symbol of the potential V ( t , x , D ) that ensure existence of solutions exhibiting unbounded growth in time of their positive Sobolev norms and we show that the class of symbols satisfying such conditions is generic in the Fréchet space of classical 2 π -time periodic symbols of order zero. To prove our result we apply the abstract Theorem of [46] : the main difficulty is to find a conjugate operator A for the resonant average of V ( t , x , D ) . We construct explicitly the symbol of the conjugate operator A , called escape function, combining techniques from microlocal analysis, dynamical systems and contact topology.},

First, we prove the global existence of strong solution and the stability of the constant equilibrium state to 1D Cauchy problem of compressible Euler-Navier-Stokes system by using the standard continuity argument for small H 1 data while their second order derivative can be large. Then we derive the optimal time decay rate to the constant equilibrium state. Compared with multi-dimensional case, it is much harder to get optimal time decay rate by direct spectrum method due to a slower convergence rate of the fundamental solution in 1D case. To overcome this main difficulty, we need to first carry out time-weighted energy estimates (not optimal) for higher order derivatives, and based on these time-weighted estimates, we can close a priori assumptions and get the optimal time decay rate by spectrum analysis method. Moreover, due to non-conserved form and insufficient decay rate of the coupled drag force terms between the two-phase flows, we essentially need to use momentum variables ( m = ρ u , M = n ω ) , rather than velocity variables ( u , ω ) in the spectrum analysis, to fully cancel out those non-conserved and insufficient time decay drag force terms.},

As applications, we consider parabolic systems that satisfy different similarities. We prove a Hartman-Grobman theorem for general parabolic systems.

The findings, derived from variational and weak solutions, rely on the monotonicity formula to construct the blow-up limit, thereby identifying that the possible singular profiles near stagnation points are constrained to corner, cusp, or flat singularity. Additionally, the application of frequency formula eliminates the possibility of flat singularity. Through a further symbol limitation at the right hand side of equation, we show that cusp singularity is impossible. The only admissible singular profile is a corner, whose angle depends on the decay rate of the solution near the stagnation point.},
