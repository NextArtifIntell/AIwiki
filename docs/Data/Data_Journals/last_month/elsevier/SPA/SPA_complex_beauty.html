  abstract     = {For the range- R bond percolation in d = 4 , 5 , 6 , we obtain a lower bound for the critical probability p c for R large, agreeing with the conjectured asymptotics and thus complementing the corresponding results of Van der Hofstad and Sakai (2005) for d &gt; 6 , and Frei and Perkins (2016), Hong (2023) for d ≤ 3 . The lower bound proof is completed by showing the extinction of the associated SIR epidemic model. To prove the extinction of the SIR epidemics, we introduce a refined model of the branching random walk, called a self-avoiding branching random walk, whose total range dominates that of the SIR epidemic process.},

Also, we study the question of approximating an m -divisible random set by infinitely divisible random sets. We prove a theorem analogous to that of Arak’s classical result (Arak, 1981, 1982) on approximating an m -divisible random variable by infinitely divisible random variables.},

We establish a sharp difference in the asymptotic behaviour of the self-normalized sample mean of the observed process depending on the renewal process. In particular, we show that if the renewal process has a moderate heavy-tail distribution, then the limit is a so-called Normal Variance Mixture (NVM) and we characterize the randomized variance part of the limiting NVM as an integral function of a Lévy stable motion. Otherwise, the normalized sample mean will be asymptotically normal.},

The changed measure P h depends on the choice of a function h in the domain of L . In our main result, we derive conditions on h for which the change of measure is of Girsanov-type. The process X under P h is then shown to be a mild solution to another SPDE with an extra additive drift-term. We illustrate how different choices of h impact the law of X under P h in selected applications. These include the derivation of an infinite-dimensional diffusion bridge as well as the introduction of guided processes for SPDEs, generalizing results known for finite-dimensional diffusion processes to the infinite-dimensional case.},
