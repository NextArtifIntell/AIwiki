  abstract     = {We study the asymptotic behavior of the Bergman orthogonal polynomials ( p n ) n = 0 ∞ for a class of bounded simply connected domains D . The class is defined by the requirement that conformal maps φ of D onto the unit disk extend analytically across the boundary L of D , and that φ ′ has a finite number of zeros z 1 , … , z q on L . The boundary L is then piecewise analytic with corners at the zeros of φ ′ . A result of Stylianopoulos implies that a Carleman-type strong asymptotic formula for p n holds on the exterior domain ℂ ∖ D ¯ . We prove that the same formula remains valid across L ∖ { z 1 , … , z q } and on a maximal open subset of D . As a consequence, the only boundary points that attract zeros of p n are the corners. This is in stark contrast to the case when φ fails to admit an analytic extension past L , since when this happens the zero counting measure of p n is known to approach the equilibrium measure for L along suitable subsequences.},

  abstract     = {In the machine learning literature stochastic gradient descent has recently been widely discussed for its purported implicit regularization properties. Much of the theory, that attempts to clarify the role of noise in stochastic gradient algorithms, has approximated stochastic gradient descent by a stochastic differential equation with Gaussian noise. We provide a rigorous theoretical justification for this practice that showcases how the Gaussianity of the noise arises naturally.},

We obtain the exact asymptotic order of some pseudo s -numbers for the cases 1 ≤ q &lt; p &lt; ∞ and p = q = 2 . Additionally, we also obtain an upper bound and a lower bound for some pseudo s -numbers of the embedding of W 2 α ( R d , γ ) into L ∞ g ( R d ) .

  abstract     = {We consider the Pearcey integral P ( x , y ) for large values of | x | and bounded values of | y | . The standard saddle point analysis is difficult to apply because the Pearcey integral is highly oscillating in this region. To overcome this problem we use the modified saddle point method introduced in López et al. (2009). A complete asymptotic analysis is possible with this method, and we derive a complete asymptotic expansion of P ( x , y ) for large | x | , accompanied by the exact location of the Stokes lines. There are two Stokes lines that divide the complex x − plane in two different sectors in which P ( x , y ) behaves differently when | x | is large. The asymptotic approximation is the sum of two asymptotic series whose terms are elementary functions of x and y . Both of them are of Poincaré type; one of them is given in terms of inverse powers of x ; the other one in terms of inverse powers of x 1 / 2 , and it is multiplied by an exponential factor that behaves differently in the two mentioned sectors. Some numerical experiments illustrate the accuracy of the approximation.},
