  abstract     = {Granular computing, by simulating human thought processes, provides a paradigm for solving complex decision-making problems. The three-way decision is a key component of granular computing. Compared to traditional decision-making methodologies, it introduces “deferred decision-making”, allowing for multi-granularity exploration of alternatives. This process gradually refines the granularity of alternatives, leading to a transition between acceptance and rejection. Moreover, data structures in the real world are typically multi-granular, multi-level, and incomplete. Compared to single-scale information systems, incomplete multi-scale information systems provide richer decision foundations by mapping information to different levels. Additionally, they allow for more precise and flexible decision-making by integrating attribute information from different levels at a specific granularity, depending on requirements. Therefore, this paper seeks to present a three-way multi-scale decision-making methodology under incomplete environments. First, an integration methodology under incomplete multi-scale information systems by using the best-worst method is built, which comprehensively considers the importance of each scale of attributes. Second, the grey relation analysis calculation is integrated into the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution methodology to obtain the score of alternatives, serving as the conditional probability of three-way decisions, which compensates for the problem of Euclidean distance failures due to the correlation among indicators. Third, according to the evidence theory and the enhanced belief Jensen-Sharma-Mittal divergence, the thresholds of three-way decisions are fused, improving the classification efficiency of three-way decisions for alternatives. Finally, the effectiveness of the methodology established in this paper is validated using the campus environment evaluation data set collected through the Questionnaire Star from Shanxi University, China.},

  abstract     = {The fuzzy rough approximation operator serves as the cornerstone of fuzzy rough set theory and its practical applications. Axiomatization is a crucial approach in the exploration of fuzzy rough sets, aiming to offer a clear and direct characterization of fuzzy rough approximation operators. Among the fundamental tools employed in this process, the inner product and outer product of fuzzy sets stand out as essential components in the axiomatization of fuzzy rough sets. In this paper, we will develop the axiomatization of a comprehensive fuzzy rough set theory, that is, the so-called L -valued rough sets with an L -set serving as the foundational universe (referred to as the L -universe) for defining L -valued rough approximation operators, where L typically denotes a GL-quantale. Firstly, we give the notions of inner product and outer product of two L -subsets within an L -universe and examine their basic properties. It is shown that these notions are extensions of the corresponding notion of fuzzy sets within a classical universe. Secondly, leveraging the inner product and outer product of L -subsets, we respectively characterize L -valued upper and lower rough approximation operators generated by general, reflexive, transitive, symmetric, Euclidean, and median L -value relations on L -universe as well as their compositions. Finally, utilizing the provided axiomatic characterizations, we present the precise examples for the least and largest equivalent L -valued upper and lower rough approximation operators. Notably, many existing axiom characterizations of fuzzy rough sets within classical universe can be viewed as direct consequences of our findings.},

  abstract     = {Attribute reduction has become an essential step in pattern recognition and machine learning tasks. As an extension of the classical rough set, the covering rough set has garnered considerable attention in both theory and application. A matrix-based method for computing local covering optimistic approximation sets and local optimistic multigranulation reductions based on covering rough set in covering decision information systems (CDISs) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, we introduce a matrix representation along with its associated operations to compute the local covering optimistic approximation sets and the local positive regions of the CDISs. Subsequently, local optimistic discernibility matrices and local optimistic discernibility functions are constructed for the CDISs. By performing disjunction and conjunction operations on these local optimistic discernibility matrices, all local optimistic multigranulation reductions of the CDISs can be accurately obtained. In addition, an algorithm is developed using the local optimistic discernibility matrix to compute a suboptimal minimal local optimistic multigranulation reduction. Finally, to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method, numerical experiments are conducted on 6 UCI datasets.},

  abstract     = {Scarcity of labeled data is a common problem in supervised classification, since hand-labeling can be time consuming, expensive or hard to label; on the other hand, large amounts of unlabeled information can be found. The problem of scarcity of labeled data is even more notorious in hierarchical classification, because the data of a node is split among its children, which results in few instances associated to the deepest nodes of the hierarchy. In this work it is proposed the semi-supervised hierarchical multi-label classifier based on local information (SSHMC-BLI) which can be trained with labeled and unlabeled data to perform hierarchical classification tasks. The method can be applied to any type of hierarchical problem, here we focus on the most difficult case: hierarchies of DAG type, where the instances can be associated to multiple paths of labels which can finish in an internal node. SSHMC-BLI builds pseudo-labels for each unlabeled instance from the paths of labels of its labeled neighbors, while it considers whether the unlabeled instance is similar to its neighbors. Experiments on 12 challenging datasets from functional genomics show that making use of unlabeled along with labeled data can help to improve the performance of a supervised hierarchical classifier trained only on labeled data, even with statistical significance.},

As a result, we drive multiple equivalent characterizations of the types of neighborhoods that enable us to compare them and indicate the new, missing kinds of neighborhoods. Moreover, many kinds of neighborhoods defined in the literature on the issue proved to be identical. In particular, none of the types of recently defined so-called subset neighborhoods is new.},

However, this task is more challenging than standard regression problems due to the presence of censored observations. Additionally, the lack of confidence assessment, model robustness, and prediction calibration raises concerns about the reliability of predictions. To address these challenges, we propose an evidential regression model specifically designed for time-to-event prediction. Our approach computes a degree of belief for the event time occurring within a time interval, without any strict distribution assumption. Meanwhile, the proposed model quantifies both epistemic and aleatory uncertainties using Gaussian Random Fuzzy Numbers and belief functions, providing clinicians with uncertainty-aware survival time predictions. Experimental evaluations using simulated and real-world survival datasets highlight the potential of our approach for enhancing clinical decision-making in survival analysis.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, multi-view data has seen widespread application across various fields, presenting both opportunities and challenges due to its complex distribution across different views. Detecting outliers in such heterogeneous data has become a significant research problem. Existing multi-view outlier detection methods often rely on clustering assumptions, pairwise constraints between views, and a focus on learning consensus information, which overlook the inherent differences across views. To address the aforementioned issues, this paper proposes an outlier detection method based on the fusion of multi-granularity fuzzy rough information (MGFMOD). The method calculates a multi-granularity similarity matrix using fuzzy similarity relationships, combines similarity matrices from different granularities to form an upper approximation matrix, and constructs fused upper approximation granules to detect attribute anomalies. Neighbor domain probabilistic mapping is then employed to unify neighborhood relationships across views, allowing the analysis of both consistency and distribution differences to capture class outliers. Additionally, this paper employs a novel coarse-to-fine approximation method to construct the upper approximation matrix, further improving the accuracy of attribute outlier detection. Experimental results on multiple public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method generally outperforms existing multi-view outlier detection methods in terms of detection accuracy and robustness.},

Various forms of prior information, including must-link and cannot-link constraints, supervised dissimilarities, and Distance Metric Learning, are incorporated to guide training and improve generalisation. By processing image pairs through shared network weights, DEEM aligns pairwise dissimilarities with the conflict between mass functions, thereby mitigating errors in noisy or incomplete distance matrices.
