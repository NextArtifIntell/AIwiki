  abstract     = {This study employs an integral transform approach for Love wave propagation in a rotating composite structure having an interfacial crack. The structure comprises an initially stressed functionally graded piezoelectric-viscoelastic half-space bonded to a piezoelectric-viscoelastic half-space, and is subjected to anti-plane mechanical loading and in-plane electrical loading. The study focuses on two material systems: the first material system consists of Epoxy-BNKLBT and Epoxy-KNLNTS, where BNKLBT stands for 0.885 ( Bi 0.5 Na 0.5 ) TiO 3 − 0.05 ( Bi 0.5 K 0.5 ) TiO 3 − 0.015 ( Bi 0.5 Li 0.5 ) TiO 3 − 0.05 BaTiO 3 , and KNLNTS represents ( K 0.475 Na 0.475 Li 0.05 ) ( Nb 0.92 Ta 0.05 Sb 0.03 ) O 3 , doped with 0.4 wt% CeO 2 and 0.4 wt% MnO 2 . The second material system has Epoxy-BNKLBT and Epoxy-PZT7A, where PZT7A denotes Lead Zirconate Titanate. The viscoelastic materials are modeled to reflect their complex behavior under rotational and stress conditions. The Galilean transformation is applied to convert the Cartesian coordinate system into a moving reference frame aligned with the Love wave&#39;s propagation. Employing Bessel function properties, the system is converted into a set of double integral equations and subsequently reformulated into simultaneous Fredholm integral equations. Numerical solutions to these Fredholm integral equations are employed to compute the electric displacement intensity factor and the stress intensity factor near the interfacial crack. These factors are also used to derive the expression for the energy density factor, thereby demonstrating the intrinsic coupling between the stress intensity factor and the electric displacement intensity factor. The key objective of this study is to visualize the impact of different material parameters, including piezoelectric constants, dielectric constants, initial stress, electric displacement at the interface, as well as interface stress and rotation on the stress intensity, electric displacement intensity, and energy density factors. The investigations of this study will be helpful for advanced technologies like surface acoustic wave sensors and piezoelectric actuators, as well as to enhance surface acoustic wave bio-sensor sensitivity and stability for early cancer detection and biomedical implants.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates the application of wetting boundary conditions for modelling flows in complex curved geometries, such as rough fractures. It implements and analyses two common variants of the wetting boundary condition within the three-dimensional (3D) phase field lattice Boltzmann method. It provides a straightforward and novel extension of the geometrical approach to curved three-dimensional surfaces. It additionally implements surface-energy approach. A novel interpolation-based mitigation of the staircase approximation for curved boundaries is then developed and consistently applied to both wetting boundary conditions. The objectives of simplicity and parallel compute efficiency in implementation are emphasised. Through detailed validation on a series of 3D benchmark cases involving curved surfaces, such as droplet spread on a sphere, capillary intrusion, and droplet impact on a sphere, the behaviour of the wetting boundary conditions are validated and the differences between methods are highlighted. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach in complex geometries with varying surface curvatures, two-phase flow through a synthetic rough fracture is presented. The suitability of the methods for complex simulations is also verified by comparing the computational performance between all investigated methods using this fracture flow test case. The present work thus contributes to the field of multiphase flow modelling with the lattice Boltzmann method in realistic applications where addressing the impact of complex geometries is essential.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a phase field approach to multi-material topology optimization of thermo-elastic structures. Based on the ordered Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (ordered SIMP) model, the phase field variable is interpreted as the normalized density, which is used as the design variable in topology optimization. The material properties are interpolated in each interval of the normalized density. The advantage of ordered SIMP is that the number of design variables does not depend on the number of materials. In the proposed method, phase field evolution is governed by one Allen-Cahn type equation, with the introduction of a multiple-well potential function to take into account multiple material phases. This feature makes the current approach different from previous works, where numerous phase field evolution equations are needed. In contrast to the original ordered SIMP model, which was developed for structures subjected to only mechanical load, the current approach incorporates interpolation schemes to account for both thermal conductivity and thermal stress coefficient. An assessment of the feasibility and performance of the developed method is conducted via various benchmark examples and comparison with available reference results in the literature.},

  abstract     = {We propose mixed finite element methods for the coupled Biot poroelasticity and Poisson–Nernst–Planck equations (modeling ion transport in deformable porous media). For the poroelasticity, we consider a primal-mixed, four-field formulation in terms of the solid displacement, the fluid pressure, the Darcy flux, and the total pressure. In turn, the Poisson–Nernst–Planck equations are formulated in terms of the electrostatic potential, the electric field, the ionized particle concentrations, their gradients, and the total ionic fluxes. The weak formulation, posed in Banach spaces, exhibits the structure of a perturbed block-diagonal operator consisting of perturbed and generalized saddle-point problems for the Biot equations, a generalized saddle-point system for the Poisson equations, and a perturbed twofold saddle-point problem for the Nernst–Planck equations. One of the main novelties here is the well-posedness analysis, hinging on the Banach fixed-point theorem along with small data assumptions, the Babuška–Brezzi theory in Banach spaces, and a slight variant of recent abstract results for perturbed saddle-point problems, again in Banach spaces. The associated Galerkin scheme is addressed similarly, employing the Banach fixed-point theorem to yield discrete well-posedness. A priori error estimates are derived, and simple numerical examples validate the theoretical error bounds, and illustrate the performance of the proposed schemes.},

The analysis approach involves a priori boundedness of the finite element solution, anisotropic properties of the element, energy projection error, DOC kernels and a modified discrete Grönwall inequality. Theoretical results reveal that the error in H 1 -norm is sharp in time and optimal or even superconvergent in space. Abundant numerical experiments verify the theoretical results, and demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed fully discrete scheme.},

It is shown that this method is energy-conservative, and optimal error estimates in the energy norm are proved with the help of a modified elliptic projection. Moreover, a superconvergence result is derived, and as a consequence, the maximum norm estimate is obtained. Then, a non-standard type argument shows optimal error analysis in the L ∞ ( L 2 ) -norm with reduced regularity assumption on the solution. Further, the optimal order of convergence for the Lagrange multiplier is also established, and a superconvergence result for the gradient of the error between the modified elliptic projection and the primal hybrid finite element solution in maximum norm is derived. For a complete discrete scheme, an energy-conservative finite difference method is applied in the temporal direction, and the well-posedness of the discrete system is shown using a variant of the Brouwer fixed point theorem. The optimal rate of convergence for the primal variable in energy and L 2 -norm for the fully discrete problem are established. Both semidiscrete and fully discrete schemes are analyzed for polynomial non-linearity, which is of the locally Lipschitz type.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a numerically stable and efficient method based on Haar wavelets for solving high-dimensional second-order parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs). In the proposed framework, the spatial second-order derivatives in the governing equation are approximated using the Haar wavelet series. These approximations are subsequently integrated to obtain the corresponding lower-order derivatives. By substituting these expressions into the governing equation, the PDE is transformed into a system of first-order ordinary differential equations. This resulting system is then advanced in time using Euler&#39;s scheme. Conventional Haar wavelet methods transform the given PDEs into a system with a large number of equations, which makes them computationally expensive. In contrast, the present Haar wavelets method (HWM) significantly reduces the number of algebraic equations. Moreover, the incorporation of the Kronecker product and vectorization operator properties in the HWM substantially decreases the computational cost compared to existing Haar wavelet methods in the literature (e.g., [25] , [34] , [35] ). The HWM achieves second-order accuracy in spatial variables. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the HWM through various multi-dimensional problems, including two-, three-, four-, and ten-dimensional cases. The numerical results confirm the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach.},

This work analyzes the computational cost of the resulting hybrid least-squares/gradient-descent optimizer and explains how to implement it efficiently. In particular, we show that a traditional implementation based on backward-mode automatic differentiation leads to a prohibitively expensive algorithm. To remedy this, we propose using either forward-mode automatic differentiation or an ultraweak-type scheme that avoids the differentiation of trial functions in the discrete weak formulation. The proposed alternatives are up to one hundred times faster than the traditional one, recovering a computational cost-per-iteration similar to that of a conventional gradient-descent-based optimizer alone.

The key to energy stability is the addition of appropriate stabilisation terms into the convective fluxes of mass and momenta, and the source term. The space-time fully-discrete scheme admits the positivity of the mass density, and is consistent with the weak formulation of the EPB system upon mesh refinement. In the quasineutral limit, the numerical scheme yields a consistent, semi-implicit discretisation of the isothermal compressible Euler system, thus leading to the AP property. Several benchmark numerical case studies are performed to confirm the robustness and efficacy of the proposed scheme in the dispersive as well as the quasineutral regimes. The numerical results also corroborates scheme&#39;s ability to very well resolve plasma sheaths and the related dynamics, which indicates its potential to applications involving low-temperature plasma problems.},
