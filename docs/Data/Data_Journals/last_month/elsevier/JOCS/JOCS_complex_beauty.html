  abstract     = {Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, which capturethe heart&#39;s electrical activity, are used to diagnose and monitor cardiac problems. The accurate classification of ECG signals, particularly for distinguishing among various types of arrhythmias and myocardial infarctions, is crucial for the early detection and treatment of heart-related diseases. This paper proposes a novel approach based on an improved differential evolution (DE) algorithm for ECG signal classification for enhancing the performance. In the initial stages of our approach, the preprocessing step is followed by the extraction of several significant features from the ECG signals. These extracted features are then provided as inputs to an enhanced multi-layer perceptron (MLP). While MLPs are still widely used for ECG signal classification, using gradient-based training methods, the most widely used algorithm for the training process, has significant disadvantages, such as the possibility of being stuck in local optimums. This paper employs an enhanced differential evolution (DE) algorithm for the training process as one of the most effective population-based algorithms. To this end, we improved DE based on a clustering-based strategy, opposition-based learning, and a local search. Clustering-based strategies can act as crossover operators, while the goal of the opposition operator is to improve the exploration of the DE algorithm. The weights and biases found by the improved DE algorithm are then fed into six gradient-based local search algorithms. In other words, the weights found by the DE are employed as an initialization point. Therefore, we introduced six different algorithms for the training process (in terms of different local search algorithms). In an extensive set of experiments, we showed that our proposed training algorithm could provide better results than the conventional training algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Exploring a group of influential spreaders to acquire maximum influence has become an emerging area of research in complex network analysis. The main challenge of this research is to identify the group of important nodes that are scattered broadly, such that the propagation ability of information is maximum to a network. Researchers proposed many centrality-based approaches with certain limitations to identify the influential nodes (spreaders) considering different properties of the networks. To find a group of spreaders, the VoteRank (a voting mechanism) based method produces effective results with low time complexity, where in each iteration, the node votes for its neighbors by its voting capability, and the node obtaining the maximum vote score is identified as an influential spreader. The major loophole of existing VoteRank methods is measuring the voting capability based on the degree, k-shell index, or contribution of neighbors methods, which does not efficiently identify the spreaders from the diverse regions based on their spreading ability. In this paper, we propose a novel Community-based VoteRank method (CVoteRank) to identify a group of influential spreaders from diverse network regions by which the diffusion process is enhanced. Firstly, we measure every node’s spreading ability based on intra- and inter-connectivity structure in a community, which signifies the local and global importance of the node. To identify the seed nodes, we assign the spreading ability to that node’s voting capability and iteratively calculate the voting score of a node based on its neighboring voting capability and its spreading ability. Then, the node acquiring the maximum voting score is identified as the influential spreader in each iteration. Finally, to solve the problem of influence overlapping, CVoteRank reduces the voting capability of the neighboring nodes of the identified spreader. The efficiency of CVoteRank is evaluated and compared with the different state-of-the-art methods on twelve real networks. Utilizing the stochastic susceptible–infected–recovered epidemic method, we calculate the infected scale, final infected scale, and the average shortest path length among the identified spreaders. The experimental results show that CVoteRank identifies the most efficient spreaders with the highest spreading ability within a short period and the maximum reachability, and the identified spreaders are situated at diverse portions of the networks.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces the Interpoint Inception Distance (IID) as a new approach for evaluating deep generative models. It is based on reducing the measurement of discrepancy between multidimensional feature distributions to one-dimensional interpoint comparisons. Our method provides a general tool for deriving a wide range of evaluation measures. The Cramér Interpoint Inception Distance (CIID) is notable for its theoretical properties, including a Gaussian-free structure of feature distribution and a strongly consistent estimator. Our experiments, conducted on both synthetic and large-scale real or generated data, suggest that CIID is a promising competitor to the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), which is currently the primary metric for evaluating deep generative models. This article is an extended version of the ICCS 2024 conference paper (Jajeśniak et al., 2024) [1] .},

  abstract     = {Extensive work has been done in supervised continual learning (SCL) , wherein models adapt to changing distributions with labeled data while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. However, this approach diverges from real-world scenarios where labeled data is scarce or non-existent. Unsupervised continual learning (UCL) emerges to bridge this disparity. Previous research has explored methods for unsupervised continuous feature learning by incorporating rehearsal to alleviate the problem of catastrophic forgetting. Although these techniques are effective, they may not be feasible for scenarios where storing training data is impractical. Moreover, rehearsal techniques may confront challenges pertaining to representation drifts and overfitting, particularly under limited buffer size conditions. To address these drawbacks, we employ parameter isolation as a strategy to mitigate forgetting. Specifically, we use task-specific hard attention to prevent updates to parameters important for previous tasks. In contrastive learning, loss is prone to be negatively affected by a reduction in the diversity of negative samples. Therefore, we incorporate instance-to-instance similarity into contrastive learning through both direct instance grouping and discrimination at the cross-level with local instance groups, as well as with local pseudo-instance groups. The masked model learns the features using cross-level discrimination, which naturally clusters similar data in the representation space. Extensive experimentation demonstrates that our proposed approach outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines by significant margins, all while exhibiting minimal or nearly zero forgetting, and without the need for any rehearsal buffer. Additionally, the model learns distinct task boundaries. It achieves an overall-average task and class incremental learning (TIL &amp; CIL) accuracy of 76.79% and 62.96% respectively with nearly zero forgetting, across standard datasets for varying task sequences ranging from 5 to 100. This surpasses SOTA baselines, which only reach 74.28% and 60.68% respectively in the UCL setting, where they experience substantial forgetting of almost over 4%. Moreover, our approach achieves performance nearly comparable to the SCL baseline and even surpasses it on some standard datasets, with a notable reduction in forgetting from almost 14.51% to nearly zero.},
