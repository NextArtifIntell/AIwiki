  abstract     = {We carry on a more detailed investigation of the composition of locally solid convergences as introduced in [6] , as well as the corresponding notion of idempotency considered in [4] . In particular, we study the interactions between these two concepts and various operations with convergences. We prove associativity of the composition and show that the adherence of an ideal with respect to an idempotent convergence is equal to its closure. Some results from [12] about unbounded modification of locally solid topologies are generalized to the level of locally solid idempotent convergences. A simple application of the composition allows us to answer a question from [6] about minimal Hausdorff locally solid convergences. We also show that the weakest Hausdorff locally solid convergence exists on an Archimedean vector lattice if and only if it is atomic.},

These conditions incorporate jumps in the Dirichlet traces both of the functions in the operator domains and of their Wirtinger derivatives and are non-local. Constructing a convenient generalized boundary triple, they may be parametrized by all compact self-adjoint operators in L 2 ( Σ ; C 2 ) . Whereas for all choices of parameters the essential spectrum is stable and equal to [ 0 , + ∞ ) , the discrete spectrum exhibits diverse behavior. While in many cases it is finite, we will describe also a class of parameters for which the discrete spectrum is infinite and accumulates at −∞. The latter class contains a non-local version of the oblique transmission conditions. Finally, we will connect the current model to its relativistic counterpart studied recently in [33] .},

To obtain our results, we develop a new global Carleman estimate for the forward stochastic parabolic adjoint system, with some terms in the H − 1 -space. Subsequently, we derive the corresponding observability inequality, and using the classical duality argument, we establish our null controllability result.

We use this fact to develop a smooth functional calculus for such elements. We also give some sufficient conditions for these algebras to be symmetric.

The MLF space is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space that extends the classic Fock space and its reproducing kernel is given by the Mittag-Leffler function. We study the MLB transform and its main properties in the quaternionic setting. In this noncommutative setting there are two function theories that are prominent: the slice hyperholomorphic theory and the Fueter regular theory. The connection between the slice hyperholomorphic functions and the Fueter regular functions is given by the Fueter mapping theorem. The Mittag-Leffler Bargmann transform investigated in this paper maps the quaternionic-valued L 2 ( R , H ) space onto a counterpart of the MLF space in the Fueter regular setting. Finally the creation, annihilation, backward-shift and integration operators are studied in the case of the Fueter-MLF space.},

Some of the aforementioned results complement ones of Ľubica Holá and Dušan Holý. Also, we obtain analogous characterizations for spaces of minimal cusco maps.},

In their influential work, Petek and Šemrl characterize Jordan automorphisms of M n and T n , when n ≥ 3 , as (injective in the case of T n ) continuous commutativity and spectrum preserving maps ϕ : M n → M n and ϕ : T n → T n . Recently, in a joint work with Petek, the authors extended this characterization to the maps ϕ : A → M n , where A is an arbitrary subalgebra of M n that contains T n . In particular, any such map ϕ is a Jordan embedding and hence of the form ϕ ( X ) = T X T − 1 or ϕ ( X ) = T X t T − 1 , for some invertible matrix T ∈ M n . In this paper we further extend the aforementioned results in the context of structural matrix algebras (SMAs), i.e. subalgebras A of M n that contain all diagonal matrices. More precisely, we provide both a necessary and sufficient condition for an SMA A ⊆ M n such that any injective continuous commutativity and spectrum preserving map ϕ : A → M n is necessarily a Jordan embedding. In contrast to the previous cases, such maps ϕ no longer need to be multiplicative/antimultiplicative, nor rank-one preservers.},

The interactions among the diffusion, attraction, repulsion, and logistic sources in the system determine the behavior of solutions. It is showed that when N &lt; 4 , as long as the diffusion mechanism of population w dominates with q 2 − p 2 &lt; 4 N , global boundedness of solutions can be guaranteed; if max ⁡ { q 1 , q 2 } ≤ min ⁡ { p 1 + 2 N , p 2 + 2 N } or max ⁡ { q 1 , q 2 } ≤ min ⁡ { k 1 − 1 , k 2 − 1 } , i.e. the diffusion mechanisms or the logistic source terms of populations u and w are both dominant, the solutions are globally bounded; when the diffusion mechanism of u (or w ) and the logistic source term of w (or u ) dominate with max ⁡ { q 1 , q 2 } ≤ min ⁡ { k 2 − 1 , p 1 + 2 N } (or max ⁡ { q 1 , q 2 } ≤ min ⁡ { k 1 − 1 , p 2 + 2 N } ), the solutions are globally bounded. Also, we have proved that when the logistic source term of either u or w dominates, the global boundedness of the solutions can be obtained. Moreover, we give the large time behavior of the globally bounded solutions.},

We derive asymptotic expansions for these functions, accompanied by explicit and computable error bounds. For real values of a , the function ti ( a , z , α ) possesses infinitely many positive real zeros. Assuming a &lt; 1 , we establish asymptotic expansions for the large zeros, accompanied by precise error estimates. The error bounds for the asymptotics of the phase function and its zeros will be derived by studying the analytic properties of both the phase function and its inverse. Additionally, we demonstrate that for real variables, the derived asymptotic expansions are enveloping, meaning that successive partial sums provide upper and lower bounds for the corresponding functions.},

The basic reproduction number R 0 ( ψ ) in the between-host model strongly depends on the within-host infection process. If R 0 ( ψ ) &lt; 1 , the disease-free steady state E 0 of the between-host epidemic model is locally stable, and if R 0 ( ψ ) &gt; 1 , the endemic steady state E ⁎ of the between-host epidemic model is locally stable. If R 0 ( 0 ) &lt; 1 , the disease-free steady state E 0 of the between-host epidemic model is globally stable. Furthermore, to better understand the roles of within-host treatment and between-host control in disease transmission, we formulated and studied an optimal control problem for the immuno-epidemiological model involving treatment and vaccination. Numerical simulations were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the control strategies in various infection processes. The results showed that the duration of within-host treatment must be longer than the duration of vaccination to better control the spread of the disease.},

This study leverages the reaction-diffusion epidemic model to improve the accuracy of identifying infected areas and predicting potential outbreaks. Compression mapping and the standard theory of parabolic equations are applied to analyze the dynamics of susceptible individuals influenced by linear external sources, simulating their birth and death rates. Key findings reveal a dichotomous relationship between the spread and extinction of infectious diseases, dictated by the time-dependent basic reproduction number. Furthermore, the study investigates the impact of the diffusion coefficient, the propagation potential of infected individuals, and the initial infection range on disease dissemination or attenuation. Numerical simulations support the theoretical findings, indicating that a high expanding capacity of infected individuals poses challenges to effective disease prevention and control. This work provides novel insights into the spatio-temporal dynamics of the SIS model and lays a foundation for future research endeavours in this domain.},

The diffusion terms of the state equations are allowed to be control dependent with convex control constraints. Transposition method is adopted to deal with the adjoint operator-valued backward stochastic evolution equations, especially the correction terms. Besides, weak convergence arguments are used to obtain the optimal uncertainty reference measure, in which the regularities of the state processes, variational processes, and adjoint processes in the transposition sense are characterized. Malliavin calculus is applied to pave the way for differentiation theorem of Lebesgue type to deduce the pointwise robust optimality conditions.},

These results are based on new error estimates, previously known for the Stokes system in polyhedral or polygonal convex domains, that we have recently extended to the Oseen system in polyhedral (or polygonal) convex or non-convex domains.
