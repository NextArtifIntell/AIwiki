  abstract     = {The manuscript considers multivariate functional data analysis with a known graphical model among the functional variables representing their conditional relationships (e.g., brain region-level fMRI data with a prespecified connectivity graph among brain regions). Functional Gaussian graphical models (GGM) used for analyzing multivariate functional data customarily estimate an unknown graphical model, and cannot preserve knowledge of a given graph. We propose a method for multivariate functional analysis that exactly conforms to a given inter-variable graph. We first show the equivalence between partially separable functional GGM and graphical Gaussian processes (GP), proposed recently for constructing optimal multivariate covariance functions that retain a given graphical model. The theoretical connection helps to design a new algorithm that leverages Dempster’s covariance selection for obtaining the maximum likelihood estimate of the covariance function for multivariate functional data under graphical constraints. We also show that the finite term truncation of functional GGM basis expansion used in practice is equivalent to a low-rank graphical GP, which is known to oversmooth marginal distributions. To remedy this, we extend our algorithm to better preserve marginal distributions while respecting the graph and retaining computational scalability. The benefits of the proposed algorithms are illustrated using empirical experiments and a neuroimaging application.},

  abstract     = {The permutation test is a widely recognized and frequently used nonparametric hypothesis test, notable for its minimal reliance on assumptions compared to parametric tests. It has found applications in many fields, particularly in multivariate analysis. Since its introduction in the 1930s, permutation tests have been extensively examined both theoretically and empirically. This article provides the results of a comprehensive and systematic review of the literature, focusing on different aspects of multivariate permutation tests. Key articles published in international journals from 2010 onwards have been analyzed, classifying them into four main research strands: data, model, test and issues. These strands were further subdivided into more specific categories. The state of the art and significant developments in this field are summarized, followed by a discussion on future research challenges and trends, offering guidance for the design and development on new approaches.},

  abstract     = {One of the first steps in applications of statistical network analysis is frequently to produce summary charts of important features of the network. Many of these features take the form of sequences of graph statistics counting the number of realized events in the network, examples of which are degree distributions, edgewise shared partner distributions, and more. We provide conditions under which the empirical distributions of sequences of graph statistics are consistent in the ℓ ∞ -norm in settings where edges in the network are dependent. We accomplish this task by deriving concentration inequalities that bound probabilities of deviations of graph statistics from the expected value under weak dependence conditions. We apply our concentration inequalities to empirical distributions of sequences of graph statistics and derive non-asymptotic bounds on the ℓ ∞ -error which hold with high probability. Our non-asymptotic results are then extended to demonstrate uniform convergence almost surely in selected examples. We illustrate theoretical results through examples, simulation studies, and an application.},

According to the characteristics of the family, the marginal distributions of the Markov random fields are all Poisson with the same mean, and are untied from the strength or structure of their built-in dependence. This key feature is uncommon for Markov random fields and most convenient for applications purposes. The specific properties of this new family confer a straightforward sampling procedure and analytic expressions for the joint probability mass function and the joint probability generating function of the vector of counting random variables, thus granting computational methods that scale well to vectors of high dimension. We study the distribution of the sum of random variables constituting a Markov random field from the proposed family, analyze a random variable’s individual contribution to that sum through expected allocations, and establish stochastic orderings to assess a wide understanding of their behavior.},

  abstract     = {We propose a novel semiparametric classifier based on Mahalanobis distances of an observation from the competing classes. Our tool is a generalized additive model with the logistic link function that uses these distances as features to estimate the posterior probabilities of different classes. While popular parametric classifiers like linear and quadratic discriminant analyses are mainly motivated by the normality of the underlying distributions, the proposed classifier is more flexible and free from such parametric modeling assumptions. Since the densities of elliptic distributions are functions of Mahalanobis distances, this classifier works well when the competing classes are (nearly) elliptic. In such cases, it often outperforms popular nonparametric classifiers, especially when the sample size is small compared to the dimension of the data. To cope with non-elliptic and possibly multimodal distributions, we propose a local version of the Mahalanobis distance. Subsequently, we propose another classifier based on a generalized additive model that uses the local Mahalanobis distances as features. This nonparametric classifier usually performs like the Mahalanobis distance based semiparametric classifier when the underlying distributions are elliptic, but outperforms it for several non-elliptic and multimodal distributions. We also investigate the behavior of these two classifiers in high dimension, low sample size situations. A thorough numerical study involving several simulated and real datasets demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed classifiers in comparison to many state-of-the-art methods.},

This paper studies the problem of optimal prediction for non-Euclidean objects by extending the method of model averaging. In particular, we generalize the notion of model averaging for global Fréchet regressions and establish an optimal property of the cross-validation to select the averaging weights in terms of the final prediction error.

In this paper, a scaled factor-augmented quantile regression with aggregation (SFQRA) method is proposed for an effective prediction. It first estimates different conditional quantiles by introducing scaled covariates to the factor-augmented quantile regression, which not only combats the curse of dimensionality but also includes the target information in the estimation. Then the different conditional quantiles are aggregated appropriately to a robust forecast. Moreover, combining SFQRA with feature screening via an aggregated quantile correlation allows it to be extended to handle cases when only a portion of covariates is informative. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is justified theoretically, under the framework of large cross-sections and large time dimensions while no restriction is imposed on the relation between them. Various simulation studies and real data analyses demonstrate the superiority of the newly proposed method in forecasting.},

He pioneered almost all the main branches of statistics, but it is not as well known that he opened the area of Directional Statistics with his 1953 paper introducing a distribution on the sphere which is now known as the Fisher distribution. He stressed that for spherical data one should take into account that the data is on a manifold. We will describe this Fisher distribution and reanalyze his geological data. We also comment on the two goals he set himself in that paper, and on how he reinvented the von Mises distribution on the circle. Since then, many extensions of this distribution have appeared bearing Fisher’s name such as the von Mises–Fisher distribution and the matrix Fisher distribution. In fact, the subject of Directional Statistics has grown tremendously in the last two decades with new applications emerging in life sciences, image analysis, machine learning and so on. We give a recent new method of constructing the Fisher type distributions on manifolds which has been motivated by some problems in machine learning. The number of directional distributions has increased since then, including the bivariate von Mises distribution and we describe its connection to work resulting in the 2024 Nobel-winning AlphaFold (in Chemistry). Further, the subject has evolved as Statistics on Manifolds which also includes the new field of Shape Analysis, and finally, we end with a historical note pointing out some correspondence between D’Arcy Thompson and R.A. Fisher related to Shape Analysis.},

For estimation, functional principal component basis functions are utilized to approximate the slope function and functional predictor variable, while B-spline functions are employed to approximate the varying coefficient component. Under mild regularity conditions, the convergence rates of the resulting estimators for the unknown slope function and varying coefficient are established under various cases. To numerically estimate the proposed model, we recommend employing a computationally efficient mode expectation–maximization algorithm with the aid of a Gaussian kernel. The tuning parameters are selected using the mode-based Bayesian information criterion and cross-validation procedures. Built upon the generalized likelihood technique, we further develop a goodness-of-fit test to assess the constancy of varying coefficient functions and put forward a wild bootstrap procedure for estimating the corresponding critical values. The finite sample performance of the developed estimators is illustrated through Monte Carlo simulations and real data analysis related to the Tecator data. The results produced by the propounded method are compared favorably with those obtained from alternative estimation techniques.},

The other test is adaptive to projection direction and is generalized to the assumption of the whole elliptical distribution and independent component model.

Our approach leverages non-parametrically estimated basis functions, eliminating the need for choosing working correlation structures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method achieves a parametric n -convergence rate, contingent on an appropriate choice of bandwidth. This convergence is observed when the number of repeated measurements per trajectory exceeds a certain threshold, specifically, when it surpasses n a 0 , with n representing the number of trajectories. Additionally, we establish the asymptotic normality of the resulting estimator. The performance of the proposed method is compared with that of existing methods through extensive simulation studies, where our proposed method outperforms.

  abstract     = {It is shown that the usual delete-1 jackknife variance estimator of the asymptotic variance of spatial median is consistent. This is proved under the assumptions that the dimension of the data d ≥ 3 , the sampled distribution possesses a density with respect to the Lebesgue measure and this density is bounded on every bounded subset of R d .},
