  abstract     = {Prostate cancer cells depend on androgen for their survival. A standard treatment of metastatic prostate cancer (mPC) is androgen deprivation treatment (ADT). However, after a period of remission, some cancer cells changed into androgen-independent cells, and then treatment proceeds with a combination of ADT and chemotherapy. Senescent cells are cells that stop dividing but sustain viability. Senescence cancer cells are common in cancer, and they affect cancer treatment negatively by secreting inflammatory cytokines and pro-cancer VEGF. In this paper, we include the effect of senescence in a model of mPC. We consider combinations of ADT, chemotherapy, and senolytic drug, which eliminate senescent cells, in a spatio-temporal partial differential equations model, and demonstrate that simulations of the model are in agreement with experimental results. We evaluate the synergy between different doses of chemotherapy and senolytic drugs, at different fixed doses of ADT. We also consider optimal scheduling of the drugs, and the hypothesis that, in optimal schedule, a senolytic drug is to be administered immediately following the chemotherapy drug.},

  abstract     = {Mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) is a neglected tropical disease that became notorious during its 2022–2023 worldwide outbreak. The vaccination was available, but there were inequities in vaccine access. In this paper, we extend existing game-theoretic models to study a population that is heterogeneous in the relative vaccination costs. We consider a population with two groups. We determine the Nash equilibria (NE), i.e., optimal vaccination rates, for each of the groups. We show that the NE always exists and that, for a narrow range of parameter values, there can be multiple NEs. We focus on comparing the mean optimal vaccination rate in the heterogeneous population with the optimal vaccination rate in the corresponding homogeneous population. We show that there is a critical size for the group with lower relative costs and the mean optimal vaccination in the heterogeneous population is more than in the homogeneous population if and only if the group is larger than the critical size.},

  abstract     = {Mathematical models of infectious disease transmission typically neglect within-host dynamics. Yet within-host dynamics – including pathogen replication, host immune responses, and interactions with microbiota – are crucial not only for determining the progression of disease at the individual level, but also for driving within-host evolution and onwards transmission, and therefore shape dynamics at the population level. Various approaches have been proposed to model both within- and between-host dynamics, but these typically require considerable simplifying assumptions to couple processes at contrasting scales (e.g., the within-host dynamics quickly reach a steady state) or are computationally intensive. Here we propose a novel, readily adaptable and broadly applicable method for modelling both within- and between-host processes which can fully couple dynamics across scales and is both realistic and computationally efficient. By individually tracking the deterministic within-host dynamics of infected individuals, and stochastically coupling these to continuous host state variables at the population-level, we take advantage of fast numerical methods at both scales while still capturing individual transient within-host dynamics and stochasticity in transmission between hosts. Our approach closely agrees with full stochastic individual-based simulations and is especially useful when the within-host dynamics do not rapidly reach a steady state or over longer timescales to track pathogen evolution. By applying our method to different pathogen growth scenarios we show how common simplifying assumptions fundamentally change epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Food allergies to eggs and cow’s milk are common during infancy but often undergo desensitization during childhood. To investigate the age dependence of food allergies, we develop a simple mathematical model focusing on T helper 2 cells (Th2) causing allergies and induced regulatory T cells (iTreg) suppressing them. We assume as follows: Both types of cells differentiate from naïve T cells reactive to specific food allergens, with the rate of supply from the thymus decreasing with age. Naïve T cells are activated by allergens in peripheral tissues, differentiating into both Th2 and iTreg cells. The activation rate of Th2 cells is reduced by iTreg cells. Th2 cells promote allergies while iTreg cells help mitigate them. Analyses show that food allergies may develop at one age and resolve at a later age. Negative selection in the thymus reduces the number of naïve T cells that react to proteins resembling components of the body. As a result, allergies to these substances tend to start and resolve earlier in life than those to dissimilar materials. Food allergy starting at an older age tends to have a longer duration if the rate of naïve T cell supply decreases according to a hyperbolic (instead of exponential) function of age.},

  abstract     = {The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an important structure that regulates basal ganglia output and has been involved in the pathophysiology of epilepsy disease. In this paper, we propose an equivalent inhibitory pathway directly projecting from the STN to the cortex and systematically study its regulatory effect on absence seizures. Interestingly, we find that this equivalent inhibitory projection is a key factor for assisting in the development of atypical absence seizures. Through computational simulation and model analysis, we find that the enhancement of coupling strength on this equivalent STN-cortex projection can effectively suppress typical and atypical spike and wave discharges (TSWDs and ASWDs) during absence seizures. Furthermore, altering the activation level of STN through external stimuli can also control seizures, and the presence of equivalent STN-cortex projection makes the control effect more easier to achieve. Several direct and indirect pathways related to the STN can achieve inhibition of SWDs by regulating the activation level of STN, and relevant control strategies have high biological plausibility. Therefore, the STN may be an effective target for the deep brain stimulation (DBS) to control absence seizures. Importantly, we observe that the control effect of DBS-STN on SWDs is significantly superior to other basal ganglia targets in this model. Moreover, we find that the parameter range and value with high biological plausibility for the coupling weight in this equivalent STN-cortex projection can be effectively estimated in this model. Our results imply that the inhibitory effect from the STN to the cortex plays a crucial role in regulating both typical and atypical SWDs, and the STN might be a potential and reasonable DBS target for the treatment of absence epilepsy.},

Specific pathways include the transition of glucose to pyruvate to lactate in a microglia, as well as the gradient transport of glucose and lactate into and out of the cell. Additionally, the upregulation of certain pathways by either epigenetic modification or the inflammatory response are included. Bifurcation and sensitivity analyses demonstrate the importance of key parameters and pathways in the model, specifically the role of lactylation. Our model is validated by qualitatively reproducing recent in vitro experiments in which exogenous glucose and lactate are modified.},

  abstract     = {The interplay between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cancer cells has been observed to impact cell-to-cell interactions in experimental settings. However, the role that space plays in these interactions remains unclear. In this study, we develop mathematical models to investigate how spatial factors affect cell-to-cell competition between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cancer cells in silico. We develop two baseline models to study cells from the epithelial FaDu cell line subjected to two drugs, specifically the ATR inhibitor ceralasertib and the PARP inhibitor olaparib, that target DNA damage response pathways. Our baseline models are: (1) a temporally resolved ordinary differential equation (ODE) model, and (2) a spatio-temporally resolved agent-based model (ABM). The models simulate cells in well-mixed and spatially structured cell systems, respectively. The ODE model is calibrated against in vitro data and is thereafter mapped onto the baseline ABM which, in turn, is extended to enable a simulation-based investigation on how spatial factors impact cell-to-cell competition. Simulation results from the extended ABMs demonstrate that the in silico treatment responses are simultaneously affected by: (i) the initial spatial cell configurations, (ii) the initial fraction of drug-resistant cells, (iii) the drugs to which cells express resistance, (iv) drug combinations, (v) drug doses, and (vi) the doubling time of drug-resistant cells compared to the doubling time of drug-sensitive cells. These results reveal that spatial structures of the simulated cancer cells affect both cell-to-cell interactions, and the impact that these interactions have on the ensuing population dynamics. This leads us to suggest that the role that space plays in cell-to-cell interactions should be further investigated and quantified in experimental settings.},
