  abstract     = {When shopping online, customers may find user-generated images (UGIs) where existing buyers share their product experiences in an actual setting. Drawing on the constructivist theory of visual perception, we propose a cognitive inference process in which shoppers utilize the background objects in UGIs that contextualize a product (e.g., a snow-covered mountain implying cold weather) to infer its features (e.g., the warmth of a jacket). As a result, the contextual cues in UGIs play a critical role in facilitating future buyers&#39; purchase decision-making. Our empirical probes using data from an online outdoor gear and clothing retailer confirm this conjecture by demonstrating that product contextualization in UGIs increases a review&#39;s perceived helpfulness and improves sales. By contrast, the contextual cues in the review text only assist buyers&#39; purchase decision process when they contextualize product functionality (e.g., the windproof of a coat). Yet, they do not work for aesthetic attributes (e.g., the color of a coat). We leverage an experiment to explore the relevant mechanism. In the sales analysis, we reveal that not all image content considered helpful would positively affect sales. For example, after we account for the contextual cues in the UGI, the mere presence of an image in product reviews does not affect sales. On the other hand, although illustrating product malfunction in a UGI does not increase its helpfulness, such content hurts sales. We offer managerial implications based on the empirical findings for review platforms that aim to assist online shoppers in making informed purchases.},

  abstract     = {Most decision models of system resilience use static, deterministic optimization techniques while focusing on resilience assessment. At present, we lack appropriate decision support methodologies and computational tools that can offer dynamic control of resilience and balance the costs of resilience assurance. This paper presents a stochastic dynamic optimization model, based on an infinite horizon Continuous-Time Markov Decision Process, to balance the intervention costs and reduce the total recovery time ensuing a disruption of a social-physical system. We aim to offer a model that can facilitate its application to different disruption scenarios. Our state-space formulation of the recovery process uses discrete performance intervals, whereby actions and resulting rewards/costs are related to investment resources, which govern state transitions. We illustrate the model via a case study based on the 2010 Northern Colombia Dique Canal breach. Our results show that the optimal policy reduced the recovery time and restoration investment by approximately 40% and 10%, respectively, when compared to the efficiency of the government interventions. The proposed model features dynamic control of recovery resources and considers the costs of resilience assurance. The model can inform policymakers of ways to improve system resilience using balanced disruption recovery strategies.},

Despite the rapid growth of FLSMC, little is known about whether FLSMC can bring benefits to patients when they have online consultation needs in the future. Drawing on signaling theory, this study examines the impact of FLSMC on patient engagement and patient satisfaction in the multistage online consultation process. We further explore the moderating effects of physician&#39;s owned and earned signals in the pre-consultation stage by integrating social capital theory with signaling theory. We collect a panel data set of 16,151 physicians from a leading OHC in China. Based on the DID method, a quasi-experimental design, and the instrumental variable method, we demonstrate that FLSMC has a positive effect on patient choice, patient messaging, and patient satisfaction. In addition, we find that the physician&#39;s title and online rating can positively moderate the effects of FLSMC on patient choice. This study not only sheds light on the literature on online healthcare by identifying the role of signals in the context of FLSMC, but also provides decision support for patients, physicians, and OHC managers.},

  abstract     = {Depression is a serious and recurrent mental illness that significantly affects an individual&#39;s life and the society as a whole. Automatic detection of depression is crucial for early intervention and minimizing negative consequences. Existing studies on building deep learning models for automated depression detection have mainly used post-level emotion polarity (i.e., positive and negative emotions) and word embeddings as predictive features. Few have considered depressive emotions (e.g., anhedonia) expressed in those posts, despite that depressive emotions are essential to clinical depression diagnosis. Moreover, existing approaches for depression detection often ignore the relationship between emotions and their context. This study proposes a Depressive Emotion-Context Enhanced Network (DECEN) that consists of a pre-trained depressive emotion recognition module and an emotion-context enhanced representation module to address those limitations. DECEN first integrates semantic and syntactic structure representations of textual content of social media posts to identify depressive emotions conveyed through terms either explicitly or implicitly, rather than general emotion words. Furthermore, we propose an emotion-context enhanced representation method to enhance the role of the context of depressive emotions in depression detection. The evaluation using real social media data demonstrates that DECEN outperforms the state-of-the-art models in depression detection. The results of an ablation experiment also reveal that the proposed depressive emotion recognition and emotion-context enhanced representation modules, the two novel design artifacts, improve model performance. This study contributes to depression diagnostic decisions by introducing a novel method and providing new technical and practical insights for detecting depression from social media content.},

We conceptualize physicians&#39; noncompliance use of AI-aided diagnostic systems and draw on the technology threat avoidance theory (TTAT) to investigate the phenomenon of interest. Specifically, we leverage a mixed-methods approach to develop and test a comprehensive research model of physicians&#39; noncompliance use of AI under the overarching theory of TTAT. With an exploratory qualitative study by interviewing ten physicians with experience in using AI-aided diagnostic systems, we observe that (1) physicians experience two distinct types of threats imposed by AI, namely AI threats to diagnostic process and outcome, (2) physicians&#39; resistance to AI-aided diagnostic systems is the underlying psychological mechanism that turns their AI threat perceptions into noncompliance usage behavior, and (3) physicians&#39; professional capital serves as an essential boundary condition in understanding the impacts of AI threats on resistance. In a confirmatory quantitative survey with 160 physicians, we find that (1) both AI threats to diagnostic process and outcome arouse physicians&#39; psychological resistance, (2) such resistance to AI-aided diagnosis leads to noncompliance usage behavior, (3) noncompliance use of AI-aided diagnosis decreases physicians&#39; diagnostic performance enhanced by AI, and (4) physicians&#39; professional capital weakens the positive impact of AI threat to diagnostic process on resistance, but strengthens the positive impact of AI threat to diagnostic outcome on resistance. Our research advances the understanding of post-adoption noncompliance use of AI technology and enriches TTAT in health AI use.

This research examines the rising phenomenon of vicarious experiences within the metaverse. Using a three-study experimental approach, results show that subjects attain equal levels of embodied social presence (ESP) whether passively viewing or actively engaging with the metaverse. Since embodied social presence is a combination of activity theory and social presence, theory would suggest it cannot occur in purely vicarious experiences that do not involve direct engagement; however, our findings contradict both theory and previous research. Given these findings, we suggest users seek vicarious experiences not just to experience content they enjoy, but to have perceptually similar experiences as those actively participating in the metaverse.},

They also have important implications for resource utilization efficiency and cost containment efforts by healthcare organizations. Effective predictions should consider essential relationships across different variables pertaining to patient demographics, clinical history, injury severity, and physiology. A proposed deep learning–based method incorporates these relationships and can predict LOS more accurately, as demonstrated by a comparative evaluation involving 3722 patients who suffered traumatic fall injuries between 2011 and 2017. The results show the superior performance of the proposed method, relative to eleven prevalent methods that represent different analytics approaches. Our method demonstrates superior predictive performance, as manifested by the highest F-measure values and area under the curve. It is particularly efficacious for patients likely in need of longer LOS, which is relatively more important to physicians and healthcare organizations. This study underscores the value of incorporating important relationships and interactions among distinct patient variables to estimate LOS, with a particular emphasis on the inter-disease relationships, physiology-severity interactions, and patient information in clinical notes. The proposed method can be implemented as a decision support system to enhance physicians&#39; clinical decisions and patient management, and improve healthcare organizations&#39; resource planning and utilization efficiency, with nontrivial cost containment implications.},

In this study, we explore the complementary effects of a specific type of HIT, Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) on cardiac mortality rates (CMR) in hospitals. Though hospital personnel and cardiac medical services (CMS) are pivotal in reducing CMR, CDSS plays a complementary role by providing information and decision support throughout the cardiac care delivery process. Leveraging panel data spanning from 2016 to 2020, our analysis reveals that CDSS complements CMS and hospital personnel in mitigating CMR. These findings provide theoretical insights into the benefits facilitated by CDSS in cardiac care and hold managerial implications for the effective deployment of this technology within hospital settings. Through our analysis, we aim to elucidate the synergistic effects of CDSS, cardiac medical services, and healthcare personnel in improving clinical healthcare outcomes, particularly in the management of cardiac disease.},

These better-informed manufacturers commonly distribute their products not only through traditional offline retailers but also via direct sales channels. In this context, distinct pricing strategies for online channels, namely holding pricing power and giving up pricing power, can be observed in practice. Furthermore, these online channels also enable consumers to post consumer reviews, which significantly impacts consumers’ purchasing decisions. By applying a signaling game, our study examines the interaction between pricing strategy of a direct sales channel and consumer reviews. Our findings indicate that consumer reviews significantly influence the determination of the optimal pricing strategy of direct channel for a better-informed manufacturer. Holding pricing power is always the optimal strategy when the direct channel functions as an authentic distribution channel. However, giving up pricing power can be optimal when the direct channel personates a competitive threat, conditional on the travel cost of traditional channel and the information disclosed through consumer reviews. Contrary to expectations, manufacturer’s retention of pricing power for the direct channel can benefit the retailer when the travel cost to the traditional channel is moderate and the information disclosed in consumer reviews does not exhibit extreme negativity or positivity. Additionally, our findings indicate that the chain members can acquire an agreement on the direct channel’s pricing strategy, which results in a win-win outcome, thereby improving supply chain efficiency.},

This study examines whether and how the general audience-favored answer influences the question asker-selected best answer. Drawing upon uncertainty reduction theory (URT), this paper investigates how three uncertainty reduction strategies (i.e. question askers&#39; tenure, social closeness between the question asker and question answerer, and cultural tightness of the question asker&#39;s region) moderate the relationship between the general audience-favored answer and the question asker-selected best answer. To test the theoretical model, we used a dataset from an online Q&amp;A community comprising 161,695 observations. Our results reveal that the general audience-favored answer more likely leads to the question asker-selected best answer. Furthermore, we find that the question asker&#39;s tenure and the social closeness between the question asker and question answerer negatively moderate the above relationship, while the cultural tightness of question asker&#39;s region positively moderates the above relationship. This research offers a new perspective on the mechanisms through which the general audience-favored answer leads to question asker-selected best answer. By identifying the critical roles of uncertainty reduction strategies during the best answer selection process, our research provides valuable insights for online Q&amp;A community managers to optimize user engagement and satisfaction.},

  abstract     = {Existing Explainable AI (XAI) approaches, such as the widely used SHAP values or counterfactual (CF) explanations, are arguably often too technical for users to understand and act upon. To enhance comprehension of explanations of AI decisions and the overall user experience, we introduce XAIstories, which leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide narratives about how AI predictions are made: SHAPstories based on SHAP and CFstories on CF explanations. We study the impact of our approach on users’ experience and understanding of AI predictions. Our results are striking: over 90% of the surveyed general audience finds the narratives generated by SHAPstories convincing, and over 78% for CFstories, in a tabular data experiment. More than 75% of the respondents in an image experiment find CFstories more or equally convincing as their own crafted stories. We also find that the generated stories help users to more accurately summarize and understand AI decisions than they do when only SHAP values are provided. The results indicate that combining LLM generated stories with current XAI methods is a promising and impactful research direction.},
