  abstract     = {In this study, we investigate the precipitation kinetics of Cu in 15–5 PH maraging stainless steel during high-temperature thermal treatments in the fully austenitic state. This provides direct evidence that Cu precipitation can occur in the austenite phase of martensitic or ferritic steels. The kinetics of Cu precipitation in austenite are examined at 700 and 800 °C using in situ synchrotron small-angle and wide-angle X-ray scattering, complemented by atom probe tomography investigations to analyze the precipitates, particularly their chemistry, following heat treatment. The resulting experimental data, which include the evolution of size, volume fraction, number density and chemical composition, are used to inform precipitation kinetics modelling using the Langer-Schwartz-Kampmann-Wagner (LSKW) approach coupled with CALPHAD thermodynamic and kinetic databases. The simulations accurately capture the experimental data by adjusting the interfacial energy in an inverse modelling approach. The insight that Cu precipitation occurs in austenite and subsequently in martensite paves the way for design of hierarchical structures with a bi-modal particle size distribution of Cu precipitates with varying crystal structures and compositions. Additionally, the validated LSKW modelling approach establishes a foundation for designing Cu-alloyed high-performance steels, taking into account various manufacturing routes.},

This study investigates the impact of He bubbles on the tensile behavior of single-crystal tungsten through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The analysis considers varying He bubble sizes, He/V ratios (the number of helium atoms with respect to the number of vacancies in helium bubble), temperatures, and strain rates. The findings indicate that He bubbles significantly affect the material’s mechanical properties, with larger bubble sizes reducing tensile strength. Dislocation emission initiates from the void surface during tensile deformation. While the He/V ratio slightly influences peak stress values, it does not alter the overall stress–strain curve. Elevated temperatures lower peak stress, whereas higher strain rates increase it. Additionally, machine learning models predict the combined effects of bubble size, He/V ratio, strain rate, and temperature on the peak stress of tungsten, utilizing MD simulation data. This work offers important insights into tungsten’s behavior under irradiation conditions.},

The results show that SPPs with their distances to the O-M interface less than 500 nm remain metallic and exhibit similar structure and composition as those in Zr matrix. However, the SPPs with their distances to the O-M interface more than 1 μm exhibit obvious oxidation, characterized by the high O content and the appearance of the oxides of Fe, Cr and Zr inside the SPPs. The cracks connected to the SPPs could provide a good O supply and enhance the oxidation of the SPPs. Such cracks also promote the outwards diffusion of Fe and Cr from the SPPs during oxidation. In the oxidized Zr(FeCrNb) 2 particles, Fe has a faster outwards diffusion rate than Cr, while Nb seems to be almost immobile. Under certain conditions, small oxidized SPPs will leave porous regions within the oxide film locally. Tetragonal ZrO 2 is observed occasionally nearby the oxidized SPPs, which is thought to be caused by the doping effect of Fe depleted from the dissolved SPPs.},

  abstract     = {Bone tissue engineering scaffolds with reduced elastic anisotropy, enhanced mechanical performance, and high ratio of surface to volume are continuous pursuits. In this work, a mechanical metamaterial design strategy for isotropic bone scaffolds is proposed. The design of isotropic bone scaffolds is realized by interactive clipping of the lattice structure without nesting and complex adjustments. Employing homogenization, elastic stiffness tensors were estimated to evaluate the anisotropic measure, according to Zener ratio and elastic modulus. The designed scaffolds have a Zener ratio of nearly 1.0 and an increase of 20 % in stiffness over the pristine lattice. Quasi-static compression experiments were performed to investigate the Ti4Al6V scaffolds fabricated by selective laser melting, and the results showed that the isotropic scaffolds had compressive strengths of 100.59–198.53 MPa and stiffnesses of 1.86–4.88 GPa, which met the requirements for bone implants. Finite element simulations further revealed the structure’s mechanical response mechanism. Computational fluid dynamics results demonstrated that the structure’s permeability of 8.56 × 10 −9 -1.29 × 10 −8 m 2 , matches well with the requirements of human trabecular bone. Its large surface area facilitates osteogenic differentiation and enhances osseointegration. This study has important contribution in overcoming the constraints in the clinical applications of bone tissue engineering scaffolds.},

  abstract     = {Conventional concrete is generally unsuitable for underwater construction, typically requiring the addition of anti-washout admixtures (AWAs) to improve its washout resistance. Herein, we demonstrate the enhancement of cement paste washout resistance through the in-situ polymerization of acrylamide (AM) and sodium acrylate (SA) and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Macroscopic experiments reveal a significant improvement, with washout loss reduced to 12 % and 2 % of that observed in REF at 60 min for cement pastes modified by the in-situ polymerization of AM and SA, respectively. This enhancement is attributed to the formation of a more flocculated microstructure, where smaller flocs agglomerate into larger ones due to increased floc strength induced by the bridging effect of the resultant polymers. Consequently, flocs in cement pastes with in-situ polymerized SA exhibit higher strength and a denser structure, with a fractal dimension ( D f ) exceeding 2.00, shifting the floc break mode from surface erosion to large-scale fragmentation and thereby improving washout resistance. Nevertheless, the in-situ polymerization of both AM and SA retards cement hydration, albeit through distinct mechanisms: the non-adsorbing PAM molecules primarily hinder the nucleation and formation of hydration products, whereas the adsorbed PAAS molecules predominantly inhibit the dissolution of aqueous species.},

  abstract     = {High-entropy alloys (HEAs) have attracted considerable attention owing to their excellent properties. However, the severe segregation of the constituent elements remains a common challenge in refractory HEAs. Recently, an approach to suppress segregation was proposed using laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) owing to the ultra-high cooling rates during solidification. Despite the advantages of LPBF, the persistent microsegregation between the dendritic and interdendritic regions of refractory HEAs and costly gas atomization process hinder the further development. To address these challenges, a novel nonequiatomic TiNbMoTaW refractory HEA was designed to minimize the difference between the liquidus and solidus temperatures to prevent segregation and phase separation for a better biological performance. In-situ alloying was implemented instead of costly and time-consuming gas atomization process. The segregation of constituent elements was suppressed by remelting, resulted in epitaxial growth and development of crystallographic texture, consequently reducing residual stress. The mechanical properties were improved due to the increase of solid solution strengthening and densification. It showed superior mechanical strength and equivalent biocompatibility compared to conventional biomaterials, indicating its superiority as a biomaterial. This study represents the first successful control of crystallographic texture through in-situ alloying of BioHEAs for next-generation biomaterials.},

The proof-of-principle study is based on a binary Al–4.28 wt%-Sn alloy, where a Sn-rich eutectic with a liquidus temperature of 228 °C acts as a self-assembling healing agent, and validated by a two-pronged approach: (i) A bulk sample with artificial damage is exploited to evaluate the healing effect on large cracks open to the sample surface and to gauge its mechanical effectiveness, whereas (ii) a 3.5 µm-thick Al 2 O 3 -Al-Sn-Al thin film multilayer architecture was used as a model system to study the healing mechanisms of small-scale internal damage induced by bending of the brittle Al 2 O 3 layer. A crack length of ∼1.6 mm could be successfully re-filled by the low-melting eutectic with a simple annealing treatment at 400 °C for 30 min, which increased the bulk tensile ductility to more than 120 % compared to a similarly damaged pure Al sample. Furthermore, it is shown that the dispersion of the Sn-rich eutectic can be effectively controlled by utilising the polymorphy of Sn during material production. Alloy design perspectives for translating these findings towards industrial materials and applications are outlined and discussed.},

We propose a novel cost-effective method to fabricate the photonic structures via soft colloidal lithography negative templating of thin films of TiO 2 nanoparticles, successfully scaling the production to 11x11 cm 2 glass windows. Through simulations and optical-electrical characterization, we demonstrate substantial improvements in energy harvesting for different angles of solar irradiation. We found increases in power output ranging from 57% for angles of incidence below 45° to above 100% for 60° thanks to the nanostructured TiO 2 nanoparticles coatings added to a bottom down-shifting layer. This shows that such integrated approach can enhance both the efficiency and aesthetic appeal of solar solutions in urban environments, advancing the design of energy-efficient, sustainable buildings. Our methodology ensures consistent solar energy capture all year-round, for the relevant range of sunlight incidence angles, while preserving the transparency and multifunctionality of building elements.},

To optimize the coordination of strength, ductility and toughness, a fiber-like structure in a metastable β titanium alloy was architected through a simple thermomechanical process and aging treatment. During the thermomechanical process, the microscale primary α phase (α p ) hindered the migration of β grain boundaries and coordinated the deformation, forming fiber-like β grains. The fiber-like β grains effectively hinder and deflect crack propagation in Charpy impact tests, significantly enhancing the impact toughness. Meanwhile, plenty of kink bands activated in the α p after the thermomechanical process, refining the α grains and resulting in high yield strength and ductility. The impact toughness of the fiber-structured titanium alloy rises from 28.3 ± 2.5 J/cm 2 to 47.3 ± 2.8 J/cm 2 when compared to the sample with a bimodal structure, while the yield strength and elongation remain at the same level.

Preventing AL was crucial for significantly enhancing patient quality of life. Thus, we developed an injectable photosensitive hydrogel enriched with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) aimed at preventing AL. This study utilized the Schiff-base crosslinking reaction between photosensitive methacryloyl-substituted gelatin (GM) and oxidized dextran (OD), incorporating PRP to create a multifunctional, tri-crosslinked hydrogel (GM/OD@PRP) that effectively promotes AL healing. This GM/OD@PRP exhibited excellent mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and self-healing capabilities. The hydrogel was loaded with PRP, which was rich in various growth factors that stimulate fibroblast proliferation and angiogenesis, thereby increasing cell proliferation, vascular regeneration, and formation and ultimately promoting healing at the anastomotic site. Furthermore, the superior antimicrobial properties of GM/OD@PRP provide a relatively sterile environment at the healing site, reducing the possibility of abdominal infections. In a rat model of AL, the GM/OD@PRP notably enhanced anastomotic healing prevented the occurrence of fistulae, and demonstrated significant advantages in reducing abdominal adhesions. This GM/OD@PRP holds substantial potential for use in preventing AL and represents a promising new composite material for improving patient quality of life.},

  abstract     = {Flexible pressure sensors nanofibers-based have garnered significant attention due to their applications in smart wearable devices, healthcare monitoring, human–computer interaction, and artificial intelligence. However, developing flexible pressure sensors with excellent conductivity and stability for stable monitoring of small pressures remains a considerable challenge. This study presents a highly sensitive and rapid-response flexible pressure sensor using liquid metal-graphene composite conductive nanofibers. The sensor employs electrospinning and electrostatic spraying techniques to prepare a liquid metal-polyimide matrix material, with polyvinyl alcohol modification significantly enhancing its adhesion. Notably, an ultrasonic impregnation method was utilized to uniformly disperse conductive fillers onto the surfaces of the nanofibers and within the three-dimensional skeletal structure, creating a dual-conductive network that enhances the sensor’s conductivity. The sensor exhibits high sensitivity (3.02 kPa −1 ), rapid response/recovery times (80 ms/200 ms), and a broad detection range (0–90 kPa), along with excellent mechanical stability and durability (5000 loading–unloading cycles). These advantages enable the flexible pressure sensor to detect various signals from minor body movements to larger motions, such as throat swallowing and finger bending. This research provides an effective method for continuous health monitoring and the identification of subtle physiological changes, showcasing its tremendous potential in the fields of smart robotics and prosthetics.},

  abstract     = {Efficient water splitting is a major challenge in green hydrogen production and energy transition. Thus, considerable scientific efforts are devoted to optimize surface geometries for enhancing the performance of water-splitting catalysts. The current study aims to develop a reliable and facile 3-step (re-)production technique for manufacturing structured surfaces by combining multi-photon lithography (MPL) and nanoimprint lithography (NIL). MPL enables structuring of high-definition micrometer-scale surface geometries. A variation of these topologies was used as masks for replication by NIL. Thus, molds were derived to emboss the original nanostructured topologies repeatedly into a UV-curable resin. Subsequently, a Ni thin film metallization was deposited by physical vapor deposition onto the final imprinted polymeric structures, thereby realizing topologically structured conductive electrodes. To demonstrate the applicability of this elaborated technique, the catalytic activities towards the hydrogen evolution reaction were assessed for different surface geometries. An increase in catalytic performance was achieved through surface enlargement by structuring, whereby a direct contribution of the specific structure geometry was not evident. This elegant method is highly versatile and scalable for producing a wide range of structured functional surfaces on a lab scale, as demonstrated for the water splitting reaction, with results transferable to an industrial scale.},

However, traditional nucleic acid dyes pose great environmental and economic challenges due to their high price, high toxicity, long dyeing time, low sensitivity and insufficient stability. To overcome these problems, we developed a new nucleic acid dye based on carbon dots, which were generated through hydrothermal synthesis with liquorice components as precursors and a system containing ethylenediamine. This new type of carbon dot can effectively replace traditional dyes and can be used to efficiently visualize DNA, RNA and plasmids via agarose gel electrophoresis. Then, we studied the interaction mechanism between carbon dots and nucleic acids by UV–visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and circular dichroism spectroscopy. The interaction between the carbon dots and nucleic acids mainly occurred through groove binding and was accompanied by a slight electrostatic interaction. Carbon dots-based nucleic acid dyes, with their low cost, simple synthesis process and high stability, have opened a new path for the field of nucleic acid detection. Its research and development not only promote the frontier progress of biological science and medicine but also introduces innovative strategies and tools for scientific research and clinical practice.},

We focused on the microfabrication of polymeric materials with elastic limits and MMs regions, which have traditionally been difficult to achieve. Using 3D photolithography, UV-PDMS was successfully processed to incorporate submillimeter-sized through-holes. Furthermore, MMs with different linewidths were fabricated using from an identical mask pattern by only adjusting the UV incidence angle and exposure dose using 3D photolithography.

This is because the particle size and surface chemistry of plastic particles can be parameters for biotoxicity testing. Therefore, different types of particles need to be produced or designed. In this study, the chemical and physical properties of two model nano-samples of Low-Density Polyethylene (LDPE) were investigated; one designed by nanosecond laser ablation (LASER-LDPE.NPs), and the other designed by a combination of Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation and Ultrasound (US) exposure (UV/US-LDPE.NPs). AFM-IR, for detecting and imaging the response of a sample by scanning an AFM cantilever while irradiating an IR laser, was used to analyze the local chemical properties of these particles. New peaks specific to oxidation and degradation reactions were observed. In addition, the LASER-LDPE.NPs tend to have greater oxidation behavior with increasing methyl groups and a greater degradation with increasing carbonyl index than UV/US-LDPE.NPs. It was found that each NP production process produces NPs with unique chemical and physical properties. These designed model plastic particles mimic NPs in the environment and a study of their respective oxidation and degradation properties is expected to provide new insights into the assessment of biological effects.

  abstract     = {This study presents the influence of substrate temperature, sputtering conditions (DC and pulsed DC), and Al content on chemical composition, structure, growth morphology, mechanical properties and thermal stability of non-reactively sputtered Ti-Al-N coatings. The substrate temperature and the pulse frequency have a minor impact on the coating properties, which are more strongly influenced by the chemical composition of the target (Ti 0.5 Al 0.5 N, Ti 0.33 Al 0.67 N, or Ti 0.2 Al 0.8 N) and the duty cycle during pulsed DC sputtering. The highest deposition rate of 109 ± 2 nm/min was obtained from a single-phase cubic rock-salt-structured coating and the highest hardness of 38.2 ± 2.5 GPa from a two-phase-structure coating (cubic rock salt and minor hexagonal wurtzite structure), both prepared from the Ti 0.5 Al 0.5 N target. The maximum Al content (Ti 1-x Al x N) for single-phase cubic rock-salt-structured coatings is x = 0.64, and the minimum Al content for single-phase hexagonal wurtzite-structured coatings is x = 0.81. The findings demonstrate that non-reactive sputtering is a viable method for preparing Ti-Al-N coatings. Furthermore, even without additional substrate heating, this approach achieves a high hardness of 33.6 ± 1.5 GPa and an impressive deposition rate of 102 ± 1 nm/min, offering a pathway to further enhance the sustainable production of these hard protective coatings.},

The use of surface modification techniques, such as nitriding, is essential in advancing the performance and lifetime of implant materials. The innovative use of High Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering (HiPIMS) discharge for nitriding represents a significant advancement in surface treatment technologies for medical implants. In this work, a CoCrMo alloy underwent a low-pressure plasma nitriding process by using four different target materials to sustain the plasma: Ti, Cr, Mo and Ta. Among them, the molybdenum target leads to the best overall performance, since it achieves the formation of the desired γ N phase without secondary phases or surface particles and provides enhanced mechanical properties and chemical stability. The hardness achieved after the nitriding process is significantly higher than that of untreated CoCrMo, reaching up to 18 GPa. All nitrided samples exhibit a positive shift in corrosion potential values in Ringer’s solution, indicating improved corrosion resistance and demonstrate reduced wear rates and smoother wear scars compared to pristine samples, especially the Mo-treated one offers improved tribocorrosion behaviour, balancing wear and corrosion resistance effectively.},

Flexible mechanical metamaterials, in particular, hold significant potential for applications requiring substantial deformations, such as soft robotics and energy absorption. In this study, we proposed a collection of flexible mechanical metamaterials discretely assembled using structural spring elements. These spring elements enhance both flexibility and reversibility, allowing the materials to withstand large deformations. The geometric regularity of the metamaterials enables zero-shot learning, allowing deep learning frameworks to address property prediction and inverse design problems beyond the training dataset. Using a property-prediction model, the effective mechanical properties of these metamaterials can be accurately predicted based on specified design parameters. Furthermore, an inverse-design model enables the direct generation of mechanical metamaterials with desired target properties, even outside the training dataspace, in the range of Young&#39;s modulus E ∈ (0, 350) kPa and Poisson&#39;s ratio ν ∈ (-0.12, 0.12). The properties of these inversely designed metamaterials are analyzed through finite element method simulations and mechanical testing.

Herein, we employ a physics-informed interpretable machine learning-based strategy to facilitate the design of targeted alloys. A home-built dataset is obtained through constructing composition-physical parameters-magnetostriction relationship. By comparing different models, the XGBoost (XGB) regression model is selected to predict magnetostriction of quaternary Tb x Dy 1- x Fe y V 2- y alloys. The results demonstrate that the optimal performance occurs in the composition range of 0.23–0.38 for Tb content and 0.01–0.08 for V content. The predicted properties are then verified by the measured results of a series of synthesized samples. Additionally, a model interpretability based on SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values manifests that volume magnetic susceptibility and bulk modulus exert the greatest impact on magnetostriction. This work offers a recipe to swiftly designing RFe 2 -type materials with giant magnetostriction.},

  abstract     = {Auxetic metamaterials (AM) with negative Poisson’s ratio (NPR) offer promising mechanical properties but often suffer from significant stress concentrations, compromising durability and fatigue life. Conventional design approaches, including topology optimization and empirical geometry-based methods, struggle with exploring complex design spaces, while data-driven techniques demand extensive datasets, making fatigue life prediction computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that integrates Bézier curve-based geometric parameterization, multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MBO), and fatigue life prediction via elastoplastic homogenization and critical distance theory. This approach systematically explores the design space, simultaneously enhancing NPR and optimizing fatigue resistance while alleviating localized stress concentrations. MBO efficiently balances exploration and exploitation with limited data, making it particularly suitable for computationally intensive fatigue analysis. Optimized AM structures exhibited an 85.11% increase in NPR and a 12.07% improvement in low-cycle fatigue (LCF) life compared to initial designs. Experimental validation confirmed up to 30 times the LCF life and a 2.5-fold NPR increase over conventional AM structures. These findings establish a scalable methodology for AM design, advancing the development of durable, high-performance metamaterials for biomedical, aerospace, and energy-harvesting applications.},

  abstract     = {A new surface-texturing technique—laser-induced cavitation micro-texturing (LICMT) was proposed to improve the friction and lubrication properties of 7050 aluminum alloy. Reciprocating friction tests were used to analyze the tribological properties at different micro-texturing densities and depths under starved lubrication conditions. SEM was used to observe the morphology of the wear surface. The average friction coefficient and wear rate were lowest for a micro-texturing density of 19.63 %. The average friction coefficient decreased with increasing micro-texturing depth. Compared with LST, no craters formed on the surface. Because of the lower abrasive and adhesive wear, the LICMT samples exhibited good friction reduction and lubrication performance. Finally, the mechanism of LICMT explained friction reduction and lubrication under starved lubrication conditions.},

  abstract     = {We have collected 21 different formulations of ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), which have been employed as liners in contemporary total knee replacements (TKR). The UHMWPE liners were bought from the most important manufacturers on the orthopedic market in the Czech Republic as of 2020. The collected liners represented a broad range of both traditional and modern UHMWPE formulations, which differed by the level of crosslinking, type of thermal treatment, sterilization and/or stabilization. All obtained UHMWPE’s were characterized by multiple methods immediately after purchase and after the accelerated aging in H 2 O 2 . The experimental results (oxidative degradation, structure changes, and micromechanical properties) were correlated with manufacturer’s data (crosslinking, thermal treatment, sterilization, and stabilization). The investigated UHMWPE liners exhibited significant differences in their properties, namely in their resistance to long term oxidative degradation. The stiffness-related mechanical properties showed a strong correlation with the overall crystallinity. The crystallinity depended mostly on the oxidative degradation of the UHMWPE liners, while the thermal treatment played a minor role. The highest resistance to oxidation and wear, which promises the best in vivo performance, was found for the crosslinked UHMWPE formulations with biocompatible stabilizers (such as α-tocopherol, which is the key component of vitamin E).},

  abstract     = {AA7075 + ZrH 2 (7A76) is a nanoparticle-enhanced high-strength Al alloy, designed to substantially prevent solidification cracking during laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). Significant knowledge gaps persist in understanding the effects of melting modes, the functionality of nanoparticles, and compositional variations in this material system. This study systematically investigates the melting modes in LPBF of 7A76 to achieve defect-free samples. Processing diagrams were generated using dimensionless heat input ( E* ) and velocity ( v* ) terms, alongside a physics-based temperature prediction model used to predict melting mode thresholds. A wide operation window was discovered within the transition melting mode region, resulting in defect-free 7A76, reaching a relative density of 99.98 %, reported for the first time. Furthermore, the transition melting mode was effective in lowering the Mg and Zn evaporation. Microstructural characterizations revealed that although melting and solidification during the LPBF process resulted in the dissolution of Zr into the printed alloy, some Zr-rich particles remained unmelted. This work represents the first observation of grain nucleation on the partially melted Zr-rich particles in this modified alloy. Additionally, this work sheds light on the successful printing of nanoparticle-enhanced, crack-prone aluminum alloys using processing diagrams, while elucidating the role of nanoparticles in this process.},

Despite possessing this incredible ability, their use in applications remains limited due to the difficulty in machining into novel geometries. Laser-micromachining is an attractive solution to this problem, with the ability to micromachine geometries not conventionally possible. Such geometries, like auxetics, could be used to enhance the simultaneous two-dimensional accommodation and recovery of superelastic strain. We showcase an example of this enhancement in a laser-micromachined auxetic geometry that has minimal material removal. The recoverable strain in the auxetic geometry represents an enhancement of 86% increase over the bulk failure strain in the loading direction, and an absolute increase of 70% over the bulk failure strain in the transverse direction. Such geometries with enhanced two-dimensional functionality could serve as functional backbones on elastomeric composite testbeds with potential applications in soft robotics, stretch-triggered drug delivery, stretchable electronics, adaptive filters and controlled adhesion.},

Therefore, this paper reviews the applications of electrospun scaffolds in bone tissue engineering. Firstly, it summarizes various electrospun scaffold fabrication methods and their principles, including conventional, blend, melt, coaxial, emulsion, solution, free surface, and improved techniques. Based on differences in scaffold structure, this paper further classifies scaffolds into multilayer, grid, and tubular types, analyzing the advantages and limitations of electrospinning processes and scaffold types, and discussing related scaffolds. Future research should focus on material, structural, and solvent optimization to improve scaffold performance. Secondly, this paper discusses the material characterization and applications of electrospun scaffolds in bone tissue engineering, emphasizing the need for performance optimization for improving bone repair.

  abstract     = {Rejuvenators are crucial for efficient asphalt pavement recycling, but their effectiveness varies widely based on factors like bitumen source, aging degree, and rejuvenator composition. This study aims to develop a multiscale evaluation methodology to assess the cohesive and adhesive performance of rejuvenated bitumen, integrating molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and experimental testing. Molecular models of rejuvenated bitumen are established to predict nanoscale cohesion energy and the linear amplitude sweep (LAS) tests for fatigue evaluation. Bitumen-aggregate interface models undergo MD simulations for adhesion assessment, validated by pull-off tension tests, while microstructural observations clarify debonding mechanisms. Results show that bio-oil is the most effective rejuvenator for restoring aged bitumen’s cohesion, followed by engine-oil, naphthenic-oil, and aromatic-oil. LAS tests confirm these rankings for both bitumen and mastic, with Filler Wigro outperforming Wigro60K in reducing cohesive cracking risk. While aging decreases adhesion property, rejuvenators restore both cohesive and adhesive performance, with bio-oil achieving 44.4 % restoration of adhesion when adding 10 % by weight of bitumen. Additionally, MD simulations reveal that the work of adhesion (W aa ) negatively correlates with fatigue parameter (G*sinδ) and positively with fatigue life (N f ), and both Waa and the work of bonding adhesion (W BA ) decrease linearly with the pull-off tension strength (POTS) index. Bitumen TB is the most effective for improving cohesion crack resistance, whereas binder FB results in lower fatigue life. Overall, bio-oil proves most effective in restoring cohesion and adhesion across bitumen types and fillers, improving rejuvenated asphalt performance.},

The results found that 0.1 wt% rCF failed to considerably enhance the electrical conductivity of OPC and LC 3 mortars during the curing period, but the enhancement became apparent when these composites were 1 day-dried. With the increasing cement replacement ratio and the introduction of rCF, the mechanical properties deteriorated because of the dilutive effects together with the fragility of rCF. The OPC and LC 3 mortars exhibited a certain degree of piezoresistivity under compression, which was amplified with added 0.1 wt% rCF. Additionally, the piezoresistive performance of the LC 3 mortar was better than that of the OPC mortar, regardless of the presence of rCFs. The sensing capacity of composites is greatly weakened in terms of flexural stress. In terms of the two-probe method, because of the contact resistance, the resistivity usually decreases under compression, which results in larger fractional changes in resistivity values.

In this work, a combination of Sc-microalloying and a retrogression and re-ageing (RRA) route was applied on the SiC p /Al-Cu-Mg composites to achieve well-balanced strength and ductility. Compared to the T6 treatment, RRA heat treatment exhibit a significant strengthening effect in Sc-microalloyed composites with only a slight loss in ductility. The yield strength and ultimate strength of the Sc-RRA samples reach up to 686.4 MPa and 734.5 MPa, respectively. The plastic deformation mechanism was analyzed by thermal activation analysis and TEM observation of deformed microstructure. The plastic deformation of UFG composites, both with and without Sc, is primarily governed by a dislocation-grain boundary interaction mechanism. As confirmed by the observed stacking faults, the Sc-microalloyed composite subjected to T6 treatment suffers from poor dislocation storge capacity and insufficient intragranular precipitation strengthening. In contrast, the RRA treatment promotes the formation of intragranular Al 3 Sc precipitates and GP zones, which improve the dislocation accumulation capability and precipitation strengthening of ultrafine-grained composites by pinning dislocations. This work provides an accessible pathway to exploit aluminum matrix composites with advanced strength-ductility balance.},

The findings suggest that pre-cold deformation reduces the original austenite grain size decreases by half, and the cementite particles become more uniformly distributed. Simultaneously, pre-cold deformation treatment considerably increases the bearing steel hardness from 715HV to 768HV whilst maintaining its toughness. The homogenisation of cementite size and the increase in hardness enhance the wear resistance of the samples by 34%. Furthermore, we explores the microstructural evolution mechanisms during subsequent phase transformations: the bearing steel in the process of martensitic transformation, the pre-cold deformation treatment leads to a strong variant selection, which increases the intrinsic nucleation rate and reduces the autocatalytic nucleation rate of martensite. The change of nucleation positions causes the great differences in the crystallography of the samples.

Laser-induced vaporization caused micron-scale chemical fluctuations in the melt-pool structure, resulting in the development of inhomogeneous microstructures. Refined cellular microstructures with many columnar α-Al phases surrounded by numerous Mg 2 Si nano-particles were observed in most parts of the melt-pool structure, corresponding to hypo-eutectic compositions in the Al–Mg–Si ternary system. However, primary solidified Mg 2 Si phases were observed in some parts of the melt-pool boundaries with local Mg-rich compositions (hyper-eutectic compositions).

Moreover, the specimens underwent mechanical deterioration at elevated temperatures, owing to a significant coarsening of metastable microstructural factors (nanoscale Mg 2 Si precipitates or their related metastable phases and atomistic clusters) that contribute towards the high room-temperature strength.},

  abstract     = {This investigation demonstrates a unique layered metallic composite (LMC) design strategy which exploits the metastability tunability of the transformative complex concentrate alloys (CCAs). Metastability engineered LMC (ME-LMC) was prepared by sandwiching a relatively less metastable Fe 38.5 Mn 20 Co 20 Cr 15 Si 5 Cu 1.5 CCA (SFE = 12 mJ/m 2 ) between the two layers of the highly metastable Fe 40 Mn 20 Co 20 Cr 15 Si 5 CCA (SFE = 6 mJ/m 2 ). In ME-LMC, plastic instability of highly metastable alloy got delayed resulting in slight increase in the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) while maintaining comparable ductility compared to the monolithic CCAs. Superior properties of the ME-LMC are attributed to the enhanced activation of transformation and twin systems in the HCP phase due to the generation of biaxial state of stresses originating from the CCA interface affected zones. Enhanced transformation and twinning led to the greater dynamic refinement of the microstructure providing higher strain hardening enabling greater ductility while benefitting from the dynamic Hall-Petch strengthening. A dislocation density evolution based modelling framework is developed to elucidate the enhancement in mechanical properties.},

The reliability and efficiency of this method were verified via corroborating with in-situ SEM tensile tests and EBSD/TEM characterisation. When the average grain size was refined from 8.49 to 0.70 μm, the yield stress increased from 181 to 317 MPa and the ultimate tensile strength from 868 to 1004 MPa with little loss of UE, which was successfully predicted by the CZM-CPFE method. Also, the neighbouring grain model revealed that stress concentrations are pronounced near GBs with high misorientation angle due to the dislocation motion and twin growth hindered by GBs. Furthermore, the simulation and experimental results indicated that the critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) for twinning increased to 202 MPa for average grain size reduction to 0.70 μm, which was much higher than the 138.5 MPa for slip, making twin activation more difficult. The application of this work in steels with moderate grain sizes can facilitate understanding of the evolution of the slip and twins and the strain hardening.},

  abstract     = {Supercrystalline nanocomposites (SCNCs) are a new class of hybrid materials consisting of organically functionalized nanoparticles that are arranged into periodic architectures, featuring multi-functional properties. While their mechanical behavior is starting to be assessed, the time-dependent aspects thereof, and especially creep, remain unexplored. This lack of understanding is an obstacle towards future implementation of SCNCs into devices. It is therefore imperative not only to capture experimentally the creep behavior of SCNCs, but also to develop models that accurately predict its evolution. Here, a model is proposed to capture the nanoindentation creep behavior of SCNCs, using both rheological models and free volume theory. The creep compliance derived from the rheological model shows a stress-dependent trend, indicating nonlinear viscoelasticity. The presence of free volume is experimentally detected in SCNCs via positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy. It decreases in size with increasing degrees of crosslinking of the organic phase, a phenomenon attributed to the shrinkage of superlattices. The creep compliance is predicted by introducing a shift factor to account for the evolution of the relaxation time caused by the change in free volume. A free volume-based creep model is proposed to predict the creep behavior of SCNCs, and its applicability is validated through new nanoindentation creep tests at varying loads.},

This combination leverages each material&#39;s distinct advantages for applications requiring high strength, corrosion resistance, and superior thermal and electrical conductivity. However, inherent anisotropy at the interface between these materials poses significant challenges, impacting the integrity of material interfaces and affecting the materials&#39; properties. This research investigates the influence of three different build orientations (CuCrZr on 316L, 316L on CuCrZr, and CuCrZr next to 316L) on interface quality and part performance. Techniques like microscopy imaging, laser flash analysis, and eddy current measurements, alongside Vickers hardness tests, were employed. Aging at 500 °C for 1.5 hours increased CuCrZr&#39;s conductivity by 250% and doubled its hardness. Samples with 316L built on CuCrZr showed reduced thermal contact resistance, suggesting this configuration is preferable for efficient heat transfer. Moreover, 316L contamination reduced the microhardness of CuCrZr, impacting its precipitation hardening potential. These findings underscore the importance of strategic material selection and arrangement within the PBF-LB/M process and highlight the benefits and challenges of heat treatment and contamination.},

  abstract     = {Due to the outstanding advantages such as low density, high modulus, and high damage tolerance, cast Al-Li alloys are highly promising metallic materials for load-bearing applications in the coming decades. However, compared to their wrought counterparts, the mechanical properties of these alloys, particularly the ductility, are still unsatisfactory, which severely limits their further applications. Here, we report that the mechanical properties of cast Al-Li alloys can be significantly improved by regulating various nano-phases during aging. Results show that the introduction of 0.2 wt% Zr in the Al-2Li-2Cu-0.5 Mg alloy contributes to grain refinement by providing a large number of primary Al 3 Zr particles acting as ideal heterogeneous nucleation sites for the α-Al matrix. During subsequent aging, Al 3 Li tends to nucleate and grow on the Al 3 Zr surface to reduce the interfacial energy and form a nano-complex with a core–shell structure in 0.2Zr alloy. Then, the Al 3 Li shell can serve as an effective nucleation site for the T 1 and θʹ phases. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that nucleation of T 1 and θʹ on the Al 3 Li shell reduces the interfacial energy, which promotes their uniform precipitation. In this case, unique Al 3 (Zr, Li) particles and higher density of finer T 1 and θʹ phases provide a substantial Orowan strengthening effect, alleviating the stress concentration. In addition, grain refinement improves the coordination of plastic deformation in 0.2Zr alloys. As a result, the ductility of 0.2Zr alloy increases from 3.6 % to 7.1 % compared to the Base alloy, accompanied by a 66 MPa increase in ultimate tensile strength. This work is expected to offer a new engineering approach to designing high-performance cast Al-Li alloy components with broad application prospects.},

This study introduces an innovative elastic metamaterial inspired by Miura-origami tubes, fabricated using laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), a prevalent additive manufacturing technique. The metamaterial’s unit cell consists of a diamond-shaped frame and a pair of orthogonal springs, displaying quasi-zero stiffness through the interaction of lateral and longitudinal springs, which balances internal pressure and tension. The transmission and dispersion of longitudinal waves in these metamaterials, with varying structural parameters, were systematically investigated. The findings demonstrate that the Miura-origami inspired metamaterial can generate ultra-wide band gaps for low-frequency longitudinal waves (500 Hz to 2500 Hz). It effectively converts longitudinal waves into other energy forms via internal vibration mode transformations. Structural parameters critically impact the metamaterial’s mechanical performance and manufacturing quality. Optimal parameters for LPBF fabrication were identified through rigorous experiments and simulations. These origami-inspired elastic metamaterials show substantial promise for vibration mitigation in civil, medical, mechanical, and aerospace engineering applications.},

However, achieving high-strength joints between semiconductor materials and metal substrates remains challenging due to the low interfacial bonding ratios, leading to interfacial fractures that weaken the joint. Herein, we demonstrate a current-assisted low-temperature Ag sinter bonding process for SiC, utilizing ion migration within the bonding layer. The process significantly improved the joint strength by enhancing the interfacial bonding properties via Ag precipitation on the SiC surface. The precipitation, facilitated by the current-driven migration of Ag ions derived from the decomposition of compounds, effectively increased the density and interfacial bonding ratio of the sintered Ag layer, thereby mitigating interfacial fracture. Based on these findings, we successfully achieved current-assisted sinter bonding, notably at room temperature. Furthermore, the current-driven migration of the generated Ag ions was sufficiently induced even with a minimal amount of Ag compounds. Accordingly, the joint properties were further enhanced by suppressing localized vulnerability in the sintered Ag layer through the optimization of the Ag 2 O mixture ratio in the bonding paste. This current-assisted process plays a crucial role in achieving reliable low-temperature sinter bonding, essential for advanced electronics packaging.},

Experimental analyses demonstrate that the mechanical properties of HTC can be directionally optimized through parameterization of secondary conformational architecture and coupling states. Remarkably, HTC manifests triphasic nonlinear mechanical behavior analogous to native ligamentous tissues. This biomimetic response originates from synergistic interactions between the stiff helix conformation (the stiff conformation) and highly stretchable tubular conformation (the stretchable conformation). Furthermore, cyclic tensile evaluations reveal exceptional fatigue resistance exceeding thousands of cycles. This durability substantiates the composite’s potential for replicating the multifunctional mechanical behavior of biological tendons and ligaments.

This study presents a user-friendly design framework for phononic metamaterials, enabling ultra-wide bandgap tunability ( B/ ω c ratios up to 172 %) across multiple frequency ranges and scales. Using finite element simulations of a Yablonovite-inspired unit cell, we establish a comprehensive parametric design space that illustrates how geometric parameters, such as sphere size and beam diameter, controls bandgap width and frequency. The scalability and robustness of the framework are validated through experimental testing on additively manufactured structures at both macro (10 mm) and micro (80 µm) scales, fabricated using Stereolithography and Two-Photon Polymerization. Transmission loss measurements, conducted with piezoelectric transducers and laser vibrometry, closely match simulations in the kHz and MHz frequency ranges, confirming the reliability and consistency of the bandgap behavior across scales.

CoCrFeMnNi high-entropy alloys (HEAs) is widely used due to its good plasticity, low temperature strength and other advantages. To enhance the mechanical properties of the lattice structure, a unique decahedral internal diamond (DID) unit cell type was designed to construct the periodic lattice structure. The DID lattice structure was prepared by SLM using CoCrFeMnNi HEAs spherical powder as the material, and its surface morphology was observed under SEM. In comparison to conventional lattice structures, various lattice structures’ mechanical properties and deformation behaviors were analyzed using quasi-static compression tests and finite element analysis. Additionally, the effects of different rod diameter on the compressive performance and energy absorption characteristics of the DID lattice structure were also studied. The results show that the lattice structure prepared by SLM has good forming quality. In the tested samples, the DID structure has better bearing capacity and energy absorption performance, and the yield strength of the DID lattice structure with an overall size of 15 mm × 15 mm × 15 mm and a relative density of 25 % is 66 MPa, and the Young’s modulus is 3798 MPa. In addition, increasing the rod diameter can reduce the forming defects of the crossbar and further improve the compressive performance and energy absorption characteristics of the DID structure. This study provides a theoretical reference for the design and fabrication of load-absorber integrated structures, and confirms that the CoCrFeMnNi HEAs DID lattice structure can be used for lightweight support manufacturing applications.},

The precursor of silver ammonia concentrations from 5 to 160 mM was explored, revealing a positive correlation between reactant concentration and particle size that challenges traditional theories. It results from aggregation growth facilitated by high concentrations, leading to significant increases of particle size, with a trigger of 10 mM.

Specifically, decreasing the instantaneous concentration while increasing the homogeneous concentration compress the reaction zone and refined particle size distributions.

  abstract     = {Al-Mg-Zn alloys, designed to combine the formability of 5xxx alloys with the high strength of 7xxx alloys, still face challenges in achieving an optimal strength-ductility balance. This study presents an active learning-based alloy design strategy to guide experiments aimed at enhancing the strength-ductility balance in Al-Mg-Zn alloys. Firstly, a sub-dataset comprising ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and elongation (EL) data with optimal generalization ability was identified from the small and disordered Al-Mg-Zn dataset using the bagging method. Subsequently, the bagging model of this sub-dataset was employed to construct a Pareto front based on the Upper Confidence Bound for UTS and EL, providing guidance for alloy composition design. Through experimental validation and iterative optimization, the strength-ductility balance of Al-Mg-Zn alloys was significantly improved, with the designed Al-5.27Mg-2.8Zn-0.44Cu-0.19Ag-0.15Sc-0.05Mn-0.01Zr alloy (wt.%) exhibiting superior mechanical properties with the measured UTS of 602 MPa and EL of 15.1 %. Microstructural analysis using SEM, EBSD and TEM revealed that the improved strength-ductility balance of the alloy is attributed to its optimized composition, which results in the minimal micron phases, numerous fine Al 3 Sc particles, low-recrystallization grains, and a high density of precipitates. This active learning-based design strategy offering a novel approach for material development in systems with limited data.},

Its strengthening effect is associated with the energy of the faulted interfaces generated upon dislocation-shearing of the precipitates. Due to the extremely small size of the T 1 phase, this energy cannot be directly measured, and the atomic arrangement around the faulted interface has never been characterized, leading to a knowledge gap regarding these interfaces. This work constructed large-scale supercells that encompassed both precipitate and matrix atoms for a first-principles examination of the faulted interfaces. Two opposite dislocation-shearing actions were incorporated to reserve the overall periodicity of the supercells, which is essential for compatibility with density functional theory calculations. Rigorous statistical analysis of the faulted interface energy was facilitated by modeling a variety of possible atomic arrangements of the faulted interfaces and investigating scenarios with T 1 phases of 1, 2, and 3 unit-cells in thickness. Following density functional theory relaxation of the supercells, the results demonstrated satisfactory convergence. The faulted interface energy was calculated as approximately 4 to 5 times the unstable stacking-fault energy of the matrix. The diverse thickening mechanisms of T 1 precipitates were found to significantly alter the overall FIE of the thickened precipitate.},

However, the columnar grains that grow epitaxially along the building direction are prone to reduce the performance of the as-built parts. Herein, external ultrasonic field are introduced during the LDED of near-α titanium alloy Ti60 (Ti-5.7Al-4.0Sn-3.5Zr-0.4Mo-0.4Si-0.4Nb-1.0Ta-0.05C), resulting in equiaxed β grains with an average grain size of 62.82 μm. The single track morphology, molten pool, microstructure, and mechanical properties under different ultrasonic powers are characterized and investigated. The results indicate that the ultrasound can induce columnar to equiaxed transition (CET) of the prior-β grains and promote the precipitation of silicides, but the width of the α laths increases due to heating effect caused by ultrasound. Consequently, the sample prepared with the 6 μm ultrasonic vibration exhibits a increases of 67.18 % in elongation, and the mechanical properties reach the forge standard. Finally, the effects of prior-β grain and α lath on the final mechanical properties of the samples are discussed.

  abstract     = {The decommissioning of the Fukushima Daiichi (1F) nuclear power plant remains a significant environmental concern. A crucial aspect of this process involves the effective immobilization of 137 Cs to reduce the volume of radioactive waste. This technique traps radioactive materials that adhere to the concrete surface by embedding in the glass, allowing only the glass to be removed during decommissioning. In this study, we first irradiated concrete mixed with 133 Cs, which had the same composition as the nuclear reactor building at 1F, using a high-brightness laser beam to immobilize Cs. We then investigated the characteristics of in-situ immobilization of Cs from the aspects of distribution, migration, and elution. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results indicate that the concrete underwent vitrification. Measurements from an electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA) show that Cs exhibits aggregate-dependent heterogeneity within the fused, glass-like concrete. The experimental migration rate of 99 % is more reliable compared to the 57 % achieved through conventional thermal plasma melting of simulated low-level radioactive waste. As far as elution is concerned, the normalized mass loss of the elements is 0.06 to 0.08 g/m 2 , which is below the 2 g/m 2 limit set by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) International. Consequently, laser-assisted in-situ immobilization of Cs has superior potential for supporting the decommissioning of 1F by effectively utilizing the hazardous materials on site.},

Characterizing slender regions in material microstructures is an extremely important aspect in material science because these regions govern the macroscopic behavior of materials for many applications like energy absorption, activation of metamaterials, stability of high temperature filters, etc. This work utilizes skeletonization method to calculate centerline of the microstructure geometry followed by a novel pruning strategy based on cross-sectional area to identify slender regions in the microstructure. 3D images of such microstructures obtained from micro-CT often suffer from low image resolution resulting in high surface noise. The skeleton of such an image has many spurious skeletal branches that do not represent the actual microstructure geometry. The proposed pruning method of cross-sectional area is insensitive to surface noise and hence is a reliable method of identifying skeletal branches that represent the slender regions in the microstructure. The proposed algorithm is implemented on a test case to showcase its effectiveness. Further it is implemented on a 3D microstructure of ceramic foam to identify the slender regions present in it. It is shown that the method can be used to segment slender regions of varying dimensions and to study their geometric properties.},

In this study, we designed and developed a manganese-doped bioactive glass-based (Mn-MBG) core, creating a Mn-rich nanotherapeutic platform named MMPI. This platform was further modified by encapsulation with polydopamine (PDA) and successfully loaded with the photosensitizer indocyanine green (ICG) through π-π stacking interactions, enabling photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT). In vitro experiments demonstrated that under near-infrared (NIR) irradiation, MMPI could generate a moderate photothermal effect, causing damage to tumor cells. At the same time, the photothermal effect enhanced Mn 2+ and ICG release and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, intensifying damage to heat-sensitive tumor cells and aiding tumor elimination. In vivo experiments showed that MMPI can counteract the tumor’s immunosuppressive environment by activating the cGAS-STING pathway, boosting local innate immune cell recruitment, dendritic cell maturation, and T cell-mediated adaptive antitumor responses. In conclusion, this study elucidates the concept of a manganese-based non-invasive tumor immunotherapy model, establishing a paradigm for immunotherapeutic approaches in renal cell carcinoma.},

Conventional concrete formwork often faces demolding difficulties, which can damage both the formwork and the concrete and lead to increased costs and environmental impact. This study introduces a novel approach where polymeric formworks with biomimetic spiral designs are fabricated by 3D-priniting. Such customized 3D-printed formwork designs introduce a kinematic mechanism to enhance demolding efficiency while maintaining structural integrity. Polylactic acid (PLA) and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) were used to fabricate 3D-printed polymer bars with varying spiral gap lengths (0.2 mm and 0.6 mm), which were tested under monotonic pull-out conditions, mimicking formwork extraction from hollow concrete components. The spiral designs significantly reduce pull-out resistance, demolding difficulty, and associated damage. The kinematic benefits from spirals can be further amplified by adopting wider spiral gaps or by selecting TPU as the 3D printing filament, due to its greater toughness and flexibility, which resemble those of elastomeric materials. This work advances concrete demolding through innovative design optimization and offers practical solutions for greater customization and fabrication efficiency for intricate concrete structures.},

A detailed microstructural and mechanical analysis was conducted to assess the damage incurred during curved printing. The deposition mechanism of the FDM process was found to lack high dimensional accuracy when 3D printing continuous fibre filaments in tight curvatures. Issues including filament peeling and twisting resulted in printing error of up to 60 % in the curvature radius, depending on the fibre types. The filaments experienced fibre damage, matrix tearing, and shape distortion during the curved printing process, which subsequently reduced the tensile properties of the printed composites. The average filament strengths were found to be only 30 %, 41 % and 64 % compared to that of the straight printed filament for carbon, glass, and aramid fibre filaments, respectively, when the radius was below 5 mm.

  abstract     = {Compared to conventional metal additive manufacturing techniques, metal fused deposition modeling (Metal FDM) reduces cost at the expense of deterioration in materials’ mechanical performance. To realize the full design potential that Metal FDM components can offer, effectively predicting the performance becomes imperative, especially for lattice structures that are widely used in aerospace under complex and cyclic loading. This work developed a framework for characterizing and predicting static and high-cycle fatigue behaviors of FDM-printed metal lattices. Constitutive model constants of FDM-printed 17-4PH steels were identified via experiments on dog bone samples at the same length scale of lattice microstructures. The material exhibits quasi-brittle behavior at microstructural size, with a tensile stiffness of 24 GPa. It is only 13 % of the expected stiffness for macroscopic level materials, showing a severe effect by length scale. Residual porosity leads to microcracks, which act as the primary failure mechanism under high-cycle fatigue, reducing the fatigue limit to 31 % of rolled steel. Assigning developed constitutive models, the asymptotic homogenization method was employed to obtain equivalent static properties of stretch- and bend-dominated lattices, which were in accord with testing results. Through the Brown-Miller-Morrow method, the framework numerically predicted lattice high-cycle fatigue life, which was validated against experiments.},

  abstract     = {Roadside safety hardware, such as longitudinal barriers and crash cushions, is part of the highway infrastructure used to protect an errant vehicle from crashing into fixed roadside objects in a well-controlled manner. Despite constantly improved design and standardized full-scale impact testing of the roadside safety hardware, more than 3% of U.S. traffic fatalities are caused by the inefficiency of the roadside safety hardware. This perspective article highlights the need for innovative designs to enhance protection and mitigate impact severity. In nature, many plants and animals are optimized to adapt to various overload conditions and have demonstrated superior impact-resistant and energy-absorbing capabilities. Careful study of these biological structures may inspire the development of a new generation of soft, flexible, curvilinear roadside safety hardware.},

The preparation technology of ultrafine grains/nanocrystals relying on severe plastic deformation deviates from actual industrial production, therefore alloying is currently a more practical choice. This work simultaneously promoted the strength and ductility of Mg-Gd-Y-Zn-Zr alloy by adding a trace amount of Er element (0.5 wt%). Er microalloying has little effect on grain size, texture, morphology and content of long-period stacking ordered (LPSO) structure, but significantly promotes aging precipitation, thereby substantially increasing the number density of β’ and reducing its size. The significantly refined β’ makes calculations based on the Orowan bypass mechanism less accurate, and more consideration should be given to linking the synchronous improvement of strength and ductility with the dislocation-shearing mechanism.},

  abstract     = {For advantages in integrating the intrinsic properties of the metal matrix and reinforcing phases, properly designed metal matrix composites (MMCs) are promising candidates for overcoming the trade-offs of properties such as corrosion, ductility, strength, and lightweight. However, MMCs often face challenges such as agglomeration and inhomogeneous distribution of the reinforcing phase, leading to significant degradation of mechanical properties. In this study, we propose a method to overcome these obstacles by in-situ alloying via laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), achieving a uniform distribution of the reinforcing nano-sized phase (α-Al 2 O 3 ) within a medium-entropy alloy matrix (CoCrNi). During the LPBF process, Al 2 O 3 is refined from the micrometer scale to the nanometer scale, simultaneously affecting the crystal orientation and leading to grain refinement of the CoCrNi matrix. The mechanical properties of CoCrNi were significantly enhanced by adding Al 2 O 3 , with an ultimate compressive strength of ∼1143 MPa, a fracture strain of ∼25%, and a hardness of ∼300 HV. The achieved strength and hardness levels are among the highest reported in the literature. The results from this study provide new design strategies for the in-situ formation of MMCs, offering a promising approach to developing MMCs with high strength and ductility.},

Depending on laser parameters, two ribbon types—delaminated (CDR) or anchored (CAR)—are produced, both exhibiting surface density gradients from the center to the edges. Microscale analysis reveals surface density gradients in both ribbon types, extending from center to edge. CDRs also show depth-wise density variations, resulting in mechanical stresses that cause detachment and curling. In CARs, intense local heating and thermal conductivity cause a temperature rise beyond the irradiated area. The substrate acts as a thermal barrier, concentrating heat at the film-substrate interface and ensuring ribbon adhesion. Cracks propagate perpendicular to isothermal lines, enabling controlled crack patterning.},

However, 3D printing TPU filaments specifically engineered for enhanced damping performance frequently lack sufficient stiffness, causing printing continuity issues. To address these challenges, this study investigates the rational design of TPU composites by regulating TPU molecular structure and incorporating polylactic acid (PLA) to enhance both damping performance and stiffness. The results reveal that a prepolymer curing coefficient of 2.0, combined with a chain extender ratio of Dimethyl thio-toluene diamine (DMTDA) to 1,4-Butanediol (BDO) at 5:5, optimizes the damping and mechanical properties of the TPU material. Furthermore, by incorporating 30 wt% PLA particles into the TPU matrix, the obtained TPU7/PLA3 composite filament has excellent printability and admirable damping properties with a peak damping value of 0.60 around room temperature and an effective damping temperature range exceeding 100 °C. A lattice structure resembling Kelvin foam was successfully fabricated using the TPU/PLA filaments, demonstrating superior damping performance compared to commercial TPU filaments and underscoring its potential for energy absorption applications.},

The material was first irradiated with He + ions to form nanometric He bubbles within its structure. Subsequently, their high-temperature evolution was studied using an in-situ heating method in a transmission electron microscope over a temperature range of 700 °C to 1000 °C. We found that the bubbles are stable in size up to a temperature of 700 °C and show no agglomeration up to 800 °C. At higher temperatures, the coarsening of the bubbles occurs through the migration and coalescence mechanism; however, even at 1000 °C, the size of the bubbles only slightly exceeds 1 nm. For a more in-depth understanding of the phenomena occurring during high-temperature annealing, molecular dynamics simulations were applied. We demonstrate that the low diffusivity of V m He n clusters in the investigated WTaCrV alloy is responsible for the low tendency for high-temperature coarsening of the bubbles. The results of this study highlight the potential of the WTaCrV RCSA as a refractory, irradiation-resistant material for crucial components in future fusion reactors.},

  abstract     = {Bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) have gained significant attention in the engineering field due to their unique microstructure and excellent properties. However, the fabrication of large-sized and complex-shaped BMGs components remains a major challenge. Laser-based additive manufacturing (LAM) techniques offer a promising solution to conquer the limitations of traditional methods in manufacturing BMGs. Theoretically, LAM techniques can achieve extremely high cooling rates of over 10 4 K/s, resulting in the formation of metallic glass structures within the tiny molten pools. More significantly, the bottom-up concept of LAM enables the layer-by-layer construction of large-sized BMGs parts. Herein, this review extensively explores cutting-edge research on various aspects of utilizing LAM techniques in BMGs fabrication. It provides a comprehensive discussion of the forming mechanism of BMGs during LAM, focusing on factors such as heterogeneous microstructure, crystallization behavior and defect elimination. Additionally, the influence of composition and process parameters on the performance of LAM-produced BMGs, including mechanical properties, corrosion behavior, and biocompatibility, is systematically reviewed. An outlook on the LAM techniques for BMGs production is presented, aiming to provide some guiding principles for future research directions in this pioneering field.},

In this study, we investigate topological interface modes in I-WP (Wrapped Package) TPMS geometry. Inspired by a one-dimensional (1D) Su–Schrieffer–Heeger (SSH) model, we design 1D elastic Phononic Crystals (PCs) made of sheet-based I-WP minimal surface geometry. By manipulating the geometry of the I-WP minimal surface, we open the degeneracies formed at the edges of the Brillouin zone to create band-folding-induced bandgaps. We then design a 1D dimerized chain of two topologically distinct unit cells of I-WP minimal surface to create an interface and introduce topological interface modes. Numerical simulations are performed to study the band structure and topological transition properties of the proposed 1D PC. In addition, we show that hybridizing alternative I-WP unit cells of different relative densities can also break the inversion symmetry of the periodic structure in contrast to manipulating the geometry. The 1D PC made of hybridized I-WP geometry is then used to realize topological interface modes. The proposed 1D PCs are additively manufactured to experimentally validate the existence of topological interface modes. Our work provides an efficient method for TPMS structures to produce multifunctional devices that can support superior load-bearing capabilities as well as robust topological phase properties.},

Contact lenses capable of blue light filtering could be used to mitigate this issue. This can be facilitated by using natural dyes to filter certain wavelengths from contact lenses. In this research, Curcuma Aromatica and Rubia Cordifolia were used to stain commercial contact lenses. This improved the blue light filtering capability and antibacterial resistance against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria. The UV Vis transmission spectra showed great blue light reduction for both natural pigments, C. aromatica being the better choice. The lenses showed a reduction of around 95 % in the blue light region while maintaining high transparency. Use of PVA improved the shelf life for C. aromatica, by providing better stability in both deionized water and contact lens storage solution. The lenses showed comparable contact angle and water retention properties, indicating that the additives retained the commercial contact lens’ properties. The MTT assay and Trypan blue assay indicated very good cell viability implying good biocompatibility of the lenses. Additionally, the anti-inflammatory effect of C. aromatica and C. aromatica + PVA dipped lenses strengthens the possibility of implementing them in further applications. The R. cordifolia dipped lenses seem to have improved inflammatory responses upon the addition of PVA. These lenses show great promise for protection against blue light from displays and other sources, offering a remedy to prolonged exposure to blue light.},

The materials comprised of one high carbon, one nitrogen-alloyed and one dual precipitation hardened steel. The experiments involved a combined deuterium charge, followed by atom probe tomography, and hydrogen gas charge, followed by slow strain rate testing. This approach enabled the study of each steel’s resilience to hydrogen gas and allowed correlations between mechanical behaviors after hydrogen charging and their hydrogen trapping capabilities, as well as the presence of undissolved primary carbides or carbonitrides. Results showed that while the nitrogen-alloyed stainless steel demonstrated the highest hydrogen trapping capability, the presence of undissolved primary carbides or carbonitrides within it served as crack initiation sites during slow strain rate tests, reducing its hydrogen resistance. The dual precipitation-hardened steel, which lacked undissolved carbides, exhibited the least hydrogen embrittlement.},

In this paper, we present a novel application of femtosecond-laser-nanostructured borosilicate glass for BIPV, offering a promising alternative to traditional LSC windows. Utilizing a scalable, one-step femtosecond laser direct writing process, we fabricate nanostructured borosilicate glass specifically designed to effectively scatter incident light toward solar cells positioned at the edges of the glass. To optimize the laser processing, we perform comprehensive characterizations using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy, and spectrophotometry. The proof-of-concept system demonstrates that the glass processed at an optimized scan speed exhibits a 55-fold increase in photocurrent generation compared to unprocessed glass, highlighting its enhanced optical efficiency. Additionally, a hydrophobic coating is applied on the nanostructured glass to confer self-cleaning properties, achieving superhydrophobicity with advancing and receding contact angles of approximately 170°. This novel approach to utilizing nanostructured glass for solar concentration shows considerable promise for improving both the efficiency and practicality of building-integrated photovoltaics.},

  abstract     = {Compared to traditional tumor chemotherapy, photodynamic therapy (PDT) can effectively reduce toxic side effects and prevent tumor resistance. However, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by photosensitizers are limited, and the destructive effects on tumor cells are inadequate. In this study, nanomedicines loaded with the photosensitizers chlorin e6 (Ce6) and dihydroartemisinin (DHA) were constructed using human serum albumin (HSA) and transferrin (Tf), self-assembly for the programmed activation, and expansion of ROS in tumor cells. These nanomedicines, Ce6/DHA@HSA-SS-Tf nanoparticles (NPs), can target Tf receptors overexpressed on cancer cells to produce ROS through PDT with laser irradiation. Subsequently, the ROS-responsive vector is cleaved, and iron ions catalyze the released DHA to produce sufficient ROS and induce ferroptosis in tumor cells. The nanomedicine amplifies the ROS content in tumor cells through a dual response and programmed activation, which can effectively solve the problem of insufficient ROS production in tumor PDT. Consequently, the Ce6/DHA@HSA-SS-Tf NPs demonstrate excellent anti-tumor effects through the synergistic effects of PDT and ferroptosis. This treatment strategy provides a reliable basis for tumor-specific and efficient treatments.},

  abstract     = {Materials exposed to extreme radiation environments (e.g., nuclear devices) accumulate substantial defects, such as helium (He) bubbles. These defects can alter material properties, including melting behavior, which has not been intensively explored. Here, the melting process and the He bubble evolution in aluminium under dynamic tension at high temperature and strain rates were investigated via molecular dynamic simulations. We found that the melting process contains slow premelting and sequential fast local melting at relatively lower strain rates (10 6 ∼ 10 8 /s). The rapid growth of the bubble promotes local melting, which in turn facilitates the migration and shrinkage of the bubble. The underlying microscopic mechanisms for the interplay between the bubble and local melting have also been uncovered. Such interaction becomes weak at high strain rates (10 9 ∼ 10 10 /s). Homogeneous melting occurs directly and spontaneously throughout the sample, and local melting around the bubble becomes inconspicuous. The evolution process of the bubble gets simple, characterized by continuous growth without shrinkage or migration. Furthermore, damage development is dominated by the growth of the He bubble, which occurs after the sample is nearly completely melted at lower strain rates while it happens concurrently with melting at high strain rates.},

Firstly, Ni/Ni 2 Al 3 composite sheet with heterogeneous bimodal grains is prepared by means of hot pressing reaction synthesis from Ni and Al for 2 h at 630 ℃ under the pressure of 20 MPa and it is characterized by superplasticity at 750℃ at the strain rate of 1 × 10 - 3 to 1 × 10 - 2 s −1 . Subsequently, Ni/Ni 2 Al 3 composite sheet can be readily used to be made into the thin-walled cup-shaped components by gas forming. The Ni/Ni 2 Al 3 thin-walled cup-shape component is subjected to second-order in-situ reaction for 4 h at 1000℃ under the pressure of 20 MPa, and consequently the involved Ni/Ni 3 Al/NiAl thin-walled cup-shaped component is fabricated, where Ni 3 Al and NiAl phases are dominant. In particular, Ni 3 Al phase contributes to enhancing high-temperature strength and NiAl phase is responsible for bolstering high-temperature plasticity.

  abstract     = {Polymer-infiltrated ZrO 2 ceramic networks, due to their similar elastic moduli and hardness with natural enamel, have become a promising material for dental restoration. However, since the couple between ZrO 2 and resin is difficult, the poor interface bonding of ZrO 2 /resin degrades the mechanical characteristics of polymer-infiltrated ZrO 2 ceramic networks. This study introduced SiO 2 into ZrO 2 as a scaffold to improve the coupling via the reaction of SiO 2 and silane coupling agents. The impacts of the SiO 2 concentration on the microstructures, the fracture characteristics, and mechanical properties of the porous ceramics and composites were investigated. The microstructures showed that ceramics and resins were bonded more tightly in PICNs with ZrO 2 /SiO 2 scaffold than PICNs with pure ZrO 2 scaffold. The flexural strengths of the composites were significantly improved by the addition of SiO 2 , which was attributed to the increased coupling degree. The composites with 20 mol.% SiO 2 as the porous ceramic exhibited the optimal mechanical properties, with flexural strength, elastic modulus, hardness, and fracture toughness values of 249.8 ± 24.3 MPa, 28.8 ± 4.0 GPa, 2.0 ± 0.2 GPa, and 2.6 ± 0.5 MPa·m 1/2 , respectively.

This study explored the annealing behavior of cold-rolled AISI 304L ASSs through heat treatments over temperatures ranging from 600 °C to 1200 °C and holding times ranging from 2 min to 480 min. The microstructure was analyzed using optical microscopy and EBSD, and the deformation-induced martensite (DIM) content was evaluated using the ferrite scope. Vickers hardness values were correlated with the microstructure evolution following the Hall-Patch relationship. The grain size distribution and the kinetics of grain coarsening were analyzed. Results show that during annealing, the reverse transformation of DIM occurred, followed by static recrystallization of the γ-austenite phase. After recrystallization, grains coarsen with an activation energy of 133.8 kJ/mol, and grain size distribution fits a log-normal function. Nanoscale grains (&lt; 180 nm) were achieved in cold-rolled samples (67 % thickness reduction) annealed at 700 °C for 4 h. The δ-ferrite, primarily located at γ-grain boundaries, retarding their movement during recrystallization and coarsening. Finally, the δ-ferrite partially transformed into austenite and globularized during annealing. These findings show that the processes of phase transformation and recrystallization in cold-worked dual-phase steels are coupled.},

  abstract     = {4D printing enables the creation of adaptive and reconfigurable devices by combining additive manufacturing with smart materials. This integration introduces challenges in designing printable, responsive materials and structures. Current research focuses on improving the responsiveness and mechanical performance of smart materials, but incremental advances often lack sufficient feedback for achieving specific properties, shapes, and performance targets. Inverse design has emerged as a strategy for determining material compositions and structural configurations to meet desired outputs, but its application remains limited to simple structures. Accelerating material and structural discovery is crucial for advancing 4D printing. Artificial intelligence (AI), especially machine learning (ML), offers promising solutions to address the complexity of 4D printing design. However, conventional AI approaches often lack logical reasoning, explainability, and interpretability. This review paper highlights recent achievements and challenges in 4D printing design and introduces neuro-symbolic AI as a promising approach. By combining ML&#39;s learning capabilities with the logical reasoning and semantic understanding of symbolic AI, this approach can enhance the exploration of advanced active materials and structures. The insights provided aim to guide future research toward optimizing 4D printing for broader applications and enhanced performance.},

Yield strength is predicted using a stacking ensemble learning model, combining Multilayer Perceptron and Gradient Boosted Decision Trees with a Decision Tree meta -learner, achieving high accuracy, which was confirmed by experimental validation of four selected alloys.

  abstract     = {Aluminum alloys with initial unrecrystallized structures generally exhibit better superplasticity and are produced more efficiently and cost-effectively than fully recrystallized ones. However, the underlying recrystallization and deformation mechanisms of dynamic recrystallization (DRX)-dependent superplastic aluminium alloys under varying deformation parameters are not yet fully understood. This study investigates the effects of deformation parameters, Al 3 Zr dispersoids, and coarse secondary particles on DRX and superplasticity in an Al-Cu-Li alloy. The alloy achieves a maximum elongation of 780 % at 430 °C and 0.002 s −1 , primarily due to continuous dynamic recrystallization (CDRX) and grain boundary sliding (GBS). Under optimal conditions, deformed grains transform into equiaxed recrystallized grains through sub-grain rotation and coalescence, with GBS dominating subsequent deformation. Lower Zener-Hollomon parameter (lnZ) conditions promote dynamic recovery (DRV) and sub-grain growth, hindering grain refinement and superplastic deformation. Conversely, higher lnZ values inhibit recrystallization due to insufficient thermal driving force and lower DRV, resulting in retained banded grains and reduced elongation. Cu-rich secondary phases enhance CDRX but lose efficacy with their dissolution and coarsening at low lnZ conditions. This work provides insights into DRX-dependent superplastic mechanisms and offers guidance for optimizing deformation parameters to enhance the performance of aluminum alloys.},

Inconel 718 and GRCop42 are commonly used for such components. However, the bimetallic joining of these alloys has been shown to result in a liquid miscibility gap at the interface, which at select compositions can lead to brittle phase formation and cracking. In this work, CALPHAD modeling is used to predict regions of brittle phase formation in the Inconel 718–Ni–GRCop42 and Ni–Cu GRCop42 multi-component ternary systems, with experimental validation of the modeling provided by arc melting. Through characterization of arc melted sample microstructure combined with CALPHAD modeling, the solidification paths throughout the system are elucidated and a brittle phase and crack free compositional region is identified. Based on these results, a compositionally graded path consisting of two transition compositions is identified. Powder Laser Directed Energy Deposition is used to fabricate the Inconel 718–GRCop42 joint with the identified transition compositions, and the joint is subject to characterization in terms of composition profile, defects, grain morphology, present phases and microhardness. Results confirm the transition compositions circumvent brittle phase formation found in bimetallic Inconel 718–GRCop42 joints, thus overcoming the thermodynamic barrier of bimetallic joining.},

  abstract     = {In traditional electrical steel production oxide inclusions are conventionally perceived as deleterious elements for the functional and structural properties. The present work describes the fabrication of a high silicon content electrical steel alloy (Fe-6.5wt%Si) using directed energy deposition (DED), coupled with oxide inclusions to mitigate core energy losses. Abnormal Grain Growth (ABG) was observed after thermal post-processing at 1000 °C for 24 h (1000–24), together with the creation of oxide inclusions mainly around the grain boundaries. Magnetic properties were assessed through dynamic and quasi-static measurements for both as-printed (AP) and 1000–24 samples. The quasi-static analysis revealed hysteresis losses of 206.9 J/m 3 for the AP and 19.02 J/m 3 for the 1000–24, with maximum flux densities of 1.295 T and 1.031 T, at the magnetic field of 3000 A/m. Dynamic magnetic analysis demonstrated an improvement of 39.2% in the total core losses of the 1000–24 sample (2088.8 J/m 3 ), compared to the AP sample (3436.9 J/m 3 ). The microstructure of the 1000–24 sample revealed the formation of Goss texture via ABG, ultimately decreasing the static hysteresis loss. Furthermore, an improved electrical resistivity compare to conventional electrical steel alloys was demonstrated at 119 μΩcm for the 1000-24 sample, and 105 μΩcm for the AP sample. This work introduces a promising avenue to minimize core energy losses by incorporating oxide inclusions and ABG Goss texture in additively manufactured soft magneitc components after thermal post-processing.},

  abstract     = {This study presents a novel interpenetrating Kagome-Gyroid (K-G) structure designed to optimize lightweight, high-strength materials. Inspired by natural biomimetic structures, such as the microstructure of butterfly wings and cancellous bone, which are known for their lightweight and strength properties, the K-G structure combines the shear resistance of the Kagome lattice with the high specific strength and stiffness of the Gyroid lattice. The optimized K-G structure demonstrates a 49.5 % increase in specific energy absorption and a 35.6 % improvement in energy absorption efficiency compared to conventional materials, highlighting its superior potential for high-impact applications. Experimental and simulation results reveal that geometric parameters significantly influence the failure and fracture behavior of the structure, particularly affecting its energy absorption characteristics. The study also investigates the distribution patterns of surface roughness and internal defects during the laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) manufacturing process, highlighting their potential impact on the mechanical performance of the final structure. This novel design provides a promising foundation for the development of advanced materials with superior energy absorption capabilities, making it ideal for high-impact applications in aerospace, rail transportation, and automotive industries, where lightweight and enhanced mechanical performance are critical.},

  abstract     = {Direct measurement of elastic constants for thin films is still far from routine and poses significant technical and analytical challenges compared to bulk materials. Ab initio Density Functional Theory calculations offer theoretical input, however, discrepancies between model systems and real-world properties persist, primarily due to a lack of available experimental data for newly emerging material systems. Moreover, computationally affordable models are typically limited to defect-free single crystals, omitting microstructural effects that strongly influence the material’s behavior. This study addresses this gap by proposing a novel experimental approach to measure direction-dependent elastic constants, combining synchrotron microdiffraction and micropillar compression, testing a polycrystalline face-centered cubic TiN 0.8 B 0.2 thin film, where linear elastic failure prevails. We have established an advanced in-situ testing environment to continuously record the load–displacement of the indenter while simultaneously collecting the material’s deformation response to uniform uniaxial compression. This dynamic approach allows the evaluation of the orientation-dependent elastic strain components and the macroscopic uniaxial compressive stresses, each over time, enabling a differential analysis to assess the elastic and X-ray elastic constants. The excellent agreement between experimental and ab initio data solidifies the here-proposed robust method for direct elastic constant measurements, which is crucial for advancements in thin film material testing.},

Till now, the challenge in medical phantoms lies in their ability to accurately represent the anatomical and radiodensity heterogeneity of actual human tissues using representative synthetic materials and topology. Here, polylactic acid was employed for soft tissue representation, while a new custom material mix of Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene and bismuth was developed to replicate the higher Hounsfield Unit values characteristic of bone. Appropriate 3D printing infill densities derived from their respective linear regressions were implemented to achieve specific target radiodensities. To facilitate the efficient assembly, structural and anatomical fidelity, the head phantom was printed in 39 consecutive sections, post-processed and scanned using computed tomography (CT). Validation confirmed the success of the fabrication process, achieving both anatomical accuracy and radiodensity consistency, even in regions with complex geometries and high heterogeneity. This study marks a significant step in advancing the use of 3D printing and modularity design that can be patient-specific in developing cancer treatment processes and contributes to safer and more effective radiotherapy.},

However, the doping characteristics are rarely studied in detail and are yet to be fully understood, creating a gap in the existing knowledge of these multifunctional materials. In this work, a series of Cu 2+ doped β-TCP (Cu x -TCPs) were prepared and comprehensively characterized to investigate the correlation between Cu 2+ doping and the material properties. Also, the synthesis of Cu x -TCPs was modeled using thermodynamic equilibrium calculations to investigate their formation pathways. The calculations predicted a possible inclusion of Cu 2+ in intermediate phosphate phases during the material synthesis, depending on the temperature. The structural analyses revealed lattice shrinkage due to the Cu 2+ doping and that Cu 2+ occupied Ca4 and Ca5 sites in the β-TCP crystal. The vibrational spectroscopy of the Cu x -TCPs showed noticeable deformation of ν 1 band of P O 4 3 - ligand. The ultraviolet–visible absorption analysis revealed a reduction in the band gap energy induced by Cu 2+ doping. Photoluminescence spectroscopy demonstrated an enhanced emission tunability of Cu x -TCPs in the blue and orange–red regions depending on Cu 2+ concentration. These findings are a step toward a deeper understanding of the structure–property relationships of Cu 2+ doped β-TCPs and can play a significant role in their multidisciplinary applications.},

To investigate the effect of multi-abrasive scratch sequences on the material removal and deformation mechanism of single crystal MgAl 2 O 4 in ultra-precision machining. Multiple nanoscratches experiments with different sequences were conducted to demonstrate the randomness of the scratch sequence occurrence at the abrasive tip in ultra-precision machining. The interactions between multiple nanoscratches with different sequences were analyzed for their effects on the material deformation characteristics and surface morphologies of single crystal MgAl 2 O 4 . Additionally, theoretical models for the penetration depth of multiple nanoscratches with different sequences were established. The results show that multiple nanoscratches with different sequences affect the material removal and deformation mechanism of single crystal MgAl 2 O 4 , and the predictions of the penetration depth theoretical model align closely with the experimental results.

Their accurate and programmable control is expected for complex environments facing practical applications. We fabricate the SMHM easily through microfluidics, and build a Helmholtz coil system with a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) to programmatically control them. By controlling the currents of three-dimensional Helmholtz coil, the rotation speed and direction of the uniform rotating magnetic field generated by the coil can be customized. Besides, SMHMs can rotate in the direction perpendicular to the rotation axis of the magnetic field, and their speeds increase with the magnetic rotation frequency. Thus, the accurate manipulation of the SMHMs’ speed and direction will be achieved just by regulating the coil current. Further, a GUI combined with path planning algorithm is developed to control SMHMs by programming the currents, planning the optimal path for SMHMs, and monitoring their real-time motions. Even non-specialists could easily manipulate SMHMS to move along the desired path and realize the controllable obstacle avoidance movement, which is programmable, user-friendly, and potential for complex scenarios. These characteristics may enable more accurate, effective, and safe work of SMHMs in various fields.},

  abstract     = {Achieving desired mechanical properties in additive manufacturing requires many experiments and a well-defined design framework becomes crucial in reducing trials and conserving resources. Here, we propose a methodology embracing the synergy between high-throughput (HT) experimentation and hierarchical machine learning (ML) to unveil the complex relationships between a large set of process parameters in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) and selected mechanical properties (tensile strength and ductility). The HT method envisions the fabrication of small samples for rapid automated hardness and porosity characterization, and a smaller set of tensile specimens for more labor-intensive direct measurement of yield strength and ductility. The ML approach is based on a sequential application of Gaussian processes (GPs) where the correlations between process parameters and hardness/porosity are first learnt and subsequently adopted by the GPs that relate strength and ductility to process parameters. Finally, an optimization scheme is devised that leverages these GPs to identify the process parameters that maximize combinations of strength and ductility. By founding the learning on larger “easy-to-collect” and smaller “labor-intensive” data, we reduce the reliance on expensive characterization and enable exploration of a large processing space. Our approach is material-agnostic and herein we demonstrate its application on 17-4PH stainless steel.},

  abstract     = {The need to reduce fuel consumption and emissions is driving advances in aeroengine performance. Efficiency gains are limited by the capacity of the turbine material to withstand the high thermomechanical loads of the combustion process. Nickel-based alloy Udimet 720Li has emerged as a promising alternative to the most widely used Inconel 718 for critical aeroengine components. Nonetheless, its material properties under industry-relevant conditions remain understudied, hindering industrial implementation. Furthermore, discrepancies in the methodology for applying adiabatic heating correction in thermomechanical tests on nickel-based alloys prevent comparability of studies and alloys. This paper presents the thermophysical and thermomechanical properties of forged and heat-treated Udimet 720Li to enable advanced aeroengine design and manufacture. A novel adiabatic heating correction procedure is also proposed for thermomechanical tests. Thermophysical properties (specific heat, density, diffusivity, thermal expansion, and conductivity) were characterised for temperatures 20–1200 °C. Thermomechanical properties were obtained for temperatures 20–1100 °C and strain rates 0.01–100 s −1 with cylinder compression tests. The results show that Udimet 720Li exhibits higher thermomechanical properties than Inconel 718 at elevated temperatures and can withstand greater in-service temperatures (8–23 %) due to the higher γ ’ strengthening phase content which remains stable up to 760 °C.},

  abstract     = {Multi-material additive manufacturing (MMAM) enables the design of materials with tunable mechanical performance by fabricating multiple dissimilar materials in a single print. MMAM has been utilized to fabricate components with unique mechanical properties for applications such as damage detection, medical devices, sensors, and soft robotics. However, the bonding strength between dissimilar polymeric materials strongly depends on the material combination and is typically lower than the material strength of the constituents. This study investigates the interfacial adhesion between two thermoplastics fabricated via material extrusion (ME)-based MMAM by quantifying the interface bonding strength using mechanical tests and polymer adhesion theory-based correlation analysis. Experimental results showed that the polylactic acid (PLA)-polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG), PETG-polycarbonate (PC) and PLA-PC material combinations exhibit bonding strengths that are close to or exceed their constituent’s material strength. Material combinations that include polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) exhibited bonding strengths of nearly two magnitudes lower than those of PLA-PETG, PETG-PC, and PLA-PC. The microstructural images of the samples showed that the most compatible combinations exhibited a smooth, gradient interface indicating the importance of nano-scale adhesion mechanisms. Based on Hansen solubility parameters and the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), we observed the correlation between wettability and physical adsorption, intermolecular diffusion, thermal stress, and the interface bonding strength. The wettability and physical adsorption feature extracted from the solubility parameters showed the highest correlation with the interface bonding strength. Furthermore, we observed that the smaller the difference in solubility parameters and CTE between two thermoplastics fabricated via ME, the more compatible the two thermoplastics are.},

  abstract     = {Although Metal matrix composites (MMCs) are superior to most sought-after metallic alloys, their challenging fabricability has limited their widespread use in bulk-form applications. Among the many advanced fabrication techniques, Additive Manufacturing (AM), owing to its unique capabilities to produce near-net shapes, has drawn significant traction in the past two decades, especially for materials that are difficult to process using traditional methods. However, unlike pure metal/alloy systems, MMCs are highly sensitive to the processing conditions prevailing in AM techniques due to factors such as the high melting point of reinforcement particles and the potential for in-situ reactions. Therefore, it may be a while before metal matrix composites are commercially produced via AM. This review will discuss the current state-of-the-art design, fabricability, and performance of various additively manufactured Metal matrix composites (AMMCs). A particular focus will be on microstructural evolution and microstructure-property relationships. The most employed AM techniques, such as directed energy deposition, powder bed fusion, binder jetting, sheet lamination, and solid-state friction stir processing, are fundamentally different in terms of thermo-kinetics, forming the perspective for this review. A detailed comparison of microstructural evolution and process parameter optimization, including feedstock preparation methods and the role of machine learning and modeling among the different AM processes, is also presented. Finally, a critical evaluation of emerging AM technologies for MMCs is also provided, highlighting their potential advantages and challenges.},
