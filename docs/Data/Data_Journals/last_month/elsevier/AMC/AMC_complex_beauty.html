  abstract     = {This study explores a distinctive scenario within the e-commerce platform supply chain. To assess the performance of these entities, we develop models for both centralized and decentralized decision-making frameworks. Furthermore, we investigate the stability and dynamic behavior of the system during prolonged decentralized model interactions. We found that centralized decision-making has a significant advantage in terms of retail prices and profits within this supply chain. Additionally, the dynamic complexity analysis underscores the challenges of managing an e-commerce supply chain under the decentralized model framework, where finding equilibrium points for decision variables proves complex and the stable ranges for these parameters are notably limited. Higher commission rates incentivize entities to adopt more aggressive strategies, with the most pronounced impact on logistics services and wholesale prices. This adjustment can lead to a substantial decrease in platform profit when the commission rate is raised.},

Firstly, the actual measurement output is represented by the model that is dependent on a periodic function. Then, using the generalized delay-dependent sector condition, the augmented periodic Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional together with certain inequalities, an anti-windup design criterion is derived based on linear matrix inequalities under which the closed-loop systems have the desirable properties such as boundedness, H ∞ performance, and asymptotic stability. The corresponding results are also presented for the case of constant delay and the case of no time delay. Moreover, the relevant optimizations in the main results are discussed. In the end, two numerical examples illustrate the availability and advantages of the proposed results.},

  abstract     = {Weighted compact nonlinear schemes are a class of high-order finite difference schemes that are widely used in applications. The schemes are flexible in the choice of numerical fluxes. When applied to complex configurations, curvilinear grids are often applied, where the symmetric conservative metric method can be used to ensure geometric conservation laws. However, for complex configurations it may be difficult to generate high quality curvilinear grids. Thus, we confine the study in this paper to Cartesian grids and develop a nonlinear immersed boundary method to deal with the boundary. The developed method is applicable to different kinds of boundary conditions. In addition, compared with the traditional immersed boundary method, this new method can handle problems with shocks near boundary. Both one- and two-dimensional cases are studied into details, with corresponding numerical results showing the validity of the proposed method.},

First, a dynamic event-triggered mechanism and an observer are introduced where a virtual observer is designed to enhance accuracy and mitigate fault impact. The actual H ∞ observer is then constructed by processing unmeasurable information. Second, based on the obtained estimates, a co-design method for the dynamic event-triggered mechanism and the H ∞ fault-tolerant controller is developed.

  abstract     = {The dissemination of information and the adoption of immunization behaviors are vital for preventing infection during epidemics. Positive and negative information have different influences on the decision to accept immunization behaviors, and individuals make decisions about whether to accept immunization based on both subjective cognizance and objective environmental factors. A three-layer propagation model is proposed to explore the co-evolutionary dynamics of competitive information, immunization behavior, and epidemics in multiplex networks. We consider the competitive transmission of positive and negative information under the effect of individual cognitive preference and the effect of the subjective cognizance and objective environmental factors. For the objective environmental factors, the Prospect Theory is introduced to describe the risk-related costs. Furthermore, we investigate the local group immunity phenomenon. Utilizing the MMCA (microscopic Markov chain approach) for theoretical analysis, our findings indicate that the dynamics of epidemic transmission can indeed undergo multi-stage phase transitions when there exists a competing propagation of positive and negative information. Improving individual cognitive preference for positive information is essential for making the right judgments when engaging in the immunization game process and reducing the epidemic transmission scale. In addition, individuals are encouraged to reduce the free-rider strategy and adopt immunization behavior timely during epidemic transmission, as this contributes to overall emergency management.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we propose a novel macroscopic (fluid dynamics) model for describing pedestrian flow in low and high density regimes. The model is characterized by the fact that the maximal density reachable by the crowd – usually a fixed model parameter – is instead a state variable. To do that, the model couples a conservation law, devised as usual for tracking the evolution of the crowd density, with a Burgers-like PDE with a nonlocal term describing the evolution of the maximal density. The variable maximal density is used here to describe the effects of the psychological/physical pushing forces which are observed in crowds during competitive or emergency situations. Specific attention is also dedicated to the fundamental diagram, i.e., the function which expresses the relationship between crowd density and flux. Although the model needs a well defined fundamental diagram as known input parameter, it is not evident a priori which relationship between density and flux will be actually observed, due to the time-varying maximal density. An a posteriori analysis shows that the observed fundamental diagram has an elongated “tail” in the congested region, thus resulting similar to the concave/concave fundamental diagram with a “double hump” observed in real crowds. The main features of the model are investigated through 1D and 2D numerical simulations. The numerical code for the 1D simulation is freely available on this Gitlab repository .},

Previous research usually assumed that individual interactions are all valid and static, overlooking the fact that some interactions may be invalid and time-varying. Notably, diffusion phenomena cannot occur if interactions lose their validity. To address this gap, a novel coupled model is proposed to study the effect of time-varying interaction validity on the co-evolution of awareness and epidemics in a multiplex high-order network. Individual activity and life-cycle theory are employed to model the time-varying validity of interactions, which is further characterized using threshold functions. Simulation experiments reveal that increasing individual activity will increase the validity of interactions, which then leads to the prevalence of epidemics. In addition, maximizing epidemic control can be achieved by increasing activity in the virtual layer while reducing activity in the physical layer. Moreover, the results in more densely interacted communities suggest that more stringent control measures are required to bring the epidemic to extinction.},

This strategy not only exhibits altruism comparable to that of ordinary cooperators, but also exerts a power of good example through its unconditional cost, and influences the defector to give unforced-feedback. The findings indicate that even in the face of high temptation, exemplary cooperation strategies can also effectively prevent the total expansion of defection strategies and coexist with them. When the three strategies coexist, higher temptation does not promote defection but rather enhances the quality of cooperation to some extent. Moreover, the increase in unforced-feedback from defectors leads to a rise in the proportion of ordinary cooperation. Notably, the exemplary cooperation strategy can maintain a certain level in the population even in an unfavorable environment for cooperation, thus preventing the population from a state of full defectors. In general, the introduction of exemplary cooperation strategies fosters the development of cooperation to a certain extent. It offers a fresh perspective for understanding the emergence and sustenance of cooperative behavior.},

To begin with, considering the limited network bandwidth, a novel SCP is proposed to avoid data conflicts in information transmission. In particular, compared with the existing SCP, the SCP constructed in this article is scheduled by semi-Markov kernel, and the probability density function of its sojourn-time is assured by both the current mode and the next mode. Then, considering the influence of SCP and DoS attacks, the cooperative design conditions of observer-based security controller based on mode-dependent and fuzzy-dependent are given. Furthermore, a mode-dependent and sojourn-time-dependent Lyapunov function is adopted, and a sufficient condition for the mean square exponential stability of the closed-loop system is ensured. Finally, the feasibility of the method is verified by a mechanical motion model.},

We discuss the semi-discrete and fully-discrete error analysis of the method. For the semi-discrete error analysis, an extended type mixed Ritz-Volterra projection is introduced for the model problem. It helps to achieve the optimal order of convergence for the unknown scalar variable and its gradient. Further, a local post-processing is performed, which helps to achieve super-convergence. Subsequently, by employing the central difference scheme in the temporal direction and applying the mid-point rule for discretizing the integral term, a fully discrete scheme is formulated, accompanied by its corresponding error estimates. Ultimately, through the examination of numerical examples within two-dimensional domains, computational findings are acquired, thus validating the results of our study.},

By introducing auxiliary variables to transform the original equation into a system, structure-preserving high-order difference scheme is obtained by applying the Crank-Nicolson method and the sixth-order difference operators for discretizing time and space derivatives. Subsequently, the conservation laws of energy and mass for the discretized solution produced by the established scheme are rigorously proven. And a theoretical analysis shows that the scheme is unconditionally convergent and stable in the L 2 -norm. Additionally, a corresponding fast solving algorithm is designed for the established scheme. And the Richardson extrapolation technique is used to enhance the temporal accuracy to sixth order.

A dynamic event-triggered mechanism with adaptive bias components is developed to reduce trigger frequency, uphold system performance, and conserve communication resources. Additionally, the observer gain is determined using the nominal observation model and linear matrix inequalities. A novel model predictive control approach is devised based on the identified model to enhance system performance.

  abstract     = {This study investigates the dynamics of predator-prey interactions in both deterministic and stochastic environments, with a focus on the ecological implications of predator harvesting. Theoretical and numerical analyses explore local stability, bifurcations, and bionomic equilibria to identify sustainable harvesting strategies. Our findings reveal that increasing predator harvesting rates can induce up to four interior equilibrium points via saddle-node bifurcations, including catastrophic transitions that destabilize the system. At high harvesting rates, the predator-free equilibrium becomes globally stable, while low and intermediate rates result in bistability or tristability, allowing coexistence of prey and predator populations. For the stochastic model, we derive conditions for species persistence and extinction, using the confidence ellipse method to quantify threshold noise intensities that trigger critical transitions between stable states. At low noise levels, predator and prey populations fluctuate around stable equilibria, but higher noise intensities can drive shifts to alternate states or predator extinction. The key factors influencing system dynamics include the predator&#39;s intrinsic growth rate, alternative food sources, and harvesting intensity. Our analysis underscores the vulnerability of ecological systems to stochastic disturbances and emphasizes the importance of carefully managed harvesting practices. These findings contribute to the development of strategies that balance ecological stability with economic objectives, ensuring the long-term sustainability of predator-prey populations.},

To this aim, a dual field mixed Galerkin discretization is introduced, in which one variable is approximated via conforming finite element spaces, whereas the second is completely local. The mixed formulation is then hybridized to obtain an equivalent formulation that can be more efficiently solved using a static condensation procedure in discrete time. The size reduction achieved thanks to the hybridization is greater than the one obtained for the Hodge Laplacian as the final system only contains the globally coupled traces of one variable. Numerical experiments on the 3D wave and Maxwell equations illustrate the convergence of the method and the size reduction achieved by the hybridization.},

This special solution can also be described from the more general perspective of the mixed feedback case (sign-changing p ), thanks to its symmetry (antiperiodicity). The analogue of this conjecture for negative feedback, p ( t ) ≤ 0 , was resolved by Lillo, and the mixed feedback analog was recently set as an open problem. In this paper, we resolve the case of mixed feedback, obtaining results in support of the conjecture of Buchanan and Lillo, underlining its link to the symmetry of the periodic solution. In particular, we obtain and describe the optimal estimates on the necessary delay for existence of periodic (more generally, nonvanishing) solutions, with respect to the period (oscillation speed). These apply to almost any first-order delay system, as we consider the general nonautonomous case, under minimal assumptions of measurability of the parameters. We furthermore discuss and elucidate the relations between the periodic and the nonautonomous case.},
