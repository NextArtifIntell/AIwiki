  abstract     = {Distributed manufacturing mode can significantly enhance production flexibility and efficiency. Considering that factories and customers in distributed manufacturing environments may be geographically dispersed, we address a distributed permutation flow shop scheduling problem (DPFSP) with direct transportation under different cost of production and transportation while the goal is to minimize of weighted sum cost and makespan (DPFSP-PTM). First, we formulate two mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) models and one constraint programming (CP) model to optimize the objective simultaneously. Then, by decomposing DPFSP-PTM into an order assignment master problem (AMP) and a series of scheduling subproblems (SSPs), we develop two exact methods based on logic-based Benders decomposition (LBBD) and Branch-and-Check (BCH). To accelerate convergence, we propose three strong SSP relaxations based on the single-machine bottleneck to enhance the MILP models and AMP. Additionally, we introduce an initial solution generated by the iterated greedy (IG) algorithm to warm-start the LBBD. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in achieving competitive average optimality gaps and lower bounds across both small-scale and large-scale instances.},

Recognizing the NP-hard nature of the problem, our goal is to develop algorithms that provide approximation ratios. While existing research has established algorithms for single-cluster GPU environments, scaling these to multi-cluster platforms introduces new challenges, especially due to the restriction that tasks cannot use processors from different clusters. We propose an integer programming-based algorithm that achieves an approximation ratio of 3 2 + ϵ , trading off runtime for an improved approximation ratio. Additionally, leveraging recent theoretical advancements, we have created a polynomial-time algorithm with an approximation ratio of 2 + ϵ . Empirical computational experiments show that our algorithms surpass their counterparts in empirical approximation ratios.},

Signed graphs are a special type of graphs that can represent more complex structures, such as positive or negative connections in a social network. In this work, we address a combinatorial optimization problem, known as the Cyclic Minimum Sitting Arrangement, that consists of embedding a signed input graph into a cycle host graph, trying to locate in the embedding positive connected vertices closer than negative ones. This problem is a variant of the well-known Minimum Sitting Arrangement where the host graph has the structure of a path graph. To tackle the problem, we propose an algorithm based on the Multi-Armed Bandit method that combines three greedy-randomized constructive procedures with a Variable Neighborhood Descent local search algorithm. To assess the merit of our proposal, we compare it with the state-of-the-art method. Our experiments show that our algorithm outperforms the best-known method in the literature to date, and the results are statistically significant, establishing itself as the new state of the art for the problem.},

The minimum quasi-clique partitioning problem (MQCPP) seeks to identify the minimum cardinality of γ -quasi-clique partitions in G . This work presents an efficient iterated local search (ILS) method to address MQCPP by using a two-phase local search procedure for local improvement, and a greedy-based perturbation procedure for diversifying the search process. An evaluation function that records the number of intra edges of each quasi-clique is used for neighboring solution evaluation, and a fast incremental evaluation technique is employed to speed up the evaluation. Numerical results on three sets of 321 benchmark instances demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm compared with state-of-the-art approaches. Specifically, ILS reports 153 (47.7%) new upper bounds and fails to reach the best known solution for only 2 instances. Additional analysis experiments are conducted to evaluate the effects of the key components of ILS, including the two-phase local search procedure, the greedy-based perturbation procedure, and the fast incremental evaluation technique.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous delivery vehicles (ADVs) and drones have gained widespread attention in the last-mile delivery due to their efficiency, environmental sustainability, and convenience. Moreover, the cooperative delivery between ADVs and drones is very complex, and most of the existing studies are focused on the cooperative delivery between trucks and drones in a single delivery mode. In contrast, this paper introduces a new vehicle routing problem for an unmanned delivery system consisting of ADVs and heterogeneous drones based on multiple delivery modes. A mixed integer programming (MIP) model is constructed for the autonomous delivery vehicle routing problem with drones based on multiple delivery modes (ADVRPD-MDM) with the objective of minimizing cost. We design a randomized variable neighborhood search (RVNS) algorithm that incorporates 12 specific neighborhood structures, a random variable neighborhood descent (RVND) mechanism and a random shaking strategy to solve the model. We evaluate the application effects of each operator and verify the effectiveness of the RVNS algorithm by the improved Solomon instances. Furthermore, when compared to the large neighborhood search (LNS) algorithm in 56 instances, the RVNS algorithm demonstrates an average improvement of 3.86% in its lowest solution, thereby confirming its superior performance. Through a series of experiments, it has been observed that the integration of collaborative drones and parallel drones within the unmanned delivery system can effectively reduce the cost. The results of the sensitivity analysis demonstrate that factors such as the multi-visit capability, the utilization of multiple drones, the high payload capacity, the long endurance, and the rapid charging rate are critical in reducing the cost. Finally, we verify through a case study that the unmanned delivery system with the ADV as carrier offers cost advantages compared to those employing trucks.},

In the past, both exact and heuristic algorithms have primarily focused on solving classic benchmarks, with relatively few efforts dedicated to tackling the challenges posed by massive WGCP real-world applications. In our work, we propose an effective local search algorithm for the WGCP based on three main ideas. First, we introduce a new variant of configuration checking to escape from local optima. Second, we devise a novel method for selecting vertex movements that guides the search towards more favorable directions. Third, we propose a novel deep optimization strategy to perturb the solution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms on both classic and massive benchmarks.

  abstract     = {Last-mile delivery involves a series of complex tasks in an unpredictable environment. Decision support tools based on optimization algorithms construct efficient routes for drivers, optimizing the cost of making deliveries. However, drivers often deviate from these routes due to factors not considered in the decision-making process. This discrepancy raises the question of how to identify routes that are useable in real-world scenarios. Our research proposes using modern machine learning techniques to classify routes based on their practical usability. In a controlled environment, we demonstrate that machine learning can learn hidden factors influencing route viability by focusing on variants of the vehicle routing problem with additional constraints like time window, capacity and precedence. For each underlying constraint, we show that a machine learning model can be trained to classify routes based on whether or not they violate the constraint. Using datasets generated from well-known benchmark instances, we present computational experiments to evaluate model performance. We discuss which types of constraints are more challenging to recognize and how large a dataset must be to allow for accurate classification. This research has the potential to improve existing decision tools, enabling them to generate routes that better account for real-world complexities.},

Furthermore, through computational studies we highlight that both the urgency of due dates of the orders and the workload level of the system can significantly influence the performance of the online algorithms.

In the algorithm selection process, feature information carried by individuals is often ignored, leading to a lack of targeted guidance ability in the algorithm. To address the limitations of the existing methods, a multi-objective flexible job shop scheduling method based on a feature information optimization algorithm (FIOA) was proposed. First, a framework of multiple group optimization algorithms was applied to construct diverse groups. Subsequently, a representative individual selection strategy was applied to mine individual offspring information and accelerate population convergence. To balance the exploration ability and computational resources of the FIOA, multiple neighborhood search rules were used to improve the utilization rate of individual offspring. In this study, the parameter configuration of the proposed algorithm was calibrated using the Taguchi method. To evaluate the effectiveness and superiority of the FIOA, each improvement of the FIOA algorithm was evaluated. In addition, it was compared with state-of-the-art algorithms in benchmark tests, and the results showed that the FIOA outperformed the other algorithms in solving flexible job shop scheduling.},

  abstract     = {Strategic bidding problems have gained a lot of attention with the introduction of deregulated electricity markets where producers and retailers trade electricity in a day-ahead market run by a Market Operator (MO). All actors propose bids composed of a unit production price and a quantity of electricity to the MO. Based on these bids, the MO selects the most interesting ones and defines the spot price of electricity at which all actors are paid. As the bids of all actors determine the price of electricity, a bidding Generation Company (GC) faces a high risk regarding its profit when placing bids as the bids of competitors are not known in advance. This paper proposes a novel dynamic programming framework for a GC’s Stochastic Bidding Problem (SBP) in the day-ahead market considering uncertainty over the competitor bids. We prove this problem is NP-hard and study two variants of this problem solved with the dynamic programming framework. Firstly, a relaxation provides an upper bound solved in polynomial time (SBP-R). Secondly, we consider a bidding problem using fixed bidding quantities (SBP-Q) that has previously been solved through heuristic methods. We prove that SBP-Q is NP-hard and solve it to optimality in pseudo-polynomial time. SBP-Q is solved on much larger instances than in previous studies. We show on realistic instances that its optimal value is typically under 1% of the optimal value of SBP by using the upper bound provided by SBP-R.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces the Two-Echelon Vehicle Routing Problem with Pickups, Deliveries, and Deadlines (2E-VRP-PDD), an emerging routing variant addressing the operations of logistics companies connecting consumers and suppliers in metropolitan areas. Logistics companies typically organize their logistics in such metropolitan areas via multiple geographically dispersed two-echelon distribution systems. The 2E-VRP-PDD is the practical problem that needs to be solved within each of such a single two-echelon distribution system, thereby merging first and last-mile logistics operations. Specifically, it integrates the distribution of last-mile parcels from the hub via satellites to the consumers with the collection of first-mile parcels from the suppliers via satellites that return to the hub. Moreover, it considers deadlines before first-mile parcels arrive at the hub, which must be transported further in the network. We solve the 2E-VRP-PDD with a newly developed Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) combined with a post-process integer programming model. Our ALNS provides high-quality solutions on established benchmark instances from the literature. On a new benchmark set for the 2E-VRP-PDD, we find that modifying time restrictions, such as parcel delivery deadlines at the city hub, can lead to an 8.27% cost increase, highlighting the overhead associated with same-day delivery compared to next-day delivery operations. Finally, by analyzing real-life instances containing up to 2150 customers obtained from our industry collaborator in Jakarta, Indonesia, we show that our ALNS can reduce the cost of operations by up to 17.54% compared to current practice.},

Our model incorporates new features related to dwell time determination by considering passenger arrival patterns at bus stops which have been neglected in the literature on transfer synchronization and timetabling. We solve a sample average approximation of our model using a problem-based scenario reduction approach, and the progressive hedging algorithm. As a proof of concept, our computational experiments on instances using transfer nodes in the City of Toronto, with a mixture of low- and high-frequency routes, demonstrate the potential advantages of the proposed model.

  abstract     = {We consider two-stage robust linear programs with uncertain righthand side. We develop a General Polyhedral Approximation (GPA), in which the uncertainty set U is substituted by a finite set of polytopes derived from the vertex set of an arbitrary polytope that dominates U . The union of the polytopes need not contain U . We analyze and computationally test the performance of GPA for the frequently used budgeted uncertainty set U (with m rows). For budgeted uncertainty affine policies are known to be best possible approximations (if coefficients in the constraints are nonnegative for the second-stage decision). In practice calculating affine policies typically requires inhibitive running times. Therefore an approximation of U by a single simplex has been proposed in the literature. GPA maintains the low practical running times of the simplex based approach while improving the quality of approximation by a constant factor. The generality of our method allows to use any polytope dominating U (including the simplex). We provide a family of polytopes that allows for a trade-off between running time and approximation factor. The previous simplex based approach reaches a threshold at Γ &gt; m after which it is not better than a quasi nominal solution. Before this threshold, GPA significantly improves the approximation factor. After the threshold, it is the first fast method to outperform the quasi nominal solution. We exemplify the superiority of our method by a fundamental logistics problem, namely, the Transportation Location Problem, for which we also specifically adapt the method and show stronger results.},

  abstract     = {For a class of large and complex engineering projects with limited construction sites, three-dimensional (3D) spatial resources usually become a bottleneck that hinders their smooth implementation. A project schedule is easily disturbed by space conflicts and uncertain environments if these factors are not considered in advance. Firstly, we extend the traditional resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) by considering 3D spatial resource constraints under uncertain environments, and propose a new three-dimensional spatial resource-constrained project scheduling problem with stochastic activity durations (3D-sRCPSPSAD). The activity schedule and the space allocation need to be decided simultaneously, so we design the first-fit and the best-fit strategies, and integrate them into the traditional resource-based policy to schedule activities and allocate 3D space. Secondly, a novel hyper-heuristic based on surrogate genetic programming (HH-SGP) is designed to evolve rules automatically for the 3D-sRCPSPSAD. The main goal of the surrogate model in HH-SGP is to construct an approximate model of the fitness function based on the random forest technique. Therefore, it can be used as an efficient alternative to the more expensive fitness function in the evolutionary process. More importantly, the weak elitism mechanism and other modified techniques are designed to improve the performance of HH-SGP. Thirdly, we configure the parameters of 3D spatial resources and generate numerical instances. Finally, from the aspects of solution quality and stability, we verify the efficiency, quality and convergence rate of HH-SGP under different uncertain environments. The effectiveness of the surrogate model, and the performance of the first-fit and the best-fit strategies are also analyzed through extensive numerical experiments. The results indicate that our designed HH-SGP algorithm performs better than traditional heuristics for the 3D-sRCPSPSAD, and the performance of the fitness function surrogate model in HH-SGP is generally better than without it. This study can also help project practitioners schedule activities and allocate spatial resources more effectively under various uncertain scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Ship emission monitoring is crucial for improving compliance with emission control area (ECA) policies. To address the limitations of traditional base station-based monitoring methods, we propose a highly maneuverable mothership-based unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) monitoring mode. We develop a mixed integer non-linear programming model to maximize the total profit (i.e., the revenues of ship emission monitoring minus the fixed costs of motherships and UAVs, the fuel cost of motherships, and the electricity cost of UAVs). Three types of integer variables are relaxed to continuous variables based on the model properties. We then design a tailored Benders decomposition algorithm to solve the model. Moreover, to improve the performance of the algorithm, we also present a variety of acceleration strategies, including lower bound limit inequalities and knapsack inequalities. Finally, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm using experimental instances based on the North American ECA. We also find a relationship between the width of emission inspection area and the total monitoring cost.},
