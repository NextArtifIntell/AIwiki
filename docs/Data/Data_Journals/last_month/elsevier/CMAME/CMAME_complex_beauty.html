  abstract     = {This work presents an implicit stabilized non-ordinary state-based peridynamic method (ImNSPD) to simulate the finite deformation and crack propagation in nearly incompressible hyperelastic materials. Firstly, a mixed displacement-pressure ( u - p ) formulation of the ImNSPD is derived to mitigate the volumetric locking issues expected in a purely displacement formulation near the incompressibility limit. Additionally, the shape-associated micromodulus and the dilatation-associated micromodulus are introduced as penalty factors in the modified force vector state and the modified hydrostatic pressure scalar state, respectively, to enhance the numerical stabilization. Subsequently, an incremental-iterative solution scheme based on the Newton-Raphson algorithm and the Newmark-beta method is proposed to capture the nonlinear response of hyperelastic materials in the time domain. The stability and robustness of the ImNSPD are assessed by studying several representative numerical examples involving the finite deformation of nearly incompressible hyperelastic material models. Moreover, an equivalent strain function is introduced as a failure criterion for nearly incompressible hyperelastic materials, and the good performance of the ImNSPD in predicting crack propagation is demonstrated through the fracture analysis of the twisting column test.},

  abstract     = {Quantum computing, as an emerging technology, has experienced rapid development and attracted widespread attention across various disciplines over the past four decades. In the field of damage identification, as the demand for damage detection efficiency in real-world engineering continues to rise, the application of this fast computing technology also deserves attention. As a combination of genetic algorithm and quantum computing, the hybrid quantum genetic algorithm (HQGA) utilizes quantum superposition and entanglement to implement evolutionary optimization on quantum computers. Due to its flexibility in performing a global adaptive search without relying on the specific nature of the problem or the form of the objective function, the HQGA demonstrates the potential to solve complex optimization problems. In this paper, a mapping relationship is established between quantum bits and the stiffness reduction factors of elements, leading to the development of the HQGA for solving the damage identification problem based on measured strain responses. The performance of the proposed method is tested by damage identification for three distinct structures. The results show that the proposed method can enhance detection efficiency greatly while maintaining its effectiveness and stability.},

  abstract     = {Contact search, the step where pairs of interacting points are identified, is crucial in computer methods for contact mechanics. This work explores the properties of contact pairs in a specific approach known as master-master method, combined with a hybrid-barrier enforcement method. The scope is on two-dimensional non-conformal contact, modeled as pointwise. Line-to-line and other instances of flat contact, for which a distribution of pressure over a region of finite size better represents their physics, are avoided. The main goal is to overcome the non-uniqueness of solutions when considering concave geometries. The bodies are defined by parameterized plane curves composed of strictly convex segments that represent either convex or concave boundaries. In the master-master approach, contact pairs are characterized by the common normal concept. Within this framework, contact pairs are classified into four types: convex-convex, matchable convex-concave, non-matchable convex-concave, and concave-concave. The Hessian of the squared distance function is analyzed for each type to further characterize them. Characterization using the Hessian matrix reveals that convex-convex and matchable convex-concave pairs are local minimizers of the squared distance function, while the other two types are either saddle points or maximizers. This enables a demonstration of the uniqueness of solutions for convex bodies. In the convex-concave case, projecting the concave boundary onto the convex one results in a univariate restricted objective function that distinguishes matchable pairs as minimizers and non-matchable pairs as maximizers. This function is used to propose a robust search algorithm that includes subdividing the domain into intervals with at most one minimizer, enabling the practical use of iterative minimization techniques to find all desired contact solutions. An algorithm for contact search that accommodates concave geometries is especially valuable in multibody applications.},

Despite its popularity, FEM faces challenges such as automatic mesh generation, handling stress singularities, and adaptive meshing. The recently developed Scaled Boundary Finite Element Method (SBFEM) overcomes these challenges by utilizing polyhedral elements, such as octree elements. SBFEM, combined with octree meshes, offer significant advantages over FEM, including rapid mesh transition, automatic mesh generation, adaptive meshing, and enhanced computational efficiency. Octree-based SBFEM has been successfully implemented and tested in various applications, such as homogenization, elastoplasticity, and adaptive phase-field fracture. However, its application to polycrystal representative volume elements (RVEs) remains unexplored. In this work, we implemented octree-based SBFEM for polycrystal RVEs and evaluated its performance for elasticity. A detailed algorithm is provided to generate balanced periodic octree meshes for polycrystal RVEs. The homogenized response and local stress fields are compared with those obtained from FEM and fast Fourier transforms (FFT). The results demonstrate that SBFEM closely matches with FEM and FFT while offering the added advantage of computational efficiency over FEM.},

The BV equation presents significant challenges for PINNs, primarily due to the hyperbolic sine term, which renders the Hessian of the PINN loss function highly ill-conditioned. To address this issue, we introduce a bypassing term that improves numerical stability by substantially reducing the condition number of the Hessian matrix. Furthermore, the small magnitude of the ionic flux j often leads to a common failure mode where PINNs converge to incorrect solutions. We demonstrate that incorporating a secondary conservation law for the solid-phase potential ψ effectively prevents such convergence issues and ensures solution accuracy. The proposed methods prove effective for solving both forward and inverse problems involving the BV equation. Specifically, we achieve precise parameter estimation in inverse scenarios and reliable solution predictions for forward simulations.},

The foundational aspect of this work involves the application of Peridynamic Differential Operator (PDDO) theory, based on which the analytical relationships between the non-local bond deformations and local strain/stress tensors are first established with the consideration of bond rotation kinematics. Furthermore, the correlations between the bond stretch and Stress Intensity Factors (SIFs) within the crack tip field are rigorously derived, which facilitates the description of fatigue damage in alignment with the classical Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) theory. The PD fatigue model is implemented through a coupled PDDO and finite element (FE) approach to achieve higher numerical efficiency. Finally, the model&#39;s validity is demonstrated through high-fidelity simulation of several benchmark mixed-mode fatigue examples. A notable advantage of the proposed PD fatigue model is its seamless integration of peridynamic theory with classical fracture mechanics, and the model parameters can be rigorously and accurately calibrated for mixed-mode fatigue problems.},

Unlike traditional multiscale methods, the proposed approach reformulates the mechanical boundary value problem into Lippmann-Schwinger type integral equations at both the micro- and macro-scale, thereby leveraging the numerical efficiency of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) method at both scales. The application of generic (e.g. non-periodic) boundary conditions at the macro-scale is carried out by using the virtual boundary technique and buffer zones. In addition, the introduction of a clustering algorithm further improves the computational efficiency of the numerical method during the information transfer between scales. To ensure accurate damage prediction and mitigate spurious strain localization at both scales, suitable regularization techniques are employed. The proposed multiscale method is applied to investigate the transverse tension of unidirectional composite dog-bone specimens. After experimental verification, the method is applied to simulate 2D and 3D brittle fracture, elasto-plastic damage, and examples with non-uniform material orientation. The results demonstrate the robustness and adaptability of the clustering approach, which achieves up to 65.90-fold speedup and 81.62-fold reduction in memory usage compared to non-clustered multiscale methods, while maintaining a comparable level of accuracy.},

Accurate identification of the internal parameters within soliton systems allows us for precise comprehension and effective regulation of these systems. The introduction of deep learning has revolutionized the way to address the issue of parameter identification in soliton systems. However, the lack of suitable weight initialization schemes leads to the identification outcomes being prone to blurriness and errors. Consequently, we propose a novel initialization method: physical meta-learning(PML). The unique approach which relies solely on the physical information related to the system allows us to obtain the initialization weights without relying on any labeled data. In basic soliton systems experiments, PML reduces the identification error by 25% to 80%. Regarding the parameter identification task of dissipative soliton system in mode-locked lasers, the PML method significantly reduces the identification error by 98.1%. In addition to the application scenarios, we also examine the effectiveness of the PML method in different parameter identification methods. Overall, our research provides a method for optimizing the identification and simulation of complex soliton systems.},

  abstract     = {Hemodynamic analysis is essential for assessing cardiovascular health. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods, while precise, are computationally expensive and lack transfer learning capabilities, requiring recalculation for varying boundaries. Machine-learning methods, despite powerful data-fitting abilities, heavily rely on labeled datasets, limiting their use in clinical settings where data is scarce. To alleviate data dependency, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) embed physical laws directly into the loss function, allowing model parameter transfer across varying geometries. However, traditional PINNs struggle with complex domains like stenosed vessels, leading to inefficiency and reduced accuracy. To tackle this challenge, we propose the Boundary Progressive PINN (BP-PINN). By introducing boundary complexity, BP-PINN reconstructs vascular boundaries at varying smoothness levels. Training begins with simple models and progressively incorporating boundary details to capture complex flow characteristics. Without any labeled data, BP-PINN was successfully applied to 22 patient-specific cases, achieving L2 errors of 0.036 for velocity and 0.057 for pressure compared to CFD ground truth. Furthermore, compared to fractional flow reserve (FFR), the invasive gold standard for diagnosing myocardial ischemia, the non-invasive FFR predicted by BP-PINN attained the highest overall diagnostic accuracy of 90.9 %, outperforming vanilla-PINNs (81.8 %). Additionally, BP-PINN leveraged pretrained models with similar boundary complexities, enabling efficient stent preoperative planning. The proposed method evaluated the effects of five stenting strategies on the hemodynamic environment, achieving an average computation time of under 3 min per case. Finally, the framework was extended to solve heat equation, Poisson equation and Helmholtz equation in irregular domains, demonstrating superior accuracy compared to baseline methods.},

Finally, to obtain materials with extreme mechanical properties, a topology optimization method is adopted for the generation of cell geometries with the needed properties. The numerical experiment results indicate that compared to the homogeneous material consisting of basic cells, the Young&#39;s modulus of assembled metamaterials with similar density is enhanced by more than three orders of magnitude and up to 6273 times. Further, a series of materials with extreme Young&#39;s modulus approaching the theoretical limit are identified by geometric parameter optimization for specific topologies. Such metamaterials based on assembly strategies are capable of taking full advantage of geometric variations to enhance mechanical properties, thus having a wide range of applications in various fields such as energy absorption, impact protection, and strain sensing.},

  abstract     = {Finite element and isogeometric methods with non-boundary-conforming meshes, also known as immersed, embedding or trimming approaches, offer a fast and simple model generation process and thus became an attractive alternative to conventional boundary-fitted methods. One challenge inherent to these methods is the accurate modeling of discontinuities, such as small, narrow trimming features and cracks. Such discontinuities can split the support domain of a basis function into multiple disjoint regions, leading to a spurious mechanical coupling between physically separated material regions, which may compromise the predictive quality of the simulation model. Isogeometric Analysis (IGA), with its higher-order and higher-continuity spline bases possessing larger support domains, is even more prone to such spurious effects. This phenomenon is known as ”cross-talk”, and can be solved via adequate (local) mesh refinement, as shown by Coradello et al. [Computational Mechanics 66 (2020): 431-447]. However, the focus of our work is on explicit dynamics such as crash simulations. In such cases, mesh refinement is unfavorable because it halves the critical time step size for each level of h -refinement, and therefore substantially increases the computational cost. To this end, we propose an effective and efficient control point duplication (CPD) approach that mitigates the effects of cross-talk caused by narrow trimming features, while maintaining the feasible critical time step size in explicit dynamic analysis. CPD locally decouples the disjoint material regions by duplicating certain control points and modifying the connectivity of the affected elements. Furthermore, since cross-talk has only received limited attention in the literature, we also present a systematic study to elaborate on its characteristics and mechanisms. Following this, we provide a formal mathematical definition, a classification criterion, as well as a detection method for cross-talk in trimmed NURBS shells. Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the CPD approach through four numerical examples with varying complexities. We also show that CPD is not limited to explicit dynamics and that apart from narrow trimming features, it can potentially also mitigate cross-talk caused by element erosion and sharp crack interfaces.},

  abstract     = {Under some initial and boundary conditions, the rapid reaction-thermal diffusion process taking place during frontal polymerization (FP) destabilizes the planar mode of front propagation, leading to spatially varying, complex hierarchical patterns in thermoset polymeric materials. Although modern reaction–diffusion models can predict the patterns resulting from unstable FP, the inverse design of patterns, which aims to retrieve process conditions that produce a desired pattern, remains an open challenge due to the non-unique and non-intuitive mapping between process conditions and manufactured patterns. In this work, we propose a probabilistic generative model named univariate conditional variational autoencoder (UcVAE) for the inverse design of hierarchical patterns in FP-based manufacturing. Unlike the cVAE, which encodes both the design space and the design target, the UcVAE encodes only the design space.

  abstract     = {In peridynamics, a large amount of research related to material failure has applied the dynamic relaxation (DR) method under static or quasi-static loading conditions. However, as a pseudo-dynamic method that converts static problems into dynamic problems by introducing fictitious inertia and damping terms, the intermediate attenuation process of the DR method is not realistic. Whether it is truly suitable for simulating the irreversible mechanical behavior of material failure, which closely depends on the real process and has significant dynamic effects in the later stage of failure, is still a debatable issue. This article first derives the prerequisite for applying the DR method to solve static or quasi-static problems, which is to ensure that the load and system stiffness remain constant during the solving process. However, material damage will inevitably weaken the stiffness of the system and break this prerequisite. In view of this, using explicit dynamic algorithm for failure simulation is worthy of being reconsidered. Secondly, the DR method is used to simulate the failure of l -shaped concrete specimen, and it is found that selecting different fictitious damping coefficients may lead to different crack propagation paths, resulting in uncertainty in the simulation results. It is also found that due to the use of fictitious damping in the DR method to suppress the acceleration effect in the accelerated failure stage, the dynamic effect of the system is not fully utilized, which leads to distortion of simulation results. At last, a two-stage joint algorithm is proposed suitable for material failure problems under static or quasi-static loading conditions. The DR method is only applied to the continuous deformation stage of materials without any damage, while the explicit dynamic algorithm is applied to the crack initiation and propagation stage after damage occurs. The numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the joint algorithm.},

  abstract     = {This work develops a global-local adaptive meshing method for the phase-field model of brittle fracture, offering flexible adjustment of mesh density to produce seamless and high-quality adaptive meshes. The method first establishes a direct mapping from phase-field values and displacement errors to a normalized nodal density field, which is used to control the computational accuracy. On this basis, a sampling procedure is performed by detecting the maximum value to progressively place sampling nodes, ensuring that first-level nodes are placed globally while preserving crack location information. Subsequently, a hexagonal seeding algorithm is used to multiply nodes, where the spacing of generated seeds (i.e., higher-level nodes) is adaptively adjusted based on local nodal density requirements to regulate element sizes. A spatial assessment algorithm is utilized to compare the expected nodal spacing of the newly generated node with its distance to existing nodes, which serves as a termination criterion for the loop of the seeding algorithm and effectively prevents the occurrence of low-quality elements. After the seeding process of all nodes is completed, all generated nodes are connected by constrained Delaunay triangulation. This method has been discussed under classical brittle fracture cases with various control parameters (e.g., the mapping function, the expected maximum/minimum element size, and the distance factor) to validate its advantage of reducing degrees of freedom and improving solution efficiency.},

Such problems are computationally prohibitive when the parameter-to-observable (PtO) map is expensive to evaluate, the parameters are high-dimensional, and the optimization for sensor selection is combinatorial and high-dimensional. To address these challenges, we develop an accurate, scalable, and efficient computational framework based on derivative-informed neural operators (DINO). We propose to use derivative-informed dimension reduction to reduce the parameter dimensions, based on which we train DINO with derivative information as an accurate and efficient surrogate for the PtO map and its derivative. Moreover, we derive DINO-enabled efficient formulations in computing the maximum a posteriori (MAP) point, the eigenvalues of approximate posterior covariance, and three commonly used optimality criteria for the OED problems. Furthermore, we provide detailed error analysis for the approximations of the MAP point, the eigenvalues, and the optimality criteria. We also propose a modified swapping greedy algorithm for the sensor selection optimization and demonstrate that the proposed computational framework is scalable to preserve the accuracy for increasing parameter dimensions and achieves high computational efficiency, with an over 1000 × speedup accounting for both offline construction and online evaluation costs, compared to high-fidelity Bayesian OED solutions for a three-dimensional nonlinear convection–diffusion–reaction example with tens of thousands of parameters at the same resolution.},

  abstract     = {The intricate relationship between the microstructure of materials and their mechanical properties remains a significant challenge in the field of materials science. This study introduces a novel deep learning framework aimed at predicting mechanical properties from both global and local perspectives. Taking the dual-phase Ti-6Al-4V alloy as an example, we first predict stress–strain curves and yield strength under complex microstructural conditions to describe global mechanical behavior, followed by an analysis of the distribution of the local stress field and stress concentration phenomena. To achieve this, we employ an improved graph attention network (IGAT), which effectively captures complex intergranular relationships and enables accurate predictions of global properties by integrating node features with graph structural information. Additionally, a three-dimensional conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (3D-cDDPM) was developed for local stress field analysis, generating detailed stress field distributions through an iterative denoising process and capturing stress concentration phenomena in critical microstructural regions. The results demonstrate that this framework effectively predicts multiscale mechanical responses in various microstructural configurations. The IGAT model achieves a mean relative error (MRE) of 0. 399% on the set of tests for global performance prediction, outperforming both the graph convolutional network (GCN) and the three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN). For local stress field predictions, the 3D-cDDPM maintains an error range of 0.4% to 7%, with the generated stress distribution maps closely matching the ground truth. This work advances the development of material design and performance optimization methods, providing critical insights into the integration of computational modeling with materials science.},

  abstract     = {An isogeometric analysis is proposed for solving acoustic problems in fluids with significant thermal and viscous dissipation. The approach is based on the Kirchhoff decomposition, which simplifies the governing linearized conservation laws for mass, momentum, and energy by dividing the physical problem into three superimposed modal wave fields; acoustic, thermal, and viscous fields. The wave fields are coupled by boundary conditions and solved as time-harmonic Helmholtz problems using an isogeometric boundary element method. The proposed solution benefits from isogeometric analysis in modeling exact geometries with high continuity, achieving accurate results while adopting moderate degrees of freedom. The basic idea of isogeometric analysis is to use the same spline basis functions to approximate both the geometry and the physical variables, allowing for a direct connection between computer-aided design tools and analysis models. Moreover, the solution profits from the boundary element approach not requiring volumetric domain discretization or far-field truncation. 3D exterior and interior test cases are discussed to validate the proposed method. The results are verified by an analytical solution and other competing numerical methods showing significant savings in degrees of freedom. Furthermore, an interior field analysis reveals the dissipative behavior inside thin boundary layers at the fluid–structure interface. A comparison with the lossless case emphasizes the added value of accounting for viscothermal losses, which were previously neglected in isogeometric analysis of acoustic problems. Despite the ill-conditioning of the system combining the acoustic, thermal, and viscous contributions, the problem can be solved via LU decomposition with iterative refinement.},

  abstract     = {Bayesian model updating based on variational inference (VI-BMU) methods have attracted widespread attention due to their excellent computational tractability. Traditional VI-BMU methods often employ the mean-field assumption, which simplifies computation by treating model parameters as independent. Recent advances in variational inference have introduced more flexible variational distributions, enabling accurate modeling of parameter dependencies. To further address the limitations of traditional VI-BMU methods, this paper introduces a novel Bayesian model updating framework based on variational inference and Gaussian copula model (VGC-BMU). This framework incorporates Gaussian copula model to simulate the dependency relationships between model parameters, significantly improving the accuracy of posterior distribution estimation. The theoretical relationship between the VGC-BMU and traditional VI-BMU is derived, and the necessity and advantages of parameter dependency modeling are elucidated. Moreover, a simplified computational approach is developed by introducing Jacobian matrix transformations and parameter expansion techniques to address the high computational complexity of the VGC-BMU. The method&#39;s capability to identify parameter dependencies is first demonstrated through two simple numerical models. Subsequently, two engineering case studies—a four-story shear frame model and a steel pedestrian bridge model—are selected to evaluate the performance of VGC-BMU in parameter identification and dependency modeling. The results demonstrate that VGC-BMU significantly improves parameter identification accuracy compared to traditional VI-BMU methods. Furthermore, VGC-BMU exhibits superior accuracy and robustness in response prediction by incorporating parameter dependency modeling, making it a more effective and reliable approach for engineering applications.},

However, process planning for the curved layer slicing determines the interactions between the part and supports, and consequently, self-support topology optimization requires a numerically tractable process planning algorithm to derive the sensitivities, which however, has yet been achieved. To fill the gap, we develop a structural topology optimization method for multi-axis additive manufacturing, which features in achieving the self-support effect by deeply incorporating the curved layer slicing. Specifically, a process scalar field is generated on top of a domain of pseudo-densities by solving a heat diffusion equation and a Poisson equation, through which the geodesics included in the scalar field facilitate the curved layer slicing and any geometric information about the layers are derivable on the pseudo-densities because of the tractable numerical processing routine. Then, self-support constraints for multi-axis additive manufacturing can be established by measuring the curved layer normals and the part boundary gradients. Coupled with the density variables for topology optimization, our proposed method could concurrently optimize the part structure and its curved slicing pattern, maximizing the structural physical performance while eliminating the need of supports. Finally, we validated and discussed the effectiveness of our method through a series of numerical tests and provided a workflow to show the strong correlation between our optimized results and the actual spatial paths.},

Dynamic characteristic optimization of mechanical structures considering multi-source uncertainties remains a challenging task due to the violent confliction among multiple objectives and multiple constraints. In this paper, a novel robust equilibrium optimization method for dynamic characteristics of mechanical structures with hybrid uncertainties is proposed. Firstly, the dynamic robust equilibrium optimization model is established with multi-source uncertainties described as truncated probabilistic variables and interval variables. Subsequently, a novel angular proximity coefficient is defined to assess the constraint feasibility of design vectors. Further, a quantitative metric named the overall robust equilibrium degree (ORED) is proposed to evaluate the overall robustness of all objective and constraint performance indices for feasible design vectors. On this basis, all the feasible design vectors are directly ranked according to their OREDs, thereby achieving the optimal design of mechanical structures. The robust equilibrium optimization is realized by integrating Kriging models, Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) and nested genetic algorithm (GA). The effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method are demonstrated through a numerical example and two engineering case studies involving a high-speed press slider and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).},

  abstract     = {This work extends our previous study from S. Shrestha et al. (2024) by introducing a new abstract framework for Variational Multiscale (VMS) methods at the discrete level. We introduce the concept of what we define as the optimal projector and present a discretisation approach that yields a numerical solution closely approximating the optimal projection of the infinite-dimensional continuous solution. In this approach, the infinite-dimensional unresolved scales are approximated in a finite-dimensional subspace using the numerically computed Fine-Scale Greens’ function of the underlying symmetric problem. The proposed approach involves solving the VMS problem on two separate meshes: a coarse mesh for the full PDE and a fine mesh for the symmetric part of the continuous differential operator. We consider the 1D and 2D steady advection–diffusion problems in both direct and mixed formulations as the test cases in this paper. We first present an error analysis of the proposed approach and show that the projected solution is achieved as the approximate Greens’ function converges to the exact one. Subsequently, we demonstrate the working of this method where we show that it can exponentially converge to the chosen optimal projection. We note that the implementation of the present work employs the Mimetic Spectral Element Method (MSEM), although, it may be applied to other Finite/Spectral Element or Isogeometric frameworks. Furthermore, we propose that VMS should not be viewed as a stabilisation technique; instead, the base scheme should be inherently stable, with VMS enhancing the solution quality by supplementing the base scheme.},

  abstract     = {An algorithm for a family of self-starting high-order implicit time integration schemes with controllable numerical dissipation is proposed for both linear and nonlinear transient problems. This work builds on the previous works of the authors on elastodynamics by presenting a new algorithm that eliminates the need for factorization of the mass matrix providing benefit for the solution of nonlinear problems. The improved algorithm directly obtains the acceleration at the same order of accuracy of the displacement and velocity using vector operations (without additional equation solutions). The nonlinearity is handled by numerical integration within a time step to achieve the desired order of accuracy. The new algorithm fully retains the desirable features of the previous works: 1. The order of accuracy is not affected by the presence of external forces and physical damping; 2. The amount of numerical dissipation in the algorithm is controlled by a user-specified parameter ρ ∞ , leading to schemes ranging from perfectly nondissipative A -stable to L -stable; 3. The effective stiffness matrix is a linear combination of the mass, damping, and stiffness matrices as in the trapezoidal rule, leading to high efficiency for large-scale problems. The proposed algorithm, with its elegance and computational advantages, is shown to replicate the numerical results demonstrated on linear problems in previous works. Additional numerical examples of linear and nonlinear vibration and wave propagation are presented herein. Notably, the proposed algorithms show the same convergence rates for nonlinear problems as linear problems, and very high accuracy. It was found that second-order time integration methods commonly used in commercial software produce significantly polluted acceleration responses for a common class of wave propagation problems. The high-order time integration schemes presented here perform noticeably better at suppressing spurious high-frequency oscillations and producing reliable and usable acceleration responses.

We consider a “parameter-free” shape optimization approach, wherein the nodal coordinates in the finite element mesh serve as design variables. To regularize the design changes we use a PDE-based filter, similar to the filtering techniques used in topology optimization. We present a variant of the “parameter-free” shape optimization where we allow not only design variables on the surface, but also in the bulk of the domain. To combat mesh quality issues we employ adaptive mesh refinement based on a Riemannian metric. The numerical algorithm is implemented in C++ and uses PETSc for efficient shape and topology optimization of complex 3D geometries on unstructured grids. We verify our “parameter-free” shape optimization on two examples, and compare different variations of the shape filter. Finally, we demonstrate the power and flexibility of our simultaneous shape and topology optimization framework on a dam-like geometry.},

  abstract     = {Predicting railhead damage due to multiple wheel passes in railway operations can be computationally demanding, especially when accounting for the rail’s inelastic material response. In this paper, we use a steady-state assumption within a convective coordinate system and employ Reduced-Order Modeling (ROM) through the Proper Generalized Decomposition (PGD) method to increase the computational efficiency. Our approach solves a nonlinear reduced-order problem for the displacements in a 3D railhead with elastic–plastic material properties considering various contact scenarios. The ROM framework includes domain decomposition and a parametric loading framework using PGD. It accounts for the elastic–plastic rail material through three key features: (1) treatment of the moving load under the assumption of steady state, by using a convective coordinate system along the railhead to convert the problem into a stationary contact load problem, (2) implementation of PGD to solve the 3D displacement field efficiently, and (3) use of fixed-point iterations to treat the coupling for solving plastic strains and displacements. In this iterative process, plastic strains are solved from displacements, and displacements are solved based on a loading scenario and updated plastic strains. The accuracy and computational efficiency are assessed by comparing our strategy with 3D finite element simulations for moving contact loads. The results show convergence with only a few fixed-point iterations for each over rolling, which results in a solution that is 63 times faster. This efficiency is crucial for assessing the accumulated plastic deformation from multiple wheel passes.},

  abstract     = {Computational mechanics is essential for understanding and predicting complex material behaviors, particularly in areas such as material fracture mechanics and structural engineering. However, the high computational costs associated with traditional methods, especially for large-scale simulations, present significant challenges. Peridynamics (PD) offers a compelling alternative to classical continuum mechanics by effectively modeling discontinuities such as cracks. Despite its strengths, PD is computationally intensive, limiting its broader application. To address these challenges, we introduce a machine learning-accelerated PD model that significantly reduces computational time while maintaining high accuracy. Our method integrates a machine learning-based surrogate model trained on displacement field data, which efficiently approximates the behaviors of material points, bypassing the iterative processes of conventional PD simulations. This approach is validated through a series of benchmark tests, ranging from one-dimensional bars to three-dimensional beams, demonstrating speedups of over six times compared to traditional methods. The integration of machine learning with PD not only enhances computational efficiency but also expands the practical applicability of PD to large-scale engineering problems, making it a viable tool for a wide range of scientific and industrial applications.},

Given a series of force and deformation measurements, the temperature field is obtained by minimizing the adequately weighted differences between the measured and computed values. Three numerical examples — a Plate With a Hole, a Bridge, and a Hoover Dam example — each with multiple sensors distributed in different configurations, demonstrate the procedure’s capabilities. A target temperature distribution is prescribed in all cases, and the displacement sensor data is recorded. The optimization algorithm (here, steepest descent with Barzilai–Borwein step) uses this data to optimize the temperatures such that the same deformation is obtained at the sensor locations. Vertex Morphing is used as a filter to mitigate the ill-conditioning. Results show that the proposed approach can accurately reconstruct the target thermal distribution, especially when more sensors are used. Additionally, it is observed that the sensors do not need to be positioned in the region of interest; the method remains effective as long as the sensors can detect changes related to that area. A comparison with standard spatial interpolation techniques, namely, k-nearest neighbors and ordinary and universal kriging, is performed using temperature sensors in the same configurations. The proposed approach performs remarkably better than the interpolation techniques with a reduction in the L 2 norm of up to 41.3%, 93.9%, and 41.3%, for the Plate With a Hole, the Bridge, and the Dam examples, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Many fluid flows of engineering interest involve high-density ratios, the formation of shock waves, and the presence of multiple chemical species. In these situations, obtaining accurate results depends on the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) algorithm’s ability to ensure stable and robust time and space discretization of the governing equations, effectively minimizing numerical diffusion. In this work, we develop and evaluate a low-dissipation, high-order solver for the Navier–Stokes equations applicable to compressible, multi-species flows within the OpenFOAM library. We introduce a new shock sensor specifically designed for high-order discretization methods, which guarantees accuracy up to the fourth order in both space and time when using unstructured grids. Additionally, this approach is compatible with real-gas equations of state. We evaluated the solver performances on three test cases, each chosen for its relevance to real-world engineering problems: a 1D multi-specie shock tube, a 2D shock tube where Richtmyer–Meshkov instability develops as a consequence of bubble-shock interaction, and, finally, the flow through the complex 3D geometry of a high-pressure fuel injector used in propulsion applications, to investigate its performances on unstructured grids. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed sensor in scenarios characterized by field discontinuities, shock waves, high-density ratio, and distorted grids. This means that our solver can accurately simulate complex fluid flows in engineering applications where these conditions are often encountered. The developed high-order scheme and shock sensor were implemented in an OpenFoam solver called rhoCubic4kFoam .},

This provides both the active set and all slip components without requiring iterative active set search procedures or inducing spurious slip on inactive systems. The basic SODS algorithm is accelerated by tracking the evolution of the active set. A fast Newton–Raphson procedure enables to obtain the solution for an unchanging active set directly, while line search and extrapolation procedures direct the SODS steps towards the solution faster. A regularised tangent modulus is proposed that eliminates stiffness jumps upon changes in active set to improve the convergence behaviour of outer (equilibrium) iterations conducted with the algorithm. The resulting stress update algorithm is highly stable and efficient, making it an attractive candidate for use in large-scale crystal plasticity FE simulations and homogenisation algorithms.},

Inspired by multi-objective optimization, this paper proposes a novel set theory-based regularization approach (STR) to enhance adaptability to uncertainties and improve reconstruction accuracy and robustness. The nominal force inversion is constituted and then extended into the interval uncertainty framework, and an effective orthogonal sampling-based interval prediction method is proposed to analyze the coupled effect of force inversion and uncertainty propagation. Once the uncertainty level of the complex structure is known, this prediction method can accurately and quickly estimate the fluctuation bound of the identified force. Enlightened by the completely same logic between the regularization method used in force inversion and multi-objective optimization problem, namely, simultaneously satisfying the norm minimization of the solution and the residual parameter, this study develops a novel multi-objective optimization-inspired set theory-based regularization parameter selection method. This method incorporates the interval dominance relationship to select the most competitive regularization parameter under interval uncertainties. Therefore, an accurate reconstuction framework with bounded uncertainties is finally proposed and verified by two numerical examples.},

The stabilization of the weighted basis is accomplished by means of extension. We present the classification criterion and the calculation procedure for the extension coefficients of the inner B-splines.

Additionally, we adopt a hybrid collocation–Galerkin approach to impose the Neumann boundary conditions on the trimming boundaries. Our proposed method combines the advantages of WEB-splines and IGA-C in terms of straightforward implementation, well-conditioned system matrices and high computational efficiency, which we illustrate by numerical tests on 2D and 3D trimmed geometries.

EF is a simple, modular, and effective strategy for both full-order models (FOMs) and reduced-order models (ROMs). It is well-known, however, that when the filter radius is too large, EF can be overdiffusive and yield inaccurate results. To alleviate this, EF is usually supplemented with a relaxation step. The relaxation parameter, however, is very sensitive with respect to the model parameters. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy to alleviate the EF overdiffusivity. Specifically, we leverage the variational multiscale (VMS) framework to separate the large resolved scales from the small resolved scales in the evolved velocity, and we use the filtered small scales to correct the large scales. Furthermore, in the new VMS-EF strategy, we use two different approaches to decompose the evolved velocity: the VMS Evolve-Filter-Filter-Correct (VMS-EFFC) and the VMS Evolve-Postprocess-Filter-Correct (VMS-EPFC) algorithms. The new VMS-based algorithms yield significantly more accurate results than the standard EF in both the FOM and the ROM simulations of a flow past a cylinder at Reynolds number Re = 1000.},

  abstract     = {Data-driven evaluation of full-field variables over time poses considerable challenges and little explored. Therefore, we propose a novel dynamic parallel spatiotemporal order reduced Gaussian Process scheme (Dyna-PSTORGP) to accurately predict the full-field, time-sequenced multi-physics responses of hypervelocity collisions in real-time using limited data. In which, we first propose parallel and reduction in space and temporal dimensionalities and investigate the optimal temporal reconstruction method, establishing the spatial-temporal unified latent (feature) spaces that efficiently decouple the strong nonlinear and multi-physics dynamic responses. Next, we propose a hierarchical parallel multi-Gaussian Processes model, emulating the maps from initial input conditions to spatiotemporal order-reduced dynamic response. This hierarchical parallelism operates on two levels: an inner parallel modeling across each component of order-reduced spatial output within individual time steps, and an outer parallel modeling across the reduced time steps. This dual-layered structure not only enhances computational efficiency and enables accurate dynamic response predictions across spatiotemporal scales, effectively addressing the common issue of error accumulation in sequential prediction, but also ensures rapid training and prediction with confidence intervals. Moreover, we investigated different kernels and sensitivity to assess the effects of varying initial conditions in hypervelocity collisions, revealing the collision inclination angle exerts a greater influence on the damage response than both the direction angle and collision velocity. Numerical examples, including simulations on the Whipple shield and space station, validate the Dyna-PSTORGP model&#39;s capability for rapid parallel construction and training, completing in seconds (e.g., 12.8 s) with a limited dataset (e.g., 125 samples). The model achieves real-time, high-precision multi-physics predictions for complex nonlinear hypervelocity collisions (e.g., 1.9 s) and consistently maintains high accuracy (e.g., relative errors &lt;5 %) across full-field, high-dimensional scenarios (e.g., 1,134,172 degrees of freedom).},

  abstract     = {Advanced simulations of the mechanical behavior of soft tissues frequently rely on structure-based constitutive models, including smeared descriptions of collagen fibers. Among them, the so-called Discrete Fiber Dispersion (DFD) modeling approach is based on a discrete integration of the fiber-strain energy over all the fiber directions. In this paper, we review the theoretical framework of the DFD model, including a derivation of the stress and stiffness tensors required for the finite element implementation. Specifically, their expressions for incompressible plane stress problems are obtained. The use of a Lebedev quadrature, built exploiting the octahedral symmetry, is then proposed, illustrating the particular choice adopted for the orientation of the integration points. Next, the convergence of this quadrature scheme is assessed by means of three numerical benchmark tests, highlighting the advantages with respect to other angular integration methods available in the literature. Finally, using the implemented model, we analyze the mechanical properties of the Z-plasty, a technique commonly used in reconstructive skin surgery, considering multiple geometrical configurations, orientations of the fibers, and levels of skin prestress. The results are presented in the form of mechanical quantities relevant to surgical practice.},

  abstract     = {We present a new framework for the simultaneous optimization of both the topology as well as the relative density grading of cellular structures and materials, also known as lattices. Due to manufacturing constraints, the optimization problem falls into the class of mixed-integer nonlinear programming problems. Since no algorithm is capable of solving these problems in polynomial time, we obtain a relaxed problem from a multiplicative split of the relative density and a penalization approach. The sensitivities of the objective function are derived such that any gradient-based solver might be applied for the iterative update of the design variables. In a next step, we introduce a material model that is parametric in the design variables of interest and suitable to describe the isotropic deformation behavior of quasi-stochastic lattices. For that, we derive and implement further physical constraints and enhance a physics-augmented neural network from the literature that was formulated initially for rhombic materials. Finally, to illustrate the applicability of the method, we incorporate the material model into our computational framework and exemplary optimize two-and three-dimensional benchmark structures as well as a complex aircraft component.},

  abstract     = {Reduced order modelling is popular and widely used in engineering as it has the potential to gain several orders of magnitude CPU speedup for simulations with different parameters such as different initial or boundary conditions. This work presents a new parametric non-linear non-intrusive reduced-order model (P-NLNIROM) for the fluid problems, which extends the capabilities for non-linear NIROM Fuet al. (2023) on parametric problems. The Deep Auto-Encoder (DAE), Deep Residual Learning Neural network (ResNet), and deep transfer learning are used to construct the P-NLNIROM. The DAE is developed to project or map the original high-dimensional dynamical systems into a much lower dimensional nonlinear reduced latent space and the deep ResNet is used to construct a set of functions that represents the relationships between model input parameters (such as initial or boundary conditions) and extracted representations in the latent or reduced space (reduced representation of fluid dynamics). Transfer learning is used to extend the predictive capability of the model for different parameters. The novelty of this work lies in that ResNet and transfer learning are used to predict different parametric conditions for the AutoEncoder-based, non-linear, non-intrusive reduced-order model (NLNIROM). Transfer learning expands the predictive range of parametric space and makes the transferred P-NLNIROM perform well with much less data. The capability of this new P-NLNIROM is illustrated numerically by two test cases: a lock exchange, and a flow past a cylinder. The results obtained show that the P-NLNIROM performs well and the transferred model shows more promising results under new parameter conditions.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes and studies two extensions of applying hp-variational physics-informed neural networks, more precisely the FastVPINNs framework, to convection-dominated convection–diffusion–reaction problems. First, a term in the spirit of a SUPG stabilization is included in the loss functional and a network architecture is proposed that predicts spatially varying stabilization parameters. Having observed that the selection of the indicator function in hard-constrained Dirichlet boundary conditions has a big impact on the accuracy of the computed solutions, the second novelty is the proposal of a network architecture that learns good parameters for a class of indicator functions. Numerical studies show that both proposals lead to noticeably more accurate results than approaches that can be found in the literature.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, neural networks (NNs) have become increasingly popular for surrogate modeling tasks in mechanics and materials modeling applications. While traditional NNs are deterministic functions that rely solely on data to learn the input–output mapping, casting NN training within a Bayesian framework allows to quantify uncertainties, in particular epistemic uncertainties that arise from lack of training data, and to integrate a priori knowledge via the Bayesian prior. However, the high dimensionality and non-physicality of the NN parameter space and the complex relationship between parameters (NN weights) and predicted outputs renders both prior design and posterior inference challenging. In this work, we present a novel BNN training scheme based on anchored ensembling that can integrate a priori information available in the function space from, e.g., low-fidelity models. The anchoring scheme makes use of low-rank correlations between NN parameters, learned from pre-training to realizations of the functional prior. We also perform a study to demonstrate how correlations between NN weights, which are often neglected in existing BNN implementations, are critical to appropriately transfer knowledge between the function-space and parameter-space priors. The performance of our novel approximate BNN algorithm is first studied on a small 1D example to illustrate the algorithm’s behavior in both interpolation and extrapolation settings. Then, a thorough assessment is performed on a multi-input–output materials surrogate modeling example, where we demonstrate the algorithm’s capabilities both in terms of accuracy and quality of the uncertainty estimation for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data.},
