  abstract     = {This research aims to automate labour-intensive tasks in forest nurseries by developing a soft gripper that mimics human workers&#39; grasps to perform the singulation and sorting of tree saplings. By analysing human workers and conducting experimental investigations, the required grasp types and grip forces were identified. The Fin Ray Effect (FRE) structure, noted for its adaptability to asymmetric shapes, was chosen as the gripper&#39;s basis. However, modifications were necessary to achieve the required power and pinch grasp types and to provide the desired grip forces. Simulation analysis explored various beam configurations and boundary conditions of FRE fingers, resulting in a proposed modified design. Experimental investigations confirmed that the proposed gripper effectively delivered required grasps and grip forces. The new design enabled three additional grasp types for FRE grippers and increased grip forces by over 200 %. This gripper design is suitable for industrial pick-and-place applications where precise pinching grasp and various power grasps with sufficient payload capacity are needed.},

In this paper,a real-time kinematic closed-loop controller that optimizes the step length to boost control performance is proposed. Initially, a differential-based generalized inverse kinematics solution is formulated to resolve the DOF coupling in twin-pivot continuum robots that intertwined two DOFs in one joint. Subsequently, an adaptive online optimization strategy utilizing the algorithm of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is proposed to refine the controller, overcoming the limitations of traditional Jacobian-based approaches. This novel method innovatively decouples control direction and step length, optimizing safety and efficiency. Comparative simulations and tracking tests confirm the controller&#39;s superior precision and efficiency, with an average accuracy of 0.33 %, a 35 % enhancement over the Jacobian controller, thus facilitating the broader application of multi-section continuum robots.},

The scenario-based cost function of NMPC encompasses terms dedicated to achieving the desired formation by leaders, converging the states of followers to the convex hull spanned by leaders, and minimizing control efforts. Utilizing an acknowledgment-based packet transmission strategy, coupled with a buffer mechanism on the actuator side, alleviates the impact of control signal absence during DoS attacks on the controller-to-actuator (C-A) channel. As a Lyapunov-based approach, the contractive constraint in MPC is employed to establish the stability of Multi-Robot Systems (MRS) throughout the mission. A search and rescue application, utilized as a simulation case study, verifies the proposed method’s usefulness and efficiency. Moreover, In the evaluation of real-time implementation, the proposed scheme was validated through a laboratory-based experiment involving a customized mobile robot and low-cost hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) agents based on Raspberry Pi.},

  abstract     = {As high-tech equipment for rescue and relief, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely used in remote relief operations during disasters, significantly improving the efficiency of rescue efforts. However, one significant challenge of UAVs is the limitation of their onboard battery, which prohibits them from completing coverage tasks in a single journey, requiring multiple round-trip flights and frequent battery charging or replacement. As a result, it will greatly prolong the task time. To improve the efficiency of coverage tasks, we allocate task points reasonably to minimize the coverage rounds, and carry out path planning to optimize the travel time of each UAV. This study first formulates a path planning model with the optimization objective of minimizing the overall task time. Then, a task allocation strategy is designed based on the priority of task points, including a max-weight allocation scheme for special scenarios with absolute priority rules and a min-delay allocation scheme for general scenarios with relative priority rules. To optimize the paths of UAVs, we further develop an improved beetle antennae search algorithm based on mutation operations (MBAS). The performance of the developed integrated methods is finally tested through simulation, yielding good results.

The following trajectory is generated in the form of a quartic Bézier curve with an adaptive control point generation method based on the integral length and curvature of the reference path. An impressive merit is that the cutting-corner problem during sharp turns can be avoided and smooth speed regulation can be achieved automatically. Another advantage is that the robot can quickly return to the reference path from a large lateral position or heading deviation, without any large space requirement for adjustment. The first few commands derived from the differentiation of the following trajectory are utilized. Simulation results show that the proposed method has a higher accuracy under the same-level computation time compared with other simple geometric methods . Real-world robot experiments are conducted in various environments to verify the proposed algorithm&#39;s accuracy, robustness, and flexibility. The average path-following error of real-world experiments is under 0.1 m, even with sudden path changing for obstacle avoidance. Additionally, with the proposed algorithm, the robot can navigate safely in a residential community where frequent pedestrian incursions occur.},

Under these conditions, the involvement of humans in the environment drastically complicates such interaction tasks; as the safety of humans should be prioritized while seeking to achieve the desired task aim. It is thus paramount that appropriate developments should be pursued with specific considerations for such safety-performance-balanced interaction tasks on unknown soft environments (e.g., humans). Towards this end, we present an adaptive robust, and passive control scheme based on model predictive control and variable impedance control that addresses this challenge. Under this control scheme, during robotic interaction tasks with complex environments (e.g., humans), the presented development and design incorporate safety thresholds that are carefully satisfied via impedance adaptation, and realized by a safety-related mode-switching mechanism. Once the safety thresholds are satisfied, task performance is then focused on. Additionally, a real-time adaptive robust parameter estimator is designed and utilized to estimate the environment contact model for the model predictive control, and thus this control scheme is robust against disturbances (e.g., which would invariably arise from the inevitable small bounded human motions) during the interaction tasks. Finally, the key safety and performance attainments of the proposed control scheme are verified via experiments. The experiments are conducted on two silicone rubber models and a human arm. These show that the proposed control scheme effectively outperformed various currently available control schemes in these interaction tasks with unknown environment contact models, and bounded but unpredictable environment position shifts, such as in robotic ultrasound scanning applications.},

However, for hardware resource-constrained USVs, current detection models still struggle to find a balance between being lightweight and maintaining accuracy. To address this challenge, we first reduce parameters by clipping channels in the backbone network through a dependency graph based pruning method. Additionally, we introduce the Simple Attention Module (SimAM) into the backbone network to derive excellent three-dimensional attention weights without adding additional parameters during computation. Furthermore, we utilize the ghost module to reconstruct the feature fusion network by using simple linear operations to process feature maps, which enhances the network performance in feature extraction while further compressing the model. Experiments show that our model achieves a 15.56 % improvement in mean Average Precision (mAP) while reducing the count of model parameters by 55 % compared to the original EfficientDet-D0 model, and balancing lightweight and accuracy compared to the majority of current models.},

Learning and replicating such human-like strategies can lead to the development of more sophisticated robots capable of performing complex whole-body tasks in real-world environments. To this end, this paper proposes a combined learning and optimization framework for transferring human loco-manipulation soft-switching skills to mobile manipulators. The methodology starts with data collection of human demonstrations for locomotion-integrated manipulation tasks through a vision system. Next, the wrist and pelvis motions are mapped to the mobile manipulators’ End-Effector (EE) and mobile base. A kernelized movement primitive algorithm learns the wrist and pelvis trajectories and generalizes them to new desired points according to task requirements. Then, the reference trajectories are sent to a hierarchical quadratic programming controller, where the EE and the mobile base reference trajectories are provided as the first and second priority tasks, respectively, generating the feasible and optimal joint level commands. Locomotion-integrated pick-and-place and door opening tasks have been chosen to validate the proposed approach. After a human demonstrates the two tasks, a mobile manipulator executes them with the same and new settings. The results showed that the proposed approach successfully transfers and generalizes the human loco-manipulation skills to mobile manipulators, even with different geometry.},

Since perturbations act by modifying the state, as well as the feasibility region itself, the fundamental idea is to select in real time the operation mode based on the feasibility properties of the current state. In standard mode , footsteps are regarded as fixed and the MPC computes a Center of Mass (CoM) and a Zero Moment Point (ZMP) trajectory. Robustness is ensured by a robust stability constraint which uses a disturbance estimate and by restricted ZMP constraints along the control horizon. In the presence of strong perturbations, that violate the aforementioned conditions, the system switches to recovery mode , in which footsteps positions and timings can be modified in order to recover feasibility. We analyze the feasibility of both modes of operation and provide conditions for recursive feasibility of the standard mode.

The RR’s kinematic model is first established by fully considering the structural characteristics of the active revolute joint. Via the kinematic model and the virtual structure method, formation control of multiple RRs is formulated as path-following control with respect to their corresponding node in the desired rolling compaction formation shape. Then, optimal formation control policies of RRs are derived by the value functional that is the solution to tracking Hamilton–Jacobi-Bellman equation. By resorting to the RL-based tracking control, approximate optimal control policies are obtained by forward-in-time online neural network estimation of the value functional. Locally uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop formation error system is analyzed rigorously by the Lyapunov technique. Finally, numerical simulation results are presented for three-RR cooperative rolling compaction of a clay core wall dam in Qianping reservoir to show the effectiveness of the main results of this paper.},

Several problems that fall under task and motion planning do not have a predetermined number of sub-tasks to achieve a goal. For example, while retrieving a target object from a cluttered workspace, in principle the number of object re-arrangements required to finally grasp it cannot be known ahead of time. To address this challenge, and in contrast to traditional planners, also those based on AND/OR graphs, we grow the AND/OR graph at run-time by progressively adding sub-graphs until grasping the target object becomes feasible, which yields a network of AND/OR graphs. The approach is extended to enable multi-robot task and motion planning, and (i) it allows us to perform task allocation while coordinating the activity of a given number of robots, and (ii) can handle multi-robot tasks involving an a priori unknown number of sub-tasks. The approach is evaluated and validated both in simulation and with a real dual-arm robot manipulator, that is, Baxter from Rethink Robotics. In particular, for the single-robot task and motion planning, we validated our approach in three different TAMP domains. Furthermore, we also use three different robots for simulation, namely, Baxter, Franka Emika Panda manipulators, and a PR2 robot. Experiments show that our approach can be readily scaled to scenarios with many objects and robots, and is capable of handling different classes of TAMP problems.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a novel deep reinforcement learning framework to tackle the problem of visual servoing of nonholonomic mobile robots. The visual control of nonholonomic mobile robots becomes particularly challenging within the classical paradigm of visual servoing, mainly due to motion and visibility constraints, which makes it impossible to reach a given desired pose for certain configurations without losing essential visual information from the camera field of view. Previous work has demonstrated the effectiveness of deep reinforcement learning in addressing various vision-based robotics tasks. In light of this, we propose a framework that integrates deep recurrent policies, intrinsic motivation, and a novel auxiliary task that leverages the interaction matrix, the core of classical visual servoing approaches, to address the problem of vision-based control of nonholonomic robotic systems. Firstly, we analyze the influence of the nonholonomic constraints on control policy learning. Subsequently, we validate and evaluate our approach in both simulated and real-world environments. Our approach exhibits an emergent control behavior that enables the robot to accurately attain the desired pose while maintaining the desired visual content within the camera’s field of view. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating its effectiveness, robustness, and accuracy.},
