  abstract     = {Federated reinforcement learning (FedRL) offers promising avenues for secure collaboration among deep reinforcement learning (DRL) clients. We embark on a pioneering journey into the federated hybrid reinforcement learning (FedRL-Hybrid) domain which remains relatively unexplored in comparison with federated online reinforcement learning (FedRL-Online). Our proposed FedRL-Hybrid framework seamlessly integrates the strengths of both Online-DRL and Offline-DRL Clients. Central to this framework are the FedRL-Offline algorithm and the FedRL-Online-AFT algorithm, with the federated adaptive fine-tuning (FedAFT) mechanism ensuring a fluid transition of the global model from FedRL-Offline to FedRL-Online settings. To bolster the empirical research in this nascent field, we present benchmark datasets along with their generation methods to evaluate the performance of FedRL-Hybrid. Our experimental results highlight the fact that FedRL-Hybrid achieves notable performance across the three paradigms, i.e., FedRL-Online, FedRL-Offline, and FedRL-Hybrid, highlighting its potential as a comprehensive framework for FedRL.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning (DL) models have great potential to be used for recommender systems (RS) in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) due to their excellent data processing and learning abilities. To alleviate the problem of privacy leakage in centralized training of DL models, federated learning (FL) is engaged for its advantage of just uploading gradients or parameters of models without raw data sharing. However, the ubiquitous data heterogeneity in IoV brings a big challenge to the stable global convergence of FL. In addition, existing FL schemes with high convergence latency cannot realize the timely personalized content recommendation in IoV. In this paper, a FL scheme with adaptive local aggregation for privacy-aware RS in IoV, named FLRS, is proposed. At first, we analyze the data distribution on each vehicle locally from two aspects: label distribution and feature distribution. After receiving vehicle data distribution information, the edge server selects aggregation collaborators for each vehicle according to the distribution similarity of labels and features. In the model updating stage, the local model on each vehicle is adaptively aggregated with those from its collaborators and then the local training process begins. At last, the performance of FLRS is evaluated through simulation experiments.},

An optimal triggering controller and a dynamic triggering mechanism are designed, incorporating a positive, decreasing dynamic parameter that gradually decreases from a positive constant to zero. This approach ensures the existence of UPMIETs. Next, a cooperative weight-updating rule for the critic-only neural network (NN) is developed, which utilizes the weights of neighboring agents. It is then proven that the weight update error of the critic-only NN is ultimately uniformly bounded, and the theoretical value of UPMIETs for the dynamic triggering mechanism can be calculated. The proposed algorithm has three main advantages: 1) It does not require global information; 2) It ensures UPMIETs; 3) It simplifies the network structure. Finally, two simulation examples are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The simulation results show that the algorithm has fewer trigger times and larger positive minimum inter-event times, which verifies the superiority of the proposed algorithm.},

This approach represents a significant improvement over conventional static or dynamic event-triggered protocols. The effects of DoS attacks on both sensor-to-controller and controller-to-actuator communication channels are modeled using independent Markov chains, which are then unified into a single chain for comprehensive analysis. The proposed MPC, combined with the switching event-triggered protocol, ensures robust performance by achieving both disturbance attenuation and input-to-state stability for the fuzzy system.

  abstract     = {In semiconductor manufacturing, wafer probing is a quality control process before packaging, usually performed by an automated machine with a fixed path. The unqualified grains in the first detection need to be confirmed again. The fixed path method is inefficient and requires manual intervention for the second wafer probing on randomly scattered grains. To this end, we propose a reinforcement learning-based adaptive path planning method for second wafer probing. To simplify decision-making in a large state space, we propose a novel attention-based hierarchical reinforcement learning method with shared memory (AHRL-SM) and introduce it into wafer probing for the first time. The high-level agent is responsible for focusing on the region with a large number of grains to be detected, while the low-level agent is responsible for planning the moving path of the probe in the specified sub-region. The soft attention mechanism and recurrent neural network are incorporated into the probing architecture to facilitate original image feature extraction and historical information acquisition, respectively. In addition, we propose a unique shared memory mechanism to further improve decision-making efficiency. The Markov decision process of the complete wafer second probing and the performance verification of the proposed method are thoroughly described in this work. Compared with the existing path planning methods for wafer probing, sufficient experimental results confirm that our method has obvious advantages in probing efficiency, grain surface protection, and generalization.},

  abstract     = {Dataset-amelioration methods improve clustering accuracy by introducing gravitation between neighboring objects, pulling them closer together. However, in overlapping datasets, the gravitation can also pull adjacent clusters closer, which will degrade data distribution. Highly Improving the Accuracy of Clustering (HIAC) constructs a probability curve to select a global threshold that eliminates inter-cluster gravitation, thereby aggregating objects within the same cluster. Nonetheless, the global threshold may erroneously retain inter-cluster gravitation while removing intra-cluster gravitation, potentially resulting in the formation of new tiny clusters and the deviation of boundary objects. To address this issue, we propose the HIACSP algorithm ( H ighly I mproving the A ccuracy of C lustering Algorithms based on S hortest P ath Distance). HIACSP defines the weight of the shortest path between objects as a novel distance metric, denoted as δ S P . This new metric prompts the K nearest neighbors identified by δ S P to be biased toward the cluster core and belong to the same cluster. Consequently, only intra-cluster gravitation forces are retained without relying on the threshold, thus preventing the formation of tiny clusters and the deviation of boundary objects. Additionally, based on SP-KNN, the boundary score is devised to identify actual boundary objects. By pulling boundary objects toward the cluster core using the gravitation acting on them by SP-KNN, overlapping clusters can be well-separated, and no clusters will be over-divided. Extensive experiments have been conducted to validate HIACSP. The experimental results show that HIACSP achieves an average improvement in clustering accuracy of 19.9% (Adjusted Rand Index, ARI), 14.8% (Normalized Mutual Information, NMI), 12.0% (Fowlkes-Mallows Index, FMI), 11.0% (Purity, PUR), and 14.8% (V-Measure, VM) across five evaluation metrics, outperforming baseline algorithms by at least 5.7% (ARI), 3.9% (NMI), 3.2% (FMI), 3.6% (PUR), and 3.9% (VM).

To fulfill the time-varying constraint requirement on the consensus error, universal barrier function (UBF) is used to transform the original consensus error into a new one. The observed state and the transformed consensus error are incorporated into the command-filtered backstepping procedure, utilizing auxiliary signals to eliminate the filtered error associated with the virtual controls. To derive the final control law, a smooth function is employed to approximate the input saturation nonlinearity, and an extended state is introduced along with an update law to estimate the bound of the nonlinear time-varying term resulting from the partial derivative of the smooth function.

However, to guarantee the responsible and secure application of AI technology in healthcare, it is imperative to address issues like data protection, moral concerns, and compliance with regulations. The concept of a p , q -cubic quasi-rung orthopair fuzzy set provides an effective optimization strategy for managing the uncertainty about the use of AI tools in healthcare issues. By adding an additional parameter, the p , q -cubic quasi-rung orthopair fuzzy set enables a more comprehensive and flexible description of the insufficient information. The key objective of the paper is to represent uncertain evaluation information about the use of AI tools in medical industry processes by introducing p , q -cubic quasi-rung orthopair fuzzy weighted arithmetic/geometric mean aggregation operator and p , q -cubic quasi-rung orthopair fuzzy ordered weighted arithmetic/geometric mean aggregation operator under the environment of a new class of algebraic operational laws. Further, to determine the optimum order of each action, which may reflect the inter-correlations among criteria, an additional structure incorporating p , q -cubic quasi-rung orthopair fuzzy assessment of alternatives and ranking based on the TOPSIS method implementing p , q -cubic quasi-rung orthopair fuzzy-criteria importance through inter-criteria correlation (CRITIC) is offered. Additionally, we go into extensive detail on the newly suggested multi-attribute group decision process that is based on the p , q -cubic quasi-rung orthopair fuzzy weighted arithmetic/geometric mean aggregation operators using new class of algebraic operational laws environment. We use the artificial intelligence tools in medical industry problem to further verify the feasibility of the approach. In terms of decision-making capability, the suggested strategy outperforms a number of different approaches that have been reported in the literature.},

  abstract     = {Crime scene investigation (CSI) image classification is crucial in forensic analysis, significantly boosting the efficiency of police investigations. Conventional CSI image classification detection approaches depend heavily on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and pre-labeled, extensive image data, which are time-consuming and costly to assemble. To address this issue, we present an active learning method that boosts model performance using fewer labeled examples. Unlike traditional active learning methods that employ heuristic selection techniques independently of the training process and compromise their effectiveness, our strategy integrates off-policy deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to make strategic data selections. The off-policy approach allows for learning from a broader range of experiences, improving adaptability and accelerating the learning process compared to on-policy methods. Our model utilizes numerous CNNs to pull features from different layers of images, which are subsequently processed by the softmax layer for image categorization. Starting with a minimal labeled dataset, the classifier employs DRL to identify which unlabeled images should be annotated next. These newly labeled images are then added to the training pool, and the classifier is periodically retrained to enhance its accuracy. Additionally, our framework incorporates a generative adversarial network (GAN) for online data augmentation and introduces a novel regularization technique to stabilize GAN training and prevent mode collapse. Furthermore, our model employs the Random Key method, optimized by the differential evolution (DE) algorithm, to minimize the dependence of the approach on hyperparameters. Our comprehensive testing across diverse datasets, including the center for image and information processing-CSI dataset (CIIP-CSID), the global human image dataset with 10,000 images (GHIM-10 K), and corel 1,000 (Corel-1 K), demonstrates that our model achieves F-measures ranging from 86.758 % to 92.611 %. This underscores the superior performance and versatility of the model in handling varied CSI image classification tasks.},

  abstract     = {The El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the primary interannual variations of the climate system, significantly impacts global climate patterns, ecosystems, and economies. Most cutting-edge ENSO prediction methods rely on traditional numerical models and novel data driven technologies. The numerical ways are based on dynamic equations and contribute to the physical representation of ENSO. However, the numerical model is relatively complex, leading to resource consumption, and it fails to address the inherent uncertainty like spring predictability barrier (SPB) and signal-to-noise ratio problem for long-lead forecasts particularly in long-term forecasts exceeding one year. Data-driven methods can effectively alleviate the SPB and improve the effective hindcasting time. However, they lack guidance from physical mechanisms, which results in a lack of physical interpretability in their outcomes. This can even lead to physically inconsistent results. In this study, we introduce an explainable physics-guided intelligent spatio-temporal forecasting model for ENSO (PGtransNet_ENSO). The model incorporates key characteristics and factors of ENSO events, including internal variability, external forcing, Bjerknes positive feedback mechanism, delayed attention mechanism to account for temporal lag effects, and El Niño/La Niña event types and intensities encoding. PGtransNet_ENSO maintains high accuracy even with limited data availability and enhances the model&#39;s convergence speed. Extensive experimental confirm its capability to deliver dependable ENSO predictions up to 12 months in advance. Moreover, the model outputs demonstrate robust physical consistency with established dynamical principles, thereby enhancing the interpretability of its underlying mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {As a cooperative policy learning method, task allocation has been widely used to enhance the collaboration of multi-agent systems. However, most allocation methods require a fully observable state of the environment during training. In dynamic environments with incomplete and noisy observations, these methods struggle to achieve effective task allocation. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Fuzzy Knowledge Inference-based dynamic Task Allocation method (FKITA) for multi-agent systems, which adopts fuzzy behavioral knowledge to improve task allocation effectiveness. Specifically, FKITA incorporates fuzzy inference into the process of interpreting agent tasks based on local observations, compensating for missing information, and reducing the uncertainty of the incomplete observation environment. Furthermore, the characteristics knowledge of task allocation is expressed in the form of fuzzy rules, which optimize the search space of task allocation, and reduce the environmental interference during task matching. In addition, we introduce a two-layer coordination framework that updates task allocation and policy learning to enhance cooperation capabilities. Experimental evaluations on three cooperative multi-agent tasks demonstrate that FKITA improved the accuracy of task allocation 75% by fuzzy knowledge inference and achieved better success rates on six StarCraft maps, leading to efficient task cooperation.},

This study introduces a novel method, RWoDSN, for extracting such feature points, incorporating considerations of sharp-to-smooth transitions, large-to-small scales, and textural-to-detailed features. We approach feature extraction as a two-stage context-dependent analysis problem. In the first stage, we propose a novel neighborhood descriptor, termed the Disk Sampling Neighborhood (DSN), which, unlike traditional spatially and geometrically invariant approaches, preserves a matrix structure while maintaining normal neighborhood relationships. In the second stage, a random walk is performed on the DSN (RWoDSN), yielding a graph-based DSN that simultaneously accounts for the spatial distribution, topological properties, and geometric characteristics of the local surface surrounding each point. This enables the effective extraction of feature points. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RWoDSN method achieves a recall of 0.769—22% higher than the current state-of-the-art—alongside a precision of 0.784. Furthermore, it significantly outperforms several traditional and deep-learning techniques across eight evaluation metrics.},

While existing RL methods primarily address this intractable instability through algorithmic modifications or training strategies, the role of optimization techniques remains largely underexplored. This paper investigates intermittent instability in RL training, which hinders accurate value learning, and proposes a novel optimization approach: Gradient Norm Preservation (GNP). Our analysis identifies irregular gradient spikes, caused by high-reward data during exploration, as a key source of instability. These spikes are mathematically quantified, and the optimizer&#39;s learning rate is dynamically adjusted to preserve initial gradient norms, mitigating their impact on value learning. Experiments across diverse environments demonstrate that integrating GNP into RL algorithms significantly improves stability, with notable gains in training performance across several environments.},

This study combines the advantages of both to establish the attribute reduction theory and the method of metric fuzzy information systems based on information theory. First, it defines the concepts of metric fuzzy rough entropy, fuzzy joint rough entropy and fuzzy rough mutual information, explores their properties and relationships and constructs a method for evaluating attribute importance. Secondly, based on this theoretical foundation, two efficient attribute reduction algorithms are designed: the first algorithm doesn&#39;t rely on decision attributes, and its advantage is that it can effectively improve the computational efficiency; the second algorithm combines decision attributes, and its advantage is that it can optimize the reduction effect. Both algorithms use the strategies of forward selection and backward elimination to eliminate redundant attributes. Finally, this paper compares these two reduction algorithms with five commonly used reduction algorithms on 20 datasets and uses the average classification accuracy of 14 classifiers to evaluate the reduction effects of these algorithms. Experimental results show that the two algorithms proposed in this paper perform well in classification tasks, with their average accuracy ranking among the highest compared to other algorithms, thus verifying the efficiency and advantages of the reduction algorithms of metric fuzzy information systems in large-scale data processing.},

Although many rough set theory extensions developed over time focus on reasoning about (partial) set inclusion, these approximation spaces sometimes fall short when dealing with crucial aspects of approximate reasoning within ISs. Specifically, these systems aim to construct high-quality approximations of compound decision granules that represent solutions. Here, we present the basis for insightful reasoning realized through approximate reasoning processes grounded in granular computations. By doing so, we provide a sufficiently rich basis for designing IS problem solvers.

In view of these observations, we propose a K nowledge&amp; S ocial-based collaborative method with C ontrastive G raph S tructure L earning for explainable recommendation, named KSCGSL . It establishes multi-view representations for users and items with explainable learning based on knowledge-enhanced semantic-aware modeling and social network-driven preference learning, both refined via contrastive graph structure optimization. Specifically, KSCGSL introduces a dual graph augmentation mechanism based on knowledge graph and semantic awareness for item embedding learning. For user modeling, it captures user preferences from user-item interaction analysis and augments them through social relations. To solve the inherent semantic inconsistencies across multiple views and mitigate noise interference, contrastive graph structural learning is incorporated to optimize embedding learning and filter structural noise. Experiments conducted on three publicly available datasets demonstrate that KSCGSL achieves significant improvements in recommendation accuracy with explainable manners.},

  abstract     = {Anomaly detection is a significant data mining task with great application potential. However, the presence of uncertain information, such as noise and fuzziness, in real data usually poses a great challenge to existing anomaly detection methods. As an important technique of granular computing theory, fuzzy neighborhood rough sets can effectively handle uncertain data. It has been successfully applied to data pre-processing tasks such as attribute reduction or feature selection. In response to the shortcomings of existing anomaly detection methods that cannot effectively handle uncertain information such as noise and fuzziness, this paper proposes an unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm based on a novel fuzzy neighborhood rough sets model. At first, parameterized fuzzy relations are introduced to inscribe fuzzy neighborhood information granules. By establishing the relationship between different granules, the fuzzy neighborhood lower and upper approximations are defined to construct a fuzzy neighborhood rough set model for decision-free information systems. The lower approximation ratio is further proposed and used to construct the anomaly score, which characterizes the anomaly degree of the objects by aggregating the granule intensity of anomalies with corresponding weights. Finally, an unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm is designed for heterogeneous data based on the proposed fuzzy neighborhood rough set model. The results of extensive experiments illustrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the other ten comparison algorithms and can effectively handle uncertain information.

This method can learn a group&#39;s preference by automatically integrating its members preferences without integrating policy, and analyze group/user preferences and understand group/user behaviors by using multi-view text mining. Specifically, in order to integrate rich group to item interaction information into the model, we designed a graph convolution network (GCN) model based on multi-topic learning, and denote the new model as topic-based graph convolution network via LLM (T-GCN-LLM). By applying graph convolutions on the multi-topic association graphs, the model can make a comprehensive representations for groups and users through using embeddings contained in multiple topics, so as to improve the group recommendations. We conducted extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets to evaluate the T-GCN-LLM, the results demonstrate that our model can better represent the interactions between groups and items than many novel and high quality group recommendation methods.

To address this gap, this article proposes novel reliability-driven joint clustering algorithms based on hybrid attribute analysis for SNLSDM problems. First, the probabilistic linguistic evaluation-reliability function (PL-ERF) is defined to handle fuzzy evaluations and social networks, along with its operational rules. We describe the configuration of SNLSDM with PL-ERFs. Subsequently, the hybrid attribute analysis is conducted to process the initial trust social network. A new reliability-based trust propagation method is designed to construct a complete trust social network. By combining trust and similarity information, a compatibility network is established. Accordingly, we develop reliability-driven joint clustering algorithms that consider multiple constraints, including similarity, trust, and compatibility. We also discuss the time complexity analysis and scalability of the algorithms. Finally, a numerical experiment and two real-word cases studies illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the algorithms. A comparative analysis highlights the impact and advantages of incorporating reliability into clustering.},

To address this issue, this study explores link prediction methods for weighted/unweighted and attributed/non-attributed networks. A novel node similarity is introduced, which comprehensively considers multiple factors. Based on structural information, attribute information, and weight information, a general link prediction framework is proposed for four different network types. This framework contains three core modules: a structural similarity module, an attribute similarity module, and a weighted similarity module. Using these modules, four global similarity measurements are defined for different network types. Taking weighted and attributed networks as an example, a link prediction algorithm is designed, and three key parameters are analyzed. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, experiments are conducted on four types of real-world network datasets.

  abstract     = {Partial label learning is a weakly supervised framework in which each training sample is associated with a set of candidate labels, but only one among them is the true label. Feature selection is a technique for enhancing the ability of learning models to generalize effectively. However, a challenging problem in feature selection for partial label learning is the impact of ambiguous candidate labels. To address this, this paper proposes a granular ball-based partial label feature selection method via fuzzy correlation and redundancy. Firstly, the paper utilizes granular ball computing to obtain two granular ball sets that respectively reflect the supervision information from candidate and non-candidate labels. The relative density between two granular ball sets is used to obtain labeling confidence which can identify the ground-truth labels. Then, a novel fuzzy entropy is defined by combining consistency in the granular ball with fuzzy information entropy. Additionally, fuzzy mutual information is derived by considering the fuzzy entropy and the fuzzy similarity constrained by granular ball radius. Fuzzy correlation and redundancy is measured by granular ball-based fuzzy mutual information. A heuristic search strategy is used to rank the features according to the principle of maximizing relevance and minimizing redundancy. Finally, experimental results on five real-world datasets and eight controlled UCI datasets show that the proposed method obtains superior performance than other compared methods.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposed a travel plan recommendation system that can provide multi-modal, personalized, and door-to-door travel plans to solve travelers’ difficulty in choosing when facing vast and complex travel information. First, we established a dynamic T ravel C hoice B ehavior G raph (TCBG) model, which considers the travel plan candidate set and the temporal characteristics (time-decay and periodicity) of travelers’ behavioral preferences. Next, to effectively learn from TCBG, we constructed a U nified C andidate S et R epresentation M odule (UCSRM) and a new graph neural network called C ontinuous D ynamic H eterogeneous Graph A ttention N etworks (CDHAN). UCSRM can employ a multi-head self-attention mechanism for a unified representation of travel plan candidate sets with inconsistent lengths. CDHAN can capture the temporal characteristics of travelers’ preferences by combining the improved Hawkes process. Finally, we validated the effectiveness of the model and framework on multi-modal travel datasets and achieved 0.8172, 0.7994, 0.7859, and 0.9345 on the evaluation metrics of Pre, Rec, F1, and NDCG, respectively. These results show that our model/framework outperforms six existing state-of-the-art models/frameworks in these four evaluation metrics. This study provided a new model and learning framework for travel plan recommendation systems, essential for improving the efficiency of urban transportation and travelers’ travel experience.},

Various SMs have been developed using type-1 and type-2 fuzzy sets (FSs) to perform the comparison of fuzzy sets in different applications. In this paper, a similarity measure for interval type-3 fuzzy sets (IT3FS) is introduced. Using IT3FSs, three set-theoretic and proximity-based SMs are proposed. These SMs are determined using α-levels on type-3 fuzzy sets (T3FSs). The employed IT3FSs are represented using Gaussians with uncertain widths and uncertain centers. The proposed SMs are used to evaluate the similarity of these fuzzy sets. The experiments are conducted, and the degrees of similarities for IT3FSs are determined. A comparison of the proposed SMs reveals that two of them exhibit a high correlation, while the third produces slightly different results. The SMs are tested in differentiating the linguistic values.},

One of the primary threats to recommendation systems is shilling attacks, which pose great challenges in handling various types of huge-volume data with anomaly detection techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel anomaly detection framework named LTHiForest with the use of the learning to hash based isolation forest. Then, we instantiate the generic framework with one concrete hashing mechanism, extended order preserving hashing, to illustrate the stages of our framework and verify its effectiveness in detecting various anomalies. The core idea of this instantiation is to learn from data to construct a better isolation forest structure than the state-of-the-art methods like iForest and LSHiForest, which can achieve robust detection of various anomaly types. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our framework for recommendation systems.},

Although Competitive swarm optimizer (CSO) is an effective method, some shortcomings still exist when handling LSOPs, such as premature convergence. Therefore, a novel multiple level CSO with dual evaluation criteria and global optimization (DEGMCSO) is proposed to seek optimal solutions of LSOPs. In this paper, dual evaluation criteria are inserted into the multiple comparison process of the losers and winners to assist the algorithm retain more high quality particles with the potential. In addition to fitness values, adaptive selection weight fitness-distance is designed as the other criterion for selecting winners and losers according to different optimization problems. Meanwhile, a simple global optimal modification strategy is employed to get high quality global best solution. By CEC2010 and CEC2013 function suits, the results indicate DEGMCSO outperforms some popular algorithms. Finally, DEGMCSO is applied to feather selection problems of high dimension classification in the real world. The simulation results show that compared with the original CSO algorithm, DEGMCSO can find the solution of 16 functions on CEC2010 test function set which is obviously better than the CSO algorithm.},

For the sake of finding the best stabilization effect among all the classifications, a convex optimization problem is developed, whose global solution is proved to be existent and can be computed by an augmented Lagrangian function. More importantly, in order to further reduce the computation complexity but retaining a better performance as much as possible, a novelly improved hill-climbing algorithm is established by applying the Q-learning technique to provide an optimal attenuation coefficient.

  abstract     = {Ordinal regression deals with the classification problems that the classes are ranked in order. The majority of existing ordinal regression approaches are designed for single-view data, and only a little work is done on multi-view ordinal regression. However, these multi-view ordinal regression works mainly concentrate on the consensus information between different views, while the complementary information that is critical in multi-view learning is not adequately considered in learning the ordinal regression classifier. In this paper, we put forward the multi-view ordinal regression model that incorporates feature augmentation and privileged information learning (MORFP). Firstly, distinguished from the existing multi-view ordinal regression approaches that mainly embody the consensus principle, MORFP introduces the concept of privileged information learning and implements both the consensus and complementarity principles. Based on the concept of privileged information learning, we treat one view as the privileged information of another view, so that different views can supply complementary information to enhance each other. Secondly, considering that the distributions of data in distinct views may be are greatly different, we map those views to a common subspace and augment this subspace by incorporating the original features of each view. By combining the original features in the views and projected features in the common subspace, the learned ordinal regression classifier is expected to have better discriminative ability than that learned on only the projected features or the original features. Lastly, we employ a heuristic framework to resolve the learning problem of MORFP, which trains the multi-view ordinal regression classifier and optimizes the projection matrices alternately. Numerical studies on real-life datasets have demonstrated that MORFP performs explicitly better than the existing multi-view ordinal regression approaches.},

End-to-end methods learn the node representations while classifying the nodes in OCL process.

This paper presents O ne-c L ass G raph A utoencoder (OLGA), a new OCL for GNN approach. OLGA is an end-to-end method that learns low-dimensional representations for nodes while encapsulating interest nodes through a proposed and new hypersphere loss function. Furthermore, OLGA combines this new hypersphere loss with the graph autoencoder reconstruction loss to improve model learning. The reconstruction loss is a constraint to the sole use of the hypersphere loss that can bias the model to encapsulate all nodes. Finally, our low-dimensional representation makes the OLGA interpretable since we can visualize the representation learning at each epoch. OLGA achieved state-of-the-art results and outperformed six other methods with statistical significance while maintaining the learning process interpretability with its low-dimensional representations.},

Unlike the traditional mechanism of correcting unknown faded neighborhood information by estimating the statistical characteristics of random fading variables, we introduce test signals to correct the trajectory signals of each agent. As no estimation mechanism is involved, the storage and computational burden of the whole system are greatly reduced. Based on a classic distributed structure and a novel correction mechanism, two novel distributed learning consensus control schemes are constructed. The consensus results of multi-agent systems under the two learning control schemes are discussed in detail using mathematical analysis tools.

  abstract     = {Web services have been prevalently applied in many software development scenarios such as the development of many applications in the cloud, mobile networks, and Web. But Web services usually suffer from the serious issue of single functionality; thus in recent years, compositions of Web services, i.e., mashups, have become a popular choice, and have brought significant convenience in providing more comprehensive functionalities. But the diversity and number of Web services are expanding dramatically, resulting in an intractable challenge: how to effectively recommend Web services for mashup development. Researchers have proposed several recommendation approaches, but existing solutions are primarily applicable in a one-shot paradigm, which may introduce biases and usually lack explainability. In real-world scenarios, developers usually need to incorporate new Web services to address emerging challenges, implying that the development paradigm could be interactive. Moreover, existing approaches are prone to produce mediocre accuracy. To solve these issues, in this paper, we develop an innovative Multimodal Features-based Unbiased (MMFU) service recommendation framework for interactive mashup development, which takes full advantage of the multimodal features involved in the development procedure. Our MMFU framework encompasses two separate models developed to learn deep features from both text and graph structural information, and contains a feature fusion mechanism. Extensive experiments were performed on two real-world datasets, and the results revealed that the MMFU framework outperforms the compared existing state-of-the-art approaches, and has high explainability and the ability to counteract biases.},

H3WDF employs a three-tier decision-making process, achieving global coordination through selective aggregation of localized decisions while establishing a balance between efficiency and quality of service. Results of experimental evaluation in a heterogeneous environment comprising several GPUs demonstrate the superior performance of H3WDF across multiple metrics. For “large language model” workloads, H3WDF achieves remarkable prediction accuracy both for short- and long-term forecasts. H3WDF&#39;s three-way decision mechanism effectively distributes workloads, balancing between batched executions for training tasks and immediate executions for inference workloads. Resource utilization exhibits significant improvements across all GPU types, with particularly strong performance in the case of high-end GPUs. Compared with the state-of-the-art baselines, H3WDF substantially reduces job completion times, enhances energy efficiency, and consistently maintains high fairness in resource allocation.},

  abstract     = {Brain tumors are among the most prevalent and deadly diseases worldwide, making early diagnosis critical. However, existing automated brain tumor diagnostic methods often lack interpretability, and the high cost of labeled data limits their effectiveness. Class activation mapping (CAM) provides visual explanations and object localization for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by highlighting regions of interest corresponding to specific classes. However, existing approaches tend to focus solely on discriminative regions and often contain excessive noise. In this paper, we propose a simpler and more efficient method called PCG-CAM, which provides visual explanations for brain tumor diagnosis and generates fine-grained pseudo-labels. PCG-CAM extracts the principal components of gradients and uses their absolute values as weights for the feature maps, thereby better reflecting the importance of each feature map while preserving more object features. We evaluated the saliency maps generated by PCG-CAM on weakly-supervised brain tumor segmentation and assessed their generalizability in object localization tasks. Specifically, our method achieves 47.42% mIoU in weakly-supervised brain tumor segmentation, outperforming other methods by nearly 10% on average. The results on brain MRI and natural images demonstrate that our method effectively localizes target positions and provides robust explanations for model decisions.},

  abstract     = {Container-based cloud computing requires efficient and adaptive resource management, particularly when making vertical scaling decisions. Traditional approaches often struggle with workload variability and lack flexibility when faced with uncertainties in workload patterns. This paper introduces a novel three-way decision-based reinforcement learning (TWD-RL) model for container vertical scaling. The TWD-RL model partitions the state space into positive, boundary, and negative regions based on confidence measures derived from historical data and current system states. This partitioning enables more nuanced scaling decisions: immediate scaling in high-confidence states, deferring decisions in uncertain states, and exploring in low-confidence states. We provide a theoretical analysis of the model&#39;s convergence properties and optimality conditions, thus establishing its mathematical foundation. Furthermore, we evaluate our model using real-world workload data from the Google Cloud Platform. The results demonstrate that TWD-RL significantly outperforms traditional Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) approaches with respect to average response time, Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations, and resource utilization efficiency.},

We define initial-minimal and initial-maximal neighborhoods and develop eight types of rough approximations ( I ȷ -approximations) that generalize Pawlak&#39;s theory.

Furthermore, we implement Generalized Nano-topological frameworks in conjunction with our novel methodologies to address clinical applications, particularly focusing on advancing diagnostic strategies for Covid-19. By employing a universal binary relation, we clarify the effectiveness for our methodology per enhancing decision-making processes and pinpointing significant risk factors associated with Covid-19.

  abstract     = {The futures portfolio is a key tool for addressing market volatility and complexity in the financial markets. Traditional static strategies struggle to keep up with the rapidly shifting market sentiment and herd behavior, leading to delayed decision-making and risk management failures. To enhance investment efficiency and improve risk control, we propose a dynamic multi-criteria nested sequential three-state three-way decision (TS3WD) model based on herd behavior to identify and implement herd behaviors and optimize the futures portfolio strategy. Firstly, this paper proposes a method for determining optimistic and pessimistic conditional probabilities based on loss functions, deriving new TS3WD and simplified decision rules. Secondly, the herd behavior discrimination method is introduced to divide it into positive, neutral, and negative herd behaviors for holding futures contracts. Thirdly, four minimum adjustment optimization models for positive and negative herd behaviors under optimistic and pessimistic attitudes are constructed based on new decision rules, respectively, and a method based on the self-confidence principle for neutral herd behavior is presented, providing a quantitative model for implementing herd behaviors. Subsequently, a progressive dynamic algorithm based on a multi-criteria nested sequential TS3WD model is proposed to deduce the futures portfolio strategy, which dynamically identifies and adjusts loss functions to obtain the optimal futures investment behavior, forming a complete futures portfolio strategy. Finally, we apply the proposed method to solve the metal futures portfolio strategy in the Shanghai Futures Exchange, providing implications for investors in the futures market through sensitivity and comparative analyses.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning techniques have been widely applied for industrial quality prediction. However, industrial process data are often generated as data streams, which typically exhibit characteristics such as strong nonlinearity, time-varying behavior, and low sampling rates of quality variables. Conventional offline-trained deep learning models often fail to provide accurate predictions for such semi-supervised data streams. Therefore, a quality-relevant deep rule-based system with complementary lifelong learning (QDRSCLL) is proposed to enable adaptive prediction of critical quality variables in streaming data environments. QDRSCLL comprises a deep backbone network and a shallow predictor. The former utilizes a semi-supervised quality-relevant stacked autoencoder (SQSAE) for feature extraction, while the latter employs a hierarchical fuzzy rule system (HFRS) to perform fuzzy inference on hierarchical hidden features. Furthermore, a novel complementary lifelong learning mechanism is proposed to enable QDRSCLL with online incremental learning capabilities. Additionally, semi-supervised learning is integrated into the online learning process to further enhance its deep feature extraction capabilities and the prediction performance. The feasibility and superiority of the proposed method are demonstrated through two real-world processes and four synthetic datasets. Compared to the traditional evolving fuzzy system (EFS), the RMSE of QDRSCLL is reduced by more than 25% in all application scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) records real-life events using timestamped facts and is used for the TKG link prediction task which is to answer an incomplete timestamped fact called the query. Existing works predict by learning entity embeddings where they represent entities with entity-related facts guided by queries to emphasize important ones. Although they generalize well, their learning with queries is limited since they guide learning with the average query which merges all queries without considering that queries in TKG represent diverse meanings. Merging diverse queries generates a vague averaged query which will mislead embedding learning and further confuse predictions. To resolve the limitation, we propose individual-query-guided learning (IndiQ) to learn clearer embeddings which faithfully realizes the nature of TKG that its records are diverse and should be modeled individually rather than averaging. Specifically, IndiQ formulates embedding learning as a weighted sum of entity-related facts and calculates weights using queries individually following the total probability theorem. Then, with the novel formulation, IndiQ guides the learning of entity embeddings using queries individually to identify important facts. Finally, IndiQ predicts future links using learned entity embeddings. Experimental results show that we achieve better performance. Visualizations further demonstrate the effectiveness of our IndiQ.},

This paper introduces a novel deep heterogeneous graph and reinforcement learning approach to address real-time challenges in a surface mount technology (SMT) workshop. The scheduling problem in SMT workshop can be modeled as a reconfigurable distributed flowshop group scheduling problem (RDFGSP), involving assignment of family operations to cells for their flows, sequencing of family operations on the cells, and sequencing of job operations in the family operations for their flows. By mapping the problem to a heterogeneous graph with distinct node and edge types, an end-to-end learning model is developed. The model integrates a heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) and sequential Q networks to effectively represent the key scheduling elements and the Markov decision-making process. HGNN is employed to extract meaningful features and representations from the heterogeneous graph. These representations are then fed into the sequential Q networks to select two cooperated actions to be taken. A weighted sum approach is proposed to provide more reasonable evaluation of the selected actions. Experimental comparisons with exact and heuristic methods from the literature demonstrate the superior performance and effectiveness of the proposed model.},

Thus, they tend to intuitively prefer alternatives that excel in several important criteria. If one alternative’s score is comparable to others, they might consider secondary and tertiary important criteria. The proposed maximin approach aligns more closely with this philosophy compared to previous methods that aim to evenly distribute operator weights. Furthermore, we derive a closed-form solution for the maximin OWA operator weights using results from convex analysis. We also revisit the minimax disparity model, which is similar to our maximin approach, to emphasize the similarities and differences between the two methods.},

Module 2 designs two improved collaborative filtering algorithms to alleviate data sparsity of intuitionistic fuzzy music taste matrix. Module 3 extracts taste features from user listening behavior and the favorite songs of users. Module 4 integrates subjective and objective music emotions to obtain the comprehensive music emotions of user. Considering the dynamic change in users’ music taste features, we incorporate the latest taste features in Module 5 to reorder the song list obtained by the above four modules.
