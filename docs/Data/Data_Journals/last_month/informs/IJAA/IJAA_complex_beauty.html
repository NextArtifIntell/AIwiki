  abstract = {In the Netherlands, 200,000 elderly and disabled citizens annually use subsidized taxi rides executed by Transvision. The day-to-day planning of up to 15,000 long-distance rides was previously a complex and daunting task split over dozens of subcontractors. Transvision, CQM, and Geodan developed an optimization solution that combines the rides into efficient taxi routes. Starting in January 2020, this solution significantly improved the mobility challenge for elderly and disabled citizens, including (1) increased punctuality and a 50% improvement in passenger satisfaction, (2) savings of 15 million driving kilometers per year, and (3) combined financial savings for all stakeholders of 60 million euros over the years 2019 to 2023 and another total of 30 million euros projected for 2024 and 2025, according to conservative estimates. Daily planning in a single batch can range from 1,000 to 15,000 rides. To construct high-quality ride plans in reasonable time for this massive-scale operations research problem, we applied classical operations research techniques viewed through a modern lens. In this paper, we explain how practical large-scale dial-a-ride problems can be solved using high-quality heuristics that exploit the power of parallel processing. Furthermore, we present new and efficient techniques to perform the required millions to billions of calculations to determine distances and driving times on the Dutch road network. We overcome several practical challenges such as (1) aligning the interests of a vulnerable passenger group and over 60 different taxi operators, (2) aligning the software that interfaces with the various companies, and (3) adapting to changing regulations and ad hoc COVID-19 measures.},

  abstract = {In steel manufacturing, continuous annealing is a crucial heat treatment applied to cold-rolled steel strips to achieve a prescribed temperature, which will ensure quality in terms of mechanical properties. However, controlling this process is challenging because of slow furnace temperature dynamics, significant time delays, frequent changes in the steel mass flow rate, target annealing temperature changes induced by steel grade transitions, and multivariable interactions within the furnace zones. To address these challenges, Tata Steel, India, with consultancy support from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, developed a novel model predictive control (MPC) technology-based solution for a continuous annealing furnace, which produces automotive grade steels. The dynamic model was developed using data from both perturbation trials and scraping historical processes. We then converted the model to a discrete-time state-space form and used it to formulate an optimal control problem over a moving time window. The solution generates optimal furnace setpoints by solving this finite-horizon optimal control problem each minute, ensuring smooth temperature transitions during steel grade changes while avoiding operational constraint violations. Tata Steel successfully implemented an MPC-based real-time supervisory optimal control solution, which became fully operational in January 2023. The implementation of the solution has led to a significant improvement in the proportion of annealed products meeting the premium quality band (±5°C of the target temperature), increasing from 30% (manually operated) to 50% (MPC operated), thereby ensuring better uniformity of properties. Furthermore, an 8% reduction in products outside the widest band (±15°C) has prevented the reprocessing of 13,000 tons of material from one line alone, annually. We have seen a consistent 8% reduction in specific fuel consumption per ton of steel. When considering Tata Steel’s current installations and those under commissioning, these improvements translate to savings of US$2.5 million and a reduction of 10,000 tons of CO 2 emissions annually.},

  abstract = {The supply chain network design (SCND) problem is a typical optimization problem that determines the structure of a supply chain and affects its costs and operational performance. SCND deals with various decisions, such as determining the number, size, and location of facilities and the optimal material and product flows of the entire supply chain network. Therefore, SCND is one of the most crucial planning problems in supply chain management. In this paper, we present a practical approach in which we adopt a mixed-integer programming (MIP) mathematical model to solve a real industry SCND problem for McDonald’s China. As a result of this project, McDonald’s China has saved millions of dollars in logistics costs and reduced CO 2 emissions by more than 10%. In our approach, size-reduction techniques were successfully applied to deal with a large-scale model, making it possible to analyze hundreds of scenarios before coming to a consensus.},

  abstract = {As a subsidiary of the ALDI SOUTH Group, ALDI SÜD Germany launched the data-driven special buys project in response to pandemic-related supply chain disruptions, market shifts, and growing competition. This initiative combines advanced analytics and operations research with employee engagement to optimize product life cycles of special buys products. The solution components include (1) multiperiod mixed-integer optimization (MIP) models for product order decisions to warehouses; (2) XGBoost classification for store product allocation (SAM); (3) a proprietary algorithm (ANA) for just-in-time reallocations between stores; (4) a multiperiod dynamic programming model (DAVE) developed in 2021 for nationwide inventory clearance; (5) an advanced version for inventory clearance, the DAVE stochastic dynamic programming model (DAVE SDP), introduced in 2023; (6) a multivariate regression model for budget allocations for markdowns on small product leftover quantities for incorporating store employee involvement; and (7) a smartphone application (Market-Whispering) to engage 50,000 employees in product selection. This paper focuses on the MIP, which optimizes the decision on stock order quantities to warehouses. We examine this in conjunction with ANA and DAVE because of their significant influence on operational efficiency. For DAVE, we examine two variants: the reference model DAVE and DAVE SDP. The project faced coordination challenges and required a strategic shift from decentralized to centralized approaches. Proprietary software for the special buys product range improved operational efficiency, positively impacting the daily operations of 40,000 store employees, and led to annual savings of several million euros in Germany.},

Molslinjen partnered with Halfspace, a data, analytics, and artificial intelligence (AI) company based in Copenhagen, Denmark, to support that transition. Halfspace and Molslinjen jointly developed and deployed a successful forecasting and revenue management toolbox for the data-driven operation of ferries in Denmark since 2020. This has resulted in $2.6–3.2 million yearly savings (and a total of $5 million savings as of December 2023), a significant reduction in the number of delayed departures and average delays, and a 3% reduction in fuel costs and emissions. This toolbox relies on some of the latest advances in machine learning for forecasting and in analytics approaches to revenue management. The potential for generalizing our toolbox to the global ferry industry is significant, with an impact on both revenues and environmental, societal, and governance criteria.},
