  abstract     = {I use an important ruling, Marblegate Asset Management v. Education Management Corporation (EMC), to study the economic role of two publicly traded debt restructuring methods: coercive bond exchange offers and Chapter 11. This ruling restricted firms from employing coercive bond exchange offers to facilitate out-of-court restructurings, thereby increasing the likelihood of restructuring publicly traded debt under Chapter 11. Following the ruling, investment in affected distressed firms decreased substantially, but investment efficiency improved. The changes in covenant, maturity, and offering yield of newly issued bonds suggested that existing bondholders with covenants gained more bargaining power than shareholders and new bondholders. The paper provides causal evidence from a large sample analysis, demonstrating the divergent effects of these two publicly traded debt restructuring methods on investment policies.

  abstract     = {We study the asset pricing implications of being able to optimally early exercise plain vanilla puts, contrasting expected raw and delta-hedged returns across equivalent American and European puts. Our theory suggests that American puts yield less negative raw but more negative delta-hedged expected returns than equivalent European puts. The raw (delta-hedged) spread widens with a higher early exercise probability as induced through, for example, moneyness, time to maturity, and underlying asset volatility (variance and jump risk premiums). An empirical comparison of single-stock American puts with equivalent synthetic European puts formed from put–call parity supports our theory if and only if we allow for optimal early exercises in our return calculations. More strikingly, allowing for optimal early exercises significantly alters the profitability of 14 out of 15 well-known option anomalies with the average absolute change equal to 33% and five anomalies becoming insignificant.

  abstract     = {We build a risk management model that incorporates variable capital utilization and time-varying collateral capacity. The former lets firms optimally choose capital utilization, and hence production, which affects capital depreciation and risk exposure. The latter means firms’ ability to borrow and hedge increases with expected earnings and thus utilization. Calibrated solutions show both ingredients matter for firm value. We test the novel model predictions using a new data set of oil and gas producers. Consistent with model predictions, we find utilization is negatively correlated with firm liquidity, while hedging is positively correlated with liquidity and expected profitability.

  abstract     = {High-dimensional weakly coupled Markov decision processes (WDPs) arise in dynamic decision making and reinforcement learning, decomposing into smaller Markov decision processes (MDPs) when linking constraints are relaxed. The Lagrangian relaxation of WDPs (LAG) exploits this property to compute policies and (optimistic) bounds efficiently; however, dualizing linking constraints averages away combinatorial information. We introduce feasibility network relaxations (FNRs), a new class of linear programming relaxations that exactly represents the linking constraints. We develop a procedure to obtain the unique minimally sized relaxation, which we refer to as self-adapting FNR, as its size automatically adjusts to the structure of the linking constraints. Our analysis informs model selection: (i) the self-adapting FNR provides (weakly) stronger bounds than LAG, is polynomially sized when linking constraints admit a tractable network representation, and can even be smaller than LAG, and (ii) self-adapting FNR provides bounds and policies that match the approximate linear programming (ALP) approach but is substantially smaller in size than the ALP formulation and a recent alternative Lagrangian that is equivalent to ALP. We perform numerical experiments on constrained dynamic assortment and preemptive maintenance applications. Our results show that self-adapting FNR significantly improves upon LAG in terms of policy performance and/or bounds, while being an order of magnitude faster than an alternative Lagrangian and ALP, which are unsolvable in several instances.

  abstract     = {The transition from a traditional manufacturing-based economy to a knowledge- and service-based economy over recent decades resulted in a considerable rise in intangible capital, most of which is not reported on companies’ balance sheets. As a result, balance sheet-based valuation ratios, investment measures, and other firm characteristics that do not incorporate off-balance sheet (OBS) intangible capital suffer from significant measurement error problems. We incorporate a new measure of OBS intangible capital into firm characteristics, such as book to market, investment, and profitability, to address these measurement errors. These OBS intangible adjustments improve the performance of the Fama–French three- and five-factor models and the q -factor model, especially during recent decades. We further find that the value factor is no longer redundant in these empirical factor models. This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.

  abstract     = {Detours are considered key for the efficient operation of a shared rides service, but they are also a major pain point for consumers of such services. This paper studies the relationship between the value generated by shared rides and the detours they create for riders. We establish a limit on the sum of value and detour, and we prove that this leads to a tight bound on the Pareto frontier of values and detours in a general setting with an arbitrary number of requests. We explicitly compute the Pareto frontier for one family of city topologies and construct it via simulation for several more networks, including one based on ride-sharing data from commute hours in Manhattan. We find that average detours are usually small, even in low-demand-density settings. We also find that by carefully choosing the match objective, detours can be reduced with a relatively small impact on values and that the density of ride requests is far more important than detours for the effective operations of a shared rides service. In response, we propose that platforms implement a two-product version of shared rides and limit the worst-case detours of its users. This paper was accepted by Hamid Nazerzadeh, data science.

However, obtaining accurate valuation estimates of reorganized firms is challenging because of limited firm-specific market-based information and the oft-conflicting incentives of claimholders. We examine the role of industry peer information in reducing misvaluations and its implications for unintended interclaimant wealth transfers and postreorganization performance. First, we find that the availability of relevant industry peer information is negatively associated with equity valuation errors for firms emerging from Chapter 11. Cross-sectional results suggest that the relation between industry peer information and valuation errors varies substantially with debtors’ information environment and case characteristics. Second, we find that industry peer information quality is associated with better ex post financial performance of emerged firms because of lower overvaluation. Finally, we document the role of industry peer information in substantially reducing the frequency and magnitude of unintended wealth transfers between claimants arising from equity valuation errors.

  abstract     = {This study examines the effect of firms’ participation in platform-endorsed review solicitation programs on consumers’ online review generation. We leverage a natural experiment on TripAdvisor, which launched a review solicitation program that allows hotels to collect reviews directly from guests after their stays with the aid of certified connectivity partners. Applying a two-stage difference-in-differences approach to a panel data set of online reviews for a matched set of hotels across TripAdvisor and Expedia, we find that hotels’ participation in the review solicitation program results in a 34.3% increase in review volume, a 0.151 increase in review rating, but a 16.9% decrease in review length. Review solicitation, however, generates a notable negative spillover effect on the volume of organic reviews. Specifically, the volume of organic reviews is reduced by 15.5% after hotels start soliciting reviews. We provide evidence that the motivational crowding-out effect plays an important role in driving this negative spillover. Further analyses reveal that the effects of review solicitation are heterogeneous with respect to hotels of different types and consumers with different demographic and behavioral characteristics. Finally, using a novel structural topic model, we detect a significant shift in review content from specific and concrete topics to general and abstract topics. Our findings suggest that review platforms and firms should be cautious about the unintended negative consequences of review solicitation on consumers’ review generation.

Specifically, new technologies, such as application programming interface (API), deliver high-volume, institutional-like raw data directly to Main Street investors. Although greater availability of information can be beneficial, it may also exacerbate retail investors’ existing trading deficiencies. Exploiting the sudden shutdown of Yahoo! Finance API, the largest free API for retail investors, this study examines how access to tech-enabled raw financial data affects retail investment. We find that retail trading volumes in stocks favored by active retail investors dropped by 8.6%–10.5% within one month of the API shutdown. The remaining retail trades collectively became more predictive of future returns, suggesting less gambling-like behavior after the API shutdown. Moreover, our randomized controlled experiment affirms the underlying mechanism: tech-enabled access to high-volume historical price data increases individuals’ overconfidence, which further leads them to engage in excessive trading.

Meanwhile, high macro-beta funds deliver higher returns than low macro-beta funds following a low-sentiment period, whereas the risk-return relation is flat following a high-sentiment period. We show that the sophisticated management of hedge funds explains this pattern. The relation between funds’ macro-risk betas and the timing abilities/investor flows is sentiment dependent, and such variation likely drives the contrasting beta-return trade-offs after high- and low-sentiment periods.

Using a hiring experiment, we rule out taste-based discrimination by design and test for the presence of two types of belief-based gender discrimination. We document evidence of explicit discriminators —individuals who are willing to discriminate even when their hiring choices are highly revealing of their gender-biased beliefs. Crucially, we also identify implicit discriminators —individuals who do not discriminate against women when taking a discriminatory action is highly revealing of their biased beliefs, but do discriminate against women when their biased motive is obscured. Our analysis highlights the central role played by features of the choice environment in determining whether and how discrimination will manifest.

  abstract     = {We examine a beauty contest game with an option to analyze an additional disclosure. We analytically prove that in some scenarios, coordination incentives cause sophisticated players who can comprehend disclosures to choose not to analyze them to match unsophisticated players’ actions, a phenomenon we call “coordinated inattention.” Laboratory experiments provide support for the coordinated inattention mechanism: Coordination incentives reduce sophisticated subjects’ propensity to analyze disclosures, especially when they believe others are unlikely to comprehend them. We further find that psychological biases help reduce coordinated inattention. Subjects are overconfident, sophisticated subjects overestimate others’ ability to comprehend disclosures, and both biases are associated with a higher tendency to analyze disclosures. Our analysis suggests that unsophisticated decision makers’ inability to comprehend complex disclosures has a negative spillover effect by reducing sophisticated decision makers’ attention to disclosures. Our results highlight the importance of the recent efforts of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) to make disclosures easier to comprehend.

  abstract     = {We consider model-free reinforcement learning (RL) in nonstationary Markov decision processes. Both the reward functions and the state transition functions are allowed to vary arbitrarily over time as long as their cumulative variations do not exceed certain variation budgets. We propose Restarted Q-Learning with Upper Confidence Bounds (RestartQ-UCB), the first model-free algorithm for nonstationary RL, and show that it outperforms existing solutions in terms of dynamic regret. Specifically, RestartQ-UCB with Freedman-type bonus terms achieves a dynamic regret bound of O ˜ ( S 1 3 A 1 3 Δ 1 3 H T 2 3 ) , where S and A are the numbers of states and actions, respectively, Δ &gt; 0 is the variation budget, H is the number of time steps per episode, and T is the total number of time steps. We further present a parameter-free algorithm named Double-Restart Q-UCB that does not require prior knowledge of the variation budget. We show that our algorithms are nearly optimal by establishing an information-theoretical lower bound of Ω ( S 1 3 A 1 3 Δ 1 3 H 2 3 T 2 3 ) , the first lower bound in nonstationary RL. Numerical experiments validate the advantages of RestartQ-UCB in terms of both cumulative rewards and computational efficiency. We demonstrate the power of our results in examples of multiagent RL and inventory control across related products. This paper was accepted by Omar Besbes, revenue management and market analytics.

We study this question in the context of increasing workers’ performance via targeted incentives using machine learning algorithms with worker demographics, personality traits, and preferences as input. Running two large-scale experiments, we show that (i) performance can be predicted by accurately measured worker characteristics, (ii) a machine learning algorithm can detect heterogeneity in responses to different schemes, (iii) a targeted assignment of schemes to individuals increases performance significantly above the level of the single best scheme, and (iv) algorithmic assignment is more effective for workers who have a high likelihood to repeatedly interact with the employer or who provide more consistent survey answers.

  abstract     = {Crowdsourcing platforms typically take a passive approach, and they let the competing firms freely design their own contests and allow every solver to self-select and join any of the concurrently running contests. In a model of competing noise-driven contests, we show that the duopoly prize allocation has fewer (but larger) prizes compared with a monopolist contest designer. We also find that contests with firm-chosen budgets and solvers’ endogenous participation create coordination inefficiencies. Thus, platform policies that constrain the competing firms from freely choosing their budgets and offer solvers non-enforceable recommendations toward specific noise-driven contests strictly enhance total welfare. Extending our framework to include arbitrarily correlated ability-driven contests, we highlight the critical role of inter-contest dependence on the efficacy of a platform’s interventions. Specifically, platform nudges to improve solver-contest (mis)matches are welfare enhancing only when the contests are sufficiently related, and allowing solvers to self-sort is appropriate otherwise.

  abstract     = {Two events, with major implications for U.S. voters, occur after each decennial census. First, congressional “apportionment” takes place, followed by congressional “districting.” Apportionment determines how to allocate the 435 seats in the House of Representatives across the 50 states, whereas districting determines the geographic boundaries assigned to representatives within each state. Although districting and the practice of gerrymandering often receive great attention in the media and courts, the best way to apportion representatives across states has been debated for nearly 250 years. Historical methods (including the current method) each satisfy some desirable optimality criteria that the others are not guaranteed to satisfy. Moreover, none are guaranteed to optimize certain reasonable fairness measures (e.g., minimum range, minimum bias). To our knowledge, we are the first to formulate and analyze a multiobjective optimization approach to apportionment, allowing policymakers to identify Pareto-optimal allocations and quantify their trade-offs between several competing criteria. Some of these models can be formulated and solved as mixed-integer linear programs, whereas others require the solution of mixed-integer, nonconvex, quadratically constrained quadratic programs. We take advantage of recent software advances that allow one to solve these problems with optimality guarantees. Policy implications of our work include Pareto curves from historical censuses and simulations, which suggest opportunities for improvement in some objectives at little sacrifice to others.

These economically significant effects suggest that through advertising, targets increase their profile and negotiating power. Further, targets that advertise are more likely to initiate their takeovers, attract multiple bidders, receive enhanced bids, capture more merger rents, and even in failed acquisitions, experience a 1% permanent revaluation. The latter result differentiates between information asymmetry and behavioral explanations for the target advertising.

Specifically, the donor priority rule grants higher priority on the organ waiting list to those who have previously registered as donors. The dual-incentive priority rules allocate organs based on donor status, followed by individual valuations within the same donor status, or vice versa. Both theoretical and experimental results suggest that the efficacy of the donor priority rule and the dual-incentive priority rules critically depends on the information environment. When organ transplantation valuations are unobservable prior to making donation decisions, the hybrid dual-incentive rules generate higher donation rates. In contrast, if valuations are observable, the dual-incentive priority rules create unbalanced incentives between high- and low-value agents, potentially undermining the efficacy of the hybrid dual-incentive rules in increasing overall donation rates.

Controlling for bidder composition, the common component of acquirer returns has increased by five percentage points relative to the 1980s.

  abstract     = {Through a large-scale field experiment with 393,036 customers considering opening a credit card account with a nationwide retail bank, we investigate how providing transparency into an offering’s tradeoffs affects subsequent rates of customer acquisition and long-run engagement. Although we find tradeoff transparency to have an insignificant effect on acquisition rates, customers who were shown each offering’s tradeoffs selected different products than those who were not. Moreover, prospective customers who experienced transparency and subsequently chose to open an account went on to exhibit higher-quality service relationships over time. Monthly spending was 9.9% higher and cancellation rates were 20.5% lower among those who experienced transparency into each offering’s tradeoffs. Increased product use and retention accrued disproportionately to customers with prior category experience: more-experienced customers who were provided transparency spent 19.2% more on a monthly basis and were 33.7% less likely to defect after nine months. Importantly, we find that these gains in engagement and retention do not come at the expense of customers’ financial well-being: the probability of making late payments was reduced among customers who experienced transparency. We further find that the positive effects of tradeoff transparency on engagement and retention were attenuated in the presence of a promotion that provided financial incentives to choose particular offerings. Taken together, these results suggest that providing transparency into an offering’s tradeoffs may be an effective strategy for informing customer choices, leading to better outcomes for customers and firms alike.

  abstract     = {We study the blocking effect of patents on follow-on innovation by others. We posit that follow-on innovation requires freedom to operate (FTO), which firms typically obtain through a license from the patentee holding the original innovation. Where licensing fails, follow-on innovation is blocked unless firms gain FTO through patent invalidation. Using large-scale data from post-grant oppositions at the European Patent Office, we find that patent invalidation increases follow-on innovation, measured in citations, by 16% on average. This effect exhibits a U-shape in the value of the original innovation. For patents on low-value original innovations, invalidation predominantly increases low-value follow-on innovation outside the patentee’s product market. Here, transaction costs likely exceed the joint surplus of licensing, causing licensing failure. In contrast, for patents on high-value original innovations, invalidation mainly increases high-value follow-on innovation in the patentee’s product market. We attribute this latter result to rent dissipation, which renders patentees unwilling to license out valuable technologies to (potential) competitors.

  abstract     = {Using an occupational probability of computerization, we measure a firm’s ability to replace labor with automated capital. Our evidence suggests that the potential to automate a workforce enhances operating flexibility, allowing firms to hold less precautionary cash. To provide evidence for this mechanism, we exploit the 2011–2012 Thailand hard drive crisis as an exogenous shock to the cost of automation. In addition, the negative relation between prospective automation and cash holdings is greater for firms with a lower expected cost of worker displacement and greater labor-induced operating leverage.

  abstract     = {We study whether banks internalize congestion externalities when lending to zombie firms. We conjecture that banks should be better informed about the presence of zombie firms and the congestion externalities that such firms exert on healthy borrowers in industries where banks are specialized and show that banks’ credit supply to zombie firms relates negatively to their industry specialization. This relation is stronger when congestion externalities are likely to have stronger adverse effects, namely when zombie firms take a higher fraction of resources in the industry or when the industry is geographically more concentrated. Additionally, this relation is weaker in industries with higher asset specificity as zombie firms’ default (and potential asset fire sales) could reduce healthy borrowers’ collateral value.

  abstract     = {Ranking and selection (R&amp;S) aims to select the best alternative with the largest mean performance from a finite set of alternatives. Recently, considerable attention has turned toward the large-scale R&amp;S problem which involves a large number of alternatives. Ideal large-scale R&amp;S procedures should be sample optimal; that is, the total sample size required to deliver an asymptotically nonzero probability of correct selection (PCS) grows at the minimal order (linear order) in the number of alternatives, k . Surprisingly, we discover that the naïve greedy procedure, which keeps sampling the alternative with the largest running average, performs strikingly well and appears sample optimal. To understand this discovery, we develop a new boundary-crossing perspective and prove that the greedy procedure is sample optimal for the scenarios where the best mean maintains at least a positive constant away from all other means as k increases. We further show that the derived PCS lower bound is asymptotically tight for the slippage configuration of means with a common variance. For other scenarios, we consider the probability of good selection and find that the result depends on the growth behavior of the number of good alternatives: if it remains bounded as k increases, the sample optimality still holds; otherwise, the result may change. Moreover, we propose the explore-first greedy procedures by adding an exploration phase to the greedy procedure. The procedures are proven to be sample optimal and consistent under the same assumptions. Last, we numerically investigate the performance of our greedy procedures in solving large-scale R&amp;S problems. This paper was accepted by Baris Ata, stochastic models and simulation.

  abstract     = {We examine the effect of trade secret protection laws on internal information integration (i.e., the extent to which economic agents are provided with access to decision-relevant information from other economic agents within a firm). We argue that stronger trade secret protection laws increase firms’ internal information integration because they reduce the proprietary costs of information leakage. To test our prediction, we measure a firm’s internal information integration by the share of its sites integrated into its enterprise management system. Exploiting the staggered adoption of trade secret protection laws via the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA), we find that these laws increase firms’ internal information integration. This effect is stronger (weaker) for firms with higher proprietary costs (coordination benefits). Further, we provide evidence that the UTSA-induced increase in internal information integration translates into improvements of firms’ internal information quality and decision-making quality. Taken together, our results enhance the understanding of the economic trade-offs shaping firms’ internal information environment. This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting. Funding: S.

  abstract     = {Firms with only one bank relationship make up the majority of firms in many economies. This paper explores whether policy-driven lending is differentially transmitted to single-bank firms in comparison with the multibank firms that are the focus of the literature. Using unique variation in the ECB’s very long-term refinancing operations (VLTROs), which affected lending to firms discontinuously across credit ratings but within banks, we find selective transmission of VLTRO liquidity to single-bank firms. Banks apply higher lending standards to single-bank firms, with banking relationships determining both new lending and lending maturity. By contrast, banks appear to transmit policy lending near-uniformly across multibank firms. This paper was accepted by David Sraer, finance.

  abstract     = {The topic of learning to solve optimization problems has received interest from both the operations research and machine learning communities. In this paper, we combine ideas from both fields to address the problem of learning to generate decisions to instances of optimization problems with potentially nonlinear or nonconvex constraints where the feasible set varies with contextual features. We propose a novel framework for training a generative model to produce provably optimal decisions by combining interior point methods and adversarial learning, which we further embed within an iterative data generation algorithm. To this end, we first train a classifier to learn feasibility and then train the generative model to produce optimal decisions to an optimization problem using the classifier as a regularizer. We prove that decisions generated by our model satisfy in-sample and out-of-sample optimality guarantees. Furthermore, the learning models are embedded in an active learning loop in which synthetic instances are iteratively added to the training data; this allows us to progressively generate provably tighter optimal decisions. We investigate case studies in portfolio optimization and personalized treatment design, demonstrating that our approach yields advantages over predict-then-optimize and supervised deep learning techniques, respectively. In particular, our framework is more robust to parameter estimation error compared with the predict-then-optimize paradigm and can better adapt to domain shift as compared with supervised learning models.

  abstract     = {This paper considers sensitivity analysis of the cost coefficients in multiobjective integer linear programming problems. We define the sensitivity region as the set of simultaneous changes to the coefficients for which the efficient set and its structure remain the same. In particular, we require that the component-wise relation between efficient solutions is preserved and that inefficient solutions remain inefficient, and we show that this is sufficient for the efficient set to be the same upon changes. For a single coefficient, we show that a subset of the inefficient solutions can be excluded from consideration. More specifically, we prove that it suffices to inspect the inefficient solutions of a q -objective problem that are efficient in one of two related q + 1-objective problems. Finally, we show that the sensitivity region is a convex set (an interval). Our approach generalizes to simultaneous changes in multiple coefficients. For illustration, we consider mean-variance capital budgeting and determine the region for which the set of efficient portfolios remains the same, despite a misspecification or a change in the net present values of the projects. Further computational experience with multiobjective binary and integer knapsack problems demonstrates the general applicability of our technique. For instance, we obtain all sensitivity intervals for changes to single coefficients of biobjective problems with 500 binary variables in less than half an hour of CPU time by excluding a large number of inefficient solutions. In fact, the number of excluded solutions is above 100 orders of magnitude larger than the number of remaining solutions. This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.

  abstract     = {We investigate a bargaining setting between an “informed” player, who has private information, and an “uninformed” player. The informed player has the option to truthfully disclose private information in two unique environments. In the first environment, the informed player is randomly matched with an uninformed player and, after matching, can voluntarily disclose private information prior to a negotiation taking place. In the second environment, the informed player can voluntarily disclose private information before any endogenous matching between players (and subsequent negotiation) takes place. We begin by examining these environments theoretically. When disclosure occurs after matching, we show that low informed types should disclose more often than high informed types to avoid disagreement. However, when disclosure occurs before matching, for a range of parameter values, we show that high informed types should disclose more than low informed types to secure a better match. We test these predictions in a controlled human-subjects experiment and verify many of the theoretical predictions. Among other results, we find that low informed types do indeed disclose their private information to avoid disagreement and that, when it is in their interest to do so, high informed types disclose their private information to secure a better match. Another key insight is that high uninformed types benefit from disclosure regardless of whether it occurs before or after matching.

  abstract     = {Government ownership of financial intermediaries is pervasive around the world. In this study, we examine the impact of common government ownership between the brokerage and listed firms on the information production role of brokerage firms. We show that affiliated analysts tend to issue more optimistic recommendations for stocks of firms controlled by the same government entity that controls their brokerage firms. This optimistic bias is particularly pronounced during periods of economic shocks. Our study demonstrates this by utilizing additional tariff impositions and tariff exemptions during the U.S.–China trade war as exogenous negative and positive shocks, respectively. Additionally, our study indicates that stocks recommended by politically affiliated analysts tend to underperform those recommended by independent analysts, implying that the optimism stems from conflicts of interest rather than superior information. Furthermore, our research highlights that sophisticated investors perceive the potential bias and incorporate it into their trading. Consistent with an exchange of favors story, politically affiliated brokerage firms receive a larger allocation during the issuance of local government debt, whereas governments subscribe for more shares during seasoned equity offerings by these affiliated brokerage firms.

  abstract     = {Standard search models assume that consumers actively decide on the order, identity, and number of products they search. We document that online, a large fraction of searches happen in a more passive manner, with consumers merely reacting to online advertisements that do not allow them to choose the timing or the identity of products to which they will be exposed. Using a clickstream panel data set capturing full URL addresses of websites that consumers visit, we show how to detect whether a click is ad initiated. We then report that in the apparel category, ad-initiated clicks account for more than half of all website arrivals, are more concentrated early on in the consumer search process, and lead to less in-depth searches and fewer transactions, consistent with the passive nature of these searches. To account for these systematic differences between active and passive searches, we propose and estimate a simple model that accommodates both types of searches. Our results show that incorrectly treating all searches as active inflates the estimated value of brands that advertise frequently. Our model can more accurately recover data patterns, especially for advertising brands. We finish with model extensions and a discussion of the managerial implications.

  abstract     = {Advances in information technology (IT) may affect the organizational design of production. Exploiting the rapid diffusion of the internet in the United States, we assess the sensitivity of production chain organization to this innovation in IT access and use. Extending theories of the firm that recognize the importance of downstream transfers (selling as opposed to sourcing) and plural governance in organizational design, we predict IT-driven shifts in downstream vertical integration. In a detailed panel of Census Bureau data for over 5,600 manufacturing plants, we observe the extent of a production unit’s downstream transactions within the firm alongside concurrent sales to external customers—a mix we refer to as plural selling . Our main finding is that the use of the internet for external coordination precipitated a significant decline in downstream vertical integration across the manufacturing sector. Instrumental variables estimation points to a causal relationship but also heterogeneous treatment effects. Key drivers of plural organization, such as complementarities and constraints across differently governed transactions, help explain such heterogeneity, as does concurrent use of internal production management IT. Our study is the first study to leverage a plural governance framework and large-scale microdata to understand how U.S. production chain organization shifted in response to this rapid and far-reaching technological change.

  abstract     = {In the classic Adwords problem introduced by [Mehta A, Saberi A, Vazirani U, Vazirani V (2007) Adwords and generalized online matching. J. ACM 54(5):22-es.], we have a bipartite graph between advertisers and queries. Each advertiser has a maximum budget that is known a priori. Queries are unknown a priori and arrive sequentially. When a query arrives, advertisers make bids, and we (immediately and irrevocably) decide which (if any) Ad to display based on the bids and advertiser budgets. The winning advertiser for each query pays their bid up to their remaining budget. Our goal is to maximize total budget used without any foreknowledge of the arrival sequence (which could be adversarial). We consider the setting where the online algorithm does not know the advertisers’ budgets a priori and the budget of an advertiser is revealed to the algorithm only when it is exceeded. A naïve greedy algorithm is 0.5 competitive for this setting, and finding an algorithm with better performance remained an open problem. We show that no deterministic algorithm has competitive ratio better than 0.5 and give the first (randomized) algorithm with strictly better performance guarantee. We show that the competitive ratio of our algorithm is at least 0.522 but also strictly less than ( 1 − 1 / e ) . We present novel applications of budget oblivious algorithms in search ads and beyond. In particular, we show that our algorithm achieves the best possible performance guarantee for deterministic online matching in the presence of multichannel traffic [Manshadi V, Rodilitz S, Saban D, Suresh A (2022) Online algorithms for matching platforms with multi-channel traffic.

  abstract     = {In community first responder (CFR) systems, traditional emergency service response is augmented by a network of trained volunteers who are dispatched via an app. A central application of such systems is out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), where a very fast response is crucial. For a target performance level, how many volunteers are needed, and from which locations should they be recruited? We model the presence of volunteers throughout a region as a Poisson point process, which permits the computation of the response-time distribution of the first-arriving volunteer. Combining this with known survival-rate functions, we deduce survival probabilities in the cardiac arrest setting. We then use convex optimization to compute a location distribution of volunteers across the region that optimizes either the fraction of incidents with a fast response (a common measure in the industry) or patient survival in the case of OHCA. The optimal location distribution provides a bound on the best possible performance with a given number of volunteers. This can be used to determine whether introducing a CFR system in a new region is worthwhile or can serve as a guide for additional recruitment in existing systems. Effective target areas for recruitment are not always obvious because volunteers recruited from one area may be found in various areas across the city depending on the time of day; we explicitly capture this issue. We demonstrate these methods through an extended case study of Auckland, New Zealand. This paper was accepted by Carri Chan, healthcare management.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates whether limited liability and moral hazard affect risk taking through motivated beliefs. On the one hand, limited liability encourages investors to take excessive risks. On the other, excessive risk taking makes it hard for investors to maintain a positive self-image when moral hazard is present. Using a novel experimental design, we show that subjects form motivated beliefs to self-justify their excessive risk taking. For the same investment opportunity, subjects invest more and are significantly more optimistic about the success of the investment if its failure can harm others. We show that more than one third of the investment increases under limited liability, and moral hazard can be explained through motivated beliefs. Moreover, through a treatment with limited liability but no moral hazard, we show that motivated beliefs are formed subconsciously and can lead to the paradoxical result of investors taking larger risks when their investment can harm a third party compared with when it cannot. These results underscore the importance of motivated beliefs in regulatory policy, emphasizing that policymakers must not only address bad incentives, but also address the role of bad beliefs.

  abstract     = {Using a randomized experiment in auto lending, we find that algorithmic underwriting outperforms the human underwriting process, resulting in 10.2% higher loan profits and 6.8% lower default rates. The human and machine underwriters show similar performance for low-risk, less complex loans. However, the performance of human underwritten loans largely declines for riskier and more complex loans, whereas the machine performance stays relatively stable across various risk dimensions and loan characteristics. The performance difference is more pronounced at underwriting thresholds with a high potential for agency conflict. These results are consistent with algorithmic underwriting mitigating agency conflicts and humans’ limited capacity for analyzing complex problems. This paper was accepted by Will Cong, finance.
