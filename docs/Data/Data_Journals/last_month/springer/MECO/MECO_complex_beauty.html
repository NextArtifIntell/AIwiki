  abstract     = {Electroencephalogram (EEG) plays a significant role in emotion recognition because it contains abundant information. However, due to the highly correlated EEG channels, a lot of redundant EEG features exist, which not only potentially degrade the emotion recognition accuracy, but also bring high computational costs. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an adaptive matrix-based evolutionary computation framework (AMEC) to select as few informative EEG features as possible for effective emotion recognition. Unlike most existing EC algorithms that utilize vector-based operations, this framework leverages matrix-based operations to reduce feature redundancy and improve classification accuracy by dynamically adjusting the feature subset size according to the characteristics of the dataset. In such a way, the selection efficiency is largely improved. To verify the effectiveness and efficiency of this framework, the classical genetic algorithm, the typical particle swarm optimization algorithm, and the classical differential evolution algorithm, are respectively embedded into this framework for EEG feature selection, and then evaluated on three widely used public EEG datasets for emotion recognition. Compared with several state-of-the-art EEG feature selection algorithms, the devised framework is much more effective in terms of the classification accuracy and the computational efficiency. In addition, the experimental results further reveal that the selected feature subsets are very different for different genders. This indicates the demand of gender-sensitive EEG feature selection for emotion recognition.},

  abstract     = {The automated design of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithms has become increasingly significant, particularly in addressing complex combinatorial optimization problems. Although existing methods have achieved some success, they still face limitations, particularly the high dependency on expert knowledge, pre-solved data, and challenges in interpretability. Genetic Programming (GP), as a proven technology, has shown potential in optimizing the automated design state transition rules of ACO. However, existing research on GP-ACO is insufficient, particularly in terms of experimental validation and systematic evaluation. To address these issues, this study conducts comprehensive experiments to explore several key questions: the generality of GP-ACO on homogeneously distributed maps, the impact of different ACO variants on the learning capabilities of GP-ACO, the effect of 2-opt local search on the learning capabilities of GP-ACO, the enhancement of learning capabilities through the addition of more global information, and the interpretability of GP-ACO. The findings indicate that GP-ACO exhibits robust generality; variations among ACO variants have minimal impact on learning performance; 2-opt local search can somewhat diminish the performance of GP-ACO in the Max–Min Ant System; additional global information can significantly enhance the learning capabilities of GP-ACO; and GP-ACO has good interpretability.},

This conversion significantly enhances the performance of various applications, such as automated question answering and information retrieval systems. However, traditional event extraction methodologies often encounter challenges stemming from limited datasets, imbalanced sample distributions, the necessity for extra resources to annotate large datasets, and the potential for data quality degradation during the augmentation process. To surmount these obstacles, this study introduces an innovative self-data augmentation strategy that leverages a single large language model (LLM) to concurrently perform data augmentation and event extraction. By dynamically assessing and refining the quality of generated samples, this approach mitigates the inclusion of noisy data, ultimately bolstering the model’s performance. Demonstrable enhancements in precision, recall, and F1 scores across various model configurations underscore the efficacy of this strategy in managing small and imbalanced datasets. Furthermore, the incorporation of Logical Thoughts for Self-Data Augmentation (LoTSA) ensures the superior quality of augmented data, culminating in more accurate and reliable extraction outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Mining frequent and high utility itemsets (FHUIs) from transaction database is an important task in data mining. In order to overcome the difficulties of parameter setting and huge search space in traditional algorithms for mining FHUIs, the task of mining FHUIs was modeled as a bi-objective problem and then solved by multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) in previous works. However, MOEAs may be inefficient when the number of transactions and items in the transaction database becomes large. To address this problem, we propose a novel efficient bi-objective evolutionary algorithm for mining FHUIs (NBOEA-FHUI). In NBOEA-FHUI, a novel initialization strategy is proposed, which takes the support, utility, and diversity of the initial population into account. The proposed initial strategy can make the initial population have relative high utility and support values with high population diversity. To improve the quality of the offspring, a method for estimating the support and utility value of itemsets and an offspring generation strategy are proposed in NBOEA-FHUI. The support and utility values of itemsets which are roughly proportional to their true values can be calculated by the estimation method with little computation. The proposed offspring generation strategy can generate better offspring based on the estimated support and utility value. Experimental results on several real datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has better performance than the state-of-the-art MOEAs in terms of the convergence speed, search efficiency, and solution accuracy in the task of mining FHUIs.},

  abstract     = {Most existing constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithms are not so efficient when handling constrained large-scale multi-objective problems (CLSMOPs). To overcome white-box CLSMOPs with definitive objective functions, a spatial–temporal lever evolutionary algorithm (STLEA), consisting of the lever evolutionary algorithm (LEA) and spatial–temporal preference strategy (STPS), is proposed. LEA ditches the thought of the mainstream algorithms for the similar problems, which changes the structure of the large-scale decision space, but handles the large-scale decision space by a certain small-scale decision space. Specifically, inspired by the lever principle, LEA explores the way to pry up the large-scale decision space, as the “load”, by the small-scale decision space, as the “force”. Meanwhile, LEA rotates the optimizations in between “load” and “force” for dual-balance: balance between objectives and constraints, and balance between convergence and diversity of solutions. STPS dynamically adjusts the proportion of optimizations in “load” and “force”. Different from existing preference strategies, which only consider the stage of the evolutionary procedure, STPS considers both stage, related to time, and varying scale of the decision space, related to space, for the comprehensive balance of feasibility, convergence, and diversity of solutions. Eleven representative and state-of-the-art constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithms have been compared to the proposed STLEA to demonstrate its effectiveness through comparative experiments on through comparative experiments on CLSMOPs with equality and inequality constraints and 1000 decision variables and three typical MaMIMO-LU models with 1024 antennas and 128, 256, and 512 users. Experimental results show that STLEA achieves the best SE-EE tradeoff.},

  abstract     = {Machine Learning has achieved considerable success in clinical applications such as image-based diagnostics, predictive modeling for patient outcomes, and personalized treatment planning. However, the black-box nature of deep neural networks often results in poor interpretability and reliability of predictions. Traditional neural network architectures, focusing primarily on correlations, fall short in elucidating underlying causal medical mechanisms. Addressing this, causal discovery, aimed at elucidating the structure of causal graphical models from observational or experimental data, is gaining prominence in clinical fields demanding high reliability. Nevertheless, the complexity of search algorithms, the scarcity of real-world data, and the challenges in identifying unique results significantly hinder the reliability of these approaches. To overcome these challenges, we propose an iterative active structure learning approach to ensure reliable clinical causal analysis. Our method begins with the recovery of a causal structure, guided by a set of prior causal presence, followed by an iterative process of active refinement to enhance the output reliability. This involves using violations of known clinical mechanisms as structural constraints to guide successive rounds of learning, thereby correcting and refining the model iteratively. The process continues until there is a convergence between expertise and the data-derived solutions. Our experiments on real-world clinical data demonstrate that Our approach can improve the quality of causal findings and discover new causal associations beyond the basis of expert knowledge. Furthermore, our approach has yielded novel and significant insights from various datasets, which we explore in our discussion.},

  abstract     = {Object detection on traffic road is crucial for enabling real-time analysis of road conditions and can be applied in intelligent transportation systems. However, in real world, we may encounter cases of low visibility, occlusion and lens contamination, where general methods of object detection usually degrade. In order to address this problem, we propose a Rotary Positional DINO with Siamese Structure (SimRo-DINO) framework, which efficiently overcomes the difficulty associated with object detection under adverse conditions. Specifically, to extract salient detail features and distinguish them from extraneous interference information, we leverage siamese representation learning along with random masking, which is named Mask Siamese Subnetwork, improving the robustness under adverse conditions. Furthermore, to enhance the connection between features scattered by various interferences and capture latent positional information under adverse conditions, we introduce Rotary Position Embedding into Co-DINO framework, an end-to-end detector with the capacity of capturing long-range dependency relationships within images. Extensive experiments have been conduct on UA-DETRAC and our self-built dataset, both under the adverse conditions. The results from our experiments indicate a substantial advancement in mean Average Precision (mAP) of 2.3 and 2.5% on these two datasets, respectively, compared to the Co-DINO baseline.

However, the construction of appropriate multi-objective problem models coupled with efficient search strategies emerges as a pivotal determinant influencing the performance of multi-objective path planning algorithms. This paper introduces a multi-task assisted multi-objective optimization algorithm (MAMO) tailored to address autonomous underwater vehicle path planning problems. The proposed multi-task framework encompasses two tasks: the original path planning task and a devised simple task. These two tasks have different decision spaces due to distinct encoding strategies. Additionally, two different yet interconnected multi-objective problem models are deployed in the above two tasks. Furthermore, two knowledge transfer strategies, domain mapping-based and reconstruction-based knowledge transfer strategies, are introduced to leverage the knowledge from the simple task to assist the original task. The efficacy of the proposed MAMO is compared against eight counterparts and evaluated on three autonomous underwater vehicle path planning cases with different numbers of obstacles. The empirical findings corroborate the efficacy of the algorithm proffered.},
