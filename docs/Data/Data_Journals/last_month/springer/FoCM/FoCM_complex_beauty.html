We discretize it in space with isoparametric finite elements and apply a semi-implicit Euler and midpoint rule as well as the exponential Euler and midpoint rule to obtain four fully discrete schemes. We derive rigorous error bounds of optimal order for the semi-discretization in space and the fully discrete methods in norms which are stronger than the classical $$H^1\times L^2$$ energy norm under weak CFL-type conditions. To confirm our theoretical findings, we also present numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {B-Series and generalizations are a powerful tool for the analysis of numerical integrators. An extension named exotic aromatic B-Series was introduced to study the order conditions for sampling the invariant measure of ergodic SDEs. Introducing a new symmetry normalization coefficient, we analyze the algebraic structures related to exotic B-Series and S-Series. Precisely, we prove the relationship between the Grossman–Larson algebras over exotic and grafted forests and the corresponding duals to the Connes–Kreimer coalgebras and use it to study the natural composition laws on exotic S-Series. Applying this algebraic framework to the derivation of order conditions for a class of stochastic Runge–Kutta methods, we present a multiplicative property that ensures some order conditions to be satisfied automatically.},

  abstract     = {We study several variants of decomposing a symmetric matrix into a sum of a low-rank positive-semidefinite matrix and a diagonal matrix. Such decompositions have applications in factor analysis, and they have been studied for many decades. On the one hand, we prove that when the rank of the positive-semidefinite matrix in the decomposition is bounded above by an absolute constant, the problem can be solved in polynomial time. On the other hand, we prove that, in general, these problems as well as their certain approximation versions are all NP-hard. Finally, we prove that many of these low-rank decomposition problems are complete in the first-order theory of the reals, i.e., given any system of polynomial equations, we can write down a low-rank decomposition problem in polynomial time so that the original system has a solution iff our corresponding decomposition problem has a feasible solution of certain (lowest) rank.},

  abstract     = {In the framework of real Hilbert spaces, we study continuous in time dynamics as well as numerical algorithms for the problem of approaching the set of zeros of a single-valued monotone and continuous operator V. The starting point of our investigations is a second-order dynamical system that combines a vanishing damping term with the time derivative of V along the trajectory, which can be seen as an analogous of the Hessian-driven damping in case the operator is originating from a potential. Our method exhibits fast convergence rates of order $$o \left( \frac{1}{t\beta (t)} \right) $$ for $$\Vert V(z(t))\Vert $$ , where $$z(\cdot )$$ denotes the generated trajectory and $$\beta (\cdot )$$ is a positive nondecreasing function satisfying a growth condition, and also for the restricted gap function, which is a measure of optimality for variational inequalities. We also prove the weak convergence of the trajectory to a zero of V. Temporal discretizations of the dynamical system generate implicit and explicit numerical algorithms, which can be both seen as accelerated versions of the Optimistic Gradient Descent Ascent (OGDA) method for monotone operators, for which we prove that the generated sequence of iterates $$(z_k)_{k \ge 0}$$ shares the asymptotic features of the continuous dynamics. In particular we show for the implicit numerical algorithm convergence rates of order $$o \left( \frac{1}{k\beta _k} \right) $$ for $$\Vert V(z^k)\Vert $$ and the restricted gap function, where $$(\beta _k)_{k \ge 0}$$ is a positive nondecreasing sequence satisfying a growth condition. For the explicit numerical algorithm, we show by additionally assuming that the operator V is Lipschitz continuous convergence rates of order $$o \left( \frac{1}{k} \right) $$ for $$\Vert V(z^k)\Vert $$ and the restricted gap function. All convergence rate statements are last iterate convergence results; in addition to these, we prove for both algorithms the convergence of the iterates to a zero of V. To our knowledge, our study exhibits the best-known convergence rate results for monotone equations. Numerical experiments indicate the overwhelming superiority of our explicit numerical algorithm over other methods designed to solve monotone equations governed by monotone and Lipschitz continuous operators.},

From a computational perspective, however, evaluating geodesics can be quite costly. We therefore introduce approximate geodesic random walks based on the concept of retractions. We show that these approximate walks converge in distribution to the correct Brownian motion as long as the geodesic equation is approximated up to second order. As a result, we obtain an efficient algorithm for sampling Brownian motion on compact Riemannian manifolds.},

Moreover, it enables the application of fully corrective generalized conditional gradient methods for their efficient solution. In this manuscript, this program is adapted to the minimization of a smooth convex fidelity term which is augmented with an unbalanced transport regularization term given in the form of a generalized Kantorovich–Rubinstein norm for Radon measures. More precisely, we show that the extremal points associated to the latter are given by all Dirac delta functionals supported in the spatial domain as well as certain dipoles, i.e., pairs of Diracs with the same mass but with different signs. Subsequently, this characterization is used to derive precise first-order optimality conditions as well as an efficient solution algorithm for which linear convergence is proved under natural assumptions. This behavior is also reflected in numerical examples for a model problem.},

  abstract     = {We develop lower bounds on communication in the memory hierarchy or between processors for nested bilinear algorithms, such as Strassen’s algorithm for matrix multiplication. We build on a previous framework that establishes communication lower bounds by use of the rank expansion, or the minimum rank of any fixed size subset of columns of a matrix, for each of the three matrices encoding a bilinear algorithm. This framework provides lower bounds for a class of dependency directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) corresponding to the execution of a given bilinear algorithm, in contrast to other approaches that yield bounds for specific DAGs. However, our lower bounds only apply to executions that do not compute the same DAG node multiple times. Two bilinear algorithms can be nested by taking Kronecker products between their encoding matrices. Our main result is a lower bound on the rank expansion of a matrix constructed by a Kronecker product derived from lower bounds on the rank expansion of the Kronecker product’s operands. We apply the rank expansion lower bounds to obtain novel communication lower bounds for nested Toom-Cook convolution, Strassen’s algorithm, and fast algorithms for contraction of partially symmetric tensors.},

  abstract     = {This work is concerned with the construction of Gaussian Beam (GB) solutions for the numerical approximation of wave equations, semi-discretized in space by finite difference schemes. GB are high-frequency solutions whose propagation can be described, both at the continuous and at the semi-discrete levels, by microlocal tools along the bi-characteristics of the corresponding Hamiltonian. Their dynamics differ in the continuous and the semi-discrete setting, because of the high-frequency gap between the Hamiltonians. In particular, numerical high-frequency solutions can exhibit spurious pathological behaviors, such as lack of propagation in space, contrary to the classical space-time propagation properties of continuous waves. This gap between the behavior of continuous and numerical waves introduces also significant analytical difficulties, since classical GB constructions cannot be immediately extrapolated to the finite difference setting, and need to be properly tailored to accurately detect the propagation properties in discrete media. Our main objective in this paper is to present a general and rigorous construction of the GB ansatz for finite difference wave equations, and corroborate this construction through accurate numerical simulations.},
