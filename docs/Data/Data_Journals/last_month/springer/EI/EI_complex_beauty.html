  abstract     = {Training deep Convolutional Neural Networks consists of multiple forward and backward passes over several epochs until the loss converges, making it time-consuming. Various factors affect the training times of networks, weight initialization being one of them. The idea of a proper weight initialization technique is to set the initial weights such that the network converges faster by extracting meaningful features from the data. This paper proposes a data-driven weight initialization to accelerate the training process. This technique is based on obtaining initial weights by appropriately analysing the training data. The proposed weight initialization strategy initializes filters from a pre-defined filter bank that is created before training, and it contains standard edge and texture feature extracting filters and data-driven filters obtained using principal component analysis, linear discriminant analysis and partial least squares. The proposed technique has been validated on AlexNet, VGG-16 and ResNet-50 for Intel Image Classification, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets. The results show that the proposed technique gives better validation results than other state-of-the-art techniques in fewer epochs and works well with state-of-the-art activation functions.},

The results demonstrate that ODMA-GA outperforms its peer metaheuristic algorithms, showcasing superior optimization capabilities. This promising performance suggests that ODMA-GA offers an effective solution for the challenging task of load frequency management in thermal power systems, ensuring stable and efficient operation.

These algorithms combine the strengths of different strategies to enhance solution identification and refinement. In this work, the integration of metaheuristic operators using the Unstructured Evolutive Game Theory to regulate and merge the advantageous features of the Cheetah Optimizer and Particle Swarm Optimization to solve continuous optimization problems is proposed. The Cheetah Optimizer and Particle Swarm Optimization are chosen for their superior exploitation and exploration capabilities, respectively. Our methodology unfolds in two primary phases: combination and modulation. In the combination phase, Cheetah Optimizer and Particle Swarm Optimization search strategies are merged, creating a unified population that generates new candidate solution positions based on the best solution and a modulation factor. During the modulation phase, pairwise competitions based on Unstructured Evolutive Game Theory assess candidate solutions against the objective function, adjusting their modulation factor and position accordingly. We conducted various experiments to evaluate our approach against the original Cheetah Optimizer and Particle Swarm Optimization, as well as seven other well-known metaheuristic algorithms and hybrid schemes, across 30 benchmark functions in dimensions of 30, 50, and 100. The results reveal that our hybrid scheme outperforms the comparative algorithms, demonstrating enhanced performance, effectiveness, and robustness through a detailed convergence and significance analysis.},

  abstract     = {The job shop scheduling problem (JSSP) is a well-known NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem that focuses on assigning tasks to limited resources while adhering to certain constraints. Currently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based solutions are being widely used to solve the JSSP by defining the problem structure on disjunctive graphs. Some of the proposed approaches attempt to leverage the structural information of the JSSP to capture the dynamics of the environment without considering the time dependency within the JSSP. However, learning graph representations only from the structural relationship of nodes results in a weak and incomplete representation of these graphs which does not provide an expressive representation of the dynamics in the environment. In this study, unlike existing frameworks, we defined the JSSP as a dynamic graph to explicitly consider the time-varying aspect of the JSSP environment. To this end, we propose a novel DRL framework that captures both the spatial and temporal attributes of the JSSP to construct rich and complete graph representations. Our DRL framework introduces a novel attentive graph isomorphism network (Attentive-GIN)-based spatial block to learn the structural relationship and a temporal block to capture the time dependency. Additionally, we designed a gated fusion block that selectively combines the learned representations from the two blocks. We trained the model using the proximal policy optimization algorithm of reinforcement learning. Experimental results show that our trained model exhibits significant performance enhancement compared to heuristic dispatching rules and learning-based solutions for both randomly generated datasets and public benchmarks.},

This study fills the research gap by offering a quantifiable improvement over traditional heuristic methods, delivering up to a 37% improvement in the GAP metric compared to state-of-the-art techniques. It also achieves a 30% enhancement over the PCH constructive heuristic used for generating initial solutions.

  abstract     = {Musculoskeletal radiograph classification has been gaining great attention due to its important application in automated diagnosis of musculoskeletal disorders. Generally, musculoskeletal radiographs capture images of various bones in the whole body, which can be considered as a combination of multiple single datasets. Existing works have tried to build either a traditional neural network (NN), convolution neural network (CNN), or Bayesian convolutional neural network (BCNN) to achieve efficient classification. However, none of them explore the mixed-dataset property. In this context, we propose a novel Gaussian mixture model-based BCNN (MixBCNN) for the abnormal musculoskeletal radiographs classification problem. In the proposed method, the distribution of NN weights is represented as a Gaussian mixture distribution, expecting a new neural network model with better representation. In addition, we propose an ensemble learning approach to efficiently combine potential NN backbones. Performance evaluation is examined for the popular MURA dataset and shows the superiority of the proposed model with respect to state-of-the-art BCNN methods, notably by 0.86 in F1 score and 0.72 in Cohen’s kappa metrics while asking for negligible complexity overhead.},

  abstract     = {The efficient speech emotion recognition (SER) is a crucial component in the development of natural and intuitive human-computer interaction systems. The problem addressed in this research is the challenge of achieving high accuracy in SER through optimized feature extraction, selection, and model tuning. The objective is to achieve more accurate speech emotion recognition through optimized feature extraction and selection, and the generation of an optimized random forest model. This paper presents a machine learning framework for speech emotion recognition based on Metaheuristic principles. The framework comprises two primary components: feature extraction and selection. Additionally, it generates an optimised random forest model by utilising the hybrid bat algorithm (HBA) to fine-tune the hyperparameters of the RF model, known as the Bat Random Forest Hybrid Meta Heuristic Algorithm (BRHAMO). Three speech corpora, including RAVDESS, SAVEE, and novel ANAKE Hindi speech corpus, have been utilized. The speech emotion recognition was subjected to a series of experiments and tests utilizing two unique features of speech characteristics, namely spectral features and the amalgamation of hybrid features. The experimental findings demonstrated BRHAMO based model achieved an accuracy of 81%, 79.6%, and 77.6% for the RAVDESS, SAVEE, and ANAKE datasets, respectively, in the spectral feature category. Furthermore, for the hybrid feature category, the RAVDESS, SAVEE, and ANAKE datasets achieved accuracy rates of 93.8%, 85.4%, and 89.8%, respectively. The performance of the BRHAMO, has been compared to several benchmark machine learning models, namely vanilla Random Forest, gradient boost, adaptive boost, and support vector machines. It is observed that the Meta Heuristic Algorithm (MHA) based approach can deliver better performance in terms of accuracy, precision, F1 score, and recall compared to all the individual classifiers in both categories.},

It equips farmers with cutting-edge instruments to safeguard their harvests, lessen their effect on the environment, and satisfy the growing need for sustenance on a worldwide scale. Deep learning can completely transform the identification of pests as it develops, protecting agriculture&#39;s production and resistance against ever-changing insect threats. It can be difficult to combine multiple methods for pest identification, including artificial intelligence, satellite imaging, and detectors. It is difficult to make sure that such innovations are available to farms and function well together. It&#39;s common for farmers as well as other agricultural personnel to require certification to properly utilize pest detection equipment and understand the findings. For these innovations to be widely adopted, the gap in understanding must be closed. Addressing these challenges requires an effective novel deep learning-based pest detection method. In this paper, a deep learning-based pest detection and classification model is developed to identify diseases caused by pests at an early stage. Initially, the images are collected from online datasets. Collected images underwent detection using the Adaptive Single Shot Detector (ASSD). To enhance the accuracy and efficiency of ASSD, the model parameters are fine-tuned by utilizing the Enhanced Running City Game Optimizer. This optimization process aims to improve the precision of pest detection. The classification of pests is done using the proposed Multi-scale and Dilated Graph Attention Network. This innovative network architecture is designed to categorize the pests effectively. The outcome of the proposed model is justified by comparing it with other classifiers and algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The Sand Cat Swarm Optimization (SCSO) algorithm is characterized by slow convergence speed and a tendency to become trapped in local optima. To address these issues, a hybrid multi-strategy variant known as HSCSO is proposed. The algorithm first employs an Elite Opposition-Based Learning strategy, which generates complementary candidate solutions, providing a more diverse set of initial solutions and improving the distribution of individual positions. Subsequently, a greedy strategy is utilized to combine the position update strategy of the golden sine algorithm, which has a fixed search pattern, with the position update strategy of the SCSO, which features random search characteristics. This combination retains the advantage of fast convergence while also providing a diverse set of random candidate solutions. Finally, a Random Inertia Weight is introduced to assist the SCSO algorithm in adaptively adjusting the search step size and optimization direction based on the different phases of the search process, thereby helping the algorithm effectively avoid local optima. The improved algorithm was compared with two classic original algorithms and six different algorithm variants on 25 benchmark functions. The experimental results indicate that HSCSO exhibits faster convergence and higher solution accuracy on most benchmark functions. Furthermore, the performance of HSCSO was evaluated on the CEC2019 and CEC2021 test suites, as well as several engineering optimization problems. The experimental results validate the competitiveness and superiority of the proposed HSCSO algorithm, demonstrating its potential for application in the field of global optimization.},

Subsequently, each IMF determined its stationarity using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test. For stationary IMFs, an AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model was built, while non-stationary IMFs were fitted using machine learning regression algorithms. The sum of the predicted values of all IMFs was considered as the forecast VIX value. About the parameter selection in machine learning algorithms, we employed the Optuna library to optimize the model’s parameters. We selected the parameters that resulted in the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) on a validation set to be the optimal model parameters. Applying this methodology, we found that our hybrid model has greater predictive capabilities compared to simple machine learning models when the market fluctuates greatly. Specifically, the AdaBoost model outperformed a basic decision tree model and a random forest model in terms of MSE and MAE (mean absolute error) accuracy.},

  abstract     = {This research investigation is concerned with social optimization and customers’ strategic behavior for a double orbit retrial queueing model with vacation, aiming to enhance the performance of virtual call centers. In many call center scenarios, if the server is busy, the arriving customer moves to premium/ordinary orbit, i.e., becomes a repeated customer; otherwise, if the server is accessible, the arriving customer joins the system to receive the required service. Once the service is completed, the server will look into the premium orbit to check whether there is any customer who needs service. If no new customer from premium/ordinary orbit or outside arrives and the system is empty, then the server takes a vacation. The customer’s decision to wait or balk from the system depends on the server’s status and the reward for receiving the service. By using a probability generating function and iterative approach, the long-run probability distribution of the queue size and other metrics, viz. equilibrium thresholds, entering probability, etc., have been obtained. Moreover, the social welfare function is analyzed based on two given information levels. The optimal solution is presented by solving the social welfare maximization problem using particle swarm optimization and harmony search techniques. The impact of different parameters on the performance metrics in Virtual Call Centers (VCC) is examined.},

  abstract     = {Current power system stabilizer designs, including fuzzy-PID and Lead-Lag compensators, need help with adaptability and complexity in diverse and evolving power system environments. Conventional tuning methods like the Newton–Raphson approach and optimization strategies like particle swarm optimization, genetic algorithms, and cuckoo search algorithms face challenges in achieving optimal performance for Fractional Order Proportional Integral Derivative (FOPID) controllers. There is a critical need for innovative tuning methods that offer enhanced adaptability and performance in complex power system stability analysis. This research contributes to the advancement of power system stability analysis, specifically in SMIB systems, offering insights into optimizing FOPID controllers utilizing the innovative Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) algorithm. The work expects these findings to broaden the implications for power system control and enhance the stability of Single Machine Infinite Bus (SMIB) systems, thus fostering the resilience and reliability of modern electrical infrastructure. The FOPID controller encompasses fractional order parameters, encompassing proportional, integral, and derivative gain, integral order, and derivative order, each exerting a substantial influence on control responses and stability. This research harnesses HHO, an optimization technique inspired by nature, to fine-tune FOPID parameters. The investigation involves initializing the SMIB model, formulating an objective function to minimize control errors, and employing HHO iteratively to refine the FOPID controller. The outcomes reveal enhanced stability, diminished overshoot, accelerated settling time, and transient response.},

  abstract     = {The problem of finding a cohesive subgraph, notably the s-club model, which is a subgraph with diameter at most s, is a widely applied topic in social network analysis and group of objects modeling. In particular, the minimum s-club cover problem (min s-club cover) is a recently introduced variant in the literature which asks to cover the vertices of a graph with a minimum number of s-clubs. The existence of common connections among these highly connected components encourages the application of multitasking optimization to leverage the shared meaningful knowledge in the discovery of multiple s-clubs at the same time. Therefore, this study proposes a multitasking evolutionary algorithm to solve the minimum s-club cover problem. Our proposal is designed with an effective solution representation method and evolutionary operators for the variation in the number of clubs. Each solution is represented by two components, where the gene number of a component can be different for each individual and can change during performing evolutionary operations. We also propose a solution generation method based on a random greedy algorithm that helps to ensure individual quality and population diversity in the initial population. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on two datasets in the DIMACS library. This study then analyzed the influence of different factors of the input data on the proposed algorithm results. Based on statistical analysis of the performance results, it is clear that our proposal’s solution is superior to an existing algorithm on two-thirds of the experimental data set.},

  abstract     = {Nonlinear, complex optimization problems are prevalent in many scientific and engineering fields. Traditional algorithms often struggle with these problems due to their high dimensionality and intricate nature, making them time-consuming. Many researchers have proposed new metaheuristic algorithms inspired by biological behaviors in nature, which comparatively show higher performance and accuracy than traditional optimization algorithms. Nature-inspired algorithms, particularly those based on swarm intelligence, offer adaptable and efficient solutions to these challenges. In recent years, swarm intelligence algorithms have made significant advancements. Classical and CEC benchmark suits are immersively useful for studying the performance of optimization algorithms. According to our literature survey, we identified that many algorithms were evaluated based on accuracy. Currently, swarm intelligence algorithms are used in many applications, and efficiency and computational complexity need to be evaluated. A broad-level study of the computational complexity and accuracy of popular swarm intelligence algorithms has not been done recently. Therefore this study we comprehensively evaluate and compare 21 bio-inspired swarm intelligence algorithms on eight non-separable unimodal, eight separable unimodal, five non-separable multimodal, seven separable multimodal functions, and two CEC 2018 many objective functions. We study the structure and mathematical model of the selected algorithms. Then we categorized selected algorithms into six different behavioral groups. We calculated the root mean square error between expected and actual values. Then we performed an RMSE cross-validation statistical test to understand how accurately an algorithm resolves an average problem. We found that Artificial Lizard Search Optimization (ALSO) is the most prominent algorithm in accuracy and efficiency. Besides that, Cat Swarm Optimization (CSO), Squirrel Search Algorithm (SSA), and Chimp Optimization Algorithm (CHOA-B) are also considered more universal algorithms. The Squirrel Search Algorithm (SSA) is ALSO’s second-best algorithm in time complexity. Wasp Swarm Algorithm (WSO), and Bat-Inspired Algorithm (BA) presented the lowest time complexity. Finally, several important issues and research directions are discussed.},

Traditional optimization algorithms often need help with the problems of quickly falling into local optimum and insufficient global search ability when dealing with high-dimensional, multi-peaked and complex structured data. In order to solve this challenge, a student psychology based optimization algorithm (GDLSPBO) that integrates differential evolution and hierarchical learning mechanisms was proposed, aiming to improve the accuracy, stability and global optimization ability of data clustering. GDLSPBO enhances the population diversity and prevents the algorithm from falling into local optimum by introducing the differential evolution mechanism. Simultaneously, the hierarchical learning strategy improves the algorithm’s search efficiency and local optimization ability. The experiments are validated on the CEC-BC-2017 benchmark functions. Several real datasets and the results show that GDLSPBO achieves an F-measure of 0.9595 and an Adjusted Rand coefficient of 0.8578 on the Cancer dataset, and the clustering accuracy on the Iris dataset reaches 93.33%, which is significantly better than that of other classical optimization algorithms. This indicates that GDLSPBO has a more substantial clustering effect and higher solution accuracy in solving complex data clustering problems. The experimental results verify that the global search ability and optimization accuracy of GDLSPBO on multidimensional complex data sets have been significantly improved, demonstrating its broad applicability and robustness in practical data clustering applications.},

  abstract     = {Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) have been widely used to solve computationally expensive optimization problems. The extreme learning machine-based DirectRanker (ELDR) is a single-layer feed-forward neural network surrogate model designed for SAEAs. ELDR estimates the superiority of two solutions with a high estimation accuracy, even in high-dimensional problems. However, ELDR requires a long computation time as the problem dimensionality and the number of hidden neurons increase, thus making it difficult to apply it to high-dimensional problems. A surrogate model should be computationally efficient and enable rapid fitness estimations. Therefore, this paper proposes a fast implementation technique, i.e., fast version ELDR (fELDR) that achieves mathematically equivalent learning results with low computational complexity. Additionally, this paper proposes a pointwise score function to render the prediction results reusable. The experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of fELDR when compared with the original ELDR. The learning results of the proposed fELDR were equivalent to those of the original ELDR while reducing the training time by up to 97%, especially when using a large hidden layer on a high dimensionality problem. Moreover, due to the reusable prediction results, the computation time of the fELDR-assisted SAEA can be further decreased by 79.5% when compared with that of the original ELDR-assisted SAEA. The reduced training time and reusable prediction results of fELDR render it feasible to apply ELDR to high-dimensional optimization problems and realize a high prediction accuracy with a large number of hidden neurons.},

  abstract     = {To address the limitations of the artificial rabbit optimization (ARO) algorithm in handling complex and large-scale optimization problems, this paper proposes an enhanced multi-strategy algorithm—MARO. The proposed algorithm integrates several strategies, including elite opposition-based learning, Levy flight, random walk, and adaptive weight factors, to significantly improve the search capability and convergence accuracy of ARO. First, the algorithm applies the elite opposition-based learning strategy in each iteration to generate opposite solutions, which enriches population diversity and enhances global search capacity, effectively preventing the algorithm from becoming trapped in local optima. Second, it incorporates Levy flight and random walk strategies to increase search randomness during the exploration phase, thus improving the probability of finding the global optimum. Finally, the adaptive weight factor is introduced during the exploitation phase to dynamically adjust the search direction based on different stages, achieving a balance between global exploration and local exploitation. Experimental results demonstrate that MARO consistently outperforms ARO and other popular algorithms across multiple international benchmark test suites. On the CEC2005 test functions, MARO shows significant improvements over CMAES and LSHADE on 9 functions. For the CEC2017 suite, MARO achieves the best average ranking on nearly three-quarters of the test functions, with an average rank of 1.38, significantly outperforming CMAES (3.48) and LSHADE (3.52). On the CEC2019 suite, MARO ranks first in 70% of the test functions. Statistical significance tests, including the Friedman and Wilcoxon tests, confirm that MARO&#39;s p-values are less than 0.05 when compared with benchmark algorithms, validating the algorithm&#39;s effectiveness. Moreover, MARO also exhibits outstanding optimization performance in real-world engineering problems such as pressure vessel design and reservoir scheduling optimization. The main contribution of this paper lies in the introduction of an innovative multi-strategy optimization framework, which enhances both exploration and exploitation capabilities. This framework effectively addresses the shortcomings of existing ARO algorithms in handling complex problems, providing a more competitive solution for practical optimization tasks.},

To alleviate these shortcomings, a novel strategy, namely Modified Random Opposition (MRO) and ten chaotic maps are integrated with ARO, termed as MROCARO. This implementation MRO technique boost the population diversity and permits the population to escape from local optima while integration of chaotic map enhances the exploitation capability. To estimate the effectiveness of the MROCARO method, the well-known CEC2005, CEC2017, CEC2019 and CEC2008lsgo test functions are considered. Moreover, non-parametric tests that include the Wilcoxon rank-sum and Friedman rank test are performed to analyze the significant difference among the compared algorithms. Furthermore, the efficiency of the MROCARO algorithm has been evaluated on various structural problems and optimal sizing of renewable energy systems. The experimental findings demonstrate that MROCARO performed optimum solution with 100% renewable sources with the lowest levelized cost of electricity of 0.0934 $/kWh as compared to other methods.

Evaluation metrics and statistical tests demonstrate MOGGO&#39;s superior performance in handling large structural optimization problems, preserving more Pareto-optimal sets, and achieving greater convergence and variance in objective and decision spaces. MOGGO’s ability to manage conflicting objectives is further validated through diversity analysis, with swarm plots illustrating its superior convergence behavior across iterations. Overall, MOGGO proves to be an efficient and effective approach for addressing challenging reliability-based multi-objective structural optimization problems.

  abstract     = {Class imbalance is one of the major issues for the application of deep learning for remote sensing imagery. High-resolution remote sensing image sample sets are prone to cause the problem of sample imbalance among classes due to the skewed distribution of ground features, which has been a huge challenge to machine learning and data mining and aroused strong attention. Despite the emerging interest in Deep Learning (DL), empirical research on its effectiveness with imbalanced data in remote sensing remains scarce. Therefore, this study aims to systematically review existing studies using DL approaches for handling class imbalanced data in the field of remote sensing, focusing on its significance in critical applications such as land use land cover classification, pixel-wise segmentation, and object detection. This study presents the most widely used balancing algorithms published from 2016 to 2024. This survey divulges that while using DL technologies, either the data augmentation can be applied to the minority class images to generate more varied samples or using algorithm-level methods by incorporating modifications to the loss function such as cross-entropy, focal loss, dice loss by assigning higher weights to minority class samples, ensuring the model pays more attention to underrepresented classes during training. While traditional techniques such as data sampling and cost-sensitive learning continue to be relevant, emerging methods such as GAN, which leverage neural network feature learning capabilities, show promise. Our discussion identifies research gaps and provides insights to guide future efforts in utilizing DL for imbalanced data in remote sensing applications.},

  abstract     = {Efficient mapping algorithms have been implemented in different fields of robotics applications. Some of those applications are in the mapping of environments with difficult accessibility, the planning of service or emergency assistant robots, or as supporting tools in helping people with disabilities. In those examples, the essential task of a mapping algorithm is to detect obstacles which may interfere in motion paths. One of the most widely used characteristics in pulse-echo range estimation is the time of flight. However, the ultrasonic frequencies (range from 30 to 120 KHz) are poorly suitable for the long distances faced in in-door applications. In view of the importance of developing efficient mapping algorithms, the present manuscript reports on an efficient method based on high-frequency waves in order to range static objects under a controlled environment. In the present approach, the signal acquisition is made out-of-band of the processing algorithm. This process is carried out by using an active speaker to throw the control ping sound. The resulting audio is captured through a unidirectional dynamic microphone Shure® SV100. The audio signal processing is based on selective filtering via Gabor models and wavelet decimation de-noising. The proposed method is compared against two common methodologies for range estimation in robotics based on ultrasonic and infrared sensor. The current methodology demonstrated a competitive and, in some cases, better performance than the standard methods.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents the development of integrated intelligent computing using physics-informed neural networks to solve the mathematical normal-tumor immune-unhealthy diet model. The model considers vitamin intervention as a moderating factor within one day. A nonlinear activation function called sigmoid was used for the model across three different scenarios to define the fitness or error function. For computing the optimized biases and weights of physics-informed neural networks, hybridization of heuristic algorithms, particularly particle swarm optimization and neural networks algorithm are employed from $$-10$$ to $$10$$ . The proposed technique&#39;s accuracy, reliability, and validity are demonstrated by consistently matching the results obtained using NDsolve from mathematics built-in function as a reference solution. Additionally, statistical analyses including absolute and mean squared errors are conducted to confirm further the precision and accuracy of the physics-informed neural networks. It is observed that the absolute errors and mean square error between the reference solution and proposed technique range from $${10}^{-2}$$ to $${10}^{-9}$$ and range from $${10}^{-6}$$ to $${10}^{-11}$$ for distinct cases. The novelty of this study highlights the importance of physics-informed neural networks for a balanced diet rich in vitamins for reducing the risk of deadly diseases, particularly cancer and the potential of machine learning algorithms in modelling and analyzing complex biological systems.},

  abstract     = {Currently, the mainstream methods for relational triple extraction mainly employ joint models and have achieved significant results. However, these methods still face challenges in dealing with the complexity of unstructured text. In joint models based on labeled relational triple extraction, the BiRTE model suffers from the issue of redundant entity pairs, leading to the generation of incorrect triples. To address this issue, This paper introduces a Ground Entity Extractor which is designed to aid the Dual Entity Linker (DEL), in addition, adversarial training methods are introduced during the DEL training process. Experimental results demonstrate that the DEL model extracts entity pairs from two directions, when compared to the previous BIRTE model, it generates more accurate entity pairs. On the WebNLG dataset, The accuracy increased by 2.9%, and F1 improved by 1.1%. On the NYT10 dataset, accuracy increased by 1.0%, recall increased by 0.5%, and F1 score improved by 0.7%. This brings significant enhancements to the triple entity extraction task, and in comparison with 8 baseline models across all datasets, the DEL model achieves better results.},

Secondly, it used the Adam optimizer for gradient descent to optimize network weights; then, for the evaluation of geometric accuracy and data integrity, this article adjusted the number of network layers and convolution kernel size. At the same time, this article integrated a differential privacy framework into the model, dynamically adjusted the privacy budget, and finally evaluated the building information modeling model for automated generation and protection. The research results indicated that the building information modeling model had an accuracy of 0.94 in aligning the edges of the structural framework, and the internal partition wall angle deviation was only 0.10. Its error in the area covered by internal partitions and floors was only 0.04, with a success rate of 0.82 for data leakage risk, a detection rate of 0.91, and a response time of 0.09 s.

  abstract     = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various artificial intelligence domains, particularly in pattern recognition, image processing, and speech recognition. However, the growing complexity of these models introduces challenges related to parameter redundancy, significantly impacting CNN performance. This paper addresses the issue of increasing parameter redundancy, focusing on the specific problem of filter redundancy during CNN training. The proposed approach involves regularization of the initialization filters to reduce redundancy at each convolutional layer. A novel layer, PFRCosSim, is introduced, computing the Cosine similarity between filters used in CNN training to ensure filter homogeneity. we reset the filters using an Orthogonal initialization based on the random choice of kernels concerning all filters in the same layers. The method is tested on a three-layer CNN model and extended to common architectures like LeNet and VGG16. Validation is performed through plant disease classification using datasets: Plant Pathology 2020 and Plant Disease Recognition. The application of this approach yields significant accuracy improvements, exceeding $$99 \%$$ .},

  abstract     = {Agriculture holds profound significance in the lives and livelihoods of Bangladesh’s population. The escalating population has contributed to a reduction in available arable land, exacerbating concerns about the feasibility of farming. In various regions of Bangladesh, there is a prevailing perception that certain areas are unsuitable for cultivation. Consequently, a substantial amount of land still needs to be tapped and explored for agricultural purposes, contributing to underutilization and hindering potential agricultural development in these regions. Considering these issues, this study seeks to forecast the optimal crop choices for specific soil classes, enabling individuals to make more informed decisions about crop cultivation on their land. Initially, the soil class is identified based on its unique characteristics within a given area, and subsequently, crop selection is determined based on these distinct soil classes. This study explores the performance of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). It proposes a hybrid PSO-GA technique to optimize the Decision Tree model for forecasting crop cultivation based on classifying soil. The performance of a standalone decision tree model is also measured. In soil classification, the hybrid PSO-GA approach demonstrates superior performance, achieving an accuracy of 96.04%, surpassing individual PSO, GA, and standalone decision tree methods. In crop cultivation prediction, the hybrid approach outperforms individual PSO, GA, and decision tree methods with an accuracy of 92.63%. The results highlight the efficacy of the integrated PSO-GA strategy in optimizing the DT model for precise agricultural predictions. This research contributes valuable insights for enhancing decision support systems in agriculture, providing a promising avenue for improved accuracy in soil classification and crop cultivation prediction.},
