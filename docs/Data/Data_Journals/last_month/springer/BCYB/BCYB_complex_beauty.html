  abstract     = {The stability–robustness–resilience–adaptiveness continuum in neuronal processing follows a hierarchical structure that explains interactions and information processing among the different time scales. Interestingly, using “canonical” neuronal computational circuits, such as Homeostatic Activity Regulation, Winner-Take-All, and Hebbian Temporal Correlation Learning, one can extend the behavior spectrum towards antifragility. Cast already in both probability theory and dynamical systems, antifragility can explain and define the interesting interplay among neural circuits, found, for instance, in sensorimotor control in the face of uncertainty and volatility. This perspective proposes a new framework to analyze and describe closed-loop neuronal processing using principles of antifragility, targeting sensorimotor control. Our objective is two-fold. First, we introduce antifragile control as a conceptual framework to quantify closed-loop neuronal network behaviors that gain from uncertainty and volatility. Second, we introduce neuronal network design principles, opening the path to neuromorphic implementations and transfer to technical systems.},

  abstract     = {Anxious emotional states disrupt decision-making and control of dexterous motor actions. Computational work has shown that anxiety-induced uncertainty alters the rate at which we learn about the environment, but the subsequent impact on the predictive beliefs that drive action control remains to be understood. In the present work we tested whether anxiety alters predictive (oculo)motor control mechanisms. Thirty participants completed an experimental task that consisted of manual interception of a projectile performed in virtual reality. Participants were subjected to conditions designed to induce states of high or low anxiety using performance incentives and social-evaluative pressure. We measured subsequent effects on physiological arousal, self-reported state anxiety, and eye movements. Under high pressure conditions we observed visual sampling of the task environment characterised by higher variability and entropy of position prior to release of the projectile, consistent with an active attempt to reduce uncertainty. Computational modelling of predictive beliefs, using gaze data as inputs to a partially observable Markov decision process model, indicated that trial-to-trial updating of predictive beliefs was reduced during anxiety, suggesting that updates to priors were constrained. Additionally, state anxiety was related to a less deterministic mapping of beliefs to actions. These results support the idea that organisms may attempt to counter anxiety-related uncertainty by moving towards more familiar and certain sensorimotor patterns.},
