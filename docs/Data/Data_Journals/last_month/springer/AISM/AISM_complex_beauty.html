  abstract     = {This paper provides a novel perspective on feature screening in the analysis of high-dimensional right-censored large-p-large-N survival data. The research introduces a distributed feature screening method known as Aggregated Distance Correlation Screening (ADCS). The proposed screening framework involves expressing the distance correlation measure as a function of multiple component parameters, each of which can be estimated in a distributed manner using a natural U-statistic from data segments. By aggregating the component estimates, a final correlation estimate is obtained, facilitating feature screening. Importantly, this approach does not necessitate any specific model specification for responses or predictors and is effective with heavy-tailed data. The study establishes the consistency of the proposed aggregated correlation estimator $$\widetilde{\omega }_{j}$$ under mild conditions and demonstrates the sure screening property of the ADCS. Empirical results from both simulated and real datasets confirm the efficacy and practicality of the ADCS approach proposed in this paper.},

  abstract     = {Propensity score weighting is widely used to correct the selection bias in the sample with missing data. The propensity score function is often developed using a model for the response probability, which completely ignores the outcome regression model. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach by developing smoothed propensity score weights that provide a more efficient estimation by removing unnecessary auxiliary variables in the propensity score model. The smoothed propensity score function is obtained by applying the information projection of the original propensity score function to the space that satisfies the moment conditions on the balancing scores obtained from the outcome regression model. By including the covariates for the outcome regression models only in the density ratio model, we can achieve an efficiency gain. Penalized regression is used to identify important covariates. Some limited simulation studies are presented to compare with the existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Statistical inference for high-dimensional parameters (HDPs) can leverage their intrinsic correlations, as spatially or temporally close parameters tend to have similar values. This is why nonlinear mixed-effects models (NMMs) are commonly used for HDPs. Conversely, in many practical applications, the random effects (REs) in NMMs are correlated HDPs that should remain constant during repeated sampling for frequentist inference. In both scenarios, the inference should be conditional on REs, instead of marginal inference by integrating out REs. We summarize recent theory of conditional inference for NMM, and then propose a bias-corrected RE predictor and confidence interval (CI). We also extend this methodology to accommodate the case where some REs are not associated with data. Simulation studies indicate our new approach leads to substantial improvement in the conditional coverage rate of RE CIs, including CIs for smooth functions in generalized additive models, compared to the existing method based on marginal inference.},

An approximation of the unobserved component is proposed, which involves three steps. First, a method of moment estimator of unknown parameters is constructed, and second, this estimator is used to define the one-step MLE-process. Finally, the last estimator is substituted into the equations of the Kalman filter. The solution of obtained equations provides us with the desired approximation (adaptive Kalman filter). The asymptotic properties of all the mentioned estimators and both maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimators of the unknown parameters are detailed. The asymptotic efficiency of adaptive filtering is discussed.},

  abstract     = {Exploring more accurate estimates of financial value at risk (VaR) has always been an important issue in applied statistics. To this end either quantile or expectile regression methods are widely employed at present, but an accumulating body of research indicates that $$L^{p}$$ quantile regression outweighs both quantile and expectile regression in many aspects. In view of this, the paper extends $$L^{p}$$ quantile regression to a general classical nonlinear conditional autoregressive model and proposes a new model called the conditional $$L^{p}$$ quantile nonlinear autoregressive regression model (CAR- $$L^{p}$$ -quantile model for short). Limit theorems for regression estimators are proved in mild conditions, and algorithms are provided for obtaining parameter estimates and the optimal value of p. Simulation study of estimation’s quality is given. Then, a CLVaR method calculating VaR based on the CAR- $$L^{p}$$ -quantile model is elaborated. Finally, a real data analysis is conducted to illustrate virtues of our proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {The IHK program is a general framework in asymptotic decision theory, introduced by Ibragimov and Hasminskii and extended to semimartingales by Kutoyants. The quasi-likelihood analysis (QLA) asserts that a polynomial type large deviation inequality is always valid if the quasi-likelihood random field is asymptotically quadratic and if a key index reflecting the identifiability is non-degenerate. As a result, following the IHK program, the QLA gives a way to inference for various nonlinear stochastic processes. This paper provides a reformed and simplified version of the QLA and improves accessibility to the theory. As an example of the advantages of the scheme, the user can obtain asymptotic properties of the quasi-Bayesian estimator by only verifying non-degeneracy of the key index.},
