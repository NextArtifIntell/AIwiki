  abstract     = {Single object tracking is a vital task of many applications in critical fields. However, it is still considered one of the most challenging vision tasks. In recent years, computer vision, especially object tracking, witnessed the introduction or adoption of many novel techniques, setting new fronts for performance. In this survey, we visit some of the cutting-edge techniques in vision, such as Sequence Models, Generative Models, Self-supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Meta-Learning, Continual Learning, and Domain Adaptation, focusing on their application in single object tracking. We propose a novel categorization of single object tracking methods based on novel techniques and trends. Also, we conduct a comparative analysis of the performance reported by the methods presented on popular tracking benchmarks. Moreover, we analyze the pros and cons of the presented approaches and present a guide for non-traditional techniques in single object tracking. Finally, we suggest potential avenues for future research in single-object tracking.},

  abstract     = {In the process of attribute reduction, the method of attribute selection holds significant importance. Different selection methods can significantly impact the efficiency and outcomes of attribute reduction. Presently, the common approach involves constructing a measure to evaluate the significance of attribute and subsequently selecting the optimal attribute to include in the reduction set based on this measure. However, most existing measures predominantly focus on the relationship between attributes and target concepts, overlooking the inter-relationships among attributes themselves. This paper defines the relationships between attributes based on the variation in significance and utilizes this concept to design a general algorithm for accelerating attribute reduction. Firstly, we introduce the concept of the similarity of attributes, where attributes exhibiting greater overlap in their classification abilities for the target set are deemed more similar. Subsequently, utilizing this concept, a cover is constructed over the original set of attributes. Then, an algorithm for accelerating attribute reduction is devised by integrating the constructed cover into a greedy attribute reduction algorithm. Finally, we conduct experiments on 12 UCI datasets. Compared to four benchmark algorithms, the proposed algorithm effectively reduces runtime while maintaining classification accuracy. The effectiveness of the algorithm is further validated using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.},

Current LE techniques concentrate on learning each instance individually, which ignores the instance correlation. In this paper, we propose to learn a cluster-wise label distribution (CWLD) shared by all instances of the cluster to explore the instance correlation. The softmax-normalized sum of the CWLD and the logical label vector yields the label distribution. CWLD is learned in an iterative manner. Following instance clustering, the label distributions of all instances in each cluster are averaged. The asymmetric label correlation is then mined using heat conduction. This process is repeated until the label distribution has reached a point of convergence. Experiments were undertaken on thirteen real-world datasets compared with six state-of-the-art algorithms. Results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.},

Despite existing approaches have shown remarkable results in incorporating external knowledge to enhance visual entity information, they still suffer from two problems: (1) the image-aspect global relevance. (2) the entity-aspect local alignment. To tackle these issues, we propose a Relevance-Aware Visual Entity Filter Network (REF) for MABSA. Specifically, we utilize the nouns of ANPs extracted from the given image as bridges to facilitate cross-modal feature alignment. Moreover, we introduce an additional “UNRELATED” marker word and utilize Contrastive Content Re-sourcing (CCR) and Contrastive Content Swapping (CCS) constraints to obtain accurate attention weight to identify image-aspect relevance for dynamically controlling the contribution of visual information. We further adopt the accurate reversed attention weight distributions to selectively filter out aspect-unrelated visual entities for better entity-aspect alignment. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the consistent superiority of our REF model over state-of-the-art approaches on the Twitter-2015 and Twitter-2017 datasets.},

To address this issue, we propose a novel Multi-label Weak-label learning algorithm via Low-rank Label correlations (MW2L). First, we propagate the structural and semantic information from the feature space to the label space to effectively capture label-related information and recover lost labels. Second, we incorporate global and local low-rank label correlation information to ensure that the label-related matrix is informative. Last, we use label correlations to supplement the original weak-label matrix and form a unified learning framework. We evaluate the performance of our approach on several benchmark datasets and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and robustness to weak-label noise. The proposed approach can effectively handle incomplete and noisy weak labels in multi-label learning and outperforms existing methods.},

To solve the equation, the initial boundary value conditions of both the differential equation and the rational polynomial neural network are integrated into the construction of the numerical solution. This construction transforms the Bratu-type equation into a set of nonlinear equations, which are subsequently solved using an appropriate optimization technique.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have gained prominence recently, finding extensive utility in edge detection. Previous methods primarily emphasized edge prediction accuracy, ignoring edge refinement. In this work, we introduce a novel encoder-decoder architecture that effectively harnesses hierarchical features. By extending the decoder horizontally, we progressively enhance resolution to preserve intricate details from the original image, thereby producing sharp edges. Additionally, we propose a novel loss function named the Pixel-Patch Combination Loss (P2CL), which employs distinct detection strategies in edge and non-edge regions to bolster network accuracy and yield crisp edges. Furthermore, considering the practicality of the algorithm, our method strikes a fine balance between accuracy and model size. It delivers precise and sharp edges while ensuring efficient model operation, thereby laying a robust foundation for advancements deployed on mobile devices or embedded systems. Our method was evaluated on three publicly available datasets, including BSDS500, Multicue, and BIPED. The experimental results show the superiority of our approach, achieving a competitive ODS F-score of 0.832 on the BSDS500 benchmark and significantly enhancing edge detection accuracy.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence and automation technology, interest in autonomous driving research is also growing. However, under heavy rain, fog, and other adverse weather conditions, the visual quality of the images is reduced due to suspended atmospheric particles that affect the vehicle’s visual perception system, which is not conducive to the autonomous driving system’s accurate perception of the road environment. To address these challenges, this article presents a computationally efficient end-to-end light-weight Transformer-like neural network called LWTD (Light-Weight Transformer-like DehazeNet) to reconstruct haze-free images for driving tasks, which based on the reformulated ASM theory without prior knowledge. First, a strategy for simplifying the atmospheric light and transmission map into a feature map is adopted, a CMT (Convolutional Mapping Transformer) module for the extraction of global features is developed, and the hazy image is decomposed into a base layer (global features) and a detail layer (local features) for Low-Level, Medium-Level, and High-Level stages. Meanwhile, a channel attention module is introduced to weigh and assign the weights of each feature, and to fuse them with the reformulated ASM (Atmospheric Scattering Model) model to restore the haze-free image. Second, a joint loss function of the graphical features is formulated to further direct the network to converge in the direction of abundant features. In addition, a dataset of real-world fog driving is constructed. Extensive experiments with synthetic and natural hazy images confirmed the superiority of the proposed method through quantitative and qualitative evaluations on various datasets. Furthermore, additional experiments validated the applicability of the proposed method for traffic participant detection and semantic segmentation tasks.

Then Bi-GRU is leveraged to realize bidirectional semantic union, comprehensively extracting bidirectional semantic information. Combining this network with the attention mechanism allows for assigning greater weights to the semantic information that has a more significant role in determining the relationship classes of sentences. This, in turn, makes feature selection more efficient. Finally, the relationship is classified using the Softmax function.

  abstract     = {With the development and progress of technology, information becomes increasingly diverse, which poses higher demands on decision-making methods. Probabilistic linguistic term set (PLTS) is a tool that can more intuitively express the evaluations of decision makers (DMs). As a specialized form of PLTS with ignored probabilities, weak probabilistic linguistic term set (WPLTS) can describe incomplete or inaccurate evaluation information. Three-way decision (3WD) is an efficient decision-making method that reduces decision cost by adopting delayed decisions on the boundary domain. In this paper, we propose a novel 3WD method by combining 3WD with the complex proportional assessment (COPRAS) method under the WPLTS environment, named the WPLTS-3WD method. Firstly, we introduce the notion of the WPLTS information system. For a WPLTS information system, we propose a method of complementing the ignored probabilities and a new score function. Secondly, the objects are ranked by the COPRAS method. According to the ranking result, we define the dominance relation and dominance sets. Based on the dominance sets, the conditional probabilities can be estimated. By combining the conditional probabilities with relative loss functions, the expected losses will be obtained and the objects can be classified. Moreover, we propose two conversion functions that can convert real-valued and linguistic term evaluation information into PLTS evaluation information. Finally, we use the proposed WPLTS-3WD method to analyze the air quality of four cities. The rationality and advantages of our method are verified through experimental comparisons with other methods and parameter analysis.},

This research presents a scalable system that combines machine and deep learning models with optimized data processing to secure IoT devices against DDoS attacks. A real-world 5G-IoT network simulation dataset was used to evaluate performance. Robust feature selection identified the 10 most informative features from the high-dimensional data. These features were used to train eight classifiers, namely: k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and hybrid CNN-LSTM models for DDoS attack detection. Experiments demonstrated 99.99% and 99.98% accuracy for multiclass and binary classification using the proposed hybrid CNN-LSTM model. Crucially, time- and space-complexity analysis validates real-world feasibility. Unlike prior works, this system optimally balances accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability through a precisely engineered model architecture, outperforming existing models.

  abstract     = {The mean–variance (MV) model provides numerous optimal portfolios for managing a firm&#39;s asset portfolio. Portfolio decisions in large corporations involve many interest groups, such as shareholders, bondholders, and employees, and require the assistance of large experts. However, experts from different departments with different cognitive levels and interests can differ or even conflict in their assessments of portfolios. To guarantee their interests, some experts may exhibit non-cooperative behavior, thus reducing the efficiency of reaching a consensus. To tackle this issue, the research aims to develop a large-scale group interactive portfolio optimization method that incorporates non-cooperative behaviors and leverages social network analysis (SN-LSGDM-NC-PO). First, various consensus feedback strategies based on minimum adjustment are formulated to provide advice during the negotiation process according to the global and local levels. Then, considering the acceptance of advice and the effect of expert adjustment on consensus, a new measure of non-cooperative behavior is designed. Non-cooperative behavior by experts can affect trust relations in a social network. Therefore, trust reward and penalty mechanisms, preference penalty mechanisms, and an exit mechanism are developed to manage different types of non-cooperative behavior. Experimental and comparison results demonstrate that the proposed SN-LSGDM-NC-PO algorithm can effectively manage the non-cooperative behaviors and reduce interaction consensus costs.},

However, existing deep learning-based methods are often accompanied by a large number of parameters and ignore the use of deep features. In this work, we propose a novel Self-Ensemble Feedback Recurrent Network (SEFRN) for fast MRI reconstruction inspired by recursive learning and ensemble learning strategies. Specifically, a lightweight but powerful Data Consistency Residual Group (DCRG) is proposed for feature extraction and data stabilization. Meanwhile, an efficient Wide Activation Module (WAM) is introduced between different DCRGs to encourage more activated features to pass through the model. In addition, a Feedback Enhancement Recurrent Architecture (FERA) is designed to reuse the model parameters and deep features. Moreover, combined with the specially designed Automatic Selection and Integration Module (ASIM), different stages of the recurrent model can elegantly implement self-ensemble learning and synergize the sub-networks to improve the overall performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves competitive results and strikes a good balance between the size, complexity, and performance of the model.},

  abstract     = {The fusion of side information in sequential recommendation (SR) is a recommendation system technique that combines a user’s historical behavior sequence with additional side information to provide more accurate personalized recommendations. Recent methods are based on self-attention mechanisms, incorporating side information as part of the attention matrix to update item representations. We believe that the integration method via self-attention mechanisms does not fully utilize side information. Therefore, we designed a new Enhanced Side Information Fusion framework (ESIF) for sequential recommendations. Specifically, we have altered the fusion strategy by using an attention matrix to simultaneously update the representations of items and side information, thereby increasing the use of side information. The attention matrix serves to balance various features, ensuring effective utilization of side information throughout the fusion process. We designed a Gated Linear Representation Fusion Module, comprising linear transformations and gated units. The linear transformation processes the input data, while the gated unit dynamically adjusts the degree of information flow based on the input. This module then combines the updated item representation with the side information representation for more efficient use of side information. Additionally, user interaction behavior data inevitably contains noise. The presence of noise can disrupt the model’s performance, affecting the accuracy and reliability of the results. Therefore, we introduced a denoising module in ESIF to enhance recommendation accuracy by reducing noise. Our experimental results demonstrate that ESIF achieves superior performance across five real-world datasets, surpassing the current state-of-the-art side information fusion SR models.},

  abstract     = {SAT-based formal verification is a systematic process to prove the correctness of computer hardware design based on formal specifications, providing an alternative to time-consuming simulations and ensuring design reliability and accuracy. Predicting the runtime of SAT solvers is important to effectively allocate verification resources and determine if the verification can be completed within time limits. Predicting SAT solver runtime is challenging due to variations in solving time across different solvers and dependence on problem complexity and solver mechanisms. Existing approaches rely on feature engineering and machine learning, but they have drawbacks in terms of expert knowledge requirements and time-consuming feature extraction. To address this, using graph neural networks (GNNs) for runtime prediction is considered, as they excel in capturing graph topology and relationships. However, directly applying existing GNNs to predict SAT solver runtime does not yield satisfactory results, as SAT solvers’ proving procedure is crucial. In this paper, we propose a novel model, TESS, that integrates the working mechanism of SAT solvers with graph neural networks (GNNs) for predicting solving time. The model incorporates a graph representation inspired by the CDCL paradigm, proposes adaptive aggregation for multilayer information and separate modules for conflict learning. Experimental results on multiple datasets validate the effectiveness, scalability, and robustness of our model, outperforming baselines in SAT solver runtime prediction.},

In this paper, we draw an analogy between the propagation of GNNs and particle systems in physics, proposing a model-agnostic enhancement framework. This framework enriches the graph structure by introducing additional nodes and rewiring connections with both positive and negative weights, guided by node labeling information. We theoretically verify that GNNs enhanced through our approach can effectively circumvent the over-smoothing issue and exhibit robustness against over-squashing. Moreover, we conduct a spectral analysis on the rewired graph to demonstrate that the corresponding GNNs can fit both homophilic and heterophilic graphs. Empirical validations on benchmarks for homophilic, heterophilic graphs, and long-term graph datasets show that GNNs enhanced by our method significantly outperform their original counterparts.},

A significant innovation in our method is the use of historical data to form a sample average approximation that directly informs the MIP model, bypassing the need for distributional assumptions to enhance solution robustness. Additionally, we implement a model improvement strategy to reduce the computational burden, making our method more scalable for large-scale power systems. Our approach is validated against benchmark systems, i.e., IEEE 14-, 57- and 118-bus systems, demonstrating superior performance in terms of cost-efficiency and robustness, with lower computational demand compared to existing methods.},

This study introduces a more versatile approach by decoupling the adaptive policy from the translation model. Our rationale is based on the finding that an independent multi-path wait-k model, when combined with adaptive policies utilized in advanced SiMT systems, can perform competitively. Specifically, we present DaP, a divergence-based adaptive policy, which dynamically adjusts read/write decisions for any translation model, taking into account potential divergence in translation distributions resulting from future information.

  abstract     = {Fake news detection aims to automatically identify the credibility of source posts, mitigating potential societal harm and conserving human resources. Textual fake news detection methods can be categorized into pattern- and fact-based. Pattern-based models focus on identifying shared writing patterns in source posts, while fact-based models leverage auxiliary external knowledge. Researchers have recently attempted to merge these two views into a comprehensive detection system, achieving superior performance to single-view methods. However, existing dual-view methods often prioritize integrating single-view methods over exploring nuanced characteristics of both perspectives. To address this, we propose a novel hierarchical dual-view model for fake news detection guided by discriminative lexicons. First, we construct two lexicons based on distinct word usage tendencies in fake and real news and further augment them with synonyms sourced from large language models. We then devise a hierarchical attention network to derive semantic representations for the source post, incorporating a lexicon attention loss to guide the prioritization of words from the two lexicons. Subsequently, a lexicon-guided interaction network is employed to model the relations between the source post and its relevant articles, assigning authenticity-aware weights to each article. Finally, the representations of source post and relevant articles are concatenated for joint detection. According to experimental results, our model outperforms many competitive baselines in terms of the macro F1 score ranging from 1.1% to 10.5% on Weibo and from 3.2% to 10.8% on Twitter.},

Most existing approaches use two-stage networks to improve a model’s ability to characterize objects of unknown classes, which leads to slow inference. To address this issue, we proposed a single-stage unknown object detection method based on the contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) model and pseudo-labelling, called CLIP-YOLO. First, a visual language embedding alignment method is introduced and a channel-grouped enhanced coordinate attention module is embedded into a YOLO-series detection head and feature-enhancing component, to improve the model’s ability to characterize and detect unknown category objects. Second, the pseudo-labelling generation is optimized based on the CLIP model to expand the diversity of the training set and enhance the ability to cover unknown object categories. We validated this method on four challenging datasets: MSCOCO, ILSVRC, Visual Genome, and PASCAL VOC. The results show that our method can achieve higher accuracy and faster speed, so as to obtain better performance of unknown object detection.

  abstract     = {The long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) plays a crucial role in various domains, utilizing a large amount of historical data to forecast trends over an extended future time range. However, in real-life scenarios, the performance of LTSF is often hindered by missing data. Few-shot learning aims to address the issue of data scarcity, but there is relatively little research on using few-shot learning to tackle sample scarcity in long-term time series forecasting tasks, and most few-shot learning methods rely on transfer learning. To address this problem, this paper proposes a Siamese network-based time series Transformer (SiaTST) for the task of LTSF in a few-shot setting. To increase the diversity of input scales and better capture local features in time series, we adopt a dual-level hierarchical input strategy. Additionally, we introduce a learnable prediction token (LPT) to capture global features of the time series. Furthermore, a feature fusion layer is utilized to capture dependencies among multiple variables and integrate information from different levels. Experimental results on 7 popular LSTF datasets demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

  abstract     = {It is an ordinary practice that deep networks are utilized to extract deep features from RGB images. Typically, the popular trackers adopt pre-trained ResNet as a backbone to extract target features, achieving excellent performance. Moreover, Staple has shown that color statistics have complementary cues, while the combination of color statistics and deep features in a unified deep framework has rarely been reported. Therefore, we employ color statistics to construct color attention maps, which are encoded into the deep network to guide the generation of target-aware feature maps. Additionally, DCF-based trackers have an online update module to dynamically update the tracking model, it is particularly necessary to collect reliable target samples. Hence, we refer to the template matching thought to design a score matching method, which is intended to score the tracked targets, this method has the advantage of considering the target extent. In this paper, we conduct sufficient ablation analyses on the color attention module and score matching method to verify their effectiveness. Furthermore, our approaches are combined into the DCF frameworks to construct two brand-new trackers, and both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that our trackers can perform favorably against recent and far more sophisticated trackers on multiple public benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {This study presents a pioneering solution to the growing challenge of escalating global crime rates through the introduction of an automated drone-based street crime detection system. Leveraging advanced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, the system integrates several key components for analyzing images captured by drones. Initially, the Embedding Bilateral Filter (EBF) technique divides images into base and detail layers to enhance detection accuracy. The fusion model, IR with attention-based Conv-ViT, combines Inception-V3, ResNet-50, and Convolution Vision Transformer (Conv-ViT) to capture both shape and texture details efficiently. Further enhancement is achieved through the Improved Shark Smell Optimization Algorithm (ISSOA), which optimizes feature selection and minimizes redundancy in image extraction. Additionally, a Multi-scale Contextual Semantic Guidance Network (MCS-GNet) ensures robust image classification by integrating features from multiple layers to prevent data loss. Evaluation on the UCF-Crime and UCSD Ped2 datasets demonstrates superior accuracy, with remarkable results of 0.783 and 0.974, respectively. This innovative approach offers a promising solution to the arduous and continuous task of monitoring security camera feeds for suspicious activities, thereby addressing the pressing need for automated crime detection systems on a global scale.},

  abstract     = {Recently, methods for modeling images in frequency domain have attracted widespread attention. Frequency methods transform image into spectrum as model input by defining a set of basis functions, where each point in frequency domain represents image’s projection at the corresponding frequency, which helps to understand structure, texture, and other basic features of the image. Studies have shown that frequency learning methods based on fixed small-scale Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) basis functions outperform spatial domain methods. However, frequency learning also faces the challenge of feature saturation bottleneck, particularly fixed DCT basis functions makes the frequency learning model more prone to reaching saturation. Therefore, we propose a multi-scale frequency domain learning approach that utilizes multi-scale DCT basis functions to extract diversified frequency features. Our method employs sampling and cropping techniques to extend the frequency features from a single-scale DCT basis functions mapping to a multi-scale mapping. This ensures that the image projection exists at as many frequencies as possible so that advanced features can be extracted over multiple frequency ranges to overcome the saturation bottleneck of network models. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our approach in texture classification tasks.},

Traditional federated learning performs well on the premise that all clients have the same learning ability or similar learning tasks. However, resource and data heterogeneity are inevitable among clients in real-world scenarios, leading to the situation that existing federated learning mechanisms cannot achieve high accuracy in short response time. In this study, an effective federated learning framework with cross-resource client collaboration, termed CEFL, is proposed to coordinate clients with different capacities to help each other, efficiently and adequately reflecting collective intelligence. Clients are categorized into different clusters based on their computational resources in the hierarchical framework. Resource-rich clusters use their knowledge to assist resource-limited clusters converge rapidly. Once resource-limited clusters have the ability to mentor others, resource-rich clusters learn from the resource-limited clusters in their favor to improve their own effectiveness. A cloud server provides tailored assistance to each cluster with a personalized model through an adaptive multi-similarity metric, in order for each cluster to learn the most useful knowledge. The experiments fully demonstrate that the proposed method not only has superior accuracy with significantly reduced latency but also improves the convergence rate compared to other state-of-the-art federated learning methods in addressing the problem of resource and data heterogeneity.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge graph (KG) based recommender systems have shown promise in improving accuracy and interpretability. They reveal the intrinsic relationships of knowledge through the associations and paths between entities for personalized recommendations. However, existing approaches do not adequately consider the high-order connections between neighboring nodes in the relational graph, resulting in a lack of sufficient capture of structured information. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-enhanced recommendation model via dynamic co-attention and high-order connectivity (DCHC) to address this issue. First, we construct a hybrid graph by aligning users and items in the user-item bipartite graph with entities in the KG. As a result, we are able to simultaneously consider the interaction between users and items as well as the entity information in the KG, thereby gaining a more comprehensive understanding of user behavior and interests. Second, we explicitly model the high-order connections between entities through the hybrid structured graphs in an end-to-end manner. Therefore, we not only explored the complex interactive relationships between entities but also ensured the accurate capture of structural information in the graph. Third, we employ a dynamic co-attention mechanism to enhance the representation of users and items, effectively exploiting the potential correlation between them. We therefore effectively exploited the potential correlation between users and items and successfully integrating these relationships into their representations. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmarks demonstrate that DCHC outperforms state-of-the-art KG-based recommendation methods.},

  abstract     = {This research introduces a new method to tackle the issue of exchanging cryptographic keys in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). This study focuses on the inefficiency and lengthy evaluation procedures of conventional cryptographic key exchange algorithms, which are not appropriate for the rapid and constantly changing IIoT device environment. In the solution domain, the proposed approach uses synchronization of neural networks with vector valued and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), merging drive-response mechanisms to enhance speed and efficiency in crucial operations. The research examines the influence of postponements on the generating arbitrary inputs and coordination challenges in RNNs that incorporate drive-response mechanisms for synchronized input vector creation. This article explains an elementary evaluation of coordination in Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) by utilizing an RNN framework to structure ANNs for sharing session keys. The study provides multiple contributions: (1) employing the polynomial coordination technique to generate coordinated inputs for the ANN synchronization process using RNNs, (2) using Lyapunov formulas and inequality assessment methods to identify required control parameters and time-varying conditions for achieving synchronization in the drive-response systems proposed with polynomial and non-polynomial functions, (3) demonstrating the connection between polynomial and non-polynomial synchronization with numerical illustrations, and (4) designing symmetric layouts of ANNs to create a session keys in the IIoT network. The suggested technique outperforms existing methods in the literature by offering a quicker, more dependable solution for cryptographic key exchange, paving the way for improved and secure industrial applications. This new method not only fixes current inefficiencies but also paves the way for future improvements in secure communication in the IIoT environment.},

The extraction strategies for global features are less developed, which has degraded the reliability of the predictions. In this study, a novel multi-dynamic residual graph convolutional network with global feature enhancement is proposed to solve these problems and achieve an accurate and reliable traffic flow prediction. First, multiple graph generators are proposed, which fully preserve the original sequence features of the traffic data and enable layered depth-wise modeling of the dynamic correlations among sensors through a residual mechanism. Second, an output module is proposed to explore extraction strategies for global features, by employing a residual mechanism and parameter sharing strategy to maintain the consistency of the global features. Finally, a new layered network architecture is proposed, which not only leverages the advantages of both static and dynamic graphs, but also captures the spatiotemporal dependencies among sensors.

  abstract     = {Heterogeneous graph data are ubiquitous and extracting information from them is increasingly crucial. Existing approaches for modeling heterogeneous graphs often rely on the splitting strategy guided by meta-paths or relations. However, the splitting strategy falls short in capturing the rich semantic information and topological structure of heterogeneous graphs comprehensively, as well as the hidden semantic associations between various edge types. Moreover, establishing meta-paths for heterogeneous graphs requires substantial expert experience and domain knowledge, making the process time-consuming, laborious, and often inaccurate. To address these challenges, we propose a novel heterogeneous graph neural network called RHGNN, which overcomes the reliance on meta-paths by modeling the heterogeneous graph as a whole instead of splitting it, and jointly obtains personalized feature representations for nodes and edges. Specifically, we first introduce the pre-training strategy Type2vec to learn feature representations of edge types and extract the semantic and structural information of the entire heterogeneous graph. Then we view the heterogeneous graph as a homogeneous one, and design a new information propagation and aggregation mechanism for both nodes and edges to learn their representations. Based on the assumption that edges with the same type have similar representations, we introduce an explicit regularization method based on the relational inductive bias to impose smoothness constraints on the model. Experimental results demonstrate that RHGNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models on both node-level and edge-level tasks.},

To overcome these limitations, in this research work an innovative Hybrid dual path Bidirectional long short-term memory Kepler dynamic graph Convolutional Network (HBKCN) is proposed to analyze and detect android malwares effectively. First, the augmented abstract syntax tree is applied for pre-processing and extracts the string function from each malware.

Finally, the proposed HBKCN classifies benign and malware apps based on their specifications. Four benchmark datasets, namely Drebin, VirusShare, Malgenome -215, and MaMaDroid datasets, are employed to estimate the effectiveness of the technique. The result demonstrates that the HBKCN technique achieved excellent performance with respect to a few important metrics compared to existing methods. Moreover, detection accuracies of 99.2%, 99.1%,99.8% and 99.8% are achieved for the considered datasets, respectively.

In this paper, we propose a reciprocal interlayer-temporal discriminative target model for robust visual tracking. Firstly, an interlayer target-aware enhancement model is constructed, which establishes pixel-by-pixel correlation between the template and search region to achieve interlayer feature information interaction. This alleviates the cumulative error caused by the blindness of the target to search region during feature extraction, enhancing target perception. Secondly, to weaken the impact of interference, a temporal interference evaluation strategy is designed. It utilizes the interframe candidate propagation module to build associations among multi-candidates in the current frame and the previous frame. Then, the similar distractors are eliminated by using object inference constraint, so as to obtain a more accurate target location. Finally, we integrate the interlayer target-aware enhancement model and temporal interference evaluation strategy into the Siamese framework to achieve reciprocity for robust target tracking. Experimental results show that our tracking approach performs well, especially on seven benchmark datasets, including OTB-100, TC-128, DTB, UAV-123, VOT-2016, VOT-2018 and GOT-10k.},

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks have been widely applied in many fields, but it is found that they are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which can mislead the DNN-based models with imperceptible perturbations. Many adversarial attack methods can achieve great success rates when attacking white-box models, but they usually exhibit poor transferability when attacking black-box models. Momentum iterative gradient-based methods can effectively improve the transferability of adversarial examples. Still, the momentum update mechanism of existing methods may lead to a problem of unstable gradient update direction and result in poor local optima. In this paper, we propose an enhanced spatial momentum iterative gradient-based adversarial attack method. Specifically, we introduce the spatial domain momentum accumulation mechanism. Instead of only accumulating the gradients of data points on the optimization path in the gradient update process, we additionally accumulate the average gradients of multiple sampling points within the neighborhood of data points. This mechanism fully utilizes the contextual gradient information of different regions within the image to smooth the accumulated gradients and find a more stable gradient update direction, thus escaping from poor local optima. Empirical results on the standard ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the attack success rate of momentum iterative gradient-based methods and shows excellent attack performance not only against normally trained models but also against adversarial training and defense models, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Visual recommendation systems have shown remarkable performance by leveraging consumer feedback and the visual attributes of products. However, recent concerns have arisen regarding the decline in recommendation quality when these systems are subjected to attacks that compromise the model parameters. While the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) and iterative FGSM (I-FGSM) are well-studied attack strategies, the momentum iterative FGSM (MI-FGSM), known for its superiority in the computer vision (CV) domain, has been overlooked. This oversight raises the possibility that visual recommender systems may be vulnerable to MI-FGSM, leading to significant vulnerabilities. Adversarial training, a regularization technique designed to withstand MI-FGSM attacks, could be a promising solution to bolster model resilience. In this research, we introduce MI-FGSM for visual recommendation. We propose the Sequential Pairwise Embedding Recommender with MI-FGSM (SPERM), a model that incorporates visual, temporal, and sequential information for visual recommendations through adversarial training. Specifically, we employ higher-order Markov chains to capture consumers’ sequential behaviors and utilize visual pairwise ranking to discern their visual preferences. To optimize the SPERM model, we employ a learning method based on AdaGrad. Moreover, we fortify the SPERM approach with adversarial training, where the primary objective is to train the model to withstand adversarial inputs introduced by MI-FGSM. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by conducting experiments on three Amazon datasets, comparing it with existing visual and adversarial recommendation algorithms. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed SPERM model in addressing adversarial attacks while enhancing visual recommendation performance.},

  abstract     = {This paper aims to provide a novel design of a multiscale framelet convolution for spectral graph neural networks (GNNs). While current spectral methods excel in various graph learning tasks, they often lack the flexibility to adapt to noisy, incomplete, or perturbed graph signals, making them fragile in such conditions. Our newly proposed framelet convolution addresses these limitations by decomposing graph data into low-pass and high-pass spectra through a finely-tuned multiscale approach. Our approach directly designs filtering functions within the spectral domain, allowing for precise control over the spectral components. The proposed design excels in filtering out unwanted spectral information and significantly reduces the adverse effects of noisy graph signals. Our approach not only enhances the robustness of GNNs but also preserves crucial graph features and structures. Through extensive experiments on diverse, real-world graph datasets, we demonstrate that our framelet convolution achieves superior performance in node classification tasks. It exhibits remarkable resilience to noisy data and adversarial attacks, highlighting its potential as a robust solution for real-world graph applications. This advancement opens new avenues for more adaptive and reliable spectral GNN architectures.},
