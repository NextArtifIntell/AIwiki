  abstract     = {We construct a fuzzy mean-semi-absolute deviation portfolio with novel power membership functions. The portfolio return is measured by the Black–Litterman model, which combines the market’s objective information and investors’ subjective preference by the GARCH model. In addition, we use semi-absolute deviation to measure portfolio risk instead of variance, which not only reduces the computational complexity but also considers the corresponding risk lower than the expected return. Considering the investors’ psychological satisfaction with return and risk, we propose two novel power membership functions of return and risk, respectively. We fully demonstrate the shapes of membership functions with different preference parameters and medium satisfaction levels and deeply discuss monotonicity, convexity and concavity using the first- and second-order derivatives by strict mathematical proof. Furthermore, a fuzzy mean-semi-absolute deviation portfolio is proposed based on the satisfaction maximization principle and the absolute value optimization theory. Finally, we give a numerical example and present the results of neutral, pessimistic, and optimistic portfolios. In terms of Sharpe ratio and satisfaction degree, the portfolio model with our proposed novel membership functions is superior to those with S-type membership functions (Watada (2001) Dynamical aspects in fuzzy decision making. Physica, Heidelberg). Moreover, it is more effective than that with standard deviation or absolute deviation to measure risk.},

  abstract     = {ELECTRE TRI-C is a method for sorting problems with imprecise evaluations and stable criteria weights, typically for a single decision-maker. While some extensions have addressed uncertain criteria weights and outranking functions using hesitant fuzzy sets (HFS) and interval type 2 trapezoidal fuzzy numbers (IT2TrfN), there is a gap in handling situations where multiple decision-makers provide uncertain information. This paper presents an extension of the ELECTRE TRI-C method incorporating a stochastic framework to model HFS and IT2TrfN, thereby accommodating subjective judgments from multiple decision-makers. The extended method was validated by sorting 49 projects based on their criticality in a Brazilian electrical power company, involving three decision-makers. The application shows strong correlations in project rankings among decision-makers, but with some exceptions. However, significant variations in acceptability ratings for sorting among decision-makers lead to notable error dispersion, highlighting differences between ranking and sorting outcomes. The key contributions of our approach are as follows: (1) Integration of subjective judgments from multiple decision-makers using IT2TrFN and Monte Carlo Simulation for constructing outranking functions; (2) Aggregation of preferences from multiple decision-makers using HFS; (3) Stochastic processing of both quantitative and qualitative criteria; (4) Integration of linear equations to represent weight constraints; and (5) Introduction of a novel visualization method for comprehensive analysis of stochastic results, enhancing robustness analysis. The proposal’s advantages over alternative methods are also highlighted.},

Because of the complexity and uncertainty of energy demand behavior and many influencing factors, we decide to take advantage of a fuzzy regression model to determine the actual relationships in the energy demand system and provide an accurate forecast of energy demand. For this purpose, because of energy demand drivers, fuzzy possibilistic approaches with symmetric and non-symmetric triangular coefficients are integrated with the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model, each in a time-series format with feedback mechanisms inside. After regularizing the L1 (Lasso regression) and L2 (ridge regression) metrics to minimize the overfitting problem, the optimal fuzzy-ARDL model is obtained. Turkey’s primary energy consumption is projected based on the best model by benchmarking the static and dynamic possibilistic fuzzy regression models according to their training and test values.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the expert evaluations transformed in the multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) model are presented in the discrimination q-rung picture linguistic fuzzy numbers (q-RPLFNs). In the construction of a second-order additive fuzzy measure (TOAFM) the attributes’ interaction indexes and Shapley values are taken into account. The Shapley entropy maximum principle for identification of associated probabilities class (APC) of a TOAFM is constructed. Based on the APC of the TOAFM, a new aggregation operators’ class is constructed which represents some hybrid extensions of ordered weighted averaging (OWA), geometric (OWG), the Choquet integral averaging (CA) and geometric (CG) operators under discrimination q-rung orthopair fuzzy (q-ROF) and q-rung picture linguistic fuzzy (q-RPLF) information. These operators, constructed for the q-RPLF and q-ROF environments, take into account the overall pair interactions among attributes. Main properties on the correctness of extensions are proved: for the lower and upper capacities of order 2, all constructed operators consequently coincide with q-ROF and q-RPLF Choquet averaging and geometric operators, respectively. Constructed operators in the evaluation of prediction of fuzzy Collaborative Filtering Recommender Systems (CFRS) are used. New symmetric discrimination measures as some extensions of discrimination measures for the fuzzy CFRS are proposed. Users’ profile data by the constructed operators in the new similarity measure under q-rung picture linguistic environment are aggregated. The developed new approach is schematically described in such a way that it can be “embedded” in any existing CFRS model. An example is given to illustrate the results, for which the software designed to aggregate profile data for similarity comparison provides the use of new and well-known classical aggregation operators.},

  abstract     = {The livestock sector has exacerbated the problems of ensuring global food safety and greenhouse gas emissions. The rapid increase in livestock production has called to shed light on decision-support tools that develop sustainable production strategies. In this context, this study aims to expand the application of multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDM) methods to assign weights to criteria and classify decision support tools for livestock with a high degree of certainty. In order to begin serious steps to address the global sustainability problem, this study extended the PIPRECIA method with a high-certainty fuzzy environment called Z-cloud rough numbers (ZCRNs) to record the weight of 19 criteria for decision support tools in livestock farming. An innovative and advanced method called CoCoSo has been utilized to rank decision-support tools for livestock farming. The methodology included two stages. The first phase involved developing the decision matrix. The second phase encompassed developing MCDM methods by clarifying the steps of the PIvot Pairwise RElative Criteria Importance Assessment (PIPRECIA) method for assigning weight to criteria, in addition to highlighting the steps of the CoCoSo method for classifying decision support tools in the livestock industry. The results of the PIPRECIA method extended to the fuzzy environment of ZCRNs confirmed that visualization and herd characteristics received the highest weight compared to the rest of the criteria of decision support tools. The CoCoSo results provided insight into ranking alternatives for livestock decision support tools. AgRECalc has the highest ranking, and FCFC has the lowest ranking. This study conducted an evaluation test to increase the chances of generalizing the results of ranking decision-support tools of the livestock industry.},

Then, we interpret some new rules such as addition, scalar multiplication, scalar power, multiplication, and present score function. Moreover, some aggregation operators based on BVCHFSs are presented, such as Bipolar-valued Complex Hesitant Fuzzy-Weighted Dombi Averaging operator (BVCHFWDA), Ordered and Hybrid concepts, and Bipolar valued Complex Hesitant Fuzzy-Weighted Dombi Geometric operator (BVCHFWDG), Ordered and Hybrid structures, and some properties, such as idempotency, monotonicity, and boundedness. Later on, the obtained operators are applied over an investment example to show originality and efficiency of suggested instructions. We test to merits and restrictions of the new instructions by comparing them with some existing measures based on bipolar complex fuzzy sets. The comparative analysis indicates that our discussed operators and distance measures over bipolar complex fuzzy sets are agreement especially for BVCHFWDA.},

The controllability and observability of GrDFDS is analysed with the help of theorems using the controllability Gramian matrix and observability Gramian matrix. In order to illustrate the efficacy of our findings, we hereby give the controllability analysis of an engineering problem pertaining to the compatibility of a descriptor fractional electric circuit. The graph visually represents the outcome, indicating that the granular descriptor dynamical system of the electric circuit can be effectively controlled, leading to the successful transition of its state from the granular initial to the final state.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the multiplicative sampled-data control for the interconnected non-linear partial differential equation (PDE) systems with parameter uncertainties. First, an interval type-2 (IT2) Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy model is employed to reconstruct the studied system. In contrast to type-1 fuzzy sets, IT2 fuzzy sets can handle parameter uncertainties that type-1 fuzzy sets cannot handle, and they can characterize parameter uncertainties by utilizing upper and lower membership functions. Next, based on the IT2 fuzzy model, a sampled-data IT2 fuzzy controller containing multiplicative control gain uncertainties is designed to reduce the control cost, where a Bernoulli distribution is adopted to depict the stochastically occurring multiplicative gain uncertainties. Moreover, to conserve communication resources, a memory event-triggered strategy (METS) is employed to decrease the amount of useless data transmitted in the network channel. In contrast to the event-triggered strategy (ETS), the METS triggers these data with a small relative error between the current data and the latest published data, thereby achieving better control. Finally, an example is given to demonstrate the validity of the proposed methodology.},

  abstract     = {A novel high-order robust control is proposed for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) steering dynamic systems. We creatively adopt the fuzzy set-based characterization to describe the uncertainty. In this way, the fuzzy dynamical USV system is constructed. Then, the proposed control is proven to render the USV system uniformly bounded and uniformly ultimately bounded regardless of the uncertainty. Furthermore, a performance index is designed by considering both system performances and control costs. This index utilized the fuzzy characteristics of the uncertainty. We solve for the optimal control design parameter by minimizing this index. Finally, simulations are performed for different cases. By comparing the detailed simulation results, the effectiveness of the high-order control is demonstrated and the functions of the control parameter are analysed.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) have been attracting researchers from a wide application area due to being easy to apply and interpret. Since its proposal, the method has been improved to satisfy the diverse needs of practitioners such as solving different types of problems and representing particular types of uncertainty. The classical FCMs depend highly on the decision-maker judgments and the uncertainty inherent in the judgments deserves significant attention. Although there are several fuzzy extensions integrated into FCMs, the uncertainty caused by the lack of knowledge, the hesitancy of decision makers, and also the limited capacity of humans to deal with pre-defined rules should be considered. To address this issue, a new distance-based approach integrating Pythagorean Fuzzy Sets and FCMs is proposed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time this extension is integrated into FCMs. Besides allowing to represent the uncertainty until the end of the calculations, the new approach offers decision makers an easier and more flexible way to assess the strength of existing causal relationships. To provide a comparison between the proposed approach and the classical FCMs, two real-life applications are selected as case studies.},

In particular, the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model is applied to the nonlinear plant, and the impact of time-varying actuator saturation is considered in the controller design. The main purpose of this paper is to develop a mode-dependent fuzzy saturation control for fuzzy MJSs over a finite-time interval. With the help of the Lyapunov stability theory and Abel lemma-based finite-sum inequality, it is established that convergence of all states are confirmed through the addressed control design. Correspondingly, the resulting closed-loop system is stochastically finite-time bounded and $$({\mathcal {Q}},{\mathcal {S}},{\mathcal {R}})$$ - $$\gamma$$ -dissipative under linear matrix inequality (LMI) framework. At last, two numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the obtained LMI conditions.},

  abstract     = {The assessment of credit risk in supply chain finance (SCF) stands as a pivotal procedure in facilitating enterprises to identify appropriate financing solutions, reduce financing costs, enhance capital utilization efficiency, and mitigate the risk of debt default. Multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM), a systematic evaluation tool, is widely used for the assessment of both qualitative and quantitative criteria. However, the conventional framework of MCGDM exhibits limitations in addressing scenarios characterized by high uncertainty in risk information, disparity in weights among decision-makers (DMs) and criteria, alongside complex and non-linear risk perception. To address these limitations, this paper introduces an analytical model that integrates Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Sets (IT2FSs), Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT), and the TODIM (an acronym from Portuguese for Interactive and Multicriteria Decision Making) method to evaluate credit risk in SCF. Firstly, the IT2FSs are utilized to represent high uncertainty in risk assessment information of DMs. Secondly, the Dice Similarity is applied to determine the weights of DMs. Then, we seek to improve the Criterion Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC) method by addressing its limitations and further integrating it with the Bayesian Best–Worst Method (BBWM), offering a robust computational framework of integrated weights for criteria. Finally, the CPT-TODIM method based on IT2FSs is applied in a real case from Ping An Bank. Through rigorous sensitivity and comparative analyses conducted within the real-world context of SCF credit risk assessments, the proposed model’s theoretical robustness and practical applicability are emphatically validated.},

Nevertheless, when the data are noisy an overfitting may occur which leads to poor accuracy and generalization ability. Prior information about the nonlinear function may improve fuzzy system performance. In this paper the case when the function is monotonic with respect to some or all variables is considered. Sufficient conditions for the monotonicity of first-order Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy systems with raised cosine membership functions are derived.

  abstract     = {Probabilistic hesitant fuzzy sets are an emerging and popular tool in the decision-making field, skilled at describing subjective information. However, it does not take into account the cognitive limitations of decision makers and the complexity of the actual environment can lead to situations such as multiple values or missing probabilistic information. Considering these issues, we first develop the uncertain probabilistic hesitant fuzzy set (UPHFS) to propose the mixed hesitant fuzzy set (MHFS). Moreover, we further give the computational rules and prove the generalization and robustness of the MHFS. Then, we design two new ratio models, namely the mixed probabilistic hesitant crossover ratio (MPHCR) model and mixed preference probabilistic hesitant crossover ratio (MPPHCR) model, and construct an integrated decision-making model based on them. The integrated decision-making model is a collection of integrated decision models for deriving unknown and mixed probabilities and computing optimal decision outcomes, which is different from the previous studies than the similar studies. Therefore, the model results could be more robust and reliable. Further, based on the proposed fuzzy environments and new decision-making models, we give the whole calculation process and integrated decision-making steps. Lastly, an illustrated example of project investment is provided to apply the above methods, processes, and steps and shows their effectiveness.},
