  abstract     = {Tool wear monitoring is crucial for quality control and cost reduction in manufacturing processes, of which drilling applications are one example. Identification of the wear area in images of cutting inserts is important to building a reliable ground truth for the development of indirect monitoring approaches. Therefore, we present a semantic image segmentation pipeline for wear detection on microscopy images of cutting inserts. A broadly used convolutional neural net, namely a U-Net, is trained with different preprocessing and optimisation task configurations: On the one hand the problem is considered as binary problem, and on the other hand as multiclass problem by differentiating the wear into two different types. By comparing these two problem formulations we investigate whether the separation of the two wear structures improves the performance of the recognition of the wear types. For both problem formulations three loss functions, i. e., Cross Entropy, Focal Cross Entropy, and a loss based on the Intersection over Union (IoU), are investigated.The use of different augmentation intensities during training suggests adequate but not too excessive augmentation, and that with optimal augmentation the choice of loss function gets less important. Furthermore, models are trained on image tiles of different sizes, which has an impact on producing artefacts on the whole image predictions performed by the overlap-tile strategy. In summary, the best performing models are binary models, trained on data with moderate augmentation and an IoU-based loss function.},

  abstract     = {Achieving a high grasping success rate in a stacked environment is the core of the robot’s grasping task. Most methods achieve a high grasping success rate by training the network on a dataset containing a large number of grasping annotations which requires a lot of manpower and material resources. Therefore, achieving a high grasping success rate for stacked scenes without grasping annotations is a challenging task. To address this, we propose a No-Grasp annotation grasp detection network for stacked scenes (NG-Net). Our network consists of two modules: an object selection module and a grasp generation module. Specifically, the object selection module performs instance segmentation on the raw point cloud to select the object with the highest score as the object to be grasped, and the grasp generation module uses mathematical methods to analyze the geometric features of the point cloud surface to achieve grasping pose generation without grasping annotations. Experiments show that on the modified IPA-Binpicking dataset G, NG-Net has an average grasp success rate of 97% in the stacked scene grasp experiment, 14–22% higher than PointNetGPD.},

  abstract     = {Delamination damage should be avoided because it severely affects the quality of CFRP products. This paper proposes a digital twin (DT) driven method for real-time suppression of delamination damage to ensure the highest quality hole exit. The relationship between the increase in thrust caused by tool wear and CFRP delamination was analyzed through extensive drilling experiments. The evolving twin models were developed to integrate the virtual space of the drilling process. Once the cutting parameters and thrust signals were input into the twin, the Gaussian process regression and mathematical models predicted the current tool wear and thrust curve, respectively. The feedback results from the DT dynamically interact with the real drilling operation after the optimization function solves the current critical feed rate (CFR). A DT scheme was designed, and the performance of the deployed DT was tested through an online service panel. The results show that the DT has excellent real-time prediction capability within 100 hole-making cycles, with maximum errors of 4.1% and 4.2% for tool wear and thrust prediction at the exit, respectively. Compared to conventional drilling (CD), DT technology provides closed-loop feedback on the time-varying CFR for each hole, resulting in no delamination mode I and up to 48.4% suppression of delamination mode III. This research has achieved intelligent virtual-real linkage in the CFRP drilling process, providing important theoretical support for effectively suppressing delamination damage in the automated production process.},

Both the functions of the sensor are encapsulated by cascading assembly, the different sensing units are nested and arranged to avoid coupling effects between different sensing signals. The structural design, working principle, and fabrication process to make the flexible dual-mode sensor were presented. Characterization tests showed that the developed flexible dual-mode sensor has a high sensitivity of 0.33 V/N and stability for contact pressure sensing, this sensor can also detect the distances between objects and sensor with high accuracy. The dual-mode sensor was then mounted onto a robotic arm to perform object’s grasping and collision experiments, results demonstrated that the sensor can accurately measure the distributed contact force and distance between objects for tactile perception.

  abstract     = {Float-Zone (FZ) crystal growth process allows for producing higher purity silicon crystal with much lower concentrations of impurities, in particular low oxygen content. Nevertheless, the FZ process occasionally faces the problem of small contamination from oxidation. This can come in the form of a thin oxide layer that may form on un-melted polysilicon surface. The appearance of the oxide layer indicates degraded machine performance and the need for machine maintenance. Therefore, oxide investigation is important for improving both the FZ process and FZ machines, and the first step is oxide recognition. In this study, we characterized oxide into mainly three varieties, according to their surface texture characteristics, which are: (i) spot (ii) shadow and (iii) ghost curtain. We leveraged FZ images captured from the vision system integrated on the FZ machine to establish an oxide dataset. Targeted for data imbalance problem in our dataset, a method based on transfer learning and asymmetric loss for multi-label oxide classification is presented in this work. The results showed that the pre-trained model and the asymmetric loss used for training outperformed the baseline models and improved the classification performance. Furthermore, this study deeply investigated the effectiveness of the components of asymmetric loss. Finally, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was employed to explain decision process of the models in order to adopt them in the industry.},

To solve this problem, a contrastive learning strategy guided by fault type differences for aeroengine fault diagnosis with limited samples is proposed. Different from the traditional contrastive learning paradigm using data augmentation, the proposed method uses the fault data to construct sample pairs, uses similarity comparison to learn fault features from limited data, and uses the learned fault features for fault diagnosis. A deep learning model for joint training of feature extractor and classifier is built to improve the fault diagnosis accuracy. Finally, the aeroengine dataset and bearing dataset are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in the case of limited data. The experimental results show that compared with the most advanced methods, the proposed method can achieve higher fault diagnosis accuracy.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we address the problem of multi-objective production planning in a hybrid manufacturing and remanufacturing system (HMRS), introducing several significant contributions. First, we propose a new formulation of the problem that extends the existing literature by introducing a multi-objective model. This model aims to minimize both total costs and $$CO_2$$ emissions within a hybrid system composed of various machines in charge of producing new and remanufactured products of different qualities. To efficiently solve this complex problem, we present an innovative approach that integrates several techniques, including NSGA-II, the entropy weight method and the TOPSIS technique. Our research focuses on the economic and environmental aspects of the remanufacturing process, seeking to determine the optimal manufacturing and remanufacturing plan. This plan aims to meet demand for new products and maximize satisfaction for remanufactured products of different qualities, while minimizing the total economic costs and $$CO_2$$ emissions incurred during the various manufacturing and remanufacturing stages, including set-up, production, inventory and disposal. To address the multi-objective nature of this problem, we develop a mathematical model and introduce an approach based on the non-dominated genetic sorting algorithm (NSGA-II). To help decision-making, we use the technique of performance ranking by similarity to the ideal solution (TOPSIS) in combination with the entropy weight method (EWM) to objectively obtain the optimal compromise solution from the Pareto front provided by NSGA-II. Finally, we conduct computational experiments to assess the environmental impact of carbon emissions associated with new, remanufactured and discarded products over a finite production horizon. We illustrate the adaptability of the proposed approach by applying it to two distinct remanufacturing strategies: one where remanufacturing is used to reduce waste, and one where demand for remanufactured products is critical, with a penalty cost associated with any shortfall in demand.},

  abstract     = {Vision-based quality inspection is a key step to ensure the quality control of complex industrial products. However, accurate defect recognition for complex products with information-rich, structure-irregular and significantly different patterns is still a tough problem, since it causes the strong visual interference. This paper proposes a causal deep learning method (CDLM) to tackle the explainable vision-based quality inspection under visual interference. First, a structural causal model for defect recognition of complex industrial products is constructed and a causal intervention strategy to overcome the background interference is generated. Second, a defect-guided recognition neural network (DGRNN) is constructed, which can realize accurate defect recognition under the training of CDLM via feature-wise causal intervention using two sub-networks with feature difference mechanism. Finally, the causality between defect features and defective product labels can guide the DGRNN to complete the accurate and explainable learning of defect in a causal direction of optimization. Quantitative experiments show that the proposed method achieves recognition accuracy of 94.09% and 93.95% on two fabric datasets respectively, which outperforms the cutting-edge inspection models. Besides, Grad-CAM visualization experiments show that the proposed method successfully captures the data causality and realizes the explainable defect recognition.},

  abstract     = {Defect detection in laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) parts is a critical step for in their quality control. Ensuring the integrity of these parts is essential for a broader adoption of this manufacturing process in highly standardized industries such as aerospace. With many challenges to overcome, there is currently no standardized image analysis and segmentation process for the defect analysis of LPBF parts. This process is often manual and operator-dependent, which limits the repeatability and the reproducibility of the analytical methods applied, raising questions about the validity of the analysis. The pore segmentation step is critical for porosity analysis since the pore size and morphology metrics are calculated directly from the results of the segmentation process. In this work, Ti6Al4V specimens with purposely induced and controlled porosity were printed, scanned 5 times on two CT scan systems by two different operators, and then reconstructed as 3D volumes. The porosity in these specimens was analyzed using manual and Otsu thresholding and a convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning segmentation algorithm. Then, a variance component estimation realized over 75 porosity analyses indicated that, independently of the operator and the CT scan system used, the CNN provided the best repeatability and reproducibility in the LPBF specimens of this study. Finally, a multimodal correlative study using higher resolution laser confocal microscopy observations was used for a multi-scale pore-to-pore comparison and as a reliability assessment of the segmentation algorithms. The validity of the CNN-based pore segmentation was thus assessed through improved repeatability, reproducibility, and reliability.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a novel stacked encoded cascade error feedback deep extreme learning machine (SEC-E-DELM) network is proposed to predict order completion time (OCT) considering the historical production planning and control data. Usually, the actual OCT significantly deviates from the planned because of recessive disturbances. The disturbances do not shut down production but slow down the production that accumulates over time, causing significant deviation of actual time from planned. The generation of weight parameters in neural networks using a randomization approach has a significant effect on generalization performance. To predict the OCT, firstly, the stacked autoencoder is used to generate input connection weights for the network by learning a deep representation of the real data. Secondly, the learned distribution of the encoder is connected to the network output through output connection weights incrementally learned by the Moore–Penrose inverse. Thirdly, the new hidden unit is added one by one to the network, which receives input connections from the input units and the last layer of the encoder to avoid overfitting and improve model generalization. The input connection weights for the newly added hidden unit are analytically calculated by the error feedback function to enhance the convergence rate by further learning deep features. Lastly, the hidden unit keeps on adding one by one by receiving connections from input units and some of the existing hidden units to make a deep cascade architecture. An extensive comparative study demonstrates that calculating connection weights by the proposed method helps to significantly improve the generalization performance and robustness of the network.},

Recently, considerable focus has been directed towards utilizing AI for the development of optimal control in industrial processes. In particular, reinforcement learning (RL) techniques have made significant advancements, enabling their application to data-driven problem-solving for the control of complex systems. Since industrial manufacturing processes can be treated as MIMO non-linear systems, RL can be used to develop complex data-driven intelligent decision-making or control systems. In this work, the workflow for developing a RL application for industrial manufacturing processes, including reward function setup, development of reduced order models and control policy construction, is addressed, and a new process-based reward function is proposed. To showcase the proposed approach, a case study is developed with reference to a wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) process. Based on experimental tests, a Reduced Order Model of the system is obtained and a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient Controller is trained with aim to produce a simple geometry. Particular attention is given to the sim-to-real process by developing a WAAM simulator which allows to simulate the process in a realistic environment and to generate the code to be deployed on the motion platform controller.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the deep integration of advanced information technology and advanced manufacturing technology has gradually become one of the main ways to achieve smart manufacturing. The computer numerical control (CNC) system is the basic equipment for machining and manufacturing, and the quality and efficiency of the system’s machining are the basis for supporting and ensuring smart manufacturing. However, the G-code used in CNC machining is usually generated with computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) according to a static model, and its tool path is relatively rough, with uneven adjacent paths and bad points in the path causing machining defects. To solve these problems, a modeling approach combining the basic elements of the intelligent CNC system with the human-cyber-physical system (HCPS) model is proposed, and a digital solution for tool path optimization is further proposed, integrating the redesign process of CAM tool path into cyber application. In addition, the process of tool path optimization is processed in steps, and a pipelined processing flow is established to accelerate the optimization process. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using an example of process file optimization for a pentagram convex rib model.},

  abstract     = {As the most promising and advanced technology, ultra-precision machining (UPM) has dramatically increased its production volume for wide-range applications in various high-tech fields such as chips, optics, microcircuits, biotechnology, etc. The concomitantly negative environmental impact resulting from huge-volume UPM has attracted unprecedented attention from both academia and industry. Accurate energy prediction of ultra-precision machine tools (UPMTs) can provide significant insight into energy planning, machining strategy, and energy conservation. Data-driven models for predicting energy have become increasingly popular due to their high accuracy and low modeling difficulty. However, existing data-driven models only focus on ordinary precision machine tools, and their applications on UPMTs are hardly studied. To fill the gap, this paper proposed a data-driven model constructed with 1DCNN-LSTM-Attention layers for predicting the instantaneous power profile of a five-axes UPMT. In the data-preparation phase, an advanced G-code interpreter was developed to generate the working status dataset from the G-code command and accurately match them with the power data collected. Random hyperparameters searching method was adopted to tune the 1DCNN-LSTM-Attention structure for better accuracy in the model creation phase. Finally, the sensitivity of these hyperparameters on the model performance was analyzed. Results demonstrate that the learning rate, 1DCNN, LSTM and dense layer numbers are identified as critical parameters affecting the model performance. The optimized 1DCNN-LSTM-Attention model outperforms other models, achieving an R2 value of 0.93. This work first validate the feasibility of utilizing advanced machine learning techniques for predicting energy consumption in UPM field, which can further promoting energy-efficient and sustainable UPM practices by digitalizing the energy consumption process.},

  abstract     = {Milling is a key manufacturing process that requires the selection of operating parameters that provide efficient performance. However, the presence of chatter, a self-excited vibration causing poor surface finish and potential damage to the machine and cutting tool, makes it challenging to select the appropriate parameters. To predict chatter, stability maps are commonly used, but their generation requires expensive data, making it difficult to employ these maps in industry. Therefore, there is a pressing need for an approach that can accurately predict stability maps using limited experimental data. This study introduces the new Encoder GAN (EGAN) approach based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) that predicts stability maps using limited experimental data. The approach consists of the encoder, generator, and discriminator subnetworks and uses the trained encoder and generator to predict the target stability map. This versatile method can be applied to various tool setups and can accurately predict stability maps with limited experimental data (five to 10 cutting tests) even when there is little information available for unknown parameters. The study evaluates the proposed approach using both numerical data and experiments and demonstrates its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks.},

Most research affects the building of new lines and, less frequently, the reconfiguration of existing lines. However, the first is insufficient to meet the reconfigurable production paradigm required by volatile market demands. Consequent reconfiguration of resources by production requests affects companies’ competitiveness. This paper introduces a problem-specific genetic algorithm for optimizing the reconfiguration of a Robotic Assembly Line Balancing Problem with Task Types, including additional company constraints. First, we present the greenfield and brownfield optimization objectives, then a mathematical problem formulation and the composition of the genetic algorithm. We evaluate our model against an Integer Programming baseline on a reconfiguration dataset with multiple equipment alternatives. The results demonstrate the capabilities of the genetic algorithm for the greenfield case and showcase the possibilities in the brownfield case. With a scalability improvement through computation time decrease of up to $$\sim $$ 2.75 $$\times $$ , reduced number of equipment and workstations, but worse objective values, the genetic algorithm holds the potential for reconfiguring assembly lines. However, the genetic algorithm has to be further optimized for the reconfiguration to leverage its full potential.},

  abstract     = {Most industrial processes are not fully-automated. Although fast and low-level control can be handled by controllers, initializing and adjusting the reference, or setpoint, values, are commonly tasks assigned to human operators. A major challenge is the control policy variation among operators. In turn this can result in inconsistencies in the final product. In order to guide operators to pursue better and more consistent performance, researchers explore the optimal control policy through different approaches. Although in different applications, researchers use different approaches, an accurate process model is still crucial to the approaches. However, for a highly transient process (e.g., the startup of a manufacturing process), modeling can be challenging and inaccurate, and approaches highly relying on a process model may not work well. In this paper, we apply the idea of offline reinforcement learning (RL), which requires the RL agent to learn control policies from a previously collected dataset. More specifically, a modified advantage weighted regression is used to guide the agent to take the more advantageous actions. In addition, we train and verify the agent by using casting data of multiple human operators from an industrial twin-roll steel strip casting process.},

  abstract     = {Material extrusion additive manufacturing (MEAM) has revolutionized the production of complex designs while minimizing the amount of effort required due to its simple production pipeline. However, MEAM naturally comes with a well-known trade-off; higher build resolution often tends to enhance the product quality at the cost of a slower build rate. Nozzles, the standard tool for thermoplastic extrusion in MEAM, have evolved into a crucial component of the process for controlling the product’s build resolution. The purpose of this study is to investigate the details of a novel extrusion system that makes use of a rotating nozzle with an unconventional aperture, in contrast to its typical (i.e., circular-orifice) counterparts. The unique nozzle configuration that lacks axial symmetry allows for precise control over the effective dimension of the extrusion via rotational guiding. By positioning the oblong orifice at intermediate orientations, the presented approach seeks to provide continuously variable intralayer and interlayer resolutions for MEAM processes. This paper explores the distinctive characteristics of this new nozzle design as well as the potential uses of the novel extrusion system. The outcomes of the conducted tests demonstrate the proof-of-concept for creating variable bead width within the layers, in addition to adaptable layer heights throughout the 3D objects. Possible limitations of the new approach and future perspectives are discussed in detail.},

In this work, we consider data-driven modeling tasks with limited point-wise measurements of otherwise continuous systems. We build upon the notion of the Universal Differential Equation (UDE) to construct data-driven models for reducing dynamics to that of a lumped parameter and inferring its properties. The flexibility of UDEs allow for composing various known physical priors suitable for application-specific modeling tasks, including lumped parameter methods.

  abstract     = {Automated fibre placement (AFP) is an advanced robotic manufacturing technique which can overcome the challenges of traditional composite manufacturing. The interlaminar strength of AFP-manufactured composites depends on the in-situ thermal history during manufacturing. The thermal history is controlled by the choice of processing conditions and improper interfacial temperatures may result in insufficient bonding. Being able to better predict such maintenance issues in real-time is an important focus of smart manufacturing and Industry 4.0 to improve manufacturing operations. The data analysis of real-time temperature measurements during AFP composites manufacturing requires the temperature profiles from Finite Element Analysis (FEA) based simulations of the AFP process to better predict the quality of layup. However, the FEA simulations of the AFP process are computationally expensive. This study focuses on developing a digital tool enabling real-time process monitoring and predictive maintenance of the AFP process. The digital tool constitutes a machine learning-based surrogate model based on results from Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulations of the AFP process to predict the in-situ thermal profile during AFP manufacturing. Multivariate Linear Regression, Multivariate Polynomial Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based models are compared to conclude that ANN based surrogate model performs best by predicting the important parameters of thermal profiles with a mean absolute percentage error of 1.56% on additional test data and reducing the time by four orders of magnitude as compared to FEA simulations. The predicted thermal profile can be compared with the real-time in-situ temperatures during manufacturing to predict the quality of the layup. A GUI application is developed to provide predicted thermal profiles data for analysis in conjunction with real-time temperatures during manufacturing enabling monitoring and predictive maintenance of the AFP process and paving way for the development of a digital twin of the AFP composites manufacturing process.},

  abstract     = {Geometric variations and uncertainty are generally observed on every manufactured workpiece and have a critical influence on the functional performance of mechanical parts. In computer-aided tolerancing, the Skin Model Shapes framework is recognized as a novel paradigm to embed the expected and observed geometric variations of mechanical products based on discrete geometry representation schemes. Currently, the generation of Skin Model Shapes is still limited due to the lack of knowledge-based parameter settings in the design process, and the consideration of enriched simulation and measurement data. In this paper, a novel method based on two distinct techniques, namely Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Hessian Locally Linear Embedding (HLLE), is proposed to generate Skin Model Shapes without any explicitly defined parameters. A Wasserstein GAN structure is trained for generating patterns of geometric deviations based on simulation data. Geometric deviations on planar and cylindrical surfaces are considered in a training process since both types of surfaces are widely used in mechanical engineering. HLLE is used in the paper to extend the implementation of the proposed deviation mapping process from planar/cylindrical surfaces to other types of surfaces scattered in 3D space. The proposed Skin Model Shapes generation process enables the efficient generation of part representatives with geometric deviations without the need for extensive deviation modeling. Meanwhile, the proposed method overcomes the common limitation of simulating different types (e.g. rotational and freeform) of non-ideal surfaces on Skin Model Shapes. The implemented case studies show that our method can be used to generate hundreds of distinct Skin Model Shapes within seconds while the distributions of simulated geometric deviations on the surfaces are consistent with the measurement results. Meanwhile, the generated Skin Model Shapes can be used for further applications such as assembly simulation and tolerance analysis to obtain more realistic simulation results.},

Most steel surface defect systems are based on supervised learning classification with 2-D image datasets. However, acquiring labeled datasets for developing supervised learning models is practically limited in the actual steel manufacturing process. Furthermore, due to the frequent occurrence of multiple defect classes on the same steel bar, the problem of multi-defect classification and localization needs to be addressed. Therefore, this paper proposes a steel bar surface inspection system for multi-defect classification and localization based on a semi-supervised learning model and MFL signals. The proposed system solves the multi-defect classification and localization problem by reducing the feature dimension with an autoencoder. Then, it classifies the defects based on the semi-supervised support vector machines that require only a small portion of the labeled dataset. Also, the classification process is repeated on the overlapped small steel section to address the multi-defect classification and localization issue. When it was evaluated on an industry MFL inspection dataset, the accuracy ranged from 81% to 90% when the labeled data ratio varied from 2% to 90%.},

  abstract     = {The problem of imbalanced regression is widely prevalent in various intelligent manufacturing systems, significantly constraining the industrial application of machine learning models. Existing research has overlooked the impact of redundant data and has lost valuable information within unlabeled data, therefore, the effectiveness of the models is limited. To this end, we propose a novel model framework (sNN-ST, similarity-based nearest neighbor and Self-Training fusion) to address imbalanced regression in industrial big data. This approach comprises two main steps: first, we identify and remove redundant samples by analyzing the redundancy relationships among samples. Then, we perform pseudo-labeling on unlabeled data, selectively incorporating reliable and non-redundant samples into the labeled dataset. We validate the proposed method on two imbalanced regression datasets. Removing redundant data and effectively utilizing unlabeled data optimize the dataset&#39;s distribution and enhance its information entropy. Consequently, the processed dataset significantly improves the overall model performance. We used this model to conduct a Multi-Parameter Global Relative Sensitivity Analysis within a production system. This analysis optimized existing process parameters and improved product quality consistency. This research presents a promising approach to addressing imbalanced regression problems.},

Considering the need to proactively enable energy flexibility in modern manufacturing systems, this work presents a component-based design approach that aims to embed energy flexibility in the design of cyber-physical production systems. To this end, energy management using Industry 4.0 technologies (e.g., Internet of Things and Cyber-physical Systems) is compared to the literature on energy flexibility in order to evaluate to what extent the energy flexibility practice takes advantage of Industry 4.0 technologies. Another dimension is the coverage of the life cycle of the manufacturing system which guarantees its sustainable design and the ability to achieve energy flexibility by configuring the energy consumption behaviour. A data-based design approach of the energy-flexible components is proposed in the spirit of the Reference Architectural Model Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0), and then it is exemplified using an electric drive (as a component) in order to show the practical applicability of the approach. The energy consumption behaviour of the component is modelled using machine learning techniques. The digital twin of the studied component is developed using Visual Components virtual engineering environment, then its energy consumption behaviour is included in the model allowing the system integrator/decision-maker to configure the component based on the energy availability/price. Finally, external services in terms of an optimisation module and a deep learning module are connected to the digital twin.},

  abstract     = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) and in particular has gained significant attention due to its capability to produce complex geometries using various materials, resulting in cost and mass reduction per part. However, metal AM parts often contain internal defects inherent to the manufacturing process. Non-Destructive Testing (NDT), particularly Computed Tomography (CT), is commonly employed for defect analysis. Today adopted standard inspection techniques are costly and time-consuming, therefore an automatic approach is needed. This paper presents a novel eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methodology for defect detection and characterization. To classify pixel data from CT images as pores or inclusions, the proposed method utilizes Support Vector Machine (SVM), a supervised machine learning algorithm, trained with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.94. Density-Based Spatial Clustering with the Application of Noise (DBSCAN) is subsequently applied to cluster the identified pixels into separate defects, and finally, a convex hull is employed to characterize the identified clusters based on their size and shape. The effectiveness of the methodology is evaluated on Ti6Al4V specimens, comparing the results obtained from manual inspection and the ML-based approach with the guidance of a domain expert. This work establishes a foundation for automated defect detection, highlighting the crucial role of XAI in ensuring trust in NDT, thereby offering new possibilities for the evaluation of AM components.},

The method correlates dominant frequency variations with the tool condition along its complete life cycle, considering both straight and circular tool paths to mimic real-life machining scenarios. Therefore, using multiple micro-milling experiments, dominant frequency was characterized using Wavelet transform and Short Time Fourier Transform, and a tool condition prognostic model was developed using LSTM networks. The model accurately predicts force signals with an RMSE less than 0.09, enabling indirect prediction of the tool condition.},

This study focuses on the Laser-based Directed Energy Deposition (L-DED) process and utilizes embedded vision systems to capture critical melt pool characteristics for continuous monitoring. Two self-learning frameworks based on Convolutional Neural Networks and Transformer architecture are applied to process zone images from different DED process regimes, enabling in-situ monitoring without ground truth information. The evaluation is based on a dataset of process zone images obtained during the deposition of titanium powder (Cp-Ti, grade 1), forming a cube geometry using four laser regimes. By training and evaluating the Deep Learning (DL) algorithms using a co-axially mounted Charged Couple Device (CCD) camera within the process zone, the down-sampled representations of process zone images are effectively used with conventional classifiers for L-DED process monitoring. The high classification accuracies achieved validate the feasibility and efficacy of self-learning strategies in real-time quality assessment of AM. This study highlights the potential of AI-based monitoring systems and self-learning algorithms in quantifying the quality of AM metallic parts during fabrication. The integration of embedded vision systems and self-learning algorithms presents a novel contribution, particularly in the context of the L-DED process. The findings open avenues for further research and development in AM process monitoring, emphasizing the importance of self-supervised in situ monitoring techniques in ensuring part quality during fabrication.},

In this work, we study the application of neural networks to the field of powder metallurgy and more specifically the production of green parts as part of a typical sintering process. More specifically, we explore the usage of neural-network-based predictions in closed-loop control. We train neural networks based on a series of produced workpieces, and use these networks in closed-loop production to predict quality characteristics like weight and dimensions of the workpiece in real-time. Based on these predictions an adaptive trajectory planner adjusts then trajectory key points and with this the final piston trajectories to bring and keep quality characteristics of workpieces within tolerance. We finally compare the control performance of this neural network-based approach with a pure sensor-based approach. Results indicate that both approaches are able to bring and keep quality characteristics within their tolerance limits, but that the neural network-based approach outperforms the sensor-based approach in the transient phase, whereas in steady state the neural network needed to be updated from time to time to reach the same high performance as the sensor-based approach. Since updating needs to be performed only from time to time, required expensive sensors can be shared among multiple machines and thus, costs can be reduced. At the same time the superior prediction performance of the neural-network-based approach in transient phases can be exploited to accelerate setting up times for new workpieces. Future work will target the automation of the recording of the training dataset, the exploration of further machine learning methods as well as the integration of additional sensor data to further improve predictions.},

The defect of the surface images with interference factors is a novel problem in the existing studies, and it is also a difficulty in the detection field. Hence, this paper proposes a high-precision anti-interference detection method for surface defects under the influence of complex environment. The detection method provides a new research idea, which is divided into three main processes: interference regions location, interference regions repair, defect detection. The regions affected by interference factors are adaptively located through the proposed Efficient Channel Attention Network (ECANet)-DeeplabV3 + network model. The mean Pixel Accuracy (mPA) and mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of ECANet-DeeplabV3 + network model for interference factor identification are 98.37% and 95.46%, respectively. The Criminisi algorithm is improved from priority, finding the best matching block, and searching regions. Directional repair based on the improved Criminisi algorithm is performed on the identified interfering regions removing the interfering factors in the image, which is the research core. Then, defect detection is performed on the repaired image using the improved superpixel technology. At the same time, the defect detection results provide a variety of surface defect information for the cutting staff, including defect types, the number of pixels in different defect regions, and the area ratio of different defect regions. This information improves predictive maintenance and surface quality control.},

  abstract     = {Multi-axis techniques in Additive Manufacturing (AM) unlock promising features such as supportless fabrication, reduced material consumption, improved surface quality and mechanical properties. Among those techniques, non-planar (NP) slicing promises to be the most suitable approach to fabricate 3D-components with significant curvature such as free-form geometries. Those are characterized by a layer thickness variation (LTV) along the curvature, which should be minimized. Industrial 6-axis robots are mandatory to achieve such performances. NP slicing generalization is challenging. On one side, there is a need to define a suitable contouring method compatible with the different geometrical features present in objects. On the other side, the generalized slicing method must be able to reconstruct the inner side not provided by superficial information provided by triangular mesh. In this work, a new algorithm to generate filled NP layer has been proposed using a contouring method that reduces the LTV. The bidirectional rectilinear infill strategy has been adapted for NP layers providing a more feasible toolpath to Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) and such Direct processes where curved paths are detrimental. The proposed strategy has been validated by fabricating a tubular geometry with a robotized FDM system. Tubular geometry provides a sub-optimal solution of LTV known analytically for the contour. The infill algorithm has been tested with a complex surface applying the NP torus on a waved shape. Previous studies consider only contour providing an LTV ranging in +0% $$\div $$ -46%. This study considers only the inner side. The analytical LTV resulted in a range of +0% $$\div $$ -60%. The cross sections of the components were analyzed and compared with the analytical results. Although the proposed infill strategy does not maintain completely the contour layer thickness in the infill side, it shows to be able to cover more complex NP layers without saddle points.},

Especially in the global context and exacerbated by Covid-19, the applications of the digital twin have offered opportunities for many industries. While the digital twin has already been widely used in many sectors such as manufacturing and the construction industry—one of the key engines of economic development, is still lagging behind many other sectors. This study uses the systematic literature review to assess the applications of digital twin in manufacturing and construction respectively, the benefits it brings, and the impediments to its application. Based on this, a comparison is made of digital twin applications in the manufacturing and construction industries to draw lessons. This study concluded that although the use of digital twin in manufacturing is better than construction overall, it is still not reaching its full potential. Despite many benefits brought by the digital twin to construction during the project lifecycle, the construction sector faces even greater challenges than manufacturing in digital twin adoption. By comparison, this study drew five lessons to drive better adoption of the digital twin. The construction industry needs to accelerate the deployment of relevant hardware, promote the standard unification of digital twin, explore the whole lifecycle application of the digital twin, enhance data protection, and embrace changes. This study was limited in the scope of data collection. Future research could focus on gathering information from specific case studies, to produce more comprehensive perspectives.},

  abstract     = {To achieve a highly agile and flexible production, a transformational shift is envisioned whereby industrial production systems evolve to be more decentralized, interconnected, and intelligent. Within this vision, production assets collaborate with each other, exhibiting a high degree of autonomy. Furthermore, information about individual production assets is accessible throughout their entire life-cycles. To realize this vision, the use of advanced information technology is required. Two commonly applied software paradigms in this context are Software Agents (referred to as Agents) and Digital Twins (DTs). This work presents a systematic comparison of Agents and DTs in industrial applications. The goal of the study is to determine the differences, similarities, and potential synergies between the two paradigms. The comparison is based on the purposes for which Agents and DTs are applied, the properties and capabilities exhibited by these software paradigms, and how they can be allocated within the Reference Architecture Model Industry 4.0. The comparison reveals that Agents are commonly employed in the collaborative planning and execution of production processes, while DTs are generally more applied to monitor production resources and process information. Although these observations imply characteristic sets of capabilities and properties for both Agents and DTs, a clear and definitive distinction between the two paradigms cannot be made. Instead, the analysis indicates that production assets utilizing a combination of Agents and DTs would demonstrate high degrees of intelligence, autonomy, sociability, and fidelity. To achieve this, further standardization is required, particularly in the field of DTs.},

  abstract     = {Cutting force is a critical factor that reflects the machining states and affects tool wear, cutting stability, and the quality of the machined surface. Accurate prediction of cutting force has been the subject of extensive research in machining technology for decades. Generally, the predicting methods are based on the physical principles of metal cutting processes and they can be divided into two main categories: calculation of cutting forces by using analytical models and numerical simulation of cutting forces with finite element analysis. With the advance of artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML), various algorithms have been developed to predict cutting force with high accuracy and high efficiency. This paper provides a comprehensive review of force prediction methods, with a focus on ML-based algorithms. The mechanisms and characteristics of various force prediction methods, such as analytical models and finite element analysis, as well as different ML-based algorithms, are introduced in detail. The challenges of current algorithms and their potential in long-term and real-time prediction are discussed. The review highlights the potential of ML-based algorithms in improving the accuracy and efficiency of cutting force prediction and emphasizes the need for further research to address the current challenges and advance the field of force prediction in metal-cutting processes.},
