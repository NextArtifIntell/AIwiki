Within the framework of the set less order relation with variable ordering structures, we investigate the existence, the upper convergence, and the lower convergence of solutions to such problems in the image spaces. For both the existence and the upper convergence of solutions, we employ new techniques to obtain various results without assuming the compactness of the constraint sets. Additionally, we utilize the domination property concerning the variable ordering cones to address the lower convergence of solutions. The obtained results are presented in several versions from different aspects for convenient comparison with existing results. Many examples are provided to illustrate the novelty of our results or to compare them with existing ones in the literature.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel algorithm, namely the adaptive nested Monte Carlo based multi-objective Efficient Global Optimization (ANMC-MOEGO), which aims to enhance efficiency and accuracy while minimizing programming complexity in contrast to traditional multi-objective Efficient Global Optimization (MOEGO). In this algorithm, the programming complexity is streamlined by employing Monte Carlo simulation for both hypervolume improvement (HVI) and expected hypervolume improvement (EHVI) calculations. Furthermore, the efficiency and accuracy of HVI and EHVI calculations are improved through the utilization of a novel technique called adaptive Monte Carlo hypercube boundaries (AMCHB), which is based on the bisection method. The algorithm is validated via a set of test functions from the open literature. The numerical results demonstrate that the ANMC-MOEGO algorithm produces solutions closer to the theoretical results, with improved distributions on the corresponding Pareto fronts compared to the algorithm without AMCHB technique. Moreover, when obtaining a better Pareto front, the proposed algorithm is found to be more time-efficient, achieving speedups of up to 22.57 times.},

A general framework for finding zeros of a continuous mapping is derived from our previous paper on this subject to establish convergence properties of the inexact proximal point method when the smooth term is vanished and of the inexact proximal gradient method when the smooth term satisfies a descent condition. The inexact proximal point method achieves global convergence with constructive convergence rates when the Moreau envelope of the objective function satisfies the Kurdyka–Łojasiewicz (KL) property. Meanwhile, when the smooth term is twice continuously differentiable with a Lipschitz continuous gradient and a differentiable approximation of the objective function satisfies the KL property, the inexact proximal gradient method achieves the global convergence of iterates with constructive convergence rates.},

We also deduce another iterative algorithm by taking the regularization parameters to be zero in our proposed algorithm. We establish the weak convergence of the sequence generated by our new algorithm under certain assumptions.

  abstract     = {In 1965, T.S. Motzkin and E. G. Straus established an elegant connection between the clique number of a graph and the global maxima of a quadratic program defined on the standard simplex. Over the years, this seminal finding has inspired a number of studies aimed at characterizing the properties of the (local and global) solutions of the Motzkin–Straus program. The result has also been generalized in various ways and has served as the basis for establishing new bounds on the clique number and developing powerful clique-finding heuristics. Despite the extensive work done on the subject, apart from a few exceptions, the existing literature pays little or no attention to the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) points of the program. In the conviction that these points might reveal interesting structural properties of the graph underlying the program, this paper tries to fill in the gap. In particular, we study the generalized KKT points of a parameterized version of the Motzkin–Straus program, which are defined via a relaxation of the usual first-order optimality conditions, and we present a number of results that shed light on the symmetries and regularities of certain substructures associated with the underlying graph. These combinatorial structures are further analyzed using barycentric coordinates, thereby providing a link to a related quadratic program that encodes local structural properties of the graph. This turns out to be particularly useful in the study of the generalized KKT points associated with a certain class of graphs that generalize the notion of a star graph. Finally, we discuss the associations between the generalized KKT points of the Motzkin–Straus program and the so-called replicator dynamics, thereby offering an alternative, dynamical-system perspective on the results presented in the paper.},

  abstract     = {Mix sparse structure is inherited in a wide class of practical applications, namely, the sparse structure appears as the inter-group and intra-group manners simultaneously. In this paper, we propose an iterative mix thresholding algorithm with continuation technique (IMTC) to solve the $$\ell _0$$ regularized mix sparse optimization. The significant advantage of the IMTC is that it has a closed-form expression and low storage requirement, and it is able to promote the mix sparse structure of the solution. We prove the convergence property and the linear convergence rate of the ITMC to a local minimum; moreover, we show that the ITMC approaches an approximate true mix sparse solution within a tolerance relevant to the noise level under an assumption of restricted isometry property. We also apply the mix sparse optimization to model the differential optical absorption spectroscopy analysis with the wavelength misalignment, and numerical results indicate that the IMTC can exactly and quantitatively predict the existing materials and the factual wavelength misalignment simultaneously within 0.1 s, which meets the demand of improvement of the automatic analysis software.},

We assume that both, the objective function and the functional constraints, are locally smooth. For solving this problem, we propose a linearized quadratic penalty method, i.e., we linearize the objective function and the functional constraints in the penalty formulation at the current iterate and add a quadratic regularization, thus yielding a subproblem that is easy to solve, and whose solution is the next iterate. Under a new adaptive regularization parameter choice, we provide convergence guarantees for the iterates of this method to an $$\epsilon $$ first-order optimal solution in $${\mathcal {O}}({\epsilon ^{-2.5}})$$ iterations. Finally, we show that when the problem data satisfy Kurdyka–Lojasiewicz property, e.g., are semialgebraic, the whole sequence generated by the proposed algorithm converges and we derive improved local convergence rates depending on the KL parameter. We validate the theory and the performance of the proposed algorithm by numerically comparing it with some existing methods from the literature.},

  abstract     = {In deterministic global optimization, techniques for linear relaxation of a non-convex program are used in the lower bound calculation phase. To achieve this phase, most deterministic global optimization codes use reformulation-linearization techniques. However, there exist also two interval-based polyhedral relaxation techniques which produce reliable bounds without adding new auxiliary variables, and which can take into account mathematical operations and most transcendental functions: (i) the affine relaxation technique, used in the IBBA code, based on affine forms and affine arithmetic, and (ii) the extremal Taylor technique, used in the Ibex-Opt code, which is based on a specific interval-based Taylor form. In this paper, we describe how these two interval-based linear relaxation techniques can be hybridized. These two approaches appear to be complementary, and such a hybrid method performs well on a representative sample of constrained global optimization instances.},
