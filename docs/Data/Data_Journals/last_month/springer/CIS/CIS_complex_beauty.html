  abstract     = {Semantic segmentation of urban scenes is essential in urban traffic analysis and road condition information acquisition. The semantic segmentation model with good performance is the key to applying high-resolution urban locations. However, the types of these images are diverse, and the spatial relationships are complex. It is greatly affected by weather and light. Objects of different scales pose significant challenges to image segmentation of urban scenes. The existing semantic segmentation is mostly solved from the target scale and superpixel methods. Our research mainly fills the gap in image segmentation field of ConvNeXt fusion U-Net pyramid network model in specific urban scenes. These methods could be more accurate. Therefore, we propose the multi-scale fusion deformation residual pyramid network model method in this paper. This method captures features of different scales and effectively solves the problem of urban scene image segmentation of memory scenes by objects of different scales. We construct a spatial information interaction module to reduce the semantic ambiguity caused by complex spatial relations. By combining spatial and channel characteristics, a series of problems caused by weather and light can be alleviated. We verify the improved semantic segmentation model on the Cityscape dataset. The experimental results show that the method achieves 84.25% MPA and 75.61% MIoU. Our improved algorithm, ConvNeXt embedding in the U-Net algorithm architecture, is named Conv-UNet. The improved method proposed in this paper is superior to other methods in the semantic segmentation of urban scenes. The main advantage of this algorithm is to explore the specific loss function and segmentation strategy suitable for urban scene in the face of the complexity and diversity of urban scene images.},

  abstract     = {Reservoir oil-bearing recognition is the process of predicting reservoir types based on well logging data, which determines the accuracy of recognition. However, the original well logging data is multidimensional and contains potential noise, which can influence the performance of sequent processing, such as clustering and classification. It is crucial to obtain key low-dimensional features and study an accurate automatic recognition algorithm under unsupervised condition. To solve this problem, we propose a feature extraction method named graph regularized non-negative matrix factorization with optimal estimation (GNMF-OE) according to the characteristics of well logging data in this paper. Firstly, the low dimensional embedding dimension of high-dimensional well logging data is modeled and estimated, which enables the method to obtain the appropriate number of features that reflect the data structure. Secondly, local features are optimized by structured initial vectors in the framework of GNMF, which encourages the basis matrix to have clear reservoir category characteristics. These two approaches are meaningful and beneficial to construct an appropriate basis matrix that discovers the intrinsic structure of well logging data. The visualized experimental results on real datasets from Jianghan oilfield in China show that the proposed method has significant clustering performance for reservoir oil-bearing recognition.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection is a common method for improving classification performance. Selecting features for high-dimensional data is challenging due to the large search space. Traditional feature ranking methods that search for top-ranked features cannot remove redundant and irrelevant features and may also ignore interrelated features. Evolutionary computation (EC) techniques are widely used in feature selection due to their global search capability. However, EC can easily fall into local optima when dealing with feature selection for high-dimensional applications. The top-ranked features are more likely to construct effective feature subsets and help EC reduce the search space. This paper proposes a feature selection method based on Genetic Programming (GP) with hybrid feature ranking criterion called GPHC, which combines multiple feature ranking methods into the GP structure using a novel GP representation to search for effective feature subsets. Experiments on eight high-dimensional datasets show that GPHC achieves significantly better classification performance compared to five feature ranking methods. Further comparisons between GPHC and other evolutionary algorithms demonstrate that GPHC has advantages in terms of classification performance, the number of features, and convergence speed.},

The method addresses a key limitation of existing meta-RL approaches, which struggle to effectively use suboptimal demonstrations to guide training in sparse reward environments. DOAMRL effectively combines reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL) within the inner loop of the MAML framework, with dynamically adjusted weights applied to the IL component. This enables the method to leverage the exploration strengths of RL and the efficiency benefits of IL at different stages of training. Additionally, DOAMRL introduces a meta-learned parameter offset, which enhances targeted exploration in sparse reward settings, helping to guide the meta-policy toward regions with non-zero rewards. To further mitigate the impact of suboptimal demonstration data on meta-training, we propose a novel demonstration data enhancement module that iteratively improves the quality of the demonstrations. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the proposed method, justifying its design choices. A comprehensive comparison with existing methods in various stages (including training and adaptation), using both optimal and suboptimal demonstrations, along with results from ablation and sensitivity analysis, demonstrates that DOAMRL outperforms existing approaches in performance, applicability, and robustness.},

  abstract     = {Remote sensing image pairs of different time phases have complex and changeable semantic contents, and traditional convolutional registration methods are challenging in modeling subtle local changes and global large-scale deformation differences in detail. This results in poor registration performance and poor feature representation. To address these problems, a semantically enhanced dual-graph perception framework is proposed. This framework aims to gradually achieve semantic alignment and precise registration of remote sensing image pairs of different time phases via coarse to fine stages. On the one hand, a newly designed large-selection kernel convolution attention module is used to learn affine transformation parameters. Attention to global semantics perceives the large pixel displacement deviation caused by large-scale deformation, and the association relationship is established between remote sensing image pairs of different time phases. At the same time, dual-graph perception modules are embedded in multiple subspace structures, and the subtle local changes of remote sensing image pairs are modeled through the dynamic aggregation ability of graph perception nodes to achieve coarse registration of remote sensing images. On the other hand, a U-shaped module guided by global attention with deformable convolution is used to refine the local spatial structural features and global contextual semantic information of the rough registration, establish dependencies between channels, and correct the pixel displacement deviation of remote sensing image pairs of different phases through position encoding. It is worth noting that the newly designed weighted loss function supervises the learning of each module and the entire network structure from the perspective of inverse consistency, promoting the network’s optimal performance. Finally, the experimental results on the AerialData and GFRS datasets show that the proposed framework has good registration performance, with mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.64 and 3.81, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Time series forecasting plays a crucial role across various sectors, including energy, transportation, meteorology, and epidemiology. However, existing models often struggle with capturing long-term dependencies and managing computational efficiency when handling complex and extensive time series data. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the BSAformer model, which leverages a unique combination of frequency-domain Sequence Progressive Split-Aggregation (SPSA) and Bidirectional Splitting-Agg Attention (BSAA) mechanisms. The SPSA module decomposes sequences into seasonal and trend components, enhancing the model’s ability to identify cyclical patterns, while the BSAA mechanism captures forward and backward dependencies, providing a comprehensive understanding of temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments conducted on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate the BSAformer model&#39;s superior performance, with notable improvements in accuracy and efficiency over state-of-the-art models. Specifically, the BSAformer achieves significant Mean Squared Error (MSE) reductions of 63.7% on the ECL dataset, 28.1% on the Traffic dataset, and 49.8% on the ILI dataset. These results validate the model’s robustness and its adaptability across diverse time series forecasting scenarios. The insights gained from this study contribute to the advancement of time series forecasting by providing a model that improves both accuracy and computational efficiency, especially in handling long-term dependencies and complex temporal patterns.},

While cross-modality attention mechanisms are widely used in MSA to capture inter-modality interactions, existing methods are limited to pairwise interactions between two modalities. Additionally, these methods can not utilize the causal relationship to guide attention learning, making them susceptible to bias information. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel method called Heterogeneous Hypergraph Attention Network with Counterfactual Learning $$(\text {H}^2\text {CAN}).$$ The method constructs a heterogeneous hypergraph based on sentiment expression characteristics and employs Heterogeneous Hypergraph Attention Networks (HHGAT) to capture interactions beyond pairwise constraints. Furthermore, it mitigates the effects of bias through a Counterfactual Intervention Task (CIT). Our model comprises two main branches: hypergraph fusion and counterfactual fusion. The former uses HHGAT to capture inter-modality interactions, while the latter constructs a counterfactual world using Gaussian distribution and additional weighting for the biased modality. The CIT leverages causal inference to maximize the prediction discrepancy between the two branches, guiding attention learning in the hypergraph fusion branch. We utilize unimodal labels to help the model adaptively identify the biased modality, thereby enhancing the handling of bias information. Experiments on three mainstream datasets demonstrate that $$\text {H}^2\text {CAN}$$ sets a new benchmark.},

Specifically, our method explores the relationships between joint, bone, and motion to learn more discriminative feature representations. Considering the hierarchy of the hand skeleton, the skeleton data is divided into multilevel to capture complementary semantic information. Furthermore, the multimodal contrastive loss measures similarity among these multilevel representations.

Hate speech is generally described as a deliberate act of aggression aimed at a particular group, intended to harm or marginalize them based on specific attributes of their identity. While positive interactions in diverse communities can greatly enhance confidence, it is important to acknowledge that negative remarks such as hate speech can weaken community unity and present a significant impact on people’s well-being. This highlights the need for improved monitoring and guidelines on social media platforms to protect individuals from discriminatory and harmful actions. Despite extensive research on resource-rich languages, such as English and German, the detection and analysis of hate speech in less-resourced languages, such as Norwegian, remains underexplored. Addressing this gap, our study leverages a metalinguistic approach that uses advanced meta-learning techniques to enhance the detection capabilities across bilingual texts, effectively linking technical advancements directly to the pressing social issue of hate speech. In this study, we introduce techniques that adapt models that deal with hate speech detection within the same languages (intra-lingual), across different languages (cross-lingual), and techniques that adapt models to new languages with minimal extra training, independent of the model type (cross-lingual model-agnostic meta-learning-based approaches) for bilingual text analysis in Norwegian and English. Our methodology incorporates attention mechanisms (components that help the model focus on relevant parts of the text) and adaptive learning rate schedulers (tools that adjust the learning speed based on performance).

To address this issue, we suggest a pattern mining based evolutionary multi-objective algorithm called PM-EMA, in which two strategies for using the knowledge are proposed to accelerate the speed of population convergence. Firstly, to discover the potential beam angle distribution and discard the worse angles, the pattern mining strategy is used to detect the maximum and minimum sets of beam angles in non-dominated solutions of the population and utilize them to generate offspring to enhance the convergence. Moreover, to improve the quality of initial solutions, a tailored population initialization strategy is proposed by using the score of beam angles defined by this study.

Although traditional methods such as particle filters and extended Kalman filters have been widely used, there is still room for assessing the capabilities of modern filtering techniques for this task. Building on a recent localization method that employs a chamfer distance-based observation model, derived from an implicit measurement equation, we explore its potential further by incorporating exact particle flow Daum–Huang filters to achieve superior accuracy. Recent advancements have spotlighted Daum–Huang filters as formidable contenders, outshining both the extended Kalman filters and traditional particle filters in various scenarios. We introduce two new Daum–Huang-based localization algorithms and assess their tracking performance through comprehensive simulations and real-world trials. Our algorithms are benchmarked against various methods, including the widely acclaimed Adaptive Monte–Carlo Localization algorithm. Overall, our algorithm demonstrates superior performance compared to the baseline models in simulations and exhibits competitive performance in the evaluated real-world application.},

  abstract     = {Driver action recognition is crucial for in-vehicle safety. We argue that the following factors limit the related research. First, spatial constraints and obstructions in the vehicle restrict the range of motion, resulting in similar action patterns and difficulty collecting the full body posture. Second, in skeleton-based action recognition, establishing the joint dependencies by the self-attention computation is always limited to a single frame, ignoring the effect of body spatial structure on dependence weights and inter-frame. Common convolution in temporal flow only focuses on frame-level temporal features, ignoring motion pattern features at a higher semantic level. Our work proposed a novel spatiotemporal decoupling attention transformer (SDA-TR). The SDA module uses a spatiotemporal decoupling strategy to decouple the weight computation according to body structure and directly establish joint dependencies between multiple frames. The TFA module aggregates sub-action-level and frame-level temporal features to improve similar recognition accuracy. On the Driver Action Recognition dataset Drive&amp;Act using driver upper body skeletons, SDA-TR achieves state-of-the-art performance. SDA-TR also achieved 92.2%/95.8% accuracy under the CS/CV benchmarks of NTU RGB+D 60, 88.6%/89.8% accuracy under the CS/CSet benchmarks of NTU RGB+D 120, on par with other state-of-the-art methods.

However, existing unsupervised deep cross-modal hashing methods still need help with issues such as inaccurate measurement of semantic similarity information, complex network architectures, and incomplete constraints among multimedia data. To address these issues, we propose an Unsupervised Random Walk Manifold Contrastive Hashing (URWMCH) method, designing a simple deep learning architecture.

Second, we construct intra- and inter-modal similarity preservation and coexistent similarity preservation loss based on contrastive learning to constrain the training of hash functions, ensuring that the hash codes contain complete semantic association information.

In many manufacturing processes, design parameters are vulnerable to random input disturbances, resulting in products that often perform less effectively than anticipated. To address this issue, we propose a novel robust multi-objective evolutionary optimization algorithm based on the concept of survival rate. The algorithm comprises two stages: the evolutionary optimization stage and the construction stage of the robust optimal front. In the former stage, we introduce the survival rate as a new optimization objective. Subsequently, we seek a robust optimal front that concurrently addresses convergence and robustness by employing a non-dominated sorting approach. Furthermore, we propose a precise sampling method and a random grouping mechanism to accurately recover solutions resilient to real noise while ensuring population’s diversity. In the latter stage, we introduce a performance measure that integrates both robustness and convergence to guide the construction of the robust optimal front. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm in terms of both convergence and robustness compared to existing approaches under noisy conditions.},

Therefore, ensuring quality of service (QoS) in a service-oriented IoT environment is crucial, highlighting QoS prediction as a prominent research focus. However, issues related to information credibility, user data privacy, and prediction accuracy in QoS prediction for IoT services have become significant challenges in current research. To tackle these issues, we propose TPP-GNCF, a trust-aware privacy-preserving QoS prediction framework that integrates graph neural networks with collaborative filtering methods. In TPP-GNCF, we filter out untrustworthy QoS values provided by users for certain services to select credible QoS values. Then, a message-passing graph neural network (MP-GNN) is utilized to effectively capture information transmission and relationships in the graph structure, while differential privacy is used to protect user node information. In addition, we use a similarity calculation method based on weight function in collaborative filtering to mine implicit embedded features that graph neural networks cannot directly utilize. Finally, the final missing QoS values are achieved by fusing graph neural predicted QoS and feature collaborative filtering predicted QoS. We conducted extensive experiments on the well-known WS-DREAM dataset. The results demonstrate that the TPP-GNCF framework not only surpasses existing schemes in performance but also effectively addresses issues of information credibility and user privacy.},

  abstract     = {The identification of vulnerabilities in smart contracts is necessary for ensuring their security. As a pre-trained language model, BERT has been employed in the detection of smart contract vulnerabilities, exhibiting high accuracy in tasks. However, it has certain limitations. Existing methods solely depend on features extracted from the final layer, thereby disregarding the potential contribution of features from other layers. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel method, which is named multi-layer feature fusion (MULF). Experiments investigate the impact of utilizing features from other layers on performance improvement. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of multi-layer feature sequence fusion in the field of smart contract vulnerability detection. Furthermore, there is a special type of patched contract code that contains vulnerability features which need to be studied. Therefore, to overcome the challenges posed by limited smart contract vulnerability datasets and high false positive rates, we introduce a data augmentation technique that incorporates function feature screening with those special smart contracts into the training set. To date, this method has not been reported in the literature. The experimental results demonstrate that the MULF model significantly enhances the performance of smart contract vulnerability identification compared to other models. The MULF model achieved accuracies of 98.95% for reentrancy vulnerabilities, 96.27% for timestamp dependency vulnerabilities, and 87.40% for overflow vulnerabilities, which are significantly higher than those achieved by existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Auscultation plays a pivotal role in early respiratory and pulmonary disease diagnosis. Despite the emergence of deep learning-based methods for automatic respiratory sound classification post-Covid-19, limited datasets impede performance enhancement. Distinguishing between normal and abnormal respiratory sounds poses challenges due to the coexistence of normal respiratory components and noise components in both types. Moreover, different abnormal respiratory sounds exhibit similar anomalous features, hindering their differentiation. Besides, existing state-of-the-art models suffer from excessive parameter size, impeding deployment on resource-constrained mobile platforms. To address these issues, we design a lightweight network CycleGuardian and propose a framework based on an improved deep clustering and contrastive learning. We first generate a hybrid spectrogram for feature diversity and grouping spectrograms to facilitate intermittent abnormal sound capture. Then, CycleGuardian integrates a deep clustering module with a similarity-constrained clustering component to improve the ability to capture abnormal features and a contrastive learning module with group mixing for enhanced abnormal feature discernment. Multi-objective optimization enhances overall performance during training. In experiments, we use the ICBHI2017 dataset, following the official split method and without any pre-trained weights, our method achieves Sp: 82.06 $$\%$$ , Se: 44.47 $$\%$$ , and Score: 63.26 $$\%$$ with a network model size of 38 M.

  abstract     = {The attention mechanism has emerged as a crucial component in medical image segmentation. Attention-based deep neural networks (ADNNs) fundamentally engage in the iterative computation of gradients for both input layers and weight parameters. Our research reveals a remarkable similarity between the optimization trajectory of ADNN and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), where the latter involves the alternate adjustment of the base and coefficient matrices. This similarity implies that the alternating optimization strategy—characterized by the adjustment of input features by the attention mechanism and the adjustment of network weights—is central to the efficacy of attention mechanisms in ADNNs. Drawing an analogy to the NMF approach, we advocate for a pixel-wise adjustment of the input layer within ADNNs. Furthermore, to reduce the computational burden, we have developed a decoupled pixel-wise attention module (DPAM) and a self-attention module (DPSM). These modules are designed to counteract the challenges posed by the high inter-class similarity among different organs when performing multi-organ segmentation. The integration of our DPAM and DPSM into traditional network architectures facilitates the creation of an NMF-inspired ADNN framework, known as the DPC-Net, which comes in two variants: DPCA-Net for attention and DPCS-Net for self-attention. Our extensive experiments on the Synapse and FLARE22 datasets demonstrate that the DPC-Net achieves satisfactory performance and visualization results with lower computational cost. Specifically, the DPC-Net achieved a Dice score of 77.98% on the Synapse dataset and 87.04% on the FLARE22 dataset, while possessing merely 14.991 million parameters. Notably, our findings indicate that DPC-Net, when equipped with convolutional attention, surpasses those networks utilizing Transformer attention mechanisms on multi-organ segmentation tasks.

  abstract     = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are constrained in their capacity to model geometric transformations due to their fixed geometric structure. To overcome this problem, researchers introduce deformable convolution, which allows the convolution kernel to be deformable on the feature map. However, deformable convolution may introduce irrelevant contextual information during the learning process and thus affect the model performance. DCNv2 introduces a modulation mechanism to control the diffusion of the sampling points to control the degree of contribution of offsets through weights, but we find that such problems still exist in practical use. Therefore, we propose a new limit deformable convolution to address this problem, which enhances the model ability by adding adaptive limiting units to constrain the offsets and adjusts the weight constraints on the offsets to enhance the image-focusing ability. In the subsequent work, we perform lightweight work on the limit deformable convolution and design three kinds of LDBottleneck to adapt to different scenarios.

  abstract     = {Adversarial examples generated by perturbing raw data with carefully designed, imperceptible noise have emerged as a primary security threat to artificial intelligence systems. In particular, black-box adversarial attack algorithms, which only rely on model input and output to generate adversarial examples, are easy to implement in real scenarios. However, previous research on black-box attacks has primarily focused on multi-class classification models, with relatively few studies on black-box attack algorithms for multi-label classification models. Multi-label classification models exhibit significant differences from multi-class classification models in terms of structure and output. The former can assign multiple labels to a single sample, with these labels often exhibiting correlations, while the latter classifies a sample as the class with the highest confidence. Therefore, existing multi-class attack algorithms cannot directly attack multi-label classification models. In this paper, we study the transplantation methods of multi-class black-box attack algorithms to multi-label classification models and propose the multi-label versions for eight classic black-box attack algorithms, which include three score-based attacks and five decision-based (label-only) attacks, for the first time. Experimental results indicate that the transplanted black-box attack algorithms demonstrate effective attack performance across various attack types, except for extreme attacks. Especially, most transplanted attack algorithms achieve more than 60% success rate on the ML-GCN model and more than 30% on the ML-LIW model under the hiding all attack type. However, the performance of these transplanted attack algorithms shows variation among different attack types due to the correlations between labels.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid growth of global maritime trade and the increasingly urgent need for maritime surveillance and security management, fast and accurate identification of vessels has become a crucial aspect. The task of ship number recognition mainly faces two challenges: first, the ship number is usually located in different parts of the hull, and due to the shooting distance, the size of the ship number can vary greatly on different vessels, making automated recognition complex. Second, adverse weather conditions and complex sea surface environments may affect the accuracy of visual recognition. To address the above issues, we produce a private dataset containing 2436 images of ships in a variety of scenarios and propose an algorithm (AILDP) for interactive feature learning and adaptive enhancement to tackle multiple challenges in ship number recognition. Firstly, in the detection phase, for the problem of varying size and position in the ship number recognition task, the detection effect is optimized by a module (AIFI_LPE) that combines feature interaction and learned position encoding. Secondly, to deal with the issues of blurring and occlusion of ship numbers due to ship movement or bad weather, a module (C2f_IRMB_DRB) is proposed that can capture high-quality features while weighing the computational effort when processing low-quality images. After detection, the results are divided into two categories: clear ship number and low-quality ship number. In order to save computational resources, only the low-quality images are first subjected to preliminary image enhancement processing, and then the Thin Plate Spline (TPS) is introduced in the recognition part based on the framework of PaddleOCRv4 and combined with the feature extraction and enhancement module to adjust the spatial features of the images to ensure that both types of ship number images can be accurately processed in the feature extraction and recognition process. Experimental results show that the AILDP can improve the accuracy of ship number recognition, with the precision, recall, and mAP0.5 for ship number detection increased to 95.7%, 94.5%, and 94.8%. The Character_accuracy of the recognition task can reach 95.23%.},

  abstract     = {The Transformer-based tracking approach achieves excellent results in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) tracking tasks. However, the existing tracking framework usually deals with this problem by visual grounding and visual tracking separately. This independent framework does not consider the correlation between the two steps mentioned above, that is, natural language description can provide global semantic information. Meanwhile, a separate framework is unable to conduct end-to-end training. As a remedy, We propose a joint natural language Mamba based tracking framework (named TADMT). Specifically, we propose a token aggregator that condenses rich features into a small number of visual tokens through a coarse to fine strategy to improve subsequent tracking speed. Then, we designed a mamba module based on the serpentine scanning strategy to effectively establish the relationship between natural language and visual images. In addition, we have designed a novel shift add multilayer perceptron in the prediction head, with the aim of achieving final classification and localization with less computation. Numerous experimental results have shown that TADMT achieves good tracking performance on six UAV tracking datasets and three general tracking datasets, with an average speed of 120FPS. The experimental results on the embedded platform also demonstrate the applicability of TADMT on UAV platforms.},

  abstract     = {Human actions can be abstracted as interactions between humans and objects. The recently proposed task of compositional action recognition emphasizes the independence and combinability of verbs (actions) and nouns (humans or objects) constituting human actions. Nonetheless, most traditional appearance-based action recognition methods usually extract spatial-temporal features from input videos concurrently to understand actions. This approach tends to excessively rely on overall appearance features and lacks precise modelling of interactions between objects, often leading to the neglect of the actions themselves. Consequently, the biases introduced by the appearance prevent the model from effectively generalizing to unseen combinations of actions and objects. To address this issue, we propose a method that explicitly models the object interaction path, aiming to capture interactions between humans and objects. The advantage of this approach is that these interactions are not affected by the object or environmental appearance bias, providing additional clues for appearance-based action recognition methods. Our method can easily be combined with any appearance-based visual encoder, significantly improving the compositional generalization ability of action recognition algorithms. Extensive experimental results on the Something-Else dataset and the IKEA-Assembly dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract     = {Due to the complexity of the underwater environment and the difficulty of the underwater energy recharging, utilizing multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to pursue the invading vehicle is a challenging project. This paper focuses on devising the rational and energy-efficient pursuit motion for a multi-AUV system in an unknown three-dimensional environment. Firstly, the pursuit system model is constructed on the two-player zero-sum stochastic game (ZSSG) framework. This framework enables the fictitious play on the behaviors of the invading AUV. Fictitious play involves players updating their strategies by observing and inferring the actions of others under incomplete information. Under this framework, a relay-pursuit mechanism is adopted by the pursuit system to form the action set in an energy-efficient way. Then, to reflect the pursuit goals of capturing the invading vehicle as soon as possible and avoid it from reaching its point of attack, two corresponding pursuit factors are considered in the designed reward function. To enable the pursuit AUVs to navigate in an unknown environment, WoLF-PHC algorithm is introduced and applied to the proposed ZSSG-based model. Finally, simulations demonstrate the effectiveness, the advantages, and the robustness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {To reduce airport operating costs and minimize environmental pollution, converting ground-handling vehicles from fuel-powered to electric ones is inevitable. However, this transformation introduces complexity in scheduling due to additional factors, such as battery capacities and charging requirements. This study models the electric ground-handling vehicle scheduling problem as a bi-objective integer programming model to address these challenges. The objectives of this model are to minimize the total travel distance of vehicles serving flights and the standard deviation of the total occupancy time for each vehicle. In order to solve this model and generate optimal scheduling solutions, this study combines the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm 2 (NSGA2) with the large neighborhood search (LNS) algorithm, proposing a novel NSGA2-LNS algorithm. A dynamic priority method is used by the NSGA2-LNS to construct the initial population, thereby speeding up the convergence. The NSGA2-LNS employs the LNS algorithm to overcome the problem that metaheuristic algorithms often lack clear directions in the process of finding solutions. In addition, this study designs the correlation-based destruction operator and the priority-based repair operator in the NSGA2-LNS algorithm, thereby significantly enhancing its ability to find optimal solutions for the electric ground-handling vehicle scheduling problem. The algorithm is verified using flight data from Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport and is compared with manual scheduling methods and traditional multi-objective optimization algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that the NSGA2-LNS can rapidly solve the scheduling problem of allocating electric ground-handling vehicles for hundreds of flights and produce high-quality scheduling solutions.},

This enhances the convergence efficiency of generator training through soft label guidance generated through knowledge distillation.
