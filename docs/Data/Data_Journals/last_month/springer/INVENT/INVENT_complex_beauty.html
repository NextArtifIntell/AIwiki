They conjecture that $\mathcal{A}_{n,k,4}$ admits a decomposition into images of BCFW positroid cells, arising from the Britto–Cachazo–Feng–Witten recurrence (2005). We prove that this conjecture is true.},

We show that these two different types of estimates are saturated on flat manifolds or manifolds all of whose sectional curvatures are negative. This allows us to classify compact space forms in terms of the size of $L^{q}$ -norms of quasimodes for each Lebesgue exponent $q\in (2,q_{c}]$ , even though it is impossible to distinguish between ones of negative or zero curvature sectional curvature for any $q&gt;q_{c}$ .},

  abstract     = {The Apollonian gasket is a well-studied circle packing. Important properties of the packing, including the distribution of the circle radii, are governed by its Hausdorff dimension. No closed form is currently known for the Hausdorff dimension, and its computation is a special case of a more general and hard problem: effective, rigorous estimates of dimension of a parabolic limit set. In this paper we develop an efficient method for solving this problem which allows us to compute the dimension of the gasket to 128 decimal places and rigorously justify the error bounds. We expect our approach to generalise easily to other parabolic fractals.},

The $\bar{\nu }$ -invariant is defined using $\eta $ -invariants and Mathai-Quillen currents on $M$ and we compute it for twisted connected sums à la Kovalev, Corti-Haskins-Nordström-Pacini and extra-twisted connected sums as constructed by the second and third authors. In particular, we find examples of $G_{2}$ -holonomy metrics in different components of the moduli space where the associated $G_{2}$ -structures are homotopic and other examples where they are not.},

This family can be thought of as a $p$ -adic analytic action on the Fukaya category. Using this, we deduce that the ranks of the Floer cohomology groups $HF(\phi ^{k}(L),L&#39;;\Lambda )$ are constant in $k\in {\mathbb{Z}}$ , with finitely many possible exceptions. We also prove an analogous result without the monotonicity assumption for generic $\phi $ isotopic to the identity by showing how to construct a $p$ -adic analytic action in this case. We give applications to categorical entropy and a conjecture of Seidel.},

This notion at the same time generalizes Lusztig’s total positivity in split real Lie groups and invariant orders in Lie groups of Hermitian type. We show that there are four families of simple Lie groups which admit a positive structure relative to a subset $\Theta$ of simple roots, and investigate fundamental properties of $\Theta $ -positivity. We define and describe the positive and nonnegative unipotent semigroups and show that they give rise to a notion of positive $n$ -tuples in flag varieties.},
