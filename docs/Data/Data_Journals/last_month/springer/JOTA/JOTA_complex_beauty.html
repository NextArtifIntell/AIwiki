  abstract     = {This paper is devoted to studying the dynamic optimization of several controlled crowd motion models in general planar settings. A set of necessary optimality conditions for optimal control problems involving crowd motion models with multiple agents and obstacles was derived and thoroughly analyzed. The analysis provides valuable insights into the primal and dual elements, as well as the degeneracy phenomena. The paper proposes several effective algorithms based on these necessary optimality conditions and presents various nontrivial illustrative examples along with their simulations. The implementation of all the considered motion models can be found via the link: https://github.com/tancao1128/Optimal_Control_of_Several_Motion_Models .},

Firstly, we transform equivalently a nonlinear Pareto game problem with convex control space and terminal state constraint into a constrained stochastic optimal control problem. By virtue of duality theory and stochastic maximum principle, a necessary condition for Pareto efficient strategy is established. With some convex assumptions, we also give a sufficient condition for Pareto efficient strategy. Secondly, we consider a linear-quadratic Pareto game with terminal state constraint, and a feedback representation for Pareto efficient strategy is derived. Finally, as an application, we solve a government debt stabilization problem and give some numerical results.},

The recently proposed sum-of-norms (SON) model by Pelckmans et al. (in: PASCAL workshop on statistics and optimization of clustering, 2005), Lindsten et al. (in: IEEE statistical signal processing workshop, 2011) and Hocking et al. (in: Proceedings of the 28th international conference on international conference on machine learning, 2011) has received a lot of attention. The advantage of the SON model is the theoretical guarantee in terms of perfect recovery, established by Sun et al. (J Mach Learn Res 22(9):1–32, 2018). It also provides great opportunities for designing efficient algorithms for solving the SON model. The semismooth Newton based augmented Lagrangian method by Sun et al. (2018) has demonstrated its superior performance over the alternating direction method of multipliers and the alternating minimization algorithm. In this paper, we propose a Euclidean distance matrix model based on the SON model. Exact recovery property is achieved under proper assumptions. An efficient majorization penalty algorithm is proposed to solve the resulting model. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model and the majorization penalty algorithm.},

The whole theory is justified with the help of examples. The order relation that we use throughout the paper is a total order relation defined on the collection of all closed and bounded intervals in $$\mathbb {R}$$ .},

By examining criteria for determining spherical convexity, we identified unique properties that differentiate spherically convex quadratic functions from their geodesically convex counterparts in both hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces. Since spherically convex functions over the entire sphere are constant, our analysis focuses on proper spherically convex subsets of the sphere. Our primary results concern non-homogeneous quadratic functions on the spherically convex set of unit vectors with positive coordinates. We also extend our findings to more general spherically convex sets. Additionally, the paper explores special cases of non-homogeneous quadratic functions where the defining matrix is of a specific type, such as positive, diagonal, or a Z-matrix. This study not only provides useful criteria for spherical convexity but also reveals surprising characteristics of spherically convex quadratic functions, contributing to a deeper understanding of convexity in spherical geometries.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we propose a globally convergent iterative method to solve uncertain constrained linear optimization problems. Due to the nondeterministic nature of such a problem, we use the min-max approach to convert the given problem into a deterministic one. We show that the robust feasible sets of the problem corresponding to the uncertainty set and the convex hull of the uncertainty set are identical. This result helps to reduce the number of inequality constraints of the problem drastically; often, this result reduces the semi-infinite programming problem of the min-max robust counterpart into a problem with a finite number of constraints. Following this, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the boundedness of the robust feasible set of the problem. Moreover, we explicitly identify the robust feasible set of the problem for polytopic and ellipsoidal uncertainty sets. We present an algorithm to construct an inner polytope of the convex hull of a general uncertainty set under a certain assumption. This algorithm provides a point-wise inner polytopic approximation of the convex hull with arbitrarily small precision. We employ this inner polytopic approximation corresponding to the uncertainty set and the infeasible interior-point technique to derive an iterative approach to solve general uncertain constrained linear optimization problems. Global convergence for the proposed method is reported. Numerical experiments illustrate the practical behaviour of the proposed method on discrete, star-shaped, disc-shaped, and ellipsoidal uncertainty sets.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the generalized mixed variational inequality, which encompasses both the generalized variational inequality and the mixed variational inequality. The core contribution of this paper is twofold. Firstly, by utilizing the principles of degree theory, we establish certain sufficient conditions for the existence of solutions to the generalized mixed variational inequality. Additionally, we formulate a sufficient condition that ensures the uniqueness of these solutions. Secondly, we recognize that the conditions outlined in our theorem are inapplicable to the generalized mixed polynomial variational inequality, a subclass within the broader family of generalized mixed variational inequalities. To address this, we employ an exceptional family of elements and establish an existence and uniqueness theorem specifically tailored for the generalized mixed polynomial variational inequality.},

We provide conditions under which the solution set of a nonsmooth and nonconvex optimization problem is non-empty and/or compact. We also examine related properties such as the compactness of the sublevel sets, the boundedness from below and the coercivity of the objective function to characterize the non-emptiness and the compactness of the solution set of the underlying optimization problem under the unboundedness of its associated feasible set.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider both unconstrained and constrained uncertain vector optimization problems involving free disposal sets, and study the qualitative properties of their robust Benson efficient solutions. First, we discuss necessary and sufficient optimality conditions for the robust Benson efficient solutions of these problems using the linear scalarization method. Then, by utilizing this approach, we investigate the semicontinuity properties of the solution maps when the problem data is perturbed by parameters given in parameter spaces. Finally, we suggest concepts of approximate robust Benson efficient solutions and investigate Hausdorff well-posedness conditions for such problems with respect to these approximate solutions. Several examples are provided to illustrate the applicability and novelty of the results obtained in this study.},
