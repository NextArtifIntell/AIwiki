  abstract     = {Keystroke biometrics is a promising approach for user identification and verification, leveraging the unique patterns in individuals’ typing behavior. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-based network that employs self-attention to extract informative features from keystroke sequences, surpassing the performance of traditional Recurrent Neural Networks. We explore two distinct architectures, namely bi-encoder and cross-encoder, and compare their effectiveness in keystroke authentication. Furthermore, we investigate different loss functions, including triplet, batch-all triplet, and WDCL loss, along with various distance metrics such as Euclidean, Manhattan, and cosine distances. These experiments allow us to optimize the training process and enhance the performance of our model. To evaluate our proposed model, we employ the Aalto desktop keystroke dataset. The results demonstrate that the bi-encoder architecture with batch-all triplet loss and cosine distance achieves the best performance, yielding an exceptional Equal Error Rate of 0.0186%. Furthermore, alternative algorithms for calculating similarity scores are explored to enhance accuracy. Notably, the utilization of a one-class Support Vector Machine reduces the Equal Error Rate to an impressive 0.0163%. The outcomes of this study indicate that our model surpasses the previous state-of-the-art in free-text keystroke authentication. These findings contribute to advancing the field of keystroke authentication and offer practical implications for secure user verification systems.},

  abstract     = {Demand forecasting has emerged as a crucial element in supply chain management. It is essential to identify anomalous data and continuously improve the forecasting model with new data. However, existing literature fails to comprehensively cover both aspects of anomaly detection and continuous improvement in demand forecasting. This study proposes an enhanced model to improve accuracy in the demand forecasting. The proposed model introduces a novel data handling method that incorporates an anomaly detection autoencoder, improved with anomaly correction mechanisms. The data handling approach simultaneously detects data anomalies, distinguishes between expected and unexpected anomalies, and corrects anomalous data, ensuring cleaner input for demand forecasting. Then, the proposed model employs a long short-term memory architecture for demand forecasting, enhanced with a continuous improvement method. Thus, the model not only forecasts demand but also retrains the model when the anomaly data surpasses the predetermined threshold, thereby improving the accuracy of forecasting. The results show that the proposed model outperforms other models in detecting data anomalies, achieving an average precision-recall of 0.922, a receiver operating characteristic value of 0.739, and a significance level of less than 0.05. Finally, the model exhibits superior performance in demand forecasting, with average mean squared error, root mean squared error, and mean absolute error values of 33.167, 4.347, and 1.509, respectively, all with a significance level of less than 0.05.},

  abstract     = {Channel pruning is a method to compress convolutional neural networks, which can significantly reduce the number of model parameters and the computational amount. Current methods that focus on the internal parameters of a model and feature mapping information rely on artificially set a priori criteria or reflect filter attributes by partial feature mapping, which lack the ability to analyze and discriminate the channel feature extraction and ignore the basic reasons for the similarity of the channels. This study developed a pruning method based on similar structural features of channels, called SSF. This method focuses on analysing the ability to extract similar features between channels and exploring the characteristics of channels producing similar feature mapping. First, adaptive threshold coding was introduced to numerically transform the channel characteristics into structural features, and channels with similar coding results could generate highly similar feature mapping. Secondly, the spatial distance was calculated for the structural features matrix to obtain the similarity between channels. Moreover, in order to keep rich channel classes in the pruned network, different class cuts were made on the basis of similarity to randomly remove some of the channels. Thirdly, considering the differences in the overall similarity of different layers, this study determined the appropriate pruning ratio for different layers on the basis of the channel dispersion degree reflected by the similarity. Finally, extensive experiments were conducted on image classification tasks, and the experimental results demonstrated the superiority of the SSF method over many existing techniques. On ILSVRC-2012, the SSF method reduced the floating-point operations (FLOPs) of the ResNet-50 model by 57.70% while reducing the Top-1 accuracy only by 1.01%.},

  abstract     = {Cervical cancer is one of the most fatal and prevalent illnesses affecting women globally. Early detection of cervical cancer is crucial for effective treatment. Pap smear tests are commonly used, but population-based screening is time-consuming, expensive, and requires expert physicians. Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) has shown promise in addressing this challenge. However, accurately predicting the disease using a single model can be difficult due to the complex data patterns involved. This research proposes a multi-stage architecture to improve cervical cancer screening. Initially, three pre-trained models are employed for image classification, after which the proposed advanced fusion technique is applied to combine the predictions. Additionally, we introduce a filtering approach in the third stage to refine the predictions. Unlike traditional fusion methods, the proposed architecture considers the confidence score of the base classifiers in making the final predictions on test samples. To enhance the performance of the models, we incorporate advanced augmentation techniques, including CutMix, CutOut, and MixUp. We assessed the performance of the proposed framework using a 5-fold cross-validation technique on two benchmark datasets. We evaluated the performance of the proposed framework through 5-fold cross-validation on two benchmark datasets. Remarkably, our framework achieved a classification accuracy of 97.62% and an F1-score of 97.64% on the SIPaKMeD dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately categorizing various cell types in the dataset.},

Therefore, this study examines a vehicle routing problem (VRP) that considers multiple goals and allows vehicles to reach their destinations within a time window with a crashed traveling time. Two objectives are considered, the minimization of total cost and the maximization of customer satisfaction. Firstly, a fuzzy multi-objective linear programming (FMOLP) model with alpha-cut technique and epsilon-constraint method is proposed to transform the multi-objective problem into a single-objective mathematical model, and then an improved genetic algorithm (IGA) is constructed to solve large-scale problems. The performances of the proposed methods are evaluated through several case studies. Design of experiments and sensitivity analysis are applied to evaluate the performance and robustness of IGA. The results show that both the FMOLP and IGA are effective, and the IGA can efficiently obtain a near-optimal solution.},

The present work aims to devise a time-series machine learning model including a recurrent neural network (RNN) and nonlinear autoregressive network with the external state (NARX) to estimate the mechanical properties of the repaired aluminium plate using the force-extension plot. The ultimate tensile strength, yield strength, impact energy and elongation of the repaired aluminium plate can be calculated based on a force-extension plot trained and extracted using the developed networks. In addition, the Bayesian technique is employed to recalculate the optimal hyperparameters of RNN and NARX, targeting the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) between the target and the estimated force during the testing. The investigated methods (RNN and NARX) with the addition of classical estimation methods, including decision tree and support vector regression, are modelled in MATLAB, and the outcomes prove the proposed NARX model efficiency in terms of lower RMSE in comparison with support vector regression, decision tree and RNN.},

  abstract     = {One widely concerned issue in the field of seawall settlement prediction is the difficulty in establishing prediction models in the context of insufficient data volume. Fractional-order grey model (FGM), as an extension of the traditional grey model incorporating fractional calculus, has been used to solve the insufficient data volume problem in temporal prediction. Due to the non-integer nature of the fractional order of FGM, traditional parameter estimation methods often lead to increased instability and uncertainty and are no longer applicable, necessitating the adoption of more complex algorithms for estimating the fractional order. To solve this issue, a novel GA-FGM-RTA combined model was proposed for predicting seawall settlement with insufficient data volume, where a genetic algorithm (GA) with enhanced search capabilities was employed to optimal the fractional order and a real-time tracing algorithm (RTA) was applied to provide a dynamic prediction. A case study of Haiyan seawall in Zhejiang province, China was selected to validate the proposed model. We also compared the proposed GA-FGM-RTA model with the fractional-order GM(1,1), integer-order GM(1,1), and fractal theory model. Results exhibit that the proposed GA-FGM-RTA combined model outperforms other relevant models under the same algorithm frame.},

However, traditional TEM nonlinear inversion adopts the OCCAM imaging method, which merely presents the approximate shape of the stratum model, with poor inversion accuracy and much iteration time. To solve the above problems, a novel nonlinear inversion approach based on extreme learning machine (ELM) is proposed in this paper. The ELM is required to establish the input–output mapping relationship of the inversion network only once through the analytical method, which is different from the traditional neural network method that demands iterative gradient learning and is prone to fall into the local optimum. Moreover, the ELM inversion network by randomly assigning the hidden layer parameters is capable of mapping the observed TEM data and quickly producing resistivity images, which avoids time-consuming iteration and inversion calculations. The presented approach is applied to both synthetic and field examples. The results show that compared with the traditional nonlinear inversion algorithms (BP and OCCAM), the proposed method achieves better inversion accuracy and significantly reduces the calculation time, which verifies the effectiveness of the ELM algorithm for TEM data interpretation. Additionally, the research provides a new method and technology for TEM data inversion.},

  abstract     = {The optimization objective of Combined Economic Emissions Dispatch (CEED) must simultaneously ensure that full generation costs and pollutant emissions are minimized to meet load demands and constraints. Though the CEED problem itself has multi-objective to be optimized (e.g., fuel cost and emissions), it can be converted into a single objective with a price penalty factor. A nonlinear convergence factor-based manta ray foraging optimization algorithm was proposed for solving the CEED problems. Six nonlinear convergence functions, including the Gaussian function, sine function, cosine function, tangent function, power function and exponential function (named S1MRFO ~ S6MRFO), are introduced in the spiral foraging behavior stage based on the hypotrochoid manta ray foraging optimization algorithm (HYMRFO). These modifications enhance the MRFO algorithm&#39;s search capabilities and avoid getting trapped in local minima. The CEC-BC-2017 benchmark functions were used to examine the performance of six revised mathematical spiral feeding strategies for MRFO algorithm, and the S6MRFO algorithm with the best results was chosen. Combining the S6MRFO algorithm with other intelligent optimization algorithms, such as the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (AOA), Multi-Verse Optimizer (MVO), Harris Hawk Optimization (HHO), Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA) and Ant Lion Optimizer (ALO) are compared together for optimal performance.

  abstract     = {Automatic crowd counting has made significant progress in recent years. However, due to the challenge of multi-scale variations, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with fixed-size kernels cannot effectively address this difficulty, leading to a severe limitation on counting performance. To alleviate this issue, we propose a semantic enhancement Transformer crowd counting network (named SET) to improve the semantic encoding relationships in crowd scenes. The SET integrates global attention from Transformer, learnable local attention, and inductive bias from CNNs into a counting model. Firstly, we introduce an efficient Transformer encoder to extract low-level global features of crowd scenes. Secondly, we propose a hybrid convtrans module to dynamically learn appropriate weights for different regions, aiding in enhancing the model’s global visual understanding. Finally, in order to guide the model to focus better on crowd regions, we jointly employ a segmentation attention module and a feature aggregation module to aggregate semantic and spatial features at multiple levels, thus obtaining finer-grained features. We conduct extensive experiments on four challenging datasets, including ShanghaiTech Part A/B, UCF-QNRF, and JHU-Crowd++, achieving excellent results.},

By addressing these dimensions and continuously seeking improvement, vocational colleges can enhance the effectiveness of their blended learning programs.

Currently, the CoCoSo approach was utilized to address MAGDM challenges. Intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) serve as tools to represent uncertain data during the evaluation process.

To meet these demands, our research focuses on the domain of 4D printing and introduces the blockchain-empowered C4DPSC_DT platform, which is based on dynamic supply and demand principles. This platform is meticulously analyzed to unveil its complex nature, characterized by the integration of physical entities, virtual twin representations, and collaborative services, forming five distinct attributes under this triadic fusion. To further enhance the adaptability of the C4DPSC_DT platform, we propose an adaptive collaborative microservice architecture. Additionally, to emphasize the collaborative service attributes of the platform, we introduce the blockchain-empowered C4DPSC framework. This framework incorporates a collaborative multi-chain blockchain structure and the HotStuff consensus algorithm, facilitating the creation of a secure, distributed, traceable, and transparent environment for sharing C4DP resources and collaboration in C4DP services, thereby establishing decentralized and trustworthy collaborative service connections. Moreover, we systematically decompose the collaborative process into five stages, providing a comprehensive lifecycle solution for the systematic analysis and understanding of the 4D Printing Service collaboration process.

Ensuring the efficiency of such IoT systems is crucial and requires addressing the management of resources. The article primarily focuses on the computation of efficiency in IoT applications, specifically considering metrics such as availability, functional correctness, and throughput. These metrics directly correlate with packet transfer information. Our main objective is to establish the efficiency of an IoT application by employing metrics related to packet transfer rate, utilizing a fuzzy-based Bayesian belief model. Key metrics such as availability, functional correctness, and throughput are commonly utilized to gauge the performance of packet transfer. To achieve this, we propose a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) model that incorporates these metrics. To calculate efficiency, we have employed a fuzzy-based approach within the Fuzzy Inference System (FIS), which allows for efficient computation when crisp values of availability, functional correctness, and throughput are provided.},

  abstract     = {Meta-heuristics are utilized to handle challenging optimization problems, since conventional optimization techniques for such problems often fail or become stuck in the local optimum. Teaching-learning based optimization algorithm (TLBO) is a prominent meta-heuristic that mimics the teaching-learning process. It is initially employed to tackle unconstrained optimization problems. The main obstacle to meta-heuristics is premature convergence. The strategy of forming groups of students is introduced in the teaching-learning process for mutual discussions and joint projects. Along with some advantages, like increased creativity, diversity of ideas, access to new information, and more critical thinking, the group discussion strategy also has few disadvantages, such as disagreements over ideas, group size sensitivity, dependency on others, and lengthened the completion time. If properly implemented, the strategy can be a useful tool in the teaching-learning process. To increase an algorithm local search capabilities and to produce solutions of diverse nature, it is essential to have sufficient knowledge about the optimum solution with enough population diversity. Through group discussion sufficient information with diverse views about the solution of the problem is obtained. Therefore, in this work, the group discussion strategy is embedded to the learner phase of TLBO to enhance it. In the strategy, the group of randomly selected individuals correspond to each candidate solution is made to minimize the happening of premature convergence. This strategy depends on the group size parameter; for which the sensitivity analysis is also performed to obtain the right/optimal value. The suggested algorithm is known as GTLBO, and the group size parameter sensitivity analysis generates its four versions, referred to as GTLBO2–GTLBO5, where the digits 2–5 represent the group size value. The performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated by the unconstrained benchmark problems of CEC 2017. The comparison of the obtained simulations’ results of the newly designed and some state-of-the-art algorithms on the tested problems exhibits that the suggested algorithms take the first, third, fourth, and fifth ranks in the top five ranks, which highlights the importance of the introduced strategy in the sense of enhancing TLBO.},

Based on the “No Free Lunch” theory, this paper discusses the development status of swarm intelligence algorithms. ISO introducing a chaotic mapping strategy allows the population to generate uniform and randomly distributed initial values at the beginning of ISO. A forced switching mechanism improving the balance between two different updating phases is introduced to address the slow convergence rate based on SO. A variant strategy of whale optimization algorithm is used to make further improvement for exploration of SO. The optimal domain perturbation strategy is used to find a better value near the result after above process. These enhancements result a more robust and effective optimization framework suiting to solve complex continuous optimization problems across various domains. The convergence ability and stability are validated by comparing ISO with SO and eight other classical or latest algorithms with dimensionality setting as Dim = 10 and Dim = 20 in the test functions from CEC-2021. The convergence efficiency achieves 94/160 and the convergence stability achieves 77/160. The ratio of convergence efficiency achieves $$100\%$$ and the ratio of convergence stability achieves $$96.25\%$$ in the applicable functions which are half of CEC-2021 functions. They represent the problems which ISO performs well. The practicality of ISO is further illustrated using three continuous optimization problems.

  abstract     = {The increasing adoption of hybrid clouds in organizations stems from their ability to bolster private cloud resources with additional public cloud capacity when required. However, scheduling distributed applications, such as workflow tasks, on hybrid cloud resources presents new and intricate challenges. A significant concern revolves around the potential exposure of private data and tasks within third-party, public cloud infrastructures, especially within sensitive domains like healthcare applications. The complexity escalates when considering the selection of resources from multiple cloud providers due to the fluctuating resource computation prices and data transmission costs. This paper presents the Spark Workflow Task Scheduling to Hybrid Cloud (SWSHC) framework, designed to schedule Spark workflows precisely while adhering to deadline and task privacy constraints within a hybrid cloud setting. Our innovative approach encompasses developing and implementing three pivotal components: deadline division, stage order optimization, and task scheduling mechanisms. We segregate the workflow deadline for each stage to bridge the gaps between stages effectively. Additionally, job prioritization is achieved using the maximum rank rule. The proposed solution considers diverse factors, including interval pricing variations, utilization of heterogeneous VM instances, intra- and inter-bandwidth considerations, and the efficient utilization of private cloud resources. Through meticulous calibration of our algorithm and comprehensive experimentation with various realistic workflows, our findings unequivocally demonstrate that SWSHC surpasses existing solutions in the current literature the cost by up to 40–70% in terms of cost efficiency and resource utilization.},

  abstract     = {Cloud computing offers solutions for various scientific and business applications. Large-scale scientific applications, which are organized as scientific workflows, are carried out using cloud computing. However, the higher failure rates in cloud computing can be attributed to the numerous servers and components dealing with intense workloads. This study presents a fault-tolerant scheduling approach using proactive and clustering methods for scientific workflows in cloud computing. Initially, the task clustering issue is addressed by consolidating multiple short-duration tasks into a single job to improve the runtime performance of workflow executions. Subsequently, an automated workflow scheduling strategy is outlined with four key stages: monitoring, analysis, planning, and execution. During monitoring, clustered jobs and the capacities of available cloud resources are observed. In the analysis phase, the accuracy of failure prediction is enhanced by employing the Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) neural network prior to any faults or failures. The planning stage introduces a novel hybrid multi-objective algorithm, MOPSO-aSA, based on MOPSO and adaptive simulated annealing (SA), to streamline workflow scheduling in error-prone execution environments. Moreover, the reliability of application execution is maintained through re-clustering and migration techniques following any faults or failures. Finally, based on the experimental findings, it is evident that the proposed strategy surpasses other methods in terms of makespan, total cost, energy consumption, and failure rate.},

  abstract     = {The concept of archives has received significant attention within the realm of multi-objective optimization. However, there exists a substantial gap in exploring archives within surrogate-assisted multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (SAMOEAs). In this paper, a novel framework called surrogate archive assisted multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (SAAMOEA) is introduced. The framework uses a surrogate archive to guide the evolution of the algorithm. This archive serves as an external database to store individuals that perform better during evolution, reducing the randomness of the individuals. Firstly, the surrogate archive is initialized using multiple MOEAs, and the surrogate constructed by the individuals in this initialization archive are used to approximate the exact function. Secondly, a cluster-based model management strategy is proposed that employs K-means method to fit the Pareto front and identify infilled individuals. Simultaneously, an environment selection method is proposed. The method determines whether infilled individuals are used to update the surrogate by calculating a convergence quality metric. The quality of the individuals in the surrogate archive is maintained inversely through the two strategies described above to provide conditions for accurate model construction. Furthermore, the paper presents three hypotheses about the relationship between the Pareto front of the surrogate model and the Pareto front of the exact function evaluation. The SAAMOEA was compared to ten state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms, and simulation experiments were conducted on 12 benchmark functions to obtain non-parametric estimation results and distribution plots of the true PF. Additionally, SAAMOEA was validated on an airfoil design optimization problem. The HV results and optimized parameter results demonstrate the performance advantages of the algorithm.},

However, it remains a challenging problem because of the inherent nonlinear dynamics, stochasticity, and spatial-temporal correlation of traffic flows. In this paper, a traffic flow prediction model called Spatial-Temporal Attention based ChebNet and BiGRU model (STA-CN-BiGRU), which consists of several layers of ST-Residual Block, is proposed. Firstly, ChebNet is used to learn the spatial dependence of traffic flow caused by the topology of the road network. BiGRU is combined with CNN for capturing the spatial and multi-scale temporal correlation of traffic flows. Then, in order to incorporate the different importance levels of temporal and spatial dependencies for each node, a hybrid spatio-temporal attention module is incorporated into the traffic flow prediction model and then a ST-Residual Block is constructed. Further, the outputs of multiple component traffic flows are weighted fused to obtain the final predictions. Finally, the performance of the proposed model has been extensively evaluated on real-world datasets in terms of one-step ahead prediction, multi-step ahead prediction, and ablation study. The results show that the proposed model can improve the prediction accuracy over the baselines, especially outperforming other models in long-term prediction.},

With the widespread application of encryption technology in the network, encrypted traffic classification has become a hot research topic. At present, most existing methods only focus on the accuracy of network traffic classification. Yet, few work studies the reliability of the classification model, which plays an important role in network regulation and network security. In this paper, we propose a novel traffic classification method based on trustworthy deep learning model, which can effectively improve the reliability of encrypted traffic classification models by correcting the confidence of model output. Specifically, we firstly perform data preprocessing on the original network traffic, and then adopt a ConvNet for feature learning and a ClassifyNet for traffic classification in the initial stage. At the same time, we utilize a trustworthy confidence criterion to design a ConfidNet trained according to the probability of the true class. The ConfidNet can provide a reliable confidence measure for the prediction of the classification model. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets ISCX VPN-nonVPN and USTC-TFC2016, and show that our method can improve the reliability of the classification model and has a good ability to identify misclassified samples compared with state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {The time-dependent and long sequential time-series is always considered as a challenging problem. It normally demands the robust machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL)-based techniques to efficiently preserve the long-ranged dependencies within intricate time-series datasets. In recent years, transformer-based architectures have emerged as a powerful tool across various data mining fields, particularly in natural language processing (NLP). These architectures are widely regarded for their ability to effectively handle long-range dependencies in sequence-based data structures, such as text and time-dependent datasets. Consequently, transformers have paved the way for advancements in complex long-sequence time-series forecasting tasks. However, recent studies have highlighted limitations in transformer-based predictive models, particularly in their ability to fully capture the joint spatial and temporal representations within input sequences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach in this paper, multi-channel attention transformer for time-series (MAT4TS). Our MAT4TS model enhances the performance of long-sequence time-series forecasting by extending the conventional self-attention mechanism. This enhanced self-attention is complemented by additional multi-channel filtering and embedding processes, leveraging convolutional neural network (CNN)-based architectures. By integrating these processes, our model is able to extract richer spatial–temporal information from long-range sequences, ultimately leading to more accurate prediction outcomes. The comprehensive comparative studies within real-world long-sequential time-series datasets demonstrated the effectiveness as well as superiority of our proposed MAT4TS model for dealing with long-ranged time-series prediction problem in comparing with previous state-of-the-art baselines.},

Although methods have been provided to calculate the security risk and identify malicious apps in Android operating system, but with the expansion of the level and depth of the threats, the need for more effective methods in this context is still required. In this paper, we have devised a new algorithm to calculate the security risk of Android apps, which can be used to identify malicious apps from benign ones. In this algorithm, to estimate the security risk of an unknown input app, its nearest neighbors to malicious apps and its nearest neighbors to normal apps are computed separately using Hamming distance. Then, the security risk of the input app can be computed using a simple formulation. After implementing this algorithm, its parameter for the number of neighbors using various real datasets is adjusted. The extensive experiments conducted on these data show the superiority of the proposed method over the previously proposed ones in terms of detection rate.

In this study, we rehabilitate the ML procedure via the modified ML (MML) methodology and obtain the likelihood equations in which two of them have explicit solutions, and the remaining one should be solved numerically. Since the MML methodology explicitly solves two of three likelihood equations, the mentioned drawbacks are alleviated. We also propose a simple algorithm to obtain the estimates of the parameters of the GG distribution. Then, the GG distribution is used for modeling the real data sets, and the performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarby–Shanno (BFGS) and Nelder–Mead (NM) algorithms.

However, existing studies have largely overlooked the disparities in risk contagion effects between different industries and the overall market across diverse time scales, and there remains instability in delineating risk frequency domains. Consequently, it becomes challenging to fully unravel the intricate correlation dynamics between different industries and the broader stock market across varying temporal dimensions. Therefore, this paper takes the China stock market as a representative of emerging markets, selects eleven distinct industry indices along with the Shanghai-Shenzhen 300 Index (CSI 300 Index), and introduces the Variable Mode Decomposition (VMD) algorithm to extract intricate information from time series data. Additionally, the Fuzzy Entropy (FE) algorithm is employed to effectively reconstruct different frequency domains. Furthermore, this paper integrates the strengths of the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model, the Copula function, and the Conditional Value at Risk (CoVaR) model. By constructing the novel VMD-FE-GARCH-Copula-CoVaR hybrid model, this research aims to explore the risk contagion characteristics of various industries and the Shanghai-Shenzhen 300 Index across different time scales, offering a fresh perspective for the paper of risk contagion within stock market industries.},

  abstract     = {The application of the electronic control unit (ECU) motivates dynamic models with high precision to simulate mechatronic systems for various analysis and design tasks like hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) simulation. Unlike traditional physical models which are established based on the research experience or the mechanics mechanism, in this study, a novel data-driven modeling approach is presented based on the piecewise affine (PWA) identification method. In this work, the highly nonlinear dynamic of automotive actuators is well approximated by the PWA model. To obtain experimental data that can accurately reflect the characteristics of actuators, a test bench was first built. On this basis, the PWA identification of automotive is composed of the data clustering, the model structure selection, and the model parameter estimation. The proposed clustering method improves the widely used balanced iterative reducing and clustering using hierarchies (BIRCH) by introducing a refinement phase for handling clusters with arbitrary shapes. The model structure selection and the parameter estimation are jointly solved by using the optimization method. The presented method is demonstrated with an academic example and an automotive throttle, and the results show that the proposed method can achieve a high model quality, which means that the normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) is 0.03 and the absolute maximal prediction error can reach 2.43°. Compared to other models like a physical model or a fuzzy model, the improvement using the proposed model can be up to 50%. Thus, the quality of the proposed PWA model is sufficient for HiL simulation.},

  abstract     = {Simulated Moving Bed (SMB) chromatography separation is a novel absorptive separation technique with high separation capacity, and it is challenging to make the process run stably at the desired operating point for a long time. Therefore, powerful, and adaptive soft sensor models are important for the overall stability, efficiency, and optimization of the SMB chromatographic separation process. Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), known for its robust generalization capability, can serve as a valuable soft-sensor model for predicting economic and technical indicators such as purity and yield in SMB chromatography separation processes. To improve the prediction accuracy of ELM, avoid stochasticity and learn incrementally, a bidirectional online sequential ELM (BOSELM) is proposed. BOSELM learns data with fixed or varying block sizes on a one-by-one or block-by-block basis (data chunks) without the need to define the size of the network beforehand and determines the output weights based on the analysis of the sequentially arriving data. On the other hand, BOSELM also makes use of the bidirectional ELM&#39;s ability to explore the number of hidden nodes to reduce the number of hidden nodes without affecting the learning efficiency, improving the speed and adaptability of model training. The moving window (MW) strategy was adopted to adaptively correct the BOSELM (MW-BOSELM) to address the issue of decreasing model prediction accuracy caused by changes in process conditions. Additionally, the MW strategy kernel-extreme learning machine (MW-KELM) exhibits higher prediction accuracy than MW-BOSELM at certain instances. To enhance the adaptability of the model, an adaptive hybrid soft-sensor model is proposed to intelligently switch between BOSELM and KELM. Comparative analysis with previous models like BELM, OSELM and BOSELM highlights the superiority of the proposed hybrid adaptive soft-sensor model. Thus, these models help to improve the operational efficiency, product quality and economics of the SMB chromatographic separation process.},

To the best of our knowledge, non of these approaches focus on generating cover photos from a text story. The paper addresses this issue by introducing multi-object image generation with text title from a text story. We split the problem into three steps:- understanding semantics of text story, predicting layout of objects, and generating a cover photo. At start, a semantic relation was encoded between text story objects using a Scene graph, then features from graph neural network were concatenated with single object features from scene graph to create an object layout. All of these features were then passed on to the image generating part. Image generation was further divided into two phases. In the first phase, the image is generated using a scene graph image generation model. While in the second phase, the results of first phase were further enhanced using image translation model conditioned on the object layout. In final phase we generated title of the given story based on generated image. In our experiments, we used custom dataset of text stories with three animal categories along with the COCO dataset. For the image generating part, we evaluated our approach with state of the art models known as scene_gen and sg2im. Our method generated high-resolution informative cover photo with story title by positioning the objects at right locations as specified in the text story.},

Thus, the structural representation of the algebraic interpolant closer to the present moment of time becomes more accurate compared to the older Chebyshev nodes. The internal smoothing scheme is used to find a balance between the ability of the algebraic interpolant to reflect the local dynamics and to suppress the unwanted effects outside the interpolation interval. Evolutionary optimization algorithms are used to define near-optimal corrections of nodal values of the time series. The proposed nonlinear mapping scheme used on the last elements of an equally spaced time series enables a more accurate extrapolation of the soft algebraic interpolant. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to employ non-uniform Chebyshev nodes for the prediction of an equally spaced time series. Computational experiments with several standard time series are used to demonstrate the efficacy and the accuracy of the proposed one-step-ahead forecasting scheme.},

  abstract     = {Ant-Miner, a rule-based classifier, has been extensively utilized for classification tasks. However, it features numerous controlling parameters that significantly impact its performance. The standard Ant-Miner (AM) often encounters issues such as slow or premature convergence and high selective pressure. Several studies have proposed innovative methods to enhance AM’s performance by examining the quality function, heuristic strategies, and pheromone update mechanisms. Recent research has also focused on ant selection for pheromone updates and term selection strategies. Despite substantial efforts, existing studies are limited by challenges like local optima entrapment, premature or slow convergence, high selective pressure, exhaustive searches, and the generation of specific yet low-quality rules. This paper introduces a novel Ant-Miner algorithm (ASAQ—AM) that implements novel Ant-Selection strategies for pheromone updating and data classification, alongside an Advanced Quality function. This novel quality function employs hierarchical thresholds to evaluate ants based on coverage, rule length, and accuracy. The selected ants contribute to pheromone updates on their respective paths guided by the proposed quality function. The effectiveness of the ASAQ—AM approach is assessed using four publicly available datasets and standard benchmark performance metrics, including accuracy and F1-score. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the basic Ant-Miner, state-of-the-art variants, and several data mining approaches in terms of accuracy, F1-score, and convergence speed.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, problem of secure message (signal and image) transmission is studied. The message is encrypted by masking it with a chaotic system state and then transmitted to receiver-side via a communication channel. It is assumed that the communication channel may be prone to a cyber-attack. The transmission system dynamics in presence of the cyber-attack in the communication channel is modeled by a singular dynamical system. Then, at the receiver-side, a novel observer is designed to recover the message together with the cyber-attack signal. Estimation of the cyber-attack is crucial for monitoring the communication channel and enable a network supervisor to mitigate the adverse consequences and make an appropriate strategy. It is assumed neither restrictions on the message nor on the cyber-attack signals. This makes the proposed scheme, the best solution in the real applications. Moreover, comparing to the existing methods which two public and private channels are required, only one communication channel is used in this paper for transmission the encrypted signal which results in a cheaper solution. Solving the optimization problem can be easily performed with the help of the existing toolboxes such as YALMIP and CVX software in MATLAB. Finally, numerical simulations for signal and image transmission are presented to justify the applicability and superior performance of the proposed scheme.},

More than 100,000 genomic sequences from different geographical locations and different variants have been tested in this research by various machine learning models. The use of KNN and SVM classifier models has resulted in the accurate diagnosis and differentiation of about 99% of coronavirus samples from the influenza virus.

  abstract     = {Music has become a part of many people&#39;s lives. Early adopters used to buy tapes or CDs to listen to music, which were difficult to preserve and easily damaged. With the digital transfor-mation of the industry, users nowadays can listen to various genres/styles of music online through digital music platforms at any time. As the types and styles of music are numerous, some digital music platforms have begun to consider providing more diverse ways of delivering music listening services. For example, various music classification systems allows users to easily find all albums by the same singer; different styles of music streaming services save users time in searching for songs of the same type; and the ability to share playlists allows users to share their listening playlists with family and friends. This service model increases peer discussion topics and exposure to albums, songs, and singers. The study summarizes the driving factors influencing the adoption of digital music subscription services using expert interviews and literature reviews. The study outlines four adoption-driving dimensions (service benefits, service efficiency, behavioral attribution, and adoption intention) and 16 evaluation criteria. Besides, this study integrates Desire and Satisfaction Analysis (DSA) and Network Relation Map (NRM) to propose a DSA-NRM analysis to evaluate the adoption strategy and optimal development path for digital music subscription services. Based on the four quadrants of music subscription services, this study proposes four selected strategies (attention strategy, sustainment strategy, adjustment strategy, and focus strategy). The research results show that the SB (service benefits) aspect has high desire and low satisfaction and can adopt selected strategy D (focus Strategy). The AI (adoption intention) aspect is an aspect with intense desire and low satisfaction and can use strategy C (adjustment strategy) chosen. The AI (adoption intention) aspect can dominate other aspects, and the SE (service effectiveness) can be dominated by different aspects.},

  abstract     = {Path planning is a major problem in autonomous vehicles. In recent years, with the increase in applications of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), one of the main challenges is path planning, particularly in adversarial environments. In this paper, we consider the problem of planning a collision-free path for a UAV in a polygonal domain from a source point to a target point. Based on the characteristics of UAVs, we assume two basic limitations on the generated paths: an upper bound on the turning angle at each turning point (maximum turning angle) and a lower bound on the distance between two consecutive turns (minimum route leg length). We describe an algorithm that runs in $$O(n^2 \log n)$$ time and finds a feasible path in accordance with the above limitations, where n is the number of obstacle vertices. As shown by experiments, the output of the algorithm is much closer to the shortest path with this requirement (always below about 10% of the shortest path), in a much smaller time (up to 10,000 quicker, in our experiments). We further demonstrate how to decompose the algorithm into two phases, a preprocessing and a query phase. In this way, given a fixed start point and a set of obstacles, we can preprocess a data structure of size $$O(n^2)$$ in $$O(n^2 \log n)$$ time, such that for any query target point we can find a path with the given requirements in $$O(n \log n)$$ time. Finally, we modify the algorithm to find a feasible (almost shortest) path that reaches the target point within a given range of directions.},

A reasonable reserve of emergency materials can play an important role in post-disaster rescue. This paper uses the uncertain comprehensive evaluation method to grade the emergency materials, and establishes a location model for the uncertain emergency materials. The location of the reserve point is determined by maximizing the rescue satisfaction, the maximum number of service demand points under the maximum coverage, and pursuing the minimum sum of the distance from the demand point to the reserve point. Based on the uncertainty theory, the uncertain emergency materials location model is converted into an equivalent deterministic emergency materials location model, and the model is solved by a tabu search algorithm.

Pricing mechanisms must address the perishable nature of RBCs and supply–demand uncertainties to minimize wastage. Government intervention in blood donation and healthcare costs further emphasizes their role in addressing these challenges. This paper utilizes mathematical modelling to investigate pricing within the RBC supply chain, involving stakeholders like governments, public hospitals, and blood banks. Employing a government-led Stackelberg game framework, it considers the precedence of government decisions. Objective functions of each participant incorporate economic and social aspects in both centralized and decentralized scenarios. The study starts with optimizing RBC pricing in blood banks and then establishes coordination mechanisms via revenue-sharing contracts to improve supply chain efficiency, cut costs, and minimize waste—an approach novel in the RBC supply chain context. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated through a numerical example based on real-world data. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses are conducted on key parameters to provide valuable insights for management decision-making.},

This study addresses this challenge by proposing a multi-objective mathematical model that optimizes cost, production, and environmental objectives. Fuzzy Robust Optimization (FRO) incorporates uncertainty into the model, and the Linear Programming Metric (LP-Metric) is employed to solve it. A case study using the Chadormalu mine demonstrates the model&#39;s effectiveness in planning shift transport. Sensitivity analysis confirms the model&#39;s ability to handle uncertainty.

It jointly optimizes the machine location, job assignment, and job sequence decision to yield a globally optimal solution. This paper investigates the multiple-agent scheduling and location problem on unrelated parallel machines with the objective of minimizing the sum of the fixed location cost of the machines, transportation cost of the jobs between the locations of the jobs and machines, and total weighted completion time of the jobs of one agent while keeping the total weighted completion time of each other agent no greater than a given limit. To solve this problem, we develop a tailored Benders decomposition algorithm, which decomposes the problem into a Benders master problem and a Benders subproblem. The Benders master problem determines which locations are chosen to set up machines and which jobs are assigned to each machine. The resulting Benders subproblem finds the optimal job sequence of the jobs assigned to each machine in use, which is solved by an exact dynamic programming algorithm. To speed up the convergence of the developed algorithm, some improvement strategies, including warm start strategy and weak Benders cut generation, are introduced. Computational experiments on randomly generated instances show the effectiveness and efficiency of developed algorithm and improvement strategies. Moreover, management insights are drawn from the sensitivity analyses of some key parameters.},

The LQBOA uses Lagrange interpolation and simple quadratic interpolation techniques with adapted parameter settings to enhance the search strategy of BOA and to achieve a better balance of diversification and intensification. LQBOA’s performance was examined on 45 traditional benchmark issues as well as the IEEE CEC 2017 benchmark suites with 10, 30 and 50 dimensions, and the results were compared against popular state-of-the-art and modified algorithms. It was discovered that in more than 85% of cases, the proposed LQBOA outperformed the compared algorithms. The Friedman rank test and Wilcoxon rank test were used to validate the suggested LQBOA’s rank and significance. Additionally, convergence and diversity analyses were performed to investigate its convergence speed and searching behavior, respectively. Furthermore, LQBOA has been successfully deployed to solve twelve real-world issues including several engineering design problems and two multiple gravity assist spacecraft trajectory problems. The results of these problems were compared to those of a wide range of algorithms, demonstrating the superior performance of the proposed LQBOA. In conclusion, LQBOA makes a significant addition to the optimization area, and its application could greatly improve the performance of numerous optimization jobs.},

We put forward a two-stage problem-solving approach that can effectively solve the train operation plan employing express and local type services. A mathematical model is formulated to address multi-level problems including line planning, train scheduling, train circulation planning, and an assignment for passengers’ travel. A two-stage iterative bi-objective algorithm is designed to suggest a targeted optimization for passengers’ traveling expenses and the enterprise’s running expenses. The first phase aims at optimizing the regularity of service to maximize the number of travelers achieved and the bi-objective function. The second phase, however, readjusts the stop plan for express operations to improve the objective until reaching the best possible setting. Finally, a real-world case study with three instances setting different departure ratios for local and express operations demonstrates how the train operation plan created using our approach lowers operational costs while meeting service level requirements with superior performance.},

  abstract     = {Efficient botnet detection is of great security importance and has been the focus of researchers in recent years. Botnet detection is also a difficult task due to the difficulty in distinguishing it from normal traffic. At the same time, detecting these botnets require a lot of computation resources using traditional methods and this limitation makes it even more difficult to detect them on Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Considering the massive IoT data, an efficient and lightweight approach for detecting and predicting IoT botnet attacks is required. In this paper, multiple lightweight machine learning methods including a deep Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) method and a Random Forest (RF) method are integrated into a stacked ensemble learning model to detect botnet attacks in IoT devices. This integration is based on applying lasso regression on features and utilizing a logistic regression in ensemble learning, which leads to increasing the accuracy of botnet detection and reducing its computational complexity. The performance evaluation of the proposed model is examined from two perspectives: accuracy and lightweight characteristics; and for this purpose, a real-world UNSW (BoT-IoT) dataset is used. A comparative study with competitive neural network methods demonstrates that our approach delivers a better outcome. Experimental results reveal that this method has a higher efficiency in all metrics than competing methods including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score with values of 99.3%, 99.2%, 99%, and 99.1%, respectively. Besides, the results showed that the proposed method requires at least 36% less CPU and 38% less memory compared to the competing methods, which makes the proposed method to be suitable for IoT devises with limited resources.},

  abstract     = {We propose a new financial model called the generalized fractional Brownian motion Heston exponential Hull–White model, which has stochastic volatility and interest rate, long memory, and heavy tail distribution. Based on the market price of the volatility and delta hedging strategies, we propose a partial differential equation (PDE) to obtain the European option price. To do this, portfolio changes contain long one position of the European call option and shares of the underlying assets (stock, zero coupon bond, volatility), where we use the mentioned model to obtain the price. Due to transaction costs, the resulting equation is a fully nonlinear PDE, which we use the Deep Galerkin Method (DGM) to solve it. Also, we present the proof of the convergence of the method to this class of equations, which includes two parts: the convergence of the loss function to zero and the convergence of the neural network to the exact solution of the equation. We finally present numerical results to show the model and method’s effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Based on the theory of Euler’s equations, this paper constructs a novel five-dimensional Hamiltonian conservative hyperchaotic system with the aim of systematically exploring and analyzing its dynamic characteristics, while validating its potential application value in the field of information security. A comprehensive and multi-faceted dynamic analysis of the new system is conducted, encompassing energy variations, equilibrium point distributions, Poincaré section structures, and the computation of Lyapunov exponents. The analysis reveals that the system exhibits excellent chaotic properties and demonstrates remarkable conservative hyperchaotic behavior across a wide range of initial values and parameters. Notably, a significant enhancement in the maximum Lyapunov exponent is observed, further highlighting the system’s potential and promising applications in information security. Additionally, by adjusting the initial values, the coexistence of nested phenomena across multiple energy levels is observed, providing intriguing perspectives for further investigation of the system. Finally, this paper proposes an image encryption scheme based on this system and is successfully applied in the field of image encryption. Experiments show that compared with the information entropy of similar documents in the past four years, the information entropy of this scheme increased by 0.02% on average, and the highest value reached 7.9995, which confirmed that the encryption algorithm has excellent confidentiality performance and provided new ideas and methods for the development of the field of information security.},

  abstract     = {Check valves are key components in hydraulic systems. The cross-port leakage in check valves is a common fault that affects their performances. The vibration and pressure fluctuations excited by leaks are weak, therefore leakage is difficult to be identified and classified by intelligent algorithms and non-destructive testing methods. To maximize the performance of leak pattern recognition, we had improved the sequential minimal optimisation algorithm for enhancing the classification performance and tested it with the University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository. Furthermore, combining with the search and rescue team (SaRT) algorithm, we propose SaRT-SVM algorithm. Two important parameters γ and C of support vector machine (SVM) were optimised and compared with response surface and other algorithms. We analysed the SaRT–SVM method for leakage pattern recognition and validated the robustness of the developed method by applying the method on multiple fault samples of each fault mode, additional different noises, and another independent data collection. The results showed that the SaRT–SVM algorithm exhibited excellent classification performance and robustness when applied to the leakage pattern recognition of hydraulic check valves under the influence of different noises.},

  abstract     = {The main focus of this paper is to investigate the asymptotic stability of impulsive fuzzy fractional dynamic systems (IFFDSs) under the Caputo fractional derivative concept in the short-memory sense. To address the issue of asymptotic instability in IFFDSs, a linear feedback controller is introduced. The paper proposes two methods for achieving this, namely Lyapunov’s direct method (LDM) which is known for its high efficiency in surveying the stability theory of dynamic systems, and the direct evaluation method (DEM), which utilizes the properties of the Laplace transform, the Mittag–Leffler function, and Gronwall–Bellman inequality. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated through numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {In the rapidly evolving field of education, a semantic search engine is essential to efficiently retrieve knowledge experts’ data. Universities and colleges continuously generate a vast amount of educational and research data. A semantic search engine can assist students and staff in efficiently searching for required information in such a big data pool. The existing systems have limitations in providing personalized recommendations that align with the individual learning objectives of students and scholars, thus hindering their educational experience. To address this, this paper proposed a KMSBOT. This novel recommendation system effectively summarizes academic data and provides tailored information for students, research scholars, and faculty, enhancing educational experiences. This paper meticulously details the development of KMSBOT, which comprises a neo4j-based knowledge graph technique, the NLP method for data structuring, and the KNN machine learning model for classification. The system employs a three-module approach, utilizing data structuring, NLP processing, and semantic search engine integration. By leveraging Neo4j, NLTK, and BERT in Python, this proposed work ensures optimal performance metrics such as time, accuracy, and loss value. The proposed solution addresses traditional recommendation systems’ limitations and contributes to a brighter future, improving user satisfaction and engagement in academic environments.},
