  abstract = {Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) has promising applications in the field of dielectric capacitors. However, its low dielectric constant and thermal conductivity limit energy storage density. To address this, three multilayer composite topologies were designed with PVDF/boron nitride nanosheets as insulation and PVDF/MXene as polarization layers. A performance evaluation framework based on the analytic hierarchy process technique for order preference by similarity to the ideal solution method identified the insulation–polarization–polarization–insulation topology as the optimal configuration. This structure enhanced the dielectric performance (ε r /tan δ) by 239.44% over pure PVDF at 10 3 Hz, increased thermal conductivity by 60.45%, and improved breakdown field strength. In addition, charge–discharge efficiency at 300 MV/m reached 75%, with a discharge density of 6.3 J/cm 3 , which is 152% higher than PVDF. The multilayer design effectively integrates the strengths of each layer to significantly enhance the overall performance, demonstrating that operational research methods are practical for evaluating dielectric materials and guiding design.},

  abstract = {2 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) field-cycling relaxometry and broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS) studies show that water dynamics in silica pores with similar diameters (∼6 nm) strongly depend on the functionalization of the inner surfaces. In all studied confinements, we observe two prominent changes in the temperature dependence of water reorientation. Specifically, the activation energy of E a ∼ 0.3 eV in the fully liquid state more than triples to E a ∼ 1.0 eV upon partial crystallization at T m ∼ 258 K. Furthermore, in the partially crystallized state, the liquid fraction shows a dynamical crossover at ∼185 K, where the common low-temperature behavior of confined water with E a = 0.4–0.5 eV is established. However, the correlation times of water reorientation are up to two orders of magnitude longer in amino-acid functionalized silica pores than in pristine ones. Comparing the results for different functional groups, NMR and BDS consistently show that the slowdown is strongest for basic lysine followed by neutral alanine and, finally, acidic glutamic acid. Based on this order, one may speculate that the changed dynamics are a consequence of different pH values of water in confinements with different functional groups. Although pH measurements confirm that the pH value strongly depends on the amino-acid functionalization, this speculation must be rejected due to the observation that water with very different pH values does not show diverse reorientation dynamics when enclosed in identical pores.},

  abstract = {Crystallization due to liquid → solid transformation is observed in many natural and engineering processes. Extant literature indicates that crystallization in supercooled liquids is initiated by precursory metastable phases or states, also called non-classical nucleation. For face-centered cubic (FCC) materials, latest experimental and computational studies suggest that metastable hexagonal-closed packed (HCP) structures facilitate equilibrium FCC formation. However, the underlying nucleation mechanism remains unclear. Here, we examine structural changes and energetic barriers associated with such a non-classical mechanism, by performing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using pure Al, Al-0.5 at. %Cu, and Al-0.5 at. %Ni (all FCC-formers) and phenomenologically coupling MD results with phase-field (PF) modeling. Such a coupling involved initializing PF simulation domains and constructing Landau polynomials—consistent with MD observations. Unsupervised machine learning was utilized to capture nuclei structures from MD simulations, while neural networks helped in extracting equilibrium interfacial energies from PF modeling. Atomistic simulations showed that precursory nuclei are comprised of collection of metastable-HCP states with medium ranged ordering. The pockets of HCP states later transform to critical nuclei—containing an FCC core and an outer layer of HCP. PF modeling qualitatively replicated the precursory-to-critical nuclei transformation and showed that the energetic barriers between the precursory and critical nuclei are substantially smaller than predictions obtained from classical nucleation theory. Together, these observations permitted us to propose a holistic non-classical mechanism that links triangular motifs within Al-based supercooled liquids to the critical nuclei via in-liquid structural transformations.},

We clarified that for rigid molecules aligned by dipole transitions, the positions of any two atoms depend on the molecular chirality, owing to the parity-odd second-rank tensors. This type of asymmetry, hidden in the so-called one-dimensional alignment, such as cos 2 θ , can be understood on the basis of the equivalence of inversion and rotation for any two points in space. Perfect chiral sensitivity is achieved when the transition dipole moment is 45° to an axis perpendicular to both position vectors of the two atoms. The positions of two specific atoms are calculated for a chiral isotopomer and methyloxirane using the spherical harmonic addition theorem. We discuss the absolute configuration and the orientation of chiral molecules.},

The solvated electrons were generated by the propagation of a femtosecond laser pump pulse. In the area with a pump laser intensity over 2 × 10 13 W/cm 2 , where a high density of free electrons was produced, solvated electrons exhibited an additional rapid increase in optical density (OD) at 800 nm, 7–9 ps after the pump pulse excitation. In contrast, no two-step increase in OD was observed when probed at 400 nm, suggesting that the absorption coefficient of the solvated electrons rapidly changed around 800 nm after femtosecond laser excitation for a few picoseconds. This observation might indicate the structural and electronic modulation of solvated electrons owing to the high density of free electrons in water, accompanied by femtosecond-laser-induced plasma generation.},

  abstract = {Benzophenone serves as a prototype chromophore for studying the photochemistry of aromatic ketones, with applications ranging from biochemistry to organic light-emitting diodes. In particular, its intersystem crossing from the first singlet excited state to triplet states has been extensively studied, but experimental or theoretical studies on the preceding internal conversion within the singlet manifold are very rare. This relaxation mechanism is particularly important because direct population transfer of the first singlet excited state from the ground state is inefficient due to its low oscillator strength. In this work, our aim is to fill this gap by employing mixed quantum-classical and full quantum dynamics simulations and time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy for gas-phase benzophenone and meta -methyl benzophenone. Our results show that nonadiabatic relaxation via conical intersections leads to an increase in the population of the first singlet excited state, which appears linear within the simulation time of 500 fs. This population transfer due to conical intersections can be directly detected by a bifurcation of the photoelectron signal. In addition, we discuss to clarify the role of the third singlet excited state degenerate to the second excited state—a topic that remains largely unexplored in the existing literature on benzophenone.},

Atomic oxygen was detected using the Raman transitions between the spin–orbit coupled triplet ground states. Atomic oxygen was generated in an H 2 /O 2 /Ar diffusion flame and an O 2 /Ar pulsed plasma discharge. Single exponential decays were observed for the O( 3 P 2 )–O( 3 P 1 ) Raman transition at 158.3 cm −1 and the O( 3 P 2 )–O( 3 P 0 ) Raman transition at 227 cm −1 . From the decay measurements, the atomic O Raman linewidths were obtained from 25 to 150 Torr in non-equilibrium plasma and at 760 Torr in a flame. Enhanced signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of atomic oxygen and atomic to molecular oxygen signal contrasts were obtained by taking advantage of electronic triplet coherence beating. Enhancement of up to seven times in the atomic O SNR was observed. We also found that the dephasing rates of O 2 (v = 0–3, N = 37) were similar, which provides evidence for the assumption that vibrational excitation does not influence the dephasing of diatomic molecular rotational CARS transitions.},

In this work, we employ the highly accurate hierarchical equations of motion method to characterize the spin states and track the real-time coherent flip-flop spin dynamics in a surface-adsorbed hydrogenated Ti dimer. Our simulations accurately reproduce the experimental observations and reveal the influences of substrate and pulse duration on the spin decoherence process of the dimer.

  abstract = {We introduce a technique for extracting microstructural geometry from NMR line shape analysis in porous materials at angstrom-scale resolution with the use of weak magnetic field gradients. Diverging from the generally held view of FID signals undergoing simple exponential decay, we show that a detailed analysis of the line shape can unravel structural geometry on much smaller scales than previously thought. While the original q-space PFG NMR relies on strong magnetic field gradients in order to achieve high spatial resolution, our current approach reaches comparable or higher resolution using much weaker gradients. As a model system, we simulated gas diffusion for xenon confined within carbon nanotubes over a range of temperatures and nanotube diameters in order to unveil manifestations of confinement in the diffusion behavior. We report a multiscale scheme that couples the above-mentioned MD simulations with the generalized Langevin equation to estimate the transport properties of interest for this problem, such as diffusivity coefficients and NMR line shapes, using the Green–Kubo correlation function to correctly evaluate time-dependent diffusion. Our results highlight how NMR methodologies can be adapted as effective means toward structural investigation at very small scales when dealing with complicated geometries. This method is expected to find applications in materials science, catalysis, biomedicine, and other areas.},

Although extensively studied within electronic structure theory, the UCC Ansatz remains relatively unexplored for the problem of molecular vibrations. In this contribution, working equations for the unitary vibrational coupled cluster (UVCC) Ansatz are derived, implemented, and benchmarked. Accuracy and convergence of state-specific excitation energies toward the full vibrational configuration interaction (FVCI) limit are observed to be comparable to vibrational coupled cluster theory. In addition, the overlap of a truncated UVCC state with the FVCI state is shown to exhibit some interesting properties from the perspective of fault-tolerant quantum computing.},

In this work, we introduce a new family of methods for advanced sampling that draw inspiration from functional representations used in machine learning and approximation theory. As shown here, such representations are particularly well suited for learning free energies using artificial neural networks. As a system evolves through phase space, the proposed methods gradually build a model for the free energy as a function of one or more collective variables, from both the frequency of visits to distinct states and generalized force estimates corresponding to such states. Implementation of the methods is relatively simple and, more importantly, for the representative examples considered in this work, they provide computational efficiency gains of up to several orders of magnitude over other widely used simulation techniques.},

  abstract = {Delta-T shot noise is activated in temperature-biased electronic junctions, down to the atomic scale. It is characterized by a quadratic dependence on the temperature difference and a nonlinear relationship with the transmission coefficients of partially opened conduction channels. In this work, we demonstrate that delta-T noise, measured across an ensemble of atomic-scale junctions, can be utilized to estimate the temperature bias in these systems. Our approach employs a supervised machine learning algorithm to train a neural network, with input features being the scaled electrical conductance, the delta-T noise, and the mean temperature. Due to limited experimental data, we generate synthetic datasets, designed to mimic experiments. The neural network, trained on these synthetic data, was subsequently applied to predict temperature biases from experimental datasets. Using performance metrics, we demonstrate that the mean bias—the deviation of predicted temperature differences from their true value—is less than 1 K for junctions with conductance up to 4 G 0 . Our study highlights that, while a single delta-T noise measurement is insufficient for accurately estimating the applied temperature bias due to noise contributions from other sources, averaging over an ensemble of junctions enables predictions within experimental uncertainties. This suggests that machine learning approaches can be utilized for estimation of temperature biases and similarly other stimuli in electronic junctions.},

Some simple machine learning approaches using average current blockade depths and dwell-times have been investigated to improve this situation. In this work, a comprehensive statistical analysis of nanopore current signals is performed and demonstrated to be sufficient for classifying up to 42 peptides with over 70% accuracy. Two sets of features, the statistical moments and the catch22 set, are compared both in their representations and after training small classifier neural networks. We demonstrate that complex features of the events, captured in both the catch22 set and the central moments, are key to classifying peptides with otherwise similar mean currents. These results highlight the efficacy of purely statistical analysis of nanopore data and suggest a path forward for more sophisticated classification techniques.},

  abstract = {Aqueous phase heterogeneous catalysis is important to various industrial processes, including biomass conversion, Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, and electrocatalysis. Accurate calculation of solvation thermodynamic properties is essential for modeling the performance of catalysts for these processes. Explicit solvation methods employing multiscale modeling, e.g., involving density functional theory and molecular dynamics have emerged for this purpose. Although accurate, these methods are computationally intensive. This study introduces machine learning (ML) models to predict solvation thermodynamics for adsorbates on a Pt(111) surface, aiming to enhance computational efficiency without compromising accuracy. In particular, ML models are developed using a combination of molecular descriptors and fingerprints and trained on previously published water–adsorbate interaction energies, energies of solvation, and free energies of solvation of adsorbates bound to Pt(111). These models achieve root mean square error values of 0.09 eV for interaction energies, 0.04 eV for energies of solvation, and 0.06 eV for free energies of solvation, demonstrating accuracy within the standard error of multiscale modeling. Feature importance analysis reveals that hydrogen bonding, van der Waals interactions, and solvent density, together with the properties of the adsorbate, are critical factors influencing solvation thermodynamics. These findings suggest that ML models can provide rapid and reliable predictions of solvation properties. This approach not only reduces computational costs but also offers insights into the solvation characteristics of adsorbates at Pt(111)–water interfaces.},

We have performed dynamics simulations in four ab initio molecular models for which benchmark ab initio multiple spawning (AIMS) data have been published. We find that the spin-LSC and the previously reported symmetric quasi-classical (SQC) approaches provide nearly equivalent population dynamics. While we expected the more involved spin-PLDM method to provide superior accuracy compared to the other mapping-based approaches, SQC and spin-LSC, we found that it performed with equivalent accuracy compared to the AIMS benchmark results. We further explore the underpinnings of the spin-PLDM correlation function by decomposing its N 2 density matrix-focused initial conditions, where N is the number of states in the quantum subsystem. Finally, we found an approximate form of the spin-PLDM correlation function, which simplifies the simulation and reduces the computational costs from N 2 to N .},

This allows us to fully include the impact of spin–orbit coupling in relativistic calculations and for applications to finite magnetic fields. For the latter, we use London atomic orbitals to ensure gauge origin invariance. It is shown that this formalism is superior to the more common canonical noncollinear approach in relativistic calculations, as it naturally includes all three spin current densities in the closed-shell limit and avoids the projection onto the spin magnetization vector. This is important to easily restore rotational invariance in this limit. In addition, the Scalmani–Frisch approach can be made numerically stable and may lead to a nonvanishing local magnetic torque. However, both formalisms are rotationally invariant for open-shell systems and in finite magnetic fields.},

Here, we propose a unified integration scheme for solving the common sets of equations of motion in MD. To achieve this, we adapted the traditional SHAKE method for treating rigid bonds to a predictor–corrector integration scheme and combined it with the existing time-reversible velocity predictor and box predictor. This new approach enables using both the time-honored Verlet method and the recently improved Gear methods. The resulting unified integration scheme was tested on two simple models and two MD systems: SPC/E water and ionic liquid (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoridoborate). Trajectories in microcanonical, Nosé–Hoover canonical, and MTK isobaric ensembles were generated. The results for Verlet-based methods were in excellent agreement with those obtained using conventional integration methods. For particular tasks, the use of higher-order methods can be beneficial. Overall, in comparison with standard approaches, our universal scheme provides a significantly simpler route to devising new integrators and maintaining existing simulation software. Furthermore, our family of new integrators can be efficiently deployed in massively parallel MD software.},

Following our earlier bond energies from bond orders and populations model that takes a similar form as an extended Hückel model but uses well-conditioned orbital populations, this work demonstrates a proof of concept for approximating ZPEs, an important component in thermochemistry calculations, while eschewing unfavorably scaling algorithms involving Hessian matrices. The ZPE-BOP1 model uses Mulliken orbital populations from hybrid Kohn–Sham density functional theory calculations within an extended Hückel-type model that defines vibrational bond energy terms using two atom-pairwise parameters that are fit to reproduce ZPEs from B3LYP calculations. The more accurate ZPE-BOP2 model uses Mulliken orbital populations from Hartree–Fock calculations within a different extended Hückel-type model that includes a short-range anharmonic energy term and a coupled three-body oscillator energy term with seven atom-pairwise parameters. Both models predict ZPEs in molecules involving first row elements, but ZPE-BOP2 outperforms ZPE-BOP1 in strained and long-chain molecules and provides ZPEs more competitive with those from semi-empirical QM methods (e.g., AM1, PM6, PM7, and XTB-2) that compute ZPEs with Hessian calculations. This work shows progress and an outlook toward computational models that use well-conditioned orbital populations to efficiently predict useful physicochemical properties. It also shows opportunities for approximate QM models that would shift traditional computational bottlenecks away from costly algorithms such as Hessian calculations to others that focus on reliable orbital populations.},

Rather than evaluating the evolution of the mixed quantum–classical density operator, we derive exact equations of motion for the nonequilibrium average values of a set of operators or variables, along with correlation function expressions for the dissipative coefficients that enter these equations. These equations are obtained by requiring that the exact nonequilibrium averages are equal to local nonequilibrium averages that depend on auxiliary fields whose values satisfy evolution equations obtained using projection operator methods. The results are illustrated by deriving reaction–diffusion equations coupled to fluid hydrodynamic equations for a solution of quantum particles that can exist in two metastable states. Nonequilibrium steady states are discussed along with the reaction rate and diffusion correlation functions that characterize such states.},

Accelerated tasks include matrix multiplication, diagonalization, and inversion, as well as Cholesky decomposition. The scaling of the implemented strategy over multiple accelerating devices is assessed in the range of 1–8 GPUs per node and found to be remarkably regular. Tests are performed on three systems: α -quartz, a microporous zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8), and a giant mesoporous metal–organic framework (bio-MOF). Scaling with system size is investigated via supercells of increasing size of both α -quartz and ZIF-8 (up to 648 and 2208 atoms per cell, respectively). The bio-MOF model structure has 2808 atoms per cell, with 33 672 basis functions. We test the performance of the accelerated code with both generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and hybrid GGA exchange–correlation functionals. The efficiency of the new accelerated code is compared to the previous central processing unit (CPU)-only parallelization strategies based on MPI or MPI/OpenMP within either replicated or distributed memory (i.e., massively parallel) approaches. Such a comparison highlights how the new GPU-accelerated code enables calculations on large systems at a significantly reduced computational cost relative to CPU-only strategies. For instance, we find that for the bio-MOF system, the computing time of the linear algebra tasks from a single GPU is comparable to that from the reference approach in the range of 512–1024 CPU cores and 4–8 nodes.},

  abstract = {Fluid transport across nanometric channels induced by electric, pressure, and concentration gradients is ubiquitous in biological systems and fosters various applications. In this context, computer simulation setups with well-defined open-boundary equilibrium starting states are essential in understanding and assisting experimental studies. However, open-boundary computational methods are scarce and do not typically satisfy all the equilibrium conditions imposed by reality. Namely, in the absence of external gradients, (1) the system of interest (SoI) must be at thermodynamic and chemical equilibrium with an infinite reservoir of particles; (2) the fluctuations of the SoI in equilibrium should sample the grand canonical ensemble; (3) the local solvation thermodynamics, which is extremely sensitive to finite-size effects due to solvent depletion, should be correctly described. This point is particularly relevant for out-of-equilibrium systems; and (4) finally, the method should be robust enough to deal with phase transitions and coexistence conditions in the SoI. In this study, we demonstrate with prototypical liquid systems embedded into a reservoir of ideal gas particles that the adaptive resolution simulation (AdResS) method, coupled with particle insertion/deletion steps (AdResS+PI), satisfies all these requirements. Therefore, the AdResS+PI setup is suitable for performing grand canonical and stationary non-equilibrium simulations of open systems.},

The model can be thought of as a straightforward rendition of colloid flocculation into large spherical aggregates. We illustrate how temperature and particle density influence the cluster size distribution and affect inter- and intra-cluster dynamics. The system is shown to exhibit two well separated length and time scales, which can be tuned by the balance between repulsive and attractive forces. Interestingly, cluster aggregates at moderate/low temperatures approach a cluster glassy phase, whereas cluster particles retain a local liquid-like structure. These states present a strong suppression of density fluctuations for a significant range of relatively large wavelengths, meeting the criterion of effective disordered hyperuniform materials as far as the intercluster structure is concerned.},

  abstract = {Cross-linked networks of semiflexible biopolymers are one of the essential building blocks of life as they are the scaffolds providing mechanical strength to biological cells to handle external stress and regulate shape. These protein structures experience strain at different rates often under confinement such as a membrane. Here, we compute the steady-state dynamics of stress and stress fluctuations in a wall-confined, continuously sheared, reversibly cross-linked, sticker–spacer model of a semiflexible biopolymer network. We find that the averages and fluctuations of shear stress and pressure increase by orders of magnitude when the strain rate is increased above a certain regime. The shear viscosity decreases with increasing strain rate except near the critical strain rate regime where it exhibits an inflection. Upon increasing the strain rate, we note a shift from a long time autocorrelation to an oscillatory and then to a sharply dropping autocorrelation function, endorsed by corresponding changes in the power spectrum of the stress. These outcomes indicate a transition from stick to stick - slip ( stress buildup and relaxation ) and then to slip upon increasing the strain rate, and we posit that this has to be a hallmark intermittent response of a dynamically cross-linked network under continuous shear deformations. We suggest that a fluctuation–dissipation type framework, where the stress is a stochastic process and “resistance to stress” is a function of strain rate, can help us understand the stress dynamics in biopolymer networks.},

  abstract = {This study presents a novel methodology for the separation of quartz and feldspar under neutral and weakly alkaline conditions. Ethyl-bis(dodecyl dimethyl ammonium bromide) (Gemini) is introduced as a new collector in the flotation process, combined with sodium oleate (NaOL) to enhance separation efficiency. The investigation focuses on the adsorption mechanism of these combined collectors on mineral surfaces. While the individual collectors, Gemini and NaOL, were ineffective in differentiating between quartz and feldspar, their combination resulted in significantly improved separation outcomes. Flotation tests indicated that at a pulp pH of 7, with Gemini and NaOL at concentrations of 12 × 10 −5 mol l −1 and molar ratios of 1:1 and 1:2, the flotation recovery of quartz was 46.51% and 40.57% higher than that of potassium feldspar, respectively. Zeta potential measurements, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses, and molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that the Gemini collector predominantly influences the flotation performance of quartz and feldspar. NaOL molecules do not directly adsorb onto the quartz surface; instead, they co-adsorb via electrostatic interactions with Gemini, which minimally affects the interaction dynamics. In contrast, NaOL preferentially adsorbs onto the aluminum, silicon, and other reactive sites on the feldspar surface through its –COO functional group, leading to competitive adsorption with Gemini and consequently diminishing Gemini’s effectiveness on feldspar. This study elucidates the selective separation mechanism of quartz and feldspar using Gemini and NaOL and aims to provide insights into employing combined collectors in diverse separation scenarios to enhance quartz quality.},

  abstract = {Carbonaceous materials have demonstrated extensive potential as anodes for sodium ion batteries (SIBs). Nevertheless, large-scale commercial use is severely hampered by the slow reaction kinetics and rapid capacity fading. Heteroatom doping can create abundant active sites to improve the ion adsorption properties of carbon materials. Here, we report a novel nitrogen/boron co-doped carbon nanosheet (NB-CN) with abundant N–B bonds for efficient Na + storage. B-doped MIL-68 as a carbon precursor can not only achieve uniform B doping but also serve as the nitrogen doping site to form N–B bonds. N, B co-doping could promote ion adsorption with improved hydrophilicity, while the 2D porous structure can accelerate the Na + transfer kinetics. Benefitting from the synergistic effect of dual-doping and hierarchical porosity, NB-CN shows improved Na + storage performance, NB-CN displays a high capacity of 307.1 mA h g −1 in SIBs at 0.1 A g −1 , and still has a reversible capacity of 157 mA h g −1 for SIBs at 4 A g −1 after 8000 cycles. Moreover, the assembled NB-CNs//Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /C full cell also exhibits the potential application prospect. This work provides an insight for designing dual-doped carbon materials for high-performance SIBs.},

  abstract = {Modeling the evolution of the melt front under gravity in the presence of a horizontal thermal gradient is a challenging issue, hitherto tackled exclusively with the concepts and tools of computational continuum thermomechanics, too phenomenologically driven to have satisfactory predictive capabilities. Here, we show that this complex phenomenon is amenable to treatment by the methods and tools of Non-Equilibrium Molecular Dynamics (NEMD). To do so, we addressed all the difficulties caused by the necessity of applying suitable boundary conditions and minimizing surface effects so that the bulk behavior of the system in non-equilibrium conditions can be detected. Sufficient adiabatic separation of the time scales permits us to use macroscopically relatively short—but microscopically long enough—time averages to get the macroscopic bulk behavior of the system accurately. To get an adequate signal-to-noise ratio, we had to use an unphysically large value of the gravity. However, we know from NEMD simulations in transport studies that the phenomena produced are stable over many orders of magnitude. In conclusion, our work proves that molecular simulation can be a good tool to study this family of non-equilibrium phenomena, although further work is needed to achieve quantitative predictive capabilities.},

The selection of the accurate TIP4P/2005 potential for water and the adoption of scaled charges for ions, ±0.85 e for monovalent ions and ±1.70 e for divalent ions, are the key features of the model. The use of scaled charges enhances the description of several properties, including solubility, transport properties, the density maximum, and the water activity in ionic solutions. In this study, we will investigate the performance of scaled charges in describing the properties of inorganic salts containing Cl − , Li + , Na + , and Ca +2 in another polar solvent, methanol. The ion charges and ion–ion interactions were taken from the Madrid-2019 potential, while the accurate OPLS/2016 model was selected for methanol. The protocol used in the development of the Madrid-2019 model, particularly regarding the selection of target properties in the fitting procedure, was applied to create this potential using LiCl, NaCl, and CaCl 2 as inorganic salts. Its predictive ability was evaluated by calculating the density, dielectric constant, self-diffusion coefficients of methanol and ions, and viscosity for methanolic solutions of these three salts. As will be shown, the experimentally observed effects of salt addition are reproduced by the new model, not only qualitatively but also quantitatively. Furthermore, since the interaction potential is compatible with the Madrid-2019 model, we also demonstrated its accurate predictive ability in the ternary system methanol + water + NaCl.},

  abstract = {This paper reports two bimodal first-order transformations in the disordered form III of linezolid. The most notable result was the identification of a transient apparently amorphous state, different from the glass, during slow heating from the glass. This transient state was interpreted as resulting from the competition between two organizations, i.e., a locally preferred structure reminiscent of the ordered form and the long-range order of the disordered form, energetically closer to the undercooled liquid than the ordered form. The first-order transformation of the undercooled liquid in this short lifetime amorphous state reflects a polyamorphism in a pharmaceutical active ingredient, which is a very unusual feature in the domain of solid-state transformations in molecular materials. Meanwhile, the bimodal polymorphic transformation of the stable crystalline form II into form III via a transient liquid state during rapid heating can also be considered as an uncommon feature for a polymorphic transition. It was found that both atypical transformations assisted by thermally activated conformational motions into the disordered crystalline form III could be kinetically hindered by the high energy barrier between conformational polymorphs. As a consequence, the polyamorphic transformation can only be detected using the rapid acquisition capability of a low-frequency Raman spectrometer, probing the molecular organization from short- to long-range order.},

  abstract = {Quantum batteries (QBs) have garnered attention as candidates for energy storage devices due to their inherent quantum advantages over classical electrochemical batteries. However, owing to the vulnerability of quantum resources to disorder, the ability of a charged QB to effectively store and discharge energy may be adversely affected by mechanical motions, thermal fluctuations, impurities, and defects in the QB. In this connection, we study the effects of (i) Gaussian static disorder, Gaussian white noise, and Gaussian colored noise in the onsite energies and electronic couplings and (ii) periodic oscillations in the electronic couplings on the exciton storage efficiency and exciton discharge rate of an open excitonic QB model—an open quantum system that stores and discharges excitons. To efficiently average over the many possible noise realizations, we employ an accurate mixed quantum–classical dynamics method that treats the QB quantum mechanically and the thermal baths in a classical-like way. The results reveal that the exciton storage efficiency decreases as the disorder strength increases, with static disorder causing the largest reductions followed by colored noise and white noise. In contrast, the exciton discharge rate remains mainly unaffected by the different types of disorder, even under very strong disorders. Moreover, depending on the model parameters, the incorporation of periodic oscillations into the electronic couplings could either enhance, have no significant effect on, or decrease the exciton discharge rate. Overall, our study elucidates the effects of different types of disorder and inter-site vibrations on the exciton dynamics in a charged QB, thereby shedding light on the importance of environmental noise engineering and mitigation in open QBs.},

  abstract = {A full-dimensional potential energy surface (PES) represented by the neural network method for the first excited state S 1 ( 1 A ″) of HPCO is reported for the first time. The PES was constructed based on more than 51 000 ab initio points, which were calculated at the multi-reference configuration interaction level with Davidson correction using the augmented correlation consistent polarized valence triple zeta basis set. Based on the newly constructed PES, quasi-classical trajectory calculations were carried out to study the photodissociation dynamics of HPCO at the total energy ranging from 4.0 to 5.6 eV. At low total energies, the HP + CO product is dominant, while the product H + PCO becomes increasingly favored at higher energies. Furthermore, the translational energy distributions of two products are found to be energy-dependent. Owing to the strongly repulsive PES along the HP + CO dissociation pathway, the translational energy distributions of HP + CO are dominated by relatively higher energies in contrast to H + PCO. The diatomic products HP and CO are found to possess the vibrational distributions decaying monotonically with the vibrational quantum number and relatively cold rotational state distributions, consistent with the strongly repulsive potentials toward the HP + CO channel. In addition, the vibrational distributions of HP and CO are found to be quite similar due to their close frequencies, while the rotational distributions of CO have a much more highly excited rotational degree of freedom owing to its rotational constant approximately four times smaller than that of HP.},

Compared to experiments that focus solely on CD 3 ( v 2 = 0), our theoretical calculations give a more global picture. It is found that the vibrational enhancement factors of the total ICS are less than 1 only in the very low collision energy region (&lt;0.55 kcal/mol); moreover, the CH stretch-excited reaction also produces vibrationally cold HCl. These two findings indicate that Polanyi’s rules apply to this late-barrier polyatomic reaction, not only in terms of the energy requirement in the breaking bond but also in the energy disposal in the newly formed bond. In addition, although the experimental and theoretical product HCl( v 1 = 1) branching fractions for CD 3 ( v 2 = 0) are in quantitative agreement, the new quantum vibrational enhancement factor for CD 3 ( v 2 = 0) is ∼2.7 times greater than the experimental results.},

  abstract = {The mechanism of the chemical transformations of isolated small organic molecules induced by high-energy radiation is of basic interest for astrophysics and astrochemistry. In this work, we first applied a combination of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to identify the products of the radiation-induced transformations of isolated CH 3 COOH and CD 3 COOH molecules. As revealed by EPR, · CH 3 (or · CD 3 ) is the principal primary radical generated from acetic acid in solid argon and xenon, while the FTIR results suggest that this radical is trapped mainly in the form of the · CH 3 ⋯CO 2 radical–molecule complex. The assignment of this previously unknown complex was based on the complexation-induced shifts of the absorption bands corresponding to CH 3OPLA and CO 2bend vibration modes, confirmed by analysis of the kinetic curves, photochemical behavior, and comparison with the results of ab initio computations at the spin-unrestricted coupled-cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triples level of theory. Most likely, the complex in matrices adopts the geometry close to the theoretically predicted structure with C s symmetry stabilized by the C⋯C and O⋯H interactions. It was suggested that the complex could be produced via the intermediate formation of a CH 3 COOH +· radical cation deprotonating to the CH 3 COO · radical, which promptly decomposed to · CH 3 + CO 2 fragments. We believe that the results obtained in this study may contribute to a better understanding of the processing of acetic acid molecules in astrophysically relevant ices under high-energy irradiation and give a valuable insight into the understanding of weak intermolecular interactions involving radicals relevant to atmospheric chemistry, combustion, and carbon dioxide conversion.},

Experiments are conducted using both methanol and deuterated methanol in order to examine potential isotope effects and to gain insights into the reaction mechanism. Kinetic data and Rice–Ramsperger–Kassel–Marcus calculations indicate the absence of methanol desorption for n &lt; 10 cluster sizes, suggesting dissociative chemisorption of methanol for those sizes. For larger clusters, the reaction involves a combination of association and desorption, with a pronounced size dependence of the corresponding reaction rates. This size dependence is anti-correlated with the promotion energy of an electron from an occupied frontier orbital to the lowest unoccupied d-state.},

In particular, for this purpose, an original interpretation of the Gibbs equimolecular surface concept has been employed. To perform all the above-mentioned evaluations, the extended Gibbs method was combined with the nearest neighbor interaction model. The results of our evaluations of the specific surface energy agree with the experimental values of the specific surface energy for corresponding solid bulk fcc metals. Then, we have found that the values of the specific excess line energy of the Ih nanocluster edges are positive and fall in order of magnitude within the range of 10 −10 to 10 −9 J/m, which agrees with the available evaluations for other types of linear boundaries. The vertex point energy was found to be on the order of 10 −20 J and positive as well. A hypothesis is put forward that the positivity of the excess energies of the edges and vertices results in their instability, i.e., in a trend for the formation of a more rounded shape of polyhedral nanoparticles, especially in the vicinity of their melting temperatures. In addition, some molecular dynamics results on Ih metal nanoclusters are discussed. For Au and Pt Ih nanoclusters, the theoretically calculated values of the specific surface energy are compared with those obtained by combining the Gibbs method with our molecular dynamics results on the size dependence of the potential term into the specific (per atom) internal energy of Ih nanoparticles.},

The Raman spectrum of the radical consists of a prominently enhanced stretching vibration, represented by a band at 212 cm −1 and its overtones. Calculations by range-separated hybrid density functionals (ωB97x and LC-ωPBE) reproduce the experimental vibrational frequency well, with a corresponding bond length of 2.713 (±0.028) Å. A first order anharmonicity of ∼1.42 cm −1 determined for the Br–Cl stretching mode in the radical suggests a convergence of vibrational states at an energy of ∼1.01 eV, using the Birge–Sponer extrapolation. This value, estimated for the radical confined in the solvent cage, compares fairly well with the calculated gas-phase energy, 1.06 eV, required for the radical to dissociate into Br · and Cl − fragments. The Raman detection of a closely related radical, ICl ·− , in water was unsuccessful. The reaction pathways and equilibria have been analyzed to discuss the observability of mixed dihalide and analogous radical species.},

  abstract = {Clusters bound by weak, non-covalent forces, such as van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonds, are ubiquitous in dilute media ranging from aerosols to molecular fluids and biological structures, their interest being not only fundamental as in astrochemistry but also more applied as in organic electronics. Neutral clusters of up to six 1-hexene molecules produced by supersonic expansion of a gas mixture were ionized, mass selected, and spectroscopically characterized using synchrotron-based VUV photoelectron photoion coincidence technique. Ionization energies inferred from these measurements show decreasing trends as the cluster size increases, by about 0.5 eV over the range of 1–6 molecules. Dedicated theoretical DFT-based calculations were performed to unravel the possible structures of these clusters and determine their vertical and adiabatic ionization energies. Our computational search for stable structures considered the possible chirality effects associated with most conformers of the monomer having enantiomers, in an approach with a broad structural sampling employing classical force fields followed by systematic re-optimization using an efficient quantum chemical method. Vertical and adiabatic ionization energies obtained using wavefunction-based methods exhibit significant dispersion due to conformational flexibility already in the monomer, but these effects are magnified in clusters due to their fluxionality at the experimental temperature of about 130 K. Overall, the trends obtained for the calculated vertical ionization energies agree well with the measured data and suggest that possible chiral recognition effects that could stabilize specific structures are likely to be hampered under the present experimental conditions.},

  abstract = {Coexistence of excitons and free charge carriers can complicate conventional spectroscopic studies of transport mechanisms in layered perovskite solar cells. Because of their large concentrations and absorbance cross sections, excitons tend to dominate spectroscopic signals and obscure observations of free charges in this class of systems. To investigate the effects of interstitial organic molecules on charge transport in photovoltaic devices, we apply a newly developed four-pulse transient grating method with photocurrent detection to layered perovskites possessing a range of quantum well thicknesses. In this method, a phase-stabilized “pump” pulse-pair photoexcites a carrier density grating in the active layer of a photovoltaic cell, whereas transport is time-resolved using the carrier density grating generated by a subsequent “probe” pulse-pair. Carrier diffusion mechanisms are revealed by measuring the recombination-induced nonlinear response of the device while varying the delay between pulse-pairs and phase difference between density gratings. Like drift velocity dispersion, our data suggest that encounters with inorganic–organic interfaces broaden the range of diffusivities in addition to skewing the distributions toward slower transit times. Rather than tunneling through the potential energy barriers associated with the organic material, the experimental measurements support a physical picture in which the photoexcited carriers traverse circuitous paths through the active layer while occupying the phases of the thickest quantum wells.},

One such approach is the optimization of parameterized circuits, but this becomes increasingly challenging with circuit size. As a consequence, the utility of large-scale circuit optimization is relatively unknown. In this work we demonstrate that purely classical resources can be used to optimize quantum circuits in an approximate but robust manner such that we can bridge the resources that we have from high performance computing and see a direct transition to quantum advantage. We show this through the sparse wave function circuit solvers, which we detail here, and demonstrate a region of efficient classic simulation. With such tools, we can avoid the many problems that plague circuit optimization for circuits with hundreds of qubits using only practical and reasonable classical computing resources. These tools allow us to probe the true benefit of variational optimization approaches on quantum computers, thus opening the window to what can be expected with near term hardware for physical systems. We demonstrate this with a unitary coupled cluster ansatz on various molecules up to 64 qubits with tens of thousands of variational parameters.},

The key advantage of this measure, which I will denote as the Manhattan exciton size, is that it directly connects with the oscillator strength of the excitons. It provides a strict upper bound on the oscillator strength of any given exciton for linear aggregates. Finally, I demonstrate that this exciton delocalization measure is more sensible for analyzing super-radiant states compared to, for example, the most commonly applied measure, i.e., the (inverse) participation ratio. However, these two measures together provide insight into the degree of exciton confinement.},

  abstract = {Solvation plays a pivotal role in chemistry to effectively steer chemical reactions. While liquid water has been extensively studied, our molecular-level knowledge of other associated liquids capable of forming H-bond networks, such as liquid methanol, remains surprisingly scarce. We use large-scale ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to comprehensively study the structural, dynamical, and electronic properties of bulk methanol under ambient conditions. Methanol is an interesting species in the liquid state since it can only donate one H-bond while a significant fraction accepts two H-bonds, which imprints one-dimensional linear and cyclic H-bonding patterns subject to significant bifurcations. After validation of radial distribution functions and the self-diffusion coefficient with respect to experimental data, we carried out detailed analyses of the H-bond network topology in terms of chain-like, ring-like, and branched H-bonded aggregates, including lifetime assessment. The analysis revealed that nearly all methanol molecules are actively engaged in filamentary H-bonding, predominantly forming branched linear chains with a significant contribution arising from tetrameric to hexameric rings—in stark contrast to the compact three-dimensional H-bond network of water. Five-membered rings turned out to be the most long-lived cyclic structures with an intermittent lifetime of 4 ps, while rings consisting of only three methanol molecules as well as very large cyclic structures are merely transient motifs. Detailed analyses of the effective electric molecular dipoles disclose a pronounced sensitivity of non-additive polarization and charge transfer effects of the individual methanol molecules to the particular H-bond network structure they are a member of, including its topology, be it linear or cyclic.},

However, the nonlocal van-der-Waals density functional (vdW-DF2) employed in BEEF-vdW can be computationally costly and displays relatively low accuracy for molecular systems. Therefore, this work explores whether atom-pairwise and many-body dispersion treatments represent viable alternatives to using the vdW-DF2 functional with BEEF-vdW. To this end, we investigate the performance of commonly used atom-pairwise corrections [i.e., the Tkatchenko–Scheffler (TS) and the exchange-hole dipole moment (XDM) approaches] and many-body dispersion (MBD) treatments for molecular, surface, and solid-state systems. The results indicate that atom-pairwise methods such as TS and particularly XDM provide a good balance of cost and accuracy across all systems.},

  abstract = {In our previous work [Mondal et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 162 , 014114 (2025)], we developed several efficient computational approaches to simulate exciton–polariton dynamics described by the Holstein–Tavis–Cummings (HTC) Hamiltonian under the collective coupling regime. Here, we incorporated these strategies into the previously developed Lindblad-partially linearized density matrix ( ⁠ L -PLDM) approach for simulating 2D electronic spectroscopy (2DES) of exciton–polariton under the collective coupling regime. In particular, we apply the efficient quantum dynamics propagation scheme developed in Paper I to both the forward and the backward propagations in the PLDM and develop an efficient importance sampling scheme and graphics processing unit vectorization scheme that allow us to reduce the computational costs from O ( K 2 ) O ( T 3 ) to O ( K ) O ( T 0 ) for the 2DES simulation, where K is the number of states and T is the number of time steps of propagation. We further simulated the 2DES for an HTC Hamiltonian under the collective coupling regime and analyzed the signal from both rephasing and non-rephasing contributions of the ground state bleaching, excited state emission, and stimulated emission pathways.},

The precise origin of this polarization is often difficult to elucidate because different transition pathways, promoted by different interactions, can occur depending on the nature of the conjugate. Moreover, the complexity of the expressions describing the evolution of the spin state populations and polarization generated by these transitions makes it difficult to estimate the dependence of the polarization on factors such as the exchange interaction and spin–orbit coupling. Here, we present a theoretical analysis and show that by making assumptions for specific cases, simplified expressions can be obtained that provide better insight into the physical origins of the polarization.},

  abstract = {Reaction coordinates are a useful tool that allows the complex dynamics of a protein in high-dimensional phase space to be projected onto a much simpler model with only a few degrees of freedom, while preserving the essential aspects of that dynamics. In this way, reaction coordinates could provide an intuitive, albeit simplified, understanding of the complex dynamics of proteins. Together with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, reaction coordinates can also be used to sample the phase space very efficiently and to calculate transition rates and paths between different metastable states. Unfortunately, ideal reaction coordinates for a system capable of these performances are not known a priori , and an efficient calculation in the course of an MD simulation is currently an active field of research. An alternative is to use geometric reaction coordinates, which, although generally unable to provide quantitative accuracy, are useful for simplified mechanistic models of protein dynamics and can thus help gain insights into the fundamental aspects of these dynamics. In this study, five such geometric reaction coordinates, such as the end-to-end distance, the radius of gyration, the solvent accessible surface area, the root-mean-square distance (RMSD), and the mean native hydrogen bond length, are compared. For this purpose, extensive molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for two peptides and a small protein in order to calculate and compare free energy profiles with the aid of the reaction coordinates mentioned. While none of the investigated geometrical reaction coordinates could be demonstrated to be an optimal reaction coordinate, the RMSD and the mean native hydrogen bond length appeared to perform more effectively than the other three reaction coordinates.},

However, traditional analytical models often face limitations in structural inversion for complex systems, primarily due to the absence of closed-form expressions of scattering functions. To address these challenges, we present a machine learning framework based on the Kolmogorov–Arnold Network (KAN) for directly extracting real-space structural information from scattering spectra in reciprocal space. This model-independent, data-driven approach provides a versatile solution for analyzing intricate configurations in soft matter. By applying the KAN to lyotropic lamellar phases and colloidal suspensions—two representative soft matter systems—we demonstrate its ability to accurately and efficiently resolve structural collectivity and complexity. Our findings highlight the transformative potential of machine learning in enhancing the quantitative analysis of soft materials, paving the way for robust structural inversion across diverse systems.},

  abstract = {Impurity motion in a many-body environment has been a central issue in the field of low-temperature physics for decades. In bosonic quantum fluids, the onset of a drag force experienced by point-like objects is due to collective environment excitations, driven by the exchange of linear momentum between the impurity and the many-body bath. In this work we consider a rotating impurity, with the aim of exploring how angular momentum is exchanged with the surrounding bosonic environment. In order to elucidate these issues, we employ a quasiparticle approach based on the angulon theory, which allows us to effectively deal with the non-trivial algebra of quantized angular momentum in the presence of a many-body environment. We uncover how impurity dressing by environmental excitations can establish an exchange channel, whose effectiveness crucially depends on the initial state of the impurity. Remarkably, we find that there is a critical value of initial angular momentum, above which this channel effectively freezes.},

Three archetypal models of two-dimensional colloidal systems are used as test cases: Weeks–Chandler–Anderson short-ranged repulsion, the Lennard-Jones potential, and a repulsive shoulder interaction with two length scales. Additionally, data on an experimental suspension of colloidal spheres are acquired by optical microscopy and used to test the inversion methods. The methods have different merits. IBI is the only choice when the radial distribution function is known but particle coordinates are unavailable. TPI requires snapshots with particle positions and can extract both pair- and higher-body potentials without the need for simulation. The ML approach can only be used when particles can be tracked in time and it returns the force rather than the potential. However, it can unravel pair interactions from any one-body forces (such as drag or propulsion) and does not rely on equilibrium distributions for its derivation. Our results may serve as a guide when a numerical method is needed for application to experimental data and as a reference for further development of the methodology itself.},

  abstract = {FFLUX is a polarizable machine-learning force field that deploys pre-trained kernel-based models of quantum topological properties in molecular dynamics simulations. Despite a track record of successful applications, this unconventional force field still uses Lennard-Jones parameters to account for dispersion effects when performing in-bulk simulations. However, optimal Lennard-Jones parameters are system-dependent and not easy to calibrate. Fortunately, physics-informed dispersion energies can be obtained from the two-particle density matrix (2PDM) of any system using correlated wavefunctions. The only challenge is that the 2PDM is a humongous object whose calculation is very time-consuming and memory-greedy. In this proof-of-concept study, we utilize the Δ-learning method to address both problems using a small set of water trimers. More specifically, we obtain pure two-electron correlation energies with the aug-cc-pVDZ basis set at the cost of Müller-approximated 2PDM calculated at a very small basis set, 6-31+G(d). We also benchmark different Δ-learning tasks designed by changing the baseline and target method and/or the basis set. Our experiments suggest that two-electron correlation energies of weakly relaxed water trimers can be accurately predicted via Δ-learning with a maximum absolute error of 1.30 ± 0.32 kJ/mol traded against a colossal computational speed-up of roughly 40 times.},

Chem. Phys. 156 , 164107 (2022)]. We first provide a systematic derivation of various iterative solvers to find the unique LISA solution. In a subsequent systematic numerical study, we evaluate their performance on 48 organic and inorganic, neutral and charged molecules and also compare LISA to two other well-known ISA variants: the Gaussian iterative stockholder analysis and Minimum Basis Iterative Stockholder analysis (MBIS). The study reveals that LISA-family methods can offer a numerically more efficient approach with better accuracy compared to the two comparative methods. Moreover, the well-known issue with the MBIS method, where atomic charges obtained for negatively charged molecules are anomalously negative, is not observed in LISA-family methods. Despite the fact that LISA occasionally exhibits elevated entropy as a consequence of the absence of more diffuse basis functions, this issue can be readily mitigated by incorporating additional or integrating supplementary basis functions within the LISA framework. This research provides the foundation for future studies on the efficiency and chemical accuracy of molecular density partitioning schemes.},

  abstract = {The evolution of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations has been intimately linked to that of computing hardware. For decades following the creation of MD, simulations have improved with computing power along the three principal dimensions of accuracy, atom count (spatial scale), and duration (temporal scale). Since the mid-2000s, computer platforms have, however, failed to provide strong scaling for MD, as scale-out central processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU) platforms that provide substantial increases to spatial scale do not lead to proportional increases in temporal scale. Important scientific problems therefore remained inaccessible to direct simulation, prompting the development of increasingly sophisticated algorithms that present significant complexity, accuracy, and efficiency challenges. While bespoke MD-only hardware solutions have provided a path to longer timescales for specific physical systems, their impact on the broader community has been mitigated by their limited adaptability to new methods and potentials. In this work, we show that a novel computing architecture, the Cerebras wafer scale engine, completely alters the scaling path by delivering unprecedentedly high simulation rates up to 1.144 M steps/s for 200 000 atoms whose interactions are described by an embedded atom method potential. This enables direct simulations of the evolution of materials using general-purpose programmable hardware over millisecond timescales, dramatically increasing the space of direct MD simulations that can be carried out. In this paper, we provide an overview of advances in MD over the last 60 years and present our recent result in the context of historical MD performance trends.},

  abstract = {The genome in the cell nucleus is organized by a dynamic process influenced by structural memory from mitosis. In this study, we develop a model of human genome dynamics through cell cycles by extending the previously developed whole-genome model to cover the mitotic phase. With this extension, we focus on the role of mitotic and cell cycle memory in genome organization. The simulation progresses from mitosis to interphase and the subsequent mitosis, leading to successive cell cycles. During mitosis, our model describes microtubule dynamics, showing how forces orchestrate the assembly of chromosomes into a rosette ring structure at metaphase. The model explains how the positioning of chromosomes depends on their size in metaphase. The memory of the metaphase configuration persists through mitosis and into interphase in dimensions perpendicular to the cell division axis, effectively guiding the distribution of chromosome territories over multiple cell cycles. At the onset of each G1 phase, phase separation of active and inactive chromatin domains occurs, leading to A/B compartmentalization. Our cycling simulations show that the compartments are unaffected by structural memory from previous cycles and are consistently established in each cell cycle. The genome model developed in this study highlights the interplay between chromosome dynamics and structural memory across cell cycles, providing insights for the analyses of cellular processes.},

  abstract = {The conformational dynamics of the DNA in the nucleosome may play a role in governing gene regulation and accessibility and impact higher-order chromatin structure. This study investigates nucleosome dynamics using both all-atom and coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics simulations, focusing on the SIRAH force field. Simulations are performed for two nucleosomal DNA sequences—alpha satellite palindromic and Widom-601—over 6 μ s at physiological salt concentrations. A comparative analysis of structural parameters, such as groove widths and base pair geometries, reveals good agreement between atomistic and CG models, although CG simulations exhibit broader conformational sampling and greater breathing motion of DNA ends. Principal component analysis is applied to DNA structural parameters, revealing multiple free energy minima, especially in CG simulations. These findings highlight the potential of the SIRAH CG force field for studying large-scale nucleosome dynamics, offering insights into DNA repositioning and sequence-dependent behavior.},

This work investigates the thermo-orientation and rotational diffusion of non-spherical particles, with special focus on shape asymmetry, through non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Our results indicate that the degree of thermo-orientation of asymmetric particles (cone-shaped) is positively correlated with both the aspect ratio ( R/H ) and the temperature gradient; however, the Soret coefficient exhibits a negative correlation with thermo-orientation. To explore the underlying mechanisms further, we analyzed the variation in the torque experienced by the particles. We propose that the thermo-orientation of particles originates from the combined effects of thermophoretic torque and random torque, which in turn lead to anomalous rotational diffusion behavior. Consequently, we investigated the rotational diffusion characteristics of the particles, observing that the probability density functions of angular displacement transition from Gaussian to thin-tailed distributions, with the degree of non-Gaussianity increasing as the R/H values rise. These results could provide a new perspective based on rotational diffusion dynamics for studying the thermo-orientation of asymmetric particles.},

  abstract = {The activity of particles can be modulated by external conditions such as light irradiation. Research on active particles with spatially varying activity has demonstrated that active particles tend to accumulate in low-activity regions and form a polarity layer at the interface, directed from the high-activity to the low-activity region. Here, we investigate the distribution and dynamics of individual or an ideal gas of inertial particles in a space with alternating active and passive regions. Our findings reveal that high inertia leads to a pronounced depletion layer in the passive region. At the interface between the active and passive regions, in addition to the usual polarity layer, an adjacent anti-polarity layer forms on the active-region side. In extreme situations (narrow region width and long persistence times), the interfacial polarity layer can even reverse orientation. Dynamically, we observe long-time peaks in the velocity autocorrelation function of particles within the active region. For particles with high inertia, the peak can even exceed 1. Correspondingly, the mean squared displacement of high-inertia particles in the active region exhibits an unusual superdiffusive behavior (∼ t 3 ). In addition, kinetic temperature and pressure differences arise between the active and passive regions. The effective temperature of particles with high inertia exhibits a gradual gradient across the active region. Our study provides new insights into the behavior of inertial active particles under spatially modulated activity and lays the groundwork for further exploration of their collective behaviors when interactions are included.},

The results suggest that the model should be applied for theoretically designing the texture and quality of whipped cream and butter products. The modeling complexity in phase inversion processes, from fresh cream via whipped cream to butter, was overcome by using a well-established complex systems approach, the coupled map lattice (CML). The proposed CML consists of a minimal set of procedures (i.e., parameterized nonlinear maps), such as whipping, coalescence, and flocculation, acting on the appropriately coarse-grained field variables, surface energy, cohesive energy, and velocity (flow) of the emulsion defined on a two-dimensional square lattice. In the CML simulations, two well-known and different phase inversion processes are reproduced at high and low whipping temperatures. The overrun and viscosity changes simulated in these processes are at least qualitatively consistent with those observed in experiments. We characterize these processes exhibiting different texture patterns as the viscosity dominance at high whipping temperatures and as the overrun dominance at low whipping temperatures on the viscosity–overrun plane, which is one of the state diagrams.},

In a local medium, described by a constant dielectric permittivity, the sign of the far-field electrostatic potential distribution around an object is governed by its electrical charge. We demonstrate significant departures from this expectation in a nonlocal medium characterized by a wave vector-dependent dielectric function. Here, surface polarization due to the solvent, or indeed non-solvent dipoles, may wield significant influence at large distances. The polarization correlation length may not only significantly augment the effective screening length but we also show that the electrical contribution from polarization can compete with and even invert the sign of the electrical potential and the field arising from charge alone. These results hold ramifications for a range of apparently anomalous electrically governed observations, such as underscreening, electrophoretic mobilities of charge-neutral objects, and long-ranged attraction between like-charged entities in water and other solvents.},

  abstract = {Magnesium silicate (MS) cement, which uses magnesium silicate hydrate (M-S-H) as its primary binding phase, is a promising low-carbon alternative to Portland cement. However, the slow dissolution of MgO limits the release of Mg ions, which is critical for the formation of M-S-H. To address this issue, solubilizers that complex Mg 2+ and promote MgO dissolution have been proposed, provided that they do not significantly hinder M-S-H formation. This study systematically examined the effects of four anionic additives—acetate, citrate, orthophosphate, and carbonate—on M-S-H nucleation and early growth, developing a highly reproducible crystallization scenario. The observed reduction in supersaturation at the nucleation point for specific additive concentrations suggests that Mg-anion complexes may play an active role in M-S-H nucleation, potentially allowing M-S-H to form at lower supersaturation levels, which could be beneficial for MS cement applications. However, as shown here, additives such as citrate, while not inhibiting nucleation, can significantly slow the growth of M-S-H, potentially compromising the strength development of MS cement. Among the additives studied, moderate concentrations of phosphate and carbonate show the most promise, as they have minimal effects on the formation process while potentially reducing the supersaturation for M-S-H nucleation. Although further research is necessary to fully understand the effects of these anions, this study provides valuable insights into their impact on M-S-H nucleation and early growth.},

Two-dimensional nanochannels—in which a single molecular layer of electrolyte is confined between solid walls—constitute a unique platform to investigate fluid and ion transport in extreme confinement, highlighting unconventional transport properties. In this work, we study ionic association in 2D nanochannels, and its consequences on non-linear ionic transport, using both molecular dynamics simulations and analytical theory. We show that under sufficient confinement, ions assemble into pairs or larger clusters in a process analogous to a Kosterlitz–Thouless transition, here modified by the dielectric confinement. We further show that the breaking of pairs results in an electric-field dependent conduction, a mechanism usually known as the second Wien effect. However the 2D nature of the system results in non-universal, temperature-dependent, scaling of the conductivity with electric field, leading to ionic coulomb blockade in some regimes. A 2D generalization of the Onsager theory fully accounts for the non-linear transport. These results suggest ways to exploit electrostatic interactions between ions to build new nanofluidic devices.},

To achieve this, we utilize a numerically exact open quantum system approach—the hierarchical equations of motion in twin space, combined with a flexible tree tensor network state solver. Our findings reveal a stochastic resonance phenomenon in cavity-modified chemical reactivities: an optimal reaction rate enhancement occurs at an intermediate noise level. In other words, this enhancement diminishes if ambient noise, sensed by the cavity–molecule system through cavity leakage, is either too weak or excessively strong. In the collective coupling regime, when the cavity is weakly damped, rate enhancement strengthens as more molecules couple to the cavity. In contrast, under strong cavity damping, reaction rates decline as the number of molecules grows.},

  abstract = {The rapid translocation speed of peptides through graphene nanopores poses a challenge, hindering the accurate sensing of the biomarkers. Employing the functionalized graphene nanopores is at the forefront of reducing the translocation speed. The current work details the translocation of a negatively charged peptide endothelin-1 through a bare multilayer graphene nanopore, a hydrogen-functionalized graphene nanopore, and a hydroxyl-functionalized graphene nanopore by applying electric fields. The hydroxyl-functionalized graphene nanopore significantly reduces the peptide’s translocation speed. The time required for the peptide to translocate through the hydroxyl-functionalized graphene nanopore is 2.25 times longer than in the non-functionalized graphene nanopore and 1.25 times longer than in the hydrogen-functionalized graphene nanopore. We critically analyze the factors influencing the reduced translocation speed, including the interactions between the pore and the peptide, the conformational changes of the peptide within the pore, the solvent velocity inside the pore, and the solvent’s viscosity near the peptide. The altered solvent velocities within functionalized pores have a minimal role in the speed reduction of peptides. When a constant force is applied to the peptide without any electric field, the hydroxyl-functionalized graphene nanopore delivers the lowest diffusion rate. The persistence time, which serves as a measure of the solvent viscosity near the peptide, is the highest within the hydroxyl-functionalized pore. Finally, we conclude that the Coulombic interactions between the peptide and the pore play a major role in its speed reduction inside the hydroxyl-functionalized graphene nanopore.},

  abstract = {Despite water intrusion in microporous materials being extensively investigated, obtaining a detailed overview of the intrusion mechanism in materials with more complex morphology, topology, and physical–chemical characteristics, such as metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), is far from trivial. In this work, we present a qualitative study on the mechanism of water intrusion in a crystallite of hydrophobic Cu 2 (tebpz) (tebpz = 3,3′,5,5′-tetraethyl-4,4′-bipyrazolate) MOF. This MOF is characterized by a complex morphology; it consists of primary (main channels) and secondary (lateral apertures) porosities. This is similar to some zeolites, such as the so-called ITT-type zeolite framework, but it presents the additional characteristics of high flexibility of the material and non-uniform hydrophobicity. Interestingly, in Cu 2 (tebpz), water intrusion occurs first for some of the channels lying tangent to the surface of the MOF’s crystallite. This is due to hydrogen bonding bridging with bulk water across the (thin) lateral apertures of these channels. In macroscopic terms, this can be understood as a local reduction of hydrophobicity favoring intrusion. Temperature and pressure influence the average number of hydrogen bonds and the number of intruded water molecules, explaining the effect of these thermodynamic parameters on the intrusion/extrusion characteristics of this porous material. Molecular dynamics simulations allowed us to glimpse liquid intrusion in this complex hydrophobic material, highlighting how the classical models valid for mesoporous systems, namely, Young–Laplace’s law, are not quite appropriate to describe intrusion in such materials.},

  abstract = {We calculate pairing free energies for a series of model monovalent ion pairs with equal sizes spanning a large radius range in the aqueous solution. Thermodynamic analysis reveals that the ion pairing strength displays an initial decrease in a nearly linear fashion followed by a significant enhancement at a relatively slower rate as the ion size gradually increases, resulting in the weakest pairing preference for ions with intermediate size. The free energy decomposition illustrates that the ion pairing is jointly governed by a delicate balance of the favorable ion–ion interaction term and the repulsive solvent-induced contribution, with their compensation leading to a small pairing free energy. The dependence of this substantial compensation on the ion size actually dominates the ion pairing strength and the magnitude of the free energy, which accounts for the occurrence of the less association between the intermediate-size ions. Estimation of van der Waals and electrostatic free energies highlights the importance of attractive dispersion forces in determining the shape of the potential of mean force, specifically for large ions with less favorable interaction with water molecules than the water–water interactions. In addition, the effect of varying the cation size on the decreased pairing preference surpasses that of altering the anion size. Our study significantly enhances our understanding of the empirical rule of matching ion size for predicting ion pairing preferences in aqueous solutions.},

  abstract = {The primary photodissociation events of acetylacetone and its fluorinated analogs reveal that the translational energy distribution profiles of the CH 3 and CF 3 radicals follow a barrier-impulsive model for the C–C bond cleavage. Analysis based on the one-dimensional potential energy surfaces in the T 1 state, as well as dynamics simulations using on-the-fly semi-empirical potentials, suggest that the C–C bond cleavage proximal to the OH group, in general, is accompanied by proton migration. Interestingly, the near identical fragment translational energy distribution profiles of CH 3 radical release from acetylacetone and trifluoroacetylacetone, as well as CF 3 radical release from trifluoroacetylacetone and hexafluoroacetylacetone, suggest that the dynamics of formation of CH 3 /CF 3 radicals in acetylacetones appears to be independent of the nature of the substituent on the other end of the molecule. In the case of acetylacetones, the C–C bond cleavage is governed by the local intramolecular vibrational redistribution along the complex reaction coordinate, which appears to be statistical for CF 3 release and non-statistical for CH 3 release; however, it remains non-statistical over the entire molecular framework.},

  abstract = {Low-kinetic energy photoelectron detachment experiments have revealed the unexpected dependence of transition intensities on photon energy, which is hypothesized to result from time-dependent coupling between low-kinetic energy photoelectrons and the remnant molecule. This study explores how the kinetic energy and detachment axis of the photoelectron influence the interaction and modify the final remnant electronic structure. Using real-time simulations on several model systems (H 2 , NO, N 2 , and C2 hydrocarbons), this study demonstrates that electron–remnant interactions are strongly dependent on the detachment orientation, electron kinetic energy, and remnant electronic structure. The results reveal that higher kinetic energies lead to significant nonadiabatic transitions, while lower kinetic energies yield more adiabatic behavior. While generally lower kinetic energies show prolonged electron–remnant interactions, the extent of temporal and spatial interactions does not necessarily vary linearly with the kinetic energy, and the final remnant electronic structure is found to be very sensitive to the exact nature of the photoelectron–remnant interactions. In addition, the point charge model employed for the photoelectron provides a useful approach for the deconvolution of more complete simulations to provide deeper insights into the specific photoelectron–remnant interactions that determine the eventual remnant wavefunction. The findings underscore the importance of considering both temporal and spatial electron dynamics in understanding low-kinetic energy photodetachment processes and provide a foundation for a further exploration of electron–molecule interactions in the low-energy regime.},

Vibrational coherence in the S 1 state of 2,4-difluoroanisole has been investigated in real time by femtosecond time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy and time-of-flight mass spectroscopy. Quantum beats of superpositions exhibit temporal oscillations with a frequency of 78 cm −1 . Combining the structure computations, oscillations derive from the structure change from planar to nonplanar geometry, which correspond the coherence wavepackets moving from the Franck–Condon region toward the minimum point of the potential energy surface, elucidating the energy flows following the excitation of 2,4-difluoroanisole in the S 1 state. The phases of the quantum beat via the resonant Rydberg states exhibit a shift of π rad.

The mixtures of multiple solvents are often used in electrolytes to achieve the desired properties, such as viscosity, dielectric constant, boiling point, and melting point. Conventionally, multi-component electrolyte properties are approximated with linear mixing, but in practice, significant deviations are observed. Excess quantities can provide insights into the molecular behavior of the mixture and could form the basis for designing high-performance electrolytes. Here, we investigate the excess density of commonly used Li-ion battery solvents, such as cyclic carbonates, linear carbonates, ethers, and nitriles with molecular dynamics simulations. We additionally investigate electrolytes consisting of these solvents and a salt. The results smoothly vary with mole percent and are fit to permutation-invariant Redlich–Kister polynomials. The mixtures of similar solvents, such as cyclic–cyclic carbonate mixtures, tend to have excess properties that are lower in magnitude compared to the mixtures of dissimilar substances, such as carbonate–nitrile mixtures. We perform experimental testing using our automated test stand, Clio, to provide validation to the observed simulation trends. We quantify the structure similarity using smooth overlap of atomic position fingerprints to create a descriptor for excess density, enabling the design of electrolyte properties. To a first approximation, this will allow us to estimate the deviation of a mixture from ideal behavior based solely upon the structural dissimilarity of the components.},

  abstract = {Resonant vibrational–electronic (vibronic) couplings in donor–acceptor systems may play a crucial role in driving non-adiabatic internal conversion reported in natural photosynthesis, organic photovoltaic polymers, and singlet exciton fission. Quantum beats arising from impulsive excitation are often employed as spectroscopic reporters of the specific vibrational modes driving this process. However, distinguishing these promoter modes from spectator modes, which do not participate in vibronic mixing and simply accompany ultrafast internal conversion, remains a challenge. This is so because vibrational quantum beats arising from uncoupled monomers can modulate pump–probe transients by themselves. In this paper, we show that vibronic mixing induces quantum beats whose amplitude is anisotropic with respect to the polarization of the light. We propose a readily implementable polarization-controlled two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy experiment to uniquely identify signatures of excited state vibronic resonance using ground state quantum beats by discriminating against vibrational motions (and corresponding quantum beats) that are simply spectators. Through analytical expressions and simulation of two-dimensional electronic spectra, we show that the resulting 2D spectra are expected to exhibit distinct spectral lineshapes with a strong temperature dependence that arises solely due to the excited state vibronic mixing. Our findings suggest an interesting experiment to decipher the presence of excited state vibronic resonances.},

The KZG approach relies solely on the density to find the XC potential by combining a systematically convergent finite-element basis with appropriate asymptotic correction on the target density. The RKS method, being designed for a finite basis, offers computational efficiency. The KZG method, using a complete basis, provides higher accuracy. In this work, we combine both methods to simultaneously afford accuracy and efficiency. In particular, we use the RKS solution as an initial guess for the KZG method to attain a significant 3–11× speedup. This work also presents a direct comparison of the XC potentials from the RKS and the KZG method and their relative accuracy on various weakly and strongly correlated molecules, using their ground state solutions from accurate configuration interaction calculations solved in a Slater orbital basis.},

Leveraging recent advances in the spectral analysis of the current time series associated with molecular trajectories, we introduce a new method to estimate the full (diagonal as well as off-diagonal) Onsager matrix of transport coefficients from a single statistical model. This approach, based on the knowledge of the statistical distribution of the Onsager-matrix samples in the frequency domain, unifies the evaluation of diagonal (conductivities and viscosities) and off-diagonal (e.g., thermoelectric) transport coefficients within a comprehensive framework, significantly improving the reliability of transport coefficient estimation for materials ranging from molten salts to solid-state electrolytes. We validate the accuracy of this method against existing approaches using benchmark data on molten cesium fluoride and liquid water and conclude our presentation with the computation of various transport coefficients of the Li 3 PS 4 solid-state electrolyte.},

  abstract = {Path-integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations are crucial for accurately capturing nuclear quantum effects in materials. However, their computational intensity often makes it challenging to address potential finite-size effects. Here, we present a specialized graphics processing units (GPUs) implementation of PIMD methods, including ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) and thermostatted ring-polymer molecular dynamics (TRPMD), into the open-source Graphics Processing Units Molecular Dynamics (GPUMD) package, combined with highly accurate and efficient machine-learned neuroevolution potential (NEP) models. This approach achieves almost the accuracy of first-principles calculations with the computational efficiency of empirical potentials, enabling large-scale atomistic simulations that incorporate nuclear quantum effects, effectively overcoming finite-size limitations at a relatively affordable computational cost. We validate and demonstrate the efficacy of the combined NEP-PIMD approach by examining various thermal properties of diverse materials, including lithium hydride (LiH), three porous metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), liquid water, and elemental aluminum. For LiH, our NEP-PIMD simulations successfully capture the isotope effect, reproducing the experimentally observed dependence of the lattice parameter on the reduced mass. For MOFs, our results reveal that achieving good agreement with experimental data requires consideration of both nuclear quantum effects and dispersive interactions. For water, our PIMD simulations capture the significant impact of nuclear quantum effects on its microscopic structure. For aluminum, the TRPMD method effectively captures thermal expansion and phonon properties, aligning well with quantum mechanical predictions. This efficient GPU-accelerated NEP-PIMD implementation in the GPUMD package provides an alternative, accessible, accurate, and scalable tool for exploring complex material properties influenced by nuclear quantum effects, with potential applications across a broad range of materials.},

While highly intuitive, the physical details of such orbital entanglement effects on the excitation energies of chromophores have yet to be fully explored. Here, using two well-known biochromophores (oxyluciferin and p -hydroxybenzyledene imidazolinone) as examples, we show that the chromophore–solvent orbital entanglements can be elucidated using two quantum mechanical embedding schemes: density matrix embedding theory and absolutely localized molecular orbitals.

  abstract = {In this work, we examine how the structure of system–bath interactions can determine commonly encountered temporal decoherence patterns, such as Gaussian and exponential decay, in molecular and other qubits coupled to a thermal bosonic bath. The analysis, based on a pure dephasing picture that admits analytical treatment, shows that decoherence, in general, is neither purely Gaussian nor exponential but rather the exponential of oscillatory functions, with periods determined by the bath’s frequencies. For initially unentangled qubit-bath states, Gaussian decay is always present at early times. It becomes increasingly dominant with increasing temperature, qubit–bath interaction strength, and bath correlation time. Initial system–bath entanglement that arises due to displacement in the position of the bath states preserves the Gaussian decay. By contrast, strict exponential decay arises only in very specific models that we isolate. However, it becomes dominant for times longer than the bath correlation time or for early times when there is initial entanglement due to momentum displacement of the bath states. For molecular electronic decoherence, the long-time exponential regime plays a limited role as it emerges after most coherence is lost. Thus, the Gaussian decay provides a more suitable (albeit imperfect) model of such decoherence. Furthermore, we discuss the connection between electronic decoherence dynamics and electronic spectroscopic line shape theory, where Gaussian spectral peaks correspond to Gaussian coherence decay and Lorentzian peaks correspond to exponential coherence decay. We find that Gaussian spectral peaks, usually associated with inhomogeneous broadening, can emerge from the entangling unitary system–bath dynamics even when there is no inhomogeneity in the initial conditions.},

  abstract = {The estimation of electronic couplings between diabatic states is crucial for the comprehension of electron transfer phenomena between molecular systems. Therefore, the development of efficient approximations that enable a very fast, yet accurate, estimation of electronic couplings is an important research goal in the context of organic semiconductors. The most popular methods (diabatization schemes, projection approximations, or methods using fragment molecular orbitals) usually involve the use of electronic structure calculations and can be computationally prohibitive if a large number of electronic coupling estimations is required. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy (CubeMap) to evaluate electronic couplings between molecular pairs in an extremely efficient manner. CubeMap employs the well-established linear relationship between the electronic coupling and the overlap integral between the corresponding molecular orbitals localized on the interacting molecules. In particular, CubeMap is based on the efficient calculation of the overlap integral in real space using molecular orbital grids of moderate size. The CubeMap efficiency partly comes from the fact that only a single electronic structure calculation of an individual molecule (reference geometry) is enough for the subsequent evaluation of overlap integrals and electronic couplings in multiple dimer dispositions. We show that CubeMap is particularly appealing to rapidly estimate the electronic coupling distributions in molecular crystals due to thermal fluctuations (dynamic disorder), which is an important effect for the accurate description of charge transport in organic semiconductors. Compared with the methods usually employed to evaluate electronic couplings, the CubeMap approach drastically reduces the computational cost by several orders of magnitude.},

  abstract = {The accuracy of quasiparticle corrections in a single-shot G 0 W 0 calculation relies heavily on the preceding eigensystem of density functional theory (DFT). An incorrect energy spectrum obtained from the DFT calculation can result in an inaccurate quasiparticle G 0 W 0 bandgap. This study explicitly investigates the bandgaps of chalcopyrite semiconductors within G 0 W 0 , considering various DFT approximations, including semilocal, hybrid, and nonempirical screened dielectric-dependent hybrid (DDH) as the starting point for G 0 W 0 calculation. The superiority of G 0 W 0 on top of screened DDH is evident in achieving highly accurate bandgaps for chalcopyrite semiconductors. In addition, when the Bethe–Salpeter equation is solved, the optical absorption spectra derived from these calculations are remarkably precise. This study demonstrates that nonempirical G 0 W 0 @DDH serves as a cost-effective and precise tool for various applications related to chalcopyrite semiconductors, particularly in cases where a self-consistent GW ( scGW ) calculation is challenging.},

Several EP methods consistently attain higher accuracy than alternatives with equal arithmetic bottlenecks expressed in terms of occupied (O) and virtual (V) orbital dimensions. The cubically scaling methods realize a mean absolute error (MAE) below 0.2 eV and are feasible whenever conventional self-consistent-field calculations are performed. O 2 V 3 -scaling EP self-energies achieve an MAE slightly above 0.1 eV and are as feasible as conventional second-order perturbative calculations of total energies. OV 4 methods are more accurate (MAEs ∼0.075 eV) than ΔCCSD(T) and are more efficient than third-order total-energy calculations. An equally accurate generalization with full self-energy matrices and non-iterative O 2 V 4 contractions produces Dyson orbitals in their most general form. Composite EP models that accurately estimate the effects of basis-set saturation drastically improve efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. No adjustable parameters are employed in the self-energy formulas or in the generation of reference-state orbitals. When Dyson-orbital probability factors indicate that Koopmans’s theorem is qualitatively valid, simple perturbative corrections suffice to approach chemical accuracy.},

  abstract = {Molecular polaritons arise when the collective coupling between an ensemble of N molecules and an optical mode exceeds individual photon and molecular linewidths. The complexity of their description stems from their multiscale nature, where the local dynamics of each molecule can, in principle, be influenced by the collective behavior of the entire ensemble. To address this, we previously introduced a formalism called collective dynamics using truncated equations (CUT-E). CUT-E approaches the problem in two stages. First, it exploits permutational symmetries to obtain a substantial simplification of the problem. However, this is often insufficient for parameter regimes relevant to most experiments. Second, it takes the exact solution of the problem in the N → ∞ limit as a reference and derives systematic finite- N corrections. Here, we provide a novel derivation of CUT-E based on recently developed bosonization techniques. We lay down its connections with 1/ N expansions that are ubiquitous in other fields of physics and present previously unexplored key aspects of this formalism, including various types of approximations and extensions to high-excitation manifolds.},

Our starting point is a precise operational definition of the onset of glassiness, as expressed by the emergence of inflections in time-dependent correlation functions. By scanning the temperature–composition phase diagram of the mixture, we find a disconnect between the onset of glassiness and freezing. Surprisingly, however, the onset temperature closely tracks the melting line, along which the excess entropy is approximately constant. At fixed composition, all characteristic temperatures display nonetheless similar pressure dependencies, which are very well predicted by the isomorph theory. While our results rule out a general connection between thermodynamic metastability and glassiness, they call for a reassessment of the role of crystalline precursors in glass-forming liquids.},

  abstract = {In recent years, computational approaches which couple density functional theory (DFT)-based description of the electron–phonon and phonon–phonon scattering rates with the Boltzmann transport equation have been shown to obtain the electron and thermal transport characteristics of many 3D and 2D semiconductors in excellent agreement with experimental measurements. At the same time, progress in the DFT-based description of the electron–phonon scattering has also allowed to describe the non-equilibrium relaxation dynamics of hot or photo-excited electrons in several materials, in very good agreement with time-resolved spectroscopy experiments. In the latter case, as the time-resolved spectroscopy techniques provide the possibility to monitor transient material characteristics evolving on the femtosecond and attosecond time scales, the time evolution of photo-excited, nonthermal carrier distributions has to be described. Similarly, reliable theoretical approaches are needed to describe the transient transport properties of devices involving high energy carriers. In this review, we aim to discuss recent progress in coupling the ab initio description of materials, especially that of the electron–phonon scattering, with the time-dependent approaches describing the time evolution of the out-of-equilibrium carrier distributions, in the context of time-resolved spectroscopy experiments as well as in the context of transport simulations. We point out the computational limitations common to all numerical approaches, which describe time propagation of strongly out-of-equilibrium carrier distributions in 3D materials, and discuss the methods used to overcome them.},

  abstract = {Templated copolymerization, in which information stored in the sequence of a heteropolymer template is copied into another polymer product, is the mechanism behind all known methods of genetic information transfer. A key aspect of templated copolymerization is the eventual detachment of the product from the template. A second key feature of natural biochemical systems is that the template-binding free energies of both correctly matched and incorrect monomers are heterogeneous. Previous work has considered the thermodynamic consequences of detachment and the consequences of heterogeneity for polymerization speed and accuracy, but the interplay of both separation and heterogeneity remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate a minimal model of templated copying that simultaneously incorporates both detachment from behind the leading edge of the growing copy and heterogeneous interactions. We first extend existing coarse-graining methods for models of polymerization to allow for heterogeneous interactions. We then show that heterogeneous copying systems with explicit detachment do not exhibit the subdiffusive behavior observed in the absence of detachment when near equilibrium. Next, we show that heterogeneity in correct monomer interactions tends to result in slower, less accurate copying, while heterogeneity in incorrect monomer interactions tends to result in faster, more accurate copying, due to an increased roughness in the free energy landscape of either correct or incorrect monomer pairs. Finally, we show that heterogeneity can improve on known thermodynamic efficiencies of homogeneous copying, but these increased thermodynamic efficiencies do not always translate to increased efficiencies of information transfer.},

This work proposes an analytical model for committor analysis of the multi-state conformational dynamics of a DNA hairpin in a complex cellular environment, within the framework of the generalized Langevin equation using a general asymmetric bistable potential with a power-law frictional memory kernel. We obtained exact analytical expressions for the probability density function, first passage time distribution, and the committor. The results are compared with those obtained from steered molecular dynamics simulation of a three-state DNA hairpin, and earlier experimental data. We investigated the dependence of the committor and the corresponding committor-inverted profiles on the linker stiffness, barrier height, and degree of asymmetry in the bistable potential. This model successfully captures the fold–unfold dynamics, reproducing the multi-state free energy profile with asymmetric energy barriers.},

Using the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) method, we simulate the linear absorption and two-dimensional electronic spectra (2DES) for a dimer model based on bottleneck sites in the light-harvesting complex of photosystem II. A site-dependent spectral density is incorporated, with only the low-energy site being coupled to the resonance mode. Similar patterns are observed in linear absorption spectra and early time 2DES for various damping times, owing to the weak coupling strength. However, notable differences emerge in the dynamics of the high-energy diagonal and cross-peaks in the 2DES. It is found that the coupling of electronic-vibrational resonance modes accelerates the energy transfer process, with rates being increased as the damping time is extended, but the impact becomes negligible when the damping time exceeds a certain threshold. To evaluate the reliability of the perturbation method, the modified Redfield (MR) method is employed to simulate 2DES under the same conditions. The results from the MR method are aligned with those obtained from the HEOM method, but the MR method predicts faster dynamics.},

The emergence of orientationally ordered, collectively moving states in such systems has been demonstrated. We here analyze the excitability of such collectively moving elastic states. To this end, we determine corresponding fluctuation spectra. They indicate that collectively excitable modes exist in the migrating solid. Differences arise when compared to those of corresponding passive solids. We provide evidence that the modes of excitation associated with the intrinsic fluctuations are related to corresponding modes of entropy production.

Sampling near the phase transition temperature in systems undergoing first-order phase transitions, such as the NI phase transition, is demanding due to the substantial energy gap between the two phases. To address this, gREM, specifically designed for first-order phase transitions, was utilized to enhance sampling near the NI phase transition temperature. Free-energy calculations based on the energy representation (ER) theory were employed to characterize the NI phase transition. ER evaluates the insertion free energy of the n CB molecule for both nematic and isotropic phases, revealing a change in the temperature dependence across the NI phase transition. Further decomposition into energetic and entropic terms quantitatively shows the balance between these contributions at the NI phase transition temperature.},

  abstract = {The walking of a nanorobot with DNA legs requires a preset track to serve as footholds for the DNA legs and a track-matched driving mechanism to propel the nanorobot. Recently, a newly suggested track formed by multiple nanopores has garnered attraction due to its chemical stability. The nanorobot can be powered by biased leg-nanopore interactions along the walking direction. Here, we propose utilizing a salt concentration gradient along the nanopore track to induce an interaction bias based on different local ion screening effects on the nanopore charges. The nanorobot walking behaviors under different salt concentration gradients are studied through a combination of computational simulations and theoretical analyses. We find that the walking properties (such as velocity and directionality) highly depend on the local interactions experienced by the lagging leg. Under strong leg-nanopore attraction, the lagging leg needs a drag force provided by the leading leg to leave from the nanopore, while under weak attraction, the lagging leg can leave the nanopore without the assistance of the leading leg. Therefore, different walking modes can be observed under various ion conditions, leading to the complicated walking dynamics of the nanorobot driven by the salt concentration gradients.},

  abstract = {Complex coacervation is the phase separation of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes, resulting in a polymer-dense coacervate phase and a polymer-depleted supernatant phase. Coacervation is crucial for many biological processes and novel synthetic materials, where the environment is often filled with other neutral molecules (crowders). Yet, the complex role of crowders in complex coacervation has not been studied systematically under controlled conditions. We performed coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of coacervation in the presence of polymeric crowders of varying concentrations and chain lengths. While short crowders do not have any significant effect on coacervation, larger crowders stabilize the coacervate against added salt, increasing its critical salt concentration. The change in critical salt concentration saturates for long crowders at a value determined by the crowder concentration. Rescaling all phase diagrams by their critical salt concentration leads to a collapse of the data, which demonstrates a universal phase behavior. Our simulation indicates that the inability of crowder chains to mix with the polyelectrolytes is the driving force behind crowding effects. These testable predictions provide a first step toward a comprehensive understanding of crowding effects in complex coacervation.},

  abstract = {Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations are employed to explore the conformational behavior of globally neutral polyampholytes under good solvent conditions. The interplay between non-Coulomb repulsions and sequence-dependent Coulomb attractions of monomers results in qualitatively different types of electrostatically driven chain contraction for diblock, random, and alternating statistics. At increasing the solution Bjerrum length l b , diblock and random polyampholytes exhibit a smooth coil-globule crossover, with the globule size continuously decreasing with l b according to the theoretical power laws. This confirms the scaling picture of the globule interior consisting of oppositely charged blobs attracting each other via long-range electrostatic forces and repelling via short-range two-body interactions. In contrast, alternating polyampholytes collapse completely analogously to neutral chains because Coulomb interactions in them are effectively dipole–dipole short-range. The transition region shrinks with increasing chain length, implying phase transition behavior in the limit of infinitely long chains. These collapse curves fall on the universal master curve, which is well-fitted by the theory of coil-globule transitions and demonstrates that Coulomb interactions in alternating polyampholytes renormalize (reduce) the dimensionless second virial coefficient by δ B ∝ − l b 2 ⁠ . This study highlights the profound impact of primary sequence on the conformational behavior of charge-balanced polyampholytes in good solvents, particularly the nature of the electrostatically driven coil-globule transition they undergo.},

  abstract = {Charge conductivity in conducting polymers is typically improved by increasing carrier density via chemical oxidation. However, the resulting electrostatic stabilization of the carriers by the dopant ions, combined with their nanostructural environment, are both known to crucially affect charge trapping. Although the effects of charge–ion electrostatic interactions on carrier trapping have been well-characterized using conventional infrared (IR) spectroscopy, the impacts of the polymer chain ordering and energetic environment are difficult to disentangle. In this study, we examine the limitations of conventional IR absorption spectroscopy and introduce a complementary spectroscopic approach capable of discerning polaron trapping more generally. To do so, we investigated films of poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) chemically doped using four different oxidants, of which each preferentially dopes the amorphous and crystalline (lamellar) phases to varying extents. Using this model system, we observed counterintuitive shifts in the polaron IR absorption band, indicating that IR spectroscopy is a clear reporter of trapping only when the carriers exclusively reside in the lamellar phase and in the absence of bipolarons or coupled polarons. Alternatively, we found that polaron excited state dynamics, probed using ultrafast near-infrared transient absorption spectroscopy, more clearly report on charge trapping. This study demonstrates near-infrared transient absorption spectroscopy as a complementary tool for probing charge trapping in conducting polymers when doping induces carriers in different nanostructural environments.},

This study explores amorphous InSnZnO thin films deposited via plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) and the development of high-performance PEALD ITZO thin-film transistors (TFTs) with different active layer thicknesses, fabricated under a low thermal budget of 200 °C. By optimizing the deposition process of binary oxides InO x , SnO x , and ZnO x , a shared temperature window of 170–180 °C was identified for ITZO thin-film deposition. The deposited ITZO films, irrespective of thickness, exhibit an amorphous phase. Moreover, a reduction in ITZO film thickness from 24 to 4.8 nm leads to an increase in the optical bandgap from 3.35 to 3.65 eV. The channel thickness significantly impacts the threshold voltage and carrier density of ITZO TFTs. Optimized ITZO TFTs with a 16 nm channel thickness demonstrate excellent electrical performance, including a threshold voltage of −0.58 V, a field-effect mobility of 29 cm 2 /V s, an on/off ratio exceeding 10 8 , and a subthreshold swing of 74 mV/dec. Furthermore, the optimized ITZO TFT exhibits excellent stability under positive bias stress at 2 MV/cm, with a threshold voltage shift of 0.15 V after 3600 s. Consequently, ALD-based ITZO emerges as a promising channel material for future applications in transparent electronics and flat-panel displays.},

When deposited on the Bi(111) substrate held at 150 K, picene molecules form a bulk-like (21 1 ̄ monolayer with building blocks of picene trimers. High-resolution STM images reveal that each trimer consists of two tilted molecules and one side-on molecule. Further reducing the deposition temperature to 90 K leads to the formation of nanostripe arrays, in which the side-on molecules adopt the π–π stacking. STS measurements demonstrate that the crystalline (001) monolayer of picene exhibits a larger gap compared with picene crystals, which can be attributed to the decoupling of the upright standing molecules from the semimetallic Bi(111) substrate.},

Up to now, molecular calculations have been performed with real-valued orbitals. However, before extending the applicability of these methodologies to extended systems, where Bloch states are employed, the subtleties of working with complex-valued orbitals and the consequences of imposing time-reversal symmetry must be carefully addressed. In this work, we describe the theoretical and practical implications of adopting time-reversal symmetry in RDMFT and pCCD when allowing for complex-valued orbital coefficients. The theoretical considerations primarily affect the optimization algorithms, while the practical implications raise fundamental questions about the stability of solutions. In particular, we find that complex solutions lower the energy when non-dynamic electronic correlation effects are pronounced. We present numerical examples to illustrate and discuss these instabilities and possible problems introduced by N -representability violations.},

  abstract = {Singlet fission (SF) in molecular semiconductors is a photophysical process of spontaneous splitting of the excited singlet state into a pair of triplet excitons (TT-pair). This process is usually strongly influenced by spin-selective back geminate TT-annihilation (TTA). Spin selectivity manifests itself in magnetic field effects (MFEs) on both TTA and SF kinetics, the study of which allows us to reveal some specific features of this kinetics. In our work, we analyze the mechanism of MFE generation in TTA and SF processes in amorphous molecular semiconductors. In this mechanism, the MFEs are assumed to be determined by magnetic field dependent spin–lattice relaxation (SLR) in TT-pairs, generated by the zero-field splitting interaction (in T-excitons), fluctuating due to T-exciton hopping over arbitrarily oriented molecules in amorphous semiconductors. The SLR-transitions are described with a semiempirical model, which makes it possible to obtain the SF-kinetic functions in analytical form. The mechanism of SLR-assisted MFEs is found to be very efficient in TTA and SF processes. The obtained results are analyzed in detail and applied to interpret experimentally observed SF-kinetic dependences in various magnetic fields. In particular, it is shown that the proposed model of SLR-generated MFEs enables one to describe the effect of crossing of SF-kinetic functions, corresponding to different magnetic fields.},

Together with elucidating the temperature-dependent mechanisms of crystallization, face-specific growth rates were systematically estimated. While the prism surface generally exhibits faster growth rates than the basal surface, a temperature-dependent crossover in growth rates between the basal and prism surfaces is observed in TIP4P/Ice simulations, which correlates with crossovers in QLL thickness and properties and with the well-known column to platelets transition in ice-crystal habits at low vapor pressure.

In the presence of 1 mM and 1M bulk aqueous phase ionic strength salt concentrations, fundamental qualitative relationships are observed for the salting out of DBP relative to bulk aqueous phase nitrate salt concentrations and the specific cations species. At 1 mM ionic strength, the interfacial charge and hence the interfacial potential modulates the electrostatic interactions; in particular, the counter cations partially screen the negatively charged interface induced by the DBP in a direct Hofmeister order. At 1M ionic strength, the electric field at the interface or interfacial potential is effectively neutralized, and the counter cations promote the partitioning of DBP to the interface depending on their specific interaction with the DBP head group and metal ion hydration properties.

  abstract = {Raman spectroscopy is an important tool for studying molecules, liquids and solids. While Raman spectra can be obtained theoretically from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, this requires the calculation of electronic polarizability along the simulation trajectory. First-principles calculations of electronic polarizability are computationally expensive, motivating the development of atomistic models for the evaluation of the changes in the electronic polarizability with the changes in the atomic coordinates of the system. The bond polarizability model (BPM) is one of the oldest and simplest such atomistic models but cannot reproduce the effects of angular vibrations, leading to inaccurate modeling of Raman spectra. Here, we demonstrate that the generalization of BPM through the inclusion of terms for atom pairs that are traditionally considered to be not involved in bonding dramatically improves the accuracy of polarizability modeling and Raman spectra calculations. The generalized BPM (GBPM) reproduces the ab initio polarizability and Raman spectra for a range of tested molecules (SO 2 , H 2 S, H 2 O, NH 3 , CH 4 , CH 3 OH, and CH 3 CH 2 OH) with high accuracy and also shows significantly improved agreement with ab initio results for the more complex ferroelectric BaTiO 3 systems. For liquid water, the anisotropic Raman spectrum derived from atomistic MD simulations using the GBPM evaluation of polarizability shows significantly improved agreement with the experimental spectrum compared to the spectrum derived using the BPM. Thus, the GBPM can be used for the modeling of Raman spectra using large-scale molecular dynamics and provides a good basis for the further development of atomistic polarizability models.},

  abstract = {Understanding charge photogeneration processes in polymer solar cells utilizing polymerized Y-molecule acceptors (PYMAs) is of great importance for design and optimization of high-performance solar cells. In this work, excited state dynamics in PYMAs (PYT, PY-DT) and corresponding solar cells were comparably studied with those of Y small molecules (Y5, Y6) by using the steady state and time-resolved spectroscopies as well as time-dependent density functional theory calculation. We find that PYMA (PYT, PY-DT) films exhibit smaller Stokes shifts than that of Y small molecules, indicating a more rigid backbone of PYMAs. Temperature-dependent steady-state PL measurement reveals that compared to small molecule films, the energy barrier from radiative to non-radiative states is smaller in PYMA films. In addition, transient absorption spectroscopy demonstrates that the exciton diffusion process in PYT and PY-DT are mainly intra-chain exciton diffusion mechanism with exciton diffusion coefficients of 1.7 × 10 −2 and 2.7 × 10 −2 cm 2 s −1 , respectively, in contrast with the inter-molecular exciton diffusion in Y5 and Y6 films. For the blend films, the phase sizes of acceptors in PM6:PYT and PM6:PY-DT are determined as 2.3 and 3.3 nm, respectively, smaller than that of Y6 (4.7 nm) in the PM6:Y6 film. In addition, unlike bimolecular recombination in classical system PM6:Y6, the PYMA-based all-polymer solar cells exhibit geminate type recombination in ultrafast timescale. We find that carrier lifetime plays a critical role in the performance of PYMA-based polymer solar cells. This work provides a comprehensive understanding of the photophysical properties of PYMAs, which is pivotal for designing highly efficient all-polymer solar cells.},

  abstract = {Large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations enabled by computationally efficient semiempirical potentials are an invaluable tool for materials modeling. In the case of metallic alloys, embedded atom method (EAM) and Finnis–Sinclair (FS) potentials are a reasonable choice based on their good balance of quality and computational cost. However, these semiempirical potentials are not suitable for simulating ionic systems, which prevents their use in studying many technologically relevant metal–oxide systems. The charge transfer ionic potential (CTIP), which can utilize EAM/FS potentials available in the literature together with a variable charge representation of electrostatic interactions, should be a reasonable choice for performing reliable and computationally efficient MD simulations of such systems. However, only a few such potentials are available in the literature, and their computational cost is much higher compared to EAM/FS potentials. In the present work, we have attempted to remedy these deficiencies by combining several modifications to the CTIP model proposed in the literature and efficiently implementing them into the widely used Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator MD code. Using these modifications, we have developed a new Ni–O CTIP parameterization, which has been tested in several different scenarios of interest. First, the early stages of Ni surface oxidation were simulated, demonstrating the nucleation and growth of a crystalline NiO film across the surface. Second, solidification and vitrification in the Ni–O system were investigated, demonstrating that the new CTIP parameterization provides reasonable agreement with the experimentally determined equilibrium phase diagram. Finally, we studied the interaction of dislocations in a Ni matrix with a NiO inclusion using a simulation cell with an unprecedented number of atoms for a variable charge MD simulation. Thus, the approach utilized in the present study is an efficient method to simulate large scale atomic mechanisms in metal–oxide systems.},

  abstract = {CoTe 2 and CoSe 2 alloys have garnered considerable attention in thermoelectric applications due to their high electrical conductivity, tunable electronic properties, and potential for high power factors. In this study, the phase formation behavior and thermoelectric transport properties of a CoTe 2 –CoSe 2 solid solution alloy were investigated by synthesizing a series of Co(Te 1− x Se x ) 2 compositions, where x = 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.0. For x = 0, 0.25, and 0.50, the orthorhombic phase of CoTe 2 was observed, while for x = 0.75, the orthorhombic phase of CoTe 2 and cubic phase of CoSe 2 coexisted. Up to x = 0.50, the power factor decreased slightly as the Hall mobility and the density-of-state effective mass decreased. The total thermal conductivity decreased as x increased to 0.50, owing to a decrease in the electronic and lattice thermal conductivity. Despite the decrease in total thermal conductivity, no significant increase in zT values was observed in the range of x = 0.25–0.50 due to a more pronounced decrease in the power factor. Nevertheless, cubic phase CoSe 2 exhibited higher power factors and thus higher zT of 0.13 at 700 K. Further analysis based on single Kane band model suggests that significant enhancement in the power factor and zT could be achieved by reducing the carrier concentration from ∼10 21 to ∼10 19 cm −3 for all compositions.},

In this work, we report the detection of a much higher (about four times) spin asymmetry in SrTiO 3 (011) by spin resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, with samples characterized also by core level x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and low energy electron diffraction. The explanation of a so important spin asymmetry is related to the partial neutralization of O 2 (4−) or SrTiO(4+) end layers. Missing electrons from O 2p states in the case of O 2 terminations enable robust atomic spins, according to Hund’s rule. The parallel analysis of core level shifts for surface atoms and the amplitude of spin asymmetry suggests that 50% of the oxygens from the surface SrO layer of SrTiO 3 (001) have a 2p 5 configuration with an unpaired electron (the rest are in a 2p 6 configuration), while in the case of O 2 terminated SrTiO 3 (011), about 50% of surface oxygens have a 2p 5 configuration and 50% of surface oxygens are neutral (2p 4 ), yielding a net charge per O 2 surface unit cell of (−1) instead of (−4).

In this study, a series of ZnS/SnS 2 heterojunction photocatalysts were prepared by a morphology-controlled strategy, and the regulation of ZnS/SnS 2 heterostructure was realized for the photodegradation of methyl violet (MV) under visible light. The results show that as-prepared ZnS/SnS 2 consists of hybrid morphological microparticles and exhibits a nanoparticle/nanosheet interspersed structure. The multi-touch interface of the constructed heterostructures can significantly shorten the carrier transport path and greatly promote the charge separation and transfer under the action of the local electric field at the semiconductor/semiconductor interface. Exposed dual-crystal planes of SnS 2 coupled with ZnS enrich the active sites and enhance the performance of pure SnS 2 and ZnS material. The degradation rate of MV over the optimal heterojunction material (ZnS/SnS 2 -50) exceeds 91.4% within 90 min under visible light irradiation, which is about 62 times that of MV compared with pristine ZnS.},

  abstract = {The complex interaction between the intrinsic and extrinsic state variables of strongly correlated insulator thin films is drawing interest as it shows memristive behavior that may be applicable to neuromorphic computing. Cerium oxide is an interesting material as its band structure is modified due to the formation of oxygen vacancy defects. The polaron formation that results from the reduction of the Ce 4+ state to the Ce 3+ state through oxygen vacancies is crucial for the electron transport in cerium oxide and is strongly influenced by temperature. In this work, we examined the relationship between the change in band structure and the associated conductivity at lower temperatures when ceria is exposed to light. Following light excitation, the creation of oxygen vacancies results in electron localization in the Ce 4f state, followed by the electron transition from 4f 1 to 4f 0 , generating the PL spectra. With decreasing temperature, the lattice vibration decreases, and the splitting in the PL peak at a particular energy state validates the weaker electron–phonon interaction with an exciton trap. This reduces the carrier mobility of the film as observed from the resistance vs temperature curve of ceria under dark conditions. When excited by a particular energy of light, the electrons move more easily from the defect state to the conduction band, increasing conductivity at much lower temperatures than the conductivity under dark conditions.},

Through dynamic compression experiments on liquefied Ar, O 2 , CO, and N 2 , we aimed to understand shock-induced cooling and radiance changes at the sample/lithium fluoride (LiF) interface. The experiments were conducted using a setup involving a Doppler pin system and pyrometer to measure shock velocities, pressures, and temperatures across the interface between shocked liquids and LiF. Under the first-shock, molecular liquids experienced partial dissociation due to a rapid rise in pressure, density, and temperature within nanoseconds. Upon re-shocking at the sample/LiF interface, a radiance drop was observed for all liquids except Ar. Our data analysis suggests that the cooling effect is likely due to a chemical reaction occurring at the interface between reactive species, produced during the initial shock, and the layer of LiF at the surface under re-shock conditions. One probable interpretation is that this reaction formed a thin, partially transparent layer on the LiF, which absorbed a significant portion of the radiation emitted by the shocked fluid. Thus, the observed temperature drop in re-shocked liquid nitrogen is likely attributable to radiation reduction.},

  abstract = {Lithium metal is a promising high-capacity anode material for solid-state batteries, but it typically suffers from poor cyclability. Carbon scaffold hosts have the potential to improve this performance due to their high electronic conductivity and large surface area, which facilitates lithium-ion adsorption and desorption. Scaffold surface chemistry is known to significantly influence performance outcomes, but the details of these interactions are not fully understood. This study employs first-principles simulations to explore lithium transport and nucleation on graphene anodes with various surface chemistries. Using enhanced sampling techniques, ab initio molecular dynamics, and density functional theory calculations, we find that although surface chemistry has a minimal impact on lithium interfacial transport, it influences surface nucleation significantly. Both heteroatom dopants and intrinsic defects lower the nucleation barrier, creating a more favorable environment for lithium nucleation compared to pristine graphene. In addition, our results reveal a complex interplay between surface lithium concentration, lithium transport, and nucleation kinetics. These findings highlight the potential of surface modifications to precisely control nucleation processes on carbon-based anodes and provide design guidance for reducing dendrite formation and improving the cycle life of solid-state batteries.},

The 1D-VSFG spectra show a broad positive peak in the hydrogen-bonded region, which means that water molecules are oriented upward toward the lipid bilayer. Although DMPC is a zwitterionic lipid, the negatively charged phosphate group primarily influences the orientation of the water molecules. The absence of a dangling peak in the 1D- and 2D-VSFG spectra shows that the water molecules form hydrogen bonds with the lipid headgroup atoms. The spectral diffusion timescales obtained from the 2D-VSFG metrics of the slope of the nodal line clearly reveal a dynamical crossover and exhibit Arrhenius behavior with different activation energies before and after the melting of the lipid bilayer. Apart from 2D-VSFG, the frequency fluctuation time correlation function also exhibits a dynamical crossover upon melting of the lipid bilayer.},

The AA molecules at the interface are found to be oriented in a manner where the hydrophobic part (methyl chain) is oriented toward the vapor phase and the hydrophilic part is pointed toward the liquid phase. The total VSFG spectrum reveals that the intensity of the peak of dangling OH groups of water around 3750 cm −1 decreases when the concentration of AA increases, while the intensity of the peak around 3550 cm −1 due to OH groups having hydrogen bonds between water and AA molecules increases. Furthermore, the latter peak is redshifted as the AA concentration increases, which is due to the partial cancellation between the positive response of water OH modes and the negative response of the OH modes of AA molecules. It is also noted that the AA molecules make the interfacial water more structured by making hydrogen bonds with its otherwise dangling OH modes at the surface.},

For the case of ammonium nitrate (NH 4 NO 3 ), we report the presence of two successive sharp steps in the molar magnetic susceptibility along the a - and b -axes upon crossing its order–disorder phase transition (from phase IV to phase II). We suggest that the first step pertains to the NO 3 − planes shifting away from facing only along the b -axis and onto the a -axis by 45°. The second step is attributed to the disordering (ungearing) of the NH 4 + and NO 3 − . In contrast, only one step was observed in the magnetic susceptibility along the c -axis, and its large magnitude suggests that the NO 3 − remain weakly correlated even in phase I at 400 K. We also find evidence that the NH 4 + become magnetically ordered (geared) along the c -axis only until phase V. The approach employed in this work can be extended to experimentally study the lattice dynamics of other solids possessing planar ions such as amphidynamic crystals.},

  abstract = {The Random First-Order Transition (RFOT) theory predicts that transport proceeds by the cooperative movement of particles in domains, whose sizes increase as a liquid is compressed above a characteristic volume fraction, ϕ d . The rounded dynamical transition around ϕ d , which signals a crossover to activated transport, is accompanied by a growing correlation length that is predicted to diverge at the thermodynamic glass transition density ( &gt; ϕ d ) ⁠ . Simulations and imaging experiments probed the single particle dynamics of mobile particles in response to pinning all the particles in a semi-infinite space or randomly pinning (RP) a fraction of particles in a liquid at equilibrium. The extracted dynamic length increases non-monotonically with a peak around ϕ d , which not only depends on the pinning method but is also different from ϕ d of the actual liquid. This finding is at variance with the results obtained using the small wavelength limit of a four-point structure factor for unpinned systems. To obtain a consistent picture of the growth of the dynamic length, one that is impervious to the use of RP, we introduce a multiparticle structure factor, S m p c ( q , t ) ⁠ , that probes collective dynamics. The collective dynamical length, calculated from the small wave vector limit of S m p c ( q , t ) ⁠ , increases monotonically as a function of the volume fraction in a glass-forming binary mixture of charged colloidal particles in both unpinned and pinned systems. This prediction, which also holds in the presence of added monovalent salt, may be validated using imaging experiments.},

  abstract = {Minor oxygen addition has been proposed as a promising strategy to enhance the performance of metallic glasses, particularly their glass-forming ability. In this work, we investigate the microscopic dynamics of a CuZr glass former with oxygen content up to 2 at. % using molecular dynamics simulations based on specially developed neural network interatomic potentials. Our findings indicate a gradual increase in the glass transition temperature with oxygen addition, with an anomalous peak at 0.4 at. % O. We reveal an anti-correlation of kinetic fragility and dynamic heterogeneity behind this unusual rise, where the system exhibits reduced kinetic fragility alongside more significant dynamic heterogeneity. Using the continuous time random walk method, we show that at 0.4 at. % O, a highly mobile Cu atomic layer forms around O–Zr clusters, resulting in notable dynamic heterogeneity. This dynamic behavior is closely linked to the bonding pattern within the O–Zr network, particularly favoring the configuration with edge and surface sharing. In addition, such structures contribute to a more compact O–Zr network, leading to lower kinetic fragility. These findings provide detailed insights into the microscopic dynamics behind the effects of minor oxygen additions.},

Contrary to prior neutron scattering results in the literature, thermal expansion of the B–O bond is resolved, with a coefficient of α BO = 4.1(3) ppm K −1 , in quantitative agreement with the result previously derived by high-energy x-ray diffraction. Exploiting the scattering contrast between neutrons and x rays, difference functions are derived that eliminate contributions due to O–O pairs, revealing, for the first time, the nearest-neighbor B–B peak in the pair distribution function. This peak occurs at r BB = 2.430(1) Å in B 2 O 3 glass, consistent with a mean B–O–B bond angle β ≃ 124° and a large boroxol ring fraction. In the liquid, a much larger r BB ≃ 2.54 Å and β ≃ 134° are indicative of either a much lower ring fraction f , a larger non-ring B–O–B bond angle, β NR , or a combination of both. The latter scenario is supported by comparison to a range of molecular dynamics models with varying boroxol ring fractions.},

  abstract = {In this contribution, we compute the 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation rate of liquid water at ambient conditions. We are using structural and dynamical information from Coupled Cluster Molecular Dynamics (CCMD) trajectories generated at CCSD(T) electronic structure accuracy while also considering nuclear quantum effects in addition to consulting information from x-ray and neutron scattering experiments. Our analysis is based on a recently presented computational framework for determining the frequency-dependent NMR dipole–dipole relaxation rate of spin 1/2 nuclei from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, which allows for an effective disentanglement of its structural and dynamical contributions and includes a correction for finite-size effects inherent to MD simulations with periodic boundary conditions. A close to perfect agreement with experimental relaxation data is achieved if structural and dynamical information from CCMD trajectories is considered, leading to a re-balancing of the rotational and translational dynamics, which can also be expressed by the product of the self-diffusion coefficient and the reorientational correlation time of the H–H vector D 0 × τ HH . The simulations show that this balance is significantly altered when nuclear quantum effects are taken into account. Our analysis suggests that the intermolecular and intramolecular contributions to the 1 H NMR relaxation rate of liquid water are almost similar in magnitude, unlike what was predicted earlier from fully classical MD simulations.},

  abstract = {Self-assembling amphiphilic cyanine dyes, such as C8S3, are promising candidates for energy storage and optoelectronic applications due to their efficient energy transport properties. C8S3 is known to self-assemble in water into double-walled J-aggregates. Thus far, the molecular self-assembly steps remain shrouded in mystery. Here, we employ a multiscale approach to unravel the first self-assembly step: dimerization. Our multiscale approach combines molecular dynamics simulations with quantum chemistry calculations to obtain a Frenkel exciton Hamiltonian, which we then use in spectral calculations to determine the absorption and two-dimensional electronic spectra of C8S3 monomer and dimer systems. We model these systems solvated in both water and methanol, validating our model with experiments in methanol solution. Our theoretical results predict a measurable anisotropy decay upon dimerization, which is experimentally confirmed. Our approach provides a tool for the experimental probing of dimerization. Moreover, molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the dimer conformation is characterized by the interaction between the hydrophobic aliphatic tails rather than the π – π stacking previously reported for other cyanine dyes. Our results pave the way for future research into the mechanism of molecular self-assembly in similar light-harvesting complexes, offering valuable insights for understanding and optimizing self-assembly processes for various (nano)technological applications.},

  abstract = {Due to their unique physiochemical properties that may be tailored for specific purposes, ionic liquids (ILs) have been investigated for various applications, including chemical separations, catalysis, energy storage, and space propulsion. The different cations and anions comprising ILs may be selected to optimize a range of desired properties, such as thermal stability, ionic conductivity, and volatility, leading to the designation of certain ILs as designer “green” solvents. The effect of counterions on the properties of ILs is of both fundamental scientific interest and technological importance. Herein, we report a systematic experimental and theoretical investigation of the size, charge, stability toward dissociation, and geometric/electronic structure of 1-ethyl-3-methyl imidazolium (EMIM)-based IL clusters containing two different atomic counterions (i.e., bromide [Br − ] and iodide [I − ]). This work extends our studies of EMIM + cations with atomic chloride (Cl − ) and molecular tetrafluoroborate (BF 4 − ) anions reported previously by Baxter et al. [Chem. Mater. 34 , 2612 (2022)] and Zhang et al. [J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 11 , 6844 (2020)], respectively. Distributions of anionic IL clusters were generated in the gas phase using electrospray ionization and characterized by high mass resolution mass spectrometry, energy-resolved collision-induced dissociation, and negative ion photoelectron spectroscopy experiments. The experimental results reveal anion-dependent trends in the size distribution, relative abundance, ionic charge state, stability toward dissociation, and electron binding energies of the IL clusters. Complementary global optimization theory provides molecular-level insights into the bonding and electronic structure of a selected subset of clusters, including their low energy structures and electrostatic potential maps, and how these fundamental characteristics are influenced by anion substitution. Collectively, our findings demonstrate how the fundamental properties of ILs, which determine their suitability for many applications, may be tuned by substituting counterions. These observations are critical in the sub-nanometer cluster size regime where phenomena do not scale predictably to the bulk phase, and each atom counts toward determining behavior.},

  abstract = {The photodissociation and photoionization of O 2 and the subsequent photodissociation of O 2 + in the wavelength region of 200 to 240 nm are reported using resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) and velocity map imaging detection. A series of two-photon allowed Rydberg states with principle quantum number n = 3–11 converging to the ground electronic state of O 2 + X 2 Π g are used as doorway states to reach the region of superexcited states of O 2 in the three-photon energy range of 15.8–18.6 eV. A detailed analysis of the kinetic energy release and anisotropy parameters of photofragments extracted from velocity map images reveals competition between neutral dissociation and autoionization and leads to the identification of different O + formation channels. Moreover, the measurement of anisotropy parameters for each channel gives additional information on the symmetry of electronic states involved in the absorption process. Formation followed by the dissociation of vibrationally excited O 2 + is the strongest channel over the full wavelength range studied. Ground and vibrationally excited O 2 + ( X 2 Π g , a 4 Π u , A 2 Π u ) are formed and dissociated to ionic products via one and two-photon processes. Neutral dissociation to form electronically excited atoms is important at the longer wavelengths studied and becomes noticeably less important at shorter wavelengths. These results agree with and expand on a previous study from our lab of O + formation at a single (2 + 1) REMPI wavelength, and the results obtained in this study are found to complement our study of the electronically analogous counterpart S 2 , where most of the S + ions arise from electronically excited S* atoms. The results of this study will also be of use in the pixel-to-velocity calibration of any velocity map imaging apparatus in the wide ultraviolet wavelength regions. Because O 2 is a common reactant or product in many molecular dynamics studies, knowledge of its ionization/dissociation pathways at commonly used wavelengths should also be useful in avoiding signal overlap problems.},

The strongest NH 3 adsorption energy, 28.55 kcal/mol, was found for Fe 2 O 3 , where NH 3 interacts with a two-coordinated Fe site, forming an Fe–N bond with a length of 2.11 Å. A comparative analysis of NH 3 dehydrogenation and H 2 formation on various Fe(III) oxide sizes identifies the rate-determining steps for each reaction. We found that the rate-determining step for the full NH 3 dehydrogenation on (Fe 2 O 3 ) n ( n = 1–4) is size-dependent, with the NH* → N* + H* reaction acting as the limiting step for n = 1–3.

With the aid of a theoretical study using ab initio methods, we propose a mechanism to infer the formation of these cationic species, which have been assigned to projectile–target stable compounds (CO 3 + and CO 4 + ).},

  abstract = {Molecular clusters are aggregates of molecules weakly bound by the van der Waals force between molecules. Removing one electron from each constitutive molecule results in van der Waals bond cleavages through Coulomb explosion. This provides an ideal prototype to further study the environmental effects played by one fragmented ion on the other one at the molecular scale. Here, we report an experimental measurement of the two-body Coulomb explosion of ( C O ) 2 2 + and ( C O ) 3 2 + ⁠ , produced in a 40 keV Ar 2+ double-electron capture collision with a CO dimer and trimer. Accurate reaction pathways are identified with the advanced ion–ion coincidence and momentum-imaging techniques. The measured kinetic energy release deviates from the calculated results based on the reciprocal of internuclear distance (i.e., Coulomb interaction only) and which, therefore, requires the inclusion of rotational energy of CO + initiated by molecular electric-dipole momentum. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the separation defining the rotational energy takes place within a few hundred fs after the onset of dissociation. This molecular-scale environmental effect significantly brings calculations and measurements of the kinetic energy release into agreement.},

  abstract = {The results of a combined experimental and computational study on Ln 3 O ( Ln = Ce, Sm, and Gd) anion and neutral clusters are presented and analyzed. These three Ln ’s were specifically targeted because they vary in their spin state and orbital angular momentum associated with the 4f N subshell occupancies. From the anion PE spectra of Ce 3 O − , Sm 3 O − , and Gd 3 O − measured with 2.330 and 3.495 eV photon energies, we determine the adiabatic electron affinities of the corresponding neutrals to be 0.83 ± 0.03, 1.11 ± 0.05, and 1.17 ± 0.05 eV, respectively. The lowest energy features in all three spectra can readily be reconciled with molecular structures in which the O-atom is central to all three Ln centers, with Ce 3 O − /Ce 3 O assuming pyramidal structures and Sm 3 O − /Sm 3 O and Gd 3 O − /Gd 3 O assuming planar structures. Computationally, the lowest-energy structure of neutral Ce 3 O is a kite-like structure, which is not consistent with the observed spectrum. The kite-like and pyramidal structures of Ce 3 O − are predicted to be nearly isoenergetic. Electronic states in which all three 4f N centers are ferromagnetically coupled are predicted to be energetically favored for all species, but spin-frustrated states in which one 4f N center is antiferromagnetically coupled to the remaining centers are computed to lie 0.05 eV higher in energy than the FM-coupled states for Ce 3 O − and Sm 3 O − . The PE spectrum of Sm 3 O − exhibits striking anomalies in the photoelectron angular dependence. This effect is attributed to strong photoelectron–valence electron interactions that drive nominally forbidden changes in the M f state of the remnant neutral.},

Knowledge of the hyperfine structure is crucial for studying the mechanism of intramolecular radical-pair formation in proteins. Transient 19 F photo-CIDNP NMR has so far not been used to determine the isotropic hyperfine coupling constants of 19 F nuclei. Here, we show that this method provides reliable results by studying three monofluorinated flavin mononucleotide (FMN) derivatives in conjunction with 6-fluoro-tryptophan.

The two-photon transition in the REMPI spectrum is rotationally resolved, allowing ionization from a selected rovibrational state of O 2 . Fits to this spectrum determine spectroscopic parameters of the O 2 d 1 Π g state and resolve a discrepancy in the literature regarding its band origin. The trapped molecular ions are cooled by co-trapped atomic ions. Fluorescence mass spectrometry nondestructively demonstrates the presence of the photoionized O 2 + ⁠ .

In this study, we combine the ODMR technique with the rapid scan of the magnetic field to demonstrate the impact of fast passage effects on the field-swept cw-ODMR. An ensemble of negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV − ) centers in a diamond crystal is used as a model system. By selecting the fast passage adiabatic region among six distinct passage regions, efficient ODMR detection is achieved through the macroscopic control of longitudinal magnetization. Experimental results are explained by the numerical analyses of classical time-dependent Bloch equations and related rate equations under an optical cycle.

While s-SNOM offers a high spatial resolution, its effectiveness is often hindered by low signal levels, particularly in weakly absorbing samples. To address these challenges, we utilize a data-driven “patch-based” machine learning reconstruction method, incorporating modern generative adversarial neural networks (CycleGANs) for denoising s-SNOM images. This method allows for flexible reconstruction of images of arbitrary sizes, a critical capability given the variable nature of scanned sample areas in point-scanning probe-based microscopies. The CycleGAN model is trained on unpaired sets of images captured at both rapid and extended acquisition times, thereby modeling instrument noise while preserving essential topographical and molecular information. The results show significant improvements in image quality, as indicated by higher structural similarity index and peak signal-to-noise ratio values, comparable to those obtained from images captured with four times the integration time. This method not only enhances image quality but also has the potential to reduce the overall data acquisition time, making high-resolution s-SNOM imaging more feasible for a wide range of biological and materials science applications.},

This review examines computational approaches to chromatin folding, focusing on polymer models that elucidate chromatin loop mechanics. We discuss three key models: (1) the multi-loop-subcompartment model, which investigates the structural effects of loops on chromatin conformation; (2) the strings and binders switch model, capturing thermodynamic chromatin aggregation; and (3) the loop extrusion model, revealing the role of structural maintenance of chromosome complexes. In addition, we explore advanced models that address chromatin clustering heterogeneity in biological processes and disease progression. The review concludes with an outlook on open questions and current trends in chromatin loop formation and genome interactions, emphasizing the physical and computational challenges in the field.},

Calculations on the GW 100 molecular test set lead, nevertheless, to a good agreement, at the 60 meV mean-absolute-error accuracy on the ionization potential, with respect to the conventional qs GW approach. We show further that constructing the density matrix from the full Green’s function as in the fully self-consistent sc GW scheme, and not from the occupied quasiparticle one-body orbitals, allows obtaining a scheme intermediate between the qs GW and sc GW approaches, closer to coupled-cluster reference values.},

The relation between the induced fluxes and the control parameters of RNEMD (such as the time interval between successive swap events) is not clear. Thus, trial-and-error is required to realize the desired fluxes in RNEMD simulations. In this study, we develop a theoretical framework using extreme value statistics to estimate the relation between the time interval and the resulting induced fluxes. Our RNEMD simulations, conducted with varying time intervals, confirm that the theoretical predictions are quantitatively consistent with the simulation results when the time interval exceeds the momentum relaxation time. Our RNEMD simulations also show that our theoretical predictions, which are valid for a large number of particles for swap candidates, work well even for a relatively small number of particles for swap candidates. These findings demonstrate that the induced fluxes can be reliably estimated, providing a valuable tool for selecting appropriate RNEMD parameters for simulations.},

  abstract = {The wetting properties of a liquid in contact with a solid are commonly described by Young’s equation, which defines the relationship between the angle made by a fluid droplet onto the solid surface and the interfacial properties of the different interfaces involved. When modeling such interfacial systems, several assumptions are usually made to determine this angle of contact, such as a completely rigid solid or the use of the tension at the interface instead of the surface free energy. In this work, we perform molecular dynamics simulations of a Lennard-Jones liquid in contact with a Lennard-Jones crystal and compare the contact angles measured from a droplet simulation with those calculated using Young’s equation based on surface free energy or surface stress. We analyze cases where the solid atoms are kept frozen in their positions and where they are allowed to relax and simulate surfaces with different wettability and degrees of softness. Our results show that using either surface free energy or surface stress in Young’s equation leads to similar contact angles but different interfacial properties. We find that the approximation of keeping the solid atoms frozen must be done carefully, especially if the liquid can efficiently pack at the interface. Finally, we show that to correctly reproduce the measured contact angles when the solid becomes soft, the quantity to be used in Young’s equation is the surface free energy only and that the error committed in using the surface stress becomes larger as the softness of the solid increases.},

By applying these techniques, we derived and implemented a series of orbital-dependent approximations for the non-additive kinetic energy, which are employed self-consistently. Our proof-of-principle computations demonstrated quantitatively correct results for potential energy curves and electron densities and hinted on the applicability of the introduced empirical parameters to different types of molecular systems and intermolecular interactions.

  abstract = {This study presents a numerical simulation approach to investigate singlet–triplet interconversion effects in organic materials with rigid molecular structures that facilitate the photogeneration of charge-separated (CS) states, such as zwitterions resulting from intramolecular electron transfer. Our approach enables the detailed modeling of electron and nuclear spin-dependent observables, including magnetic field-affected reaction yields (MARY) and chemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization (CIDNP). The equilibrium solution of the stochastic Liouville equation can be obtained with simple algebraic manipulation by noting the relationship between the Laplace transform of the density operator and the time-domain representation of the same operator. Experimental MARY and CIDNP data are modeled as functions of key external and internal system parameters, such as magnetic field strength, hyperfine interactions, and exchange couplings. This allows for exploring processes that are otherwise experimentally inaccessible, providing deeper insights into the spin dynamics of the photoinduced CS state. Understanding these interconversion processes is not only essential for the fundamental photochemistry studies but also for the rational design and development of novel organic materials for photovoltaics and photocatalysis. Our results demonstrate the significant impact of singlet–triplet interconversion on the overall efficiency of charge separation and recombination processes, highlighting the importance of spin dynamics in the design of next-generation organic photovoltaic materials.},

The accuracy of the approach has been investigated by calculating low-lying transitions of a Xe atom, a HI molecule, and spin forbidden 1 S 0 → 3 P 1 and spin allowed 1 S 0 → 1 P 1 transitions in a few closed shell cations. In addition to the valence spectra, the relativistic EOM-CCSD expectation value approach is particularly suitable for simulating the L-edge x-ray absorption spectrum (XAS). The calculated results show good agreement with the earlier reported theoretical studies and experimental values.},

  abstract = {Utilizing an atomistic computational model, which handles both translational and spin degrees of freedom, combined molecular and spin dynamics simulations have been performed to investigate the effect of vacancy defects on spin wave excitations in ferromagnetic iron. Fourier transforms of space- and time-displaced correlation functions yield the dynamic structure factor, providing characteristic frequencies and lifetimes of the spin wave modes. A comparison of the system with a 5% vacancy concentration with pure lattice data shows a decrease in frequency and a decrease in lifetime for all transverse spin wave excitations observed. In addition, the clearly defined transverse spin wave excitations are distorted with the introduction of vacancy defects, and we observe reduced excitation lifetimes due to increased magnon–magnon scattering. We observe further evidence of increased magnon–magnon scattering, as the peaks in the longitudinal spin wave spectrum become less distinct. Similar impacts are observed in the vibrational subsystem, with a decrease in characteristic phonon frequency and flattening of lattice excitation signals due to vacancy defects.},

With the exchange-correction, the FDM procedure yields dispersion coefficients for closed-shell atoms on par with highly correlated methods when using only Hartree–Fock or Kohn–Sham pair density. Conversely, the Becke–Roussel exchange-hole results in an overestimation of the dispersion coefficients for closed-shell atoms; however, the performance of the Becke–Roussel model can be improved by scaling the multipole moment integrals by a fixed amount.

It is demonstrated that matrix power and matrix logarithm functions combined with an auxiliary matrix formalism can be used to derive expressions for gradient ascent pulse engineering (GRAPE) optimization. We illustrate how different implementations provide effective and intuitive control of DNP experiments by tailoring the effective Hamiltonian governing polarization transfer and, in this manner, addressing some of the limitations of prevailing optimal control based pulse design strategies.},

Our analysis focuses on a wide range of different cell lines and two distinct organisms and provides a unified picture of chromatin structure for scales ranging from 5 kb (kilobases) up to 2 Mb (megabases), thus covering a genomic region of almost three orders of magnitude. Confirming recent analysis [Remini et al. , Phys. Rev.

On the other hand, the less well-known many-body version of Brillouin–Wigner perturbation theory has the reverse properties: it is regular but fails to be size-consistent when used with the standard MP partitioning. Consequently, its widespread use remains limited. In this work, we analyze the ways in which it is possible to use alternative non-MP partitions of the Hamiltonian to yield variants of BW2 that are size-consistent as well as regular. We show that there is a vast space of such BW2 theories and also show that it is possible to define a repartitioned BW2 theory from the ground state density alone, which regenerates the exact correlation energy. We also provide a general recipe for deriving regular, size-consistent, and size-extensive partitions from physically meaningful components, and we apply the result to small model systems. The scope of these results appears to further set the stage for a revival of BW2 in quantum chemistry.},

The implemented MD algorithm is highly parallelized and highly pipelined internally. The FPGA cluster is freely scalable in terms of size, i.e., a larger MD system requires more nodes, however, without compromising simulation speed. The performance in terms of energy stability and simulation speed is analyzed. At present, the focus lies on the fast networking, while only minimal MD functionality has been implemented so far, i.e., Lennard-Jones interactions and a thermostat, which were needed to demonstrate the feasibility of the FPGA cluster to run multi-microsecond simulations. To that end, the nucleation of a super-cooled Lennard-Jones liquid is investigated by unbiased MD simulations, which is a difficult MD problem since a high nucleation barrier has to be overcome. Finally, the pathways toward a full MD implementation are outlined. The current implementation will be made available as an open-source development project.},

Although these three defects all produce occupied electronic levels near the conduction band minimum, they impose quite different effects. Ov and Ce-int induce strong peaks in the low-energy region of the imaginary part of the microscopic dielectric function, indicating stronger electronic screening compared to the pristine CeO 2 . This causes pronounced narrowing of the bandgap, e.g., by 0.8 eV in G 0 W 0 and 1.6 eV in the eigenvalue self-consistent GW for Ov. Comparatively, Hy affects little electronic screening and bandgap at different levels of GW calculations. For the lowest several 4 f orbitals, the exchange part of the self-energy (|Σ x | &gt; 9 eV) in GW is much stronger than the correlation part (|Σ c | &lt; 5 eV) for Ov and Ce-int, while |Σ c | is much stronger than |Σ x | instead for the pristine CeO 2 and Hy. Quasiparticle weights in Ov and Ce-int decrease by a large quantity compared to the pristine CeO 2 . Consideration of Ov and Ce-int might to some extent relieve the discrepancy between the GW bandgap of the pristine CeO 2 and the experimental gap. Ov and Ce-int could reduce the excitonic binding energy several times and result in optical absorption, which corresponds to the experiments.},

  abstract = {We present an analytical description of the Alchemical Transfer Method (ATM) for molecular binding using the Potential Distribution Theory (PDT) formalism. ATM models the binding free energy by mapping the bound and unbound states of the complex by translating the ligand coordinates. PDT relates the free energy and the probability densities of the perturbation energy along the alchemical path to the probability density at the initial state, which is the unbound state of the complex in the case of a binding process. Hence, the ATM probability density of the transfer energy at the unbound state is first related by a convolution operation of the probability densities for coupling the ligand to the solvent and coupling it to the solvated receptor—for which analytical descriptions are available—with parameters obtained from maximum likelihood analysis of data from double-decoupling alchemical calculations. PDT is then used to extend this analytical description along the alchemical transfer pathway. We tested the theory on the alchemical binding of five guests to the tetramethyl octa-acid host from the SAMPL8 benchmark set. In each case, the probability densities of the perturbation energy for transfer along the alchemical transfer pathway obtained from numerical calculations match those predicted from the theory and double-decoupling simulations. The work provides a solid theoretical foundation for alchemical transfer, offers physical insights on the form of the probability densities observed in alchemical transfer calculations, and confirms the conceptual and numerical equivalence between the alchemical transfer and double-decoupling processes.},

  abstract = {Correlated orbital theory (COT) is an exact one-particle treatment that adds essential electron correlation into its molecular orbitals, potentially reducing correlated treatments of response properties to one-particle coupled-perturbed Hartree–Fock- or Kohn–Sham-like calculations. Such a computation is vastly simpler than the usual ab initio correlated approach that would add correlation typically with EOM-CC after a perturbed mean-field solution. The question then is, how well can this be accomplished via the Quantum Theory Project (QTP) exchange–correlation (XC) functionals that are meant to emulate the rigorous COT framework? This paper addresses this question for response properties by making comparisons between such orbital-specific calculations and those from well-correlated EOM-CC solutions for static polarizabilities, nuclear magnetic resonance coupling constants, and chemical shifts. The simple orbital-specific version provides an accurate realization of the correlated EOM-CC results, but now in a mode that facilitates an orbital-by-orbital interpretation. Here, we compare 33 XC functionals from the different Jacob’s ladder rungs always against the EOM-CCSD results. Thus, the smallest mean absolute deviation for the static polarizability comes from LC-QTP XC, 0.28 a.u. Regarding the total nuclear spin–spin coupling constants, QTP01 performs best, %Error = 10.63% (QTP02 and LC-QTP are second and third best). Finally, the XC that stood out in the chemical shift analysis was TPSS0, which presented the best result for the majority of the chemical shifts. However, considering the overall performances based on linear fitting of all isotope data points, five functionals are recommended for a chemical shift study: TPSS0, ω B97X, QTP00, QTP01, and QTP02, all presenting R 2 = 0.96.},

A nonlinear behavior of the transport current is exhibited due to the competition between the interdot coupling strength of the two QDs and the Kondo effect. With the increase in interdot coupling strength, the transport current first increases at low interdot couplings and then decreases with the strong interdot couplings. The reason is that the interdot coupling strength will result in a continuous evolution from the Kondo singlet state of individual QDs to the spin singlet state forming between the two QDs. Moreover, we define the physical quantity ∂G / ∂t as the differential function of differential conductance G with respect to interdot coupling strength t . The nonlinear transport behavior and the physical quantity ∂G / ∂t with differential conductance at different bias voltages can be used to detect the potential Kondo resonance in the nonequilibrium transport experiments.},

The root-mean-square deviation based bias potential is added to the potential energy surface to force the structure escape from the already explored regions. The additional constraint function is used to enable the structure reach different intersection seams. This method can be used for systematically and automatically searching MECIs or exploring conical intersection seams.

  abstract = {Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs) require ongoing improvement and innovation to effectively address challenges across various domains. Developing MLFF models typically involves extensive screening, tuning, and iterative testing. However, existing packages based on a single mature descriptor or model are unsuitable for this process. Therefore, we developed a package named ABFML, based on PyTorch, which aims to promote MLFF innovation by providing developers with a rapid, efficient, and user-friendly tool for constructing, screening, and validating new force field models. Moreover, by leveraging standardized module operations and cutting-edge machine learning frameworks, developers can swiftly establish models. In addition, the platform can seamlessly transition to the graphics processing unit environments, enabling accelerated calculations and large-scale parallel simulations of molecular dynamics. In contrast to traditional from-scratch approaches for MLFF development, ABFML significantly lowers the barriers to developing force field models, thereby expediting innovation and application within the MLFF development domains.},

  abstract = {The multilayer-multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH) method has garnered significant attention in the realm of theoretical chemistry owing to its powerful ability to perform numerically exact descriptions of multi-dimensional quantum dynamics and exhibit the remarkable performance in simulating the nonadiabatic dynamics of complex systems. Despite the availability of computational packages within the ML-MCTDH framework, executing these calculations seamlessly is not a straightforward task. Typically, substantial efforts are necessitated to configure the correct inputs for ML-MCTDH calculations, which require to correctly define several non-trivial parameters, to reasonably setup the optimal tree expansion of wavefunctions, and to properly select basis function numbers. To address these challenges, we have developed an auxiliary package named ML-MCTDH-Aid, which facilitates the setup of ML-MCTDH calculations using the Heidelberg MCTDH package in a user-friendly manner. This package is primarily tailored to handle the high-dimensional nonadiabatic dynamics governed by the Hamiltonian composed of several electronic states, several vibrational modes and their linear vibronic coupling terms. It automatically generates multiple essential input files, and all the calculations can be performed in an all-in-one black-box easy-to-use manner. To show the utility of the ML-MCTDH-Aid package, we provide a step-by-step tutorial that demonstrates running ML-MCTDH studies on three models. These examples illuminate how the utilization of the ML-MCTDH-Aid package significantly enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of ML-MCTDH calculations. This substantially boosts the accessibility of ML-MCTDH calculations in tackling the high-dimensional quantum dynamics of complex systems.},

  abstract = {Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a widely used precipitant to concentrate proteins. The effect of PEG is generally understood to be an entropic attraction between proteins due to the depletion effect of PEG around proteins. However, measurements by Bloustine et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 96 , 087803 (2006)] of the liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) temperature have shown that a lysozyme solution is stabilized and destabilized by the addition of low and high molecular-weight PEG, respectively. They also presented a theoretical model of the LLPS temperature as a virial expansion of the free energy and concluded that, in addition to the depletion effect, the attractive interaction between protein and PEG is necessary to explain the experiments. In the present study, theoretical calculations based on liquid-state density functional theory utilizing coarse-grained models are conducted to demonstrate that the protein–PEG effective attraction is responsible for the suppression and promotion of LLPS upon the addition of low- and high-weight PEG, respectively. In contrast, if the interactions between the protein and the PEG are solely due to the excluded volume effect, PEG of any molecular weight destabilizes the solution. These results suggest the necessity to reconsider the conventional understanding of the effects of polymer addition, which have been historically attributed to solely the depletion force.},

Based on our understanding of alkane solutions and in aromatic organic crystals, the charge separation mechanism in dye-sensitized solar cells is discussed as a photoionization-induced solar energy conversion system.},
