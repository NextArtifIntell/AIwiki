  abstract     = {Magnesium-air batteries hold potential applications due to their high energy density and environmental friendliness. However, the formation of passivation films and the suboptimal standard electrode potential have been primary scientific challenges hindering the rapid advancement of magnesium-air batteries. This study develops Mg 2 Sn anode materials and conceptualizes a mechanism leveraging their superior thermoelectric properties to enhance the open-circuit voltage and inhibit the formation of passivation films. By employing a self-designed magnesium saturation temperature smelting method, high-performance n-type and p-type Mg 2 Sn thermoelectric materials are synthesized rapidly in the air. Notably, the n-type thermoelectric material exhibits a peak power factor of up to 4.83 mW m −1 K −2 and a thermoelectric figure of merit ( ZT ) exceeding 1. A unique Mg 2 Sn-air battery is engineered to utilize thermoelectric effects for modulating the built-in electric field. This design not only compensates for the open-circuit voltage but also harnesses the Seebeck electromotive force generated by Mg 2 Sn to suppress the formation of passivation films on the anode surface, giving the high thermoelectric performance Mg 2 Sn, which tends to deliquesce in air, a unique application prospect. It elucidates a pathway for utilizing thermoelectric effects to synergistically enhance the electrochemical performance of metal-air batteries.},

The microbubbles are directly generated by electrolysis of the hydrogel, and their displacement is detected using optical microscopy in the focal plane of a focused vortex beam. Microbubbles displaced off-axis can be pulled by a restoring radial force component that forms a stable two-dimensional trap. We also observe an off-axis tangential microbubble motion that is due to the transfer of the beam&#39;s angular momentum flux. A simple elastic model for the hydrogel deformation combined with radiation force calculations finally provides local values of the medium&#39;s shear modulus, which are found to be in good agreement with standard bulk measurements performed with a rheometer. Our results suggest that acoustical tweezers are relevant tools to characterize the local mechanical properties of complex soft materials, opening opportunities in the field of active rheology.},

  abstract     = {Delta-E effect sensors developed for detecting small amplitude and low-frequency magnetic fields have shown potential for miniaturization. However, a comprehensive signal-and-noise analysis of such miniaturized sensors is lacking. Here, we present an in-depth study of the key performance characteristics of sub-millimeter-sized delta-E effect sensors with a double-wing resonator geometry. Several resonance modes are evaluated for their sensitivity, noise, and limit of detection ( LoD ⁠ ) as functions of the excitation voltage amplitude and magnetic bias flux density. We identify and discuss the optimal conditions for sensor operation and compare the performance to that of the reported macroscopic devices. While all investigated resonance modes behave qualitatively similar, quantitative differences in signal and noise lead to an almost sevenfold difference in LoD s. The performance is limited by magnetic noise at large excitation amplitudes and, unlike reported macroscopic delta-E effect sensors, by noise from the excitation signal and charge amplifier at low excitation amplitudes. The best performance is achieved in the third resonance mode excited at 683 kHz with a LoD ≤ 7.4 ± 3 nT / H z between 10 and 1000 Hz and a minimum of 2.8 nT / H z at 195 Hz. This demonstrates an improvement over previously reported values for miniaturized delta-E effect sensors in this frequency range. Moreover, the sensors show a −3 dB bandwidth of ≈440 Hz, which is significantly wider compared to macroscopic delta-E effect sensors. Reducing electronic noise and employing advanced magnetic multilayers can further improve the LoD ⁠ , making these miniaturized sensors promising candidates for compact arrays.},

Different intensity waveforms are created by adjusting the motion profile of a resonant absorber (an ensemble of Mössbauer nuclei) and tuning the energy of the incident radiation. A crucial aspect of this method is the use of a low fundamental frequency of vibrations, which broadens the possibilities for γ -ray control. The results of numerical simulations are experimentally validated by generating single and double γ -pulses and inducing short-term absorption. For this, a resonant absorber containing 57 Fe nuclei was vibrated with different motion profiles composed of 12 harmonics with a fundamental frequency of 1 MHz. The proposed technique represents an advancement in the manipulation of γ -rays, and potentially x rays, paving the way for the performance of unique types of γ -ray or x-ray quantum experiments and the development of tools such as adjustable table-top γ -pulse sources or γ -ray or x-ray delays and gates.

Thus, in this work, we investigated the relationship between the absorption of multilayer graphene with different stacking orders from the transition dipole moment (TDM) and joint density of states (JDOS). It is found that the interlayer linkage of different stacking sequences leads to the varied chiral pseudospin doublets, which results in changes in TDM, consequently influencing the absorption spectra in the infrared and visible regions. While the enhanced absorption in the thicker multilayers from the ultraviolet to ionizing radiation region could be attributed to the increasement of JDOS. The comprehensive understanding of the absorption mechanism behind the multilayer graphene could provide another way of thinking about the optical absorption stacking modulation in atypical multilayer graphene.},

Rapid developments in nonlinear quantum frequency conversion techniques have enhanced the potential for constructing a trapped ion quantum network via optical fiber connections. The generation of long-distance entanglement has been demonstrated with ions such as Ca + and Ba + , which emit photons in visible or near-infrared range naturally. On the other hand, as the qubit-native photons reside in ultra-violet (UV) spectrum, the Yb + ion has not been considered as a strong competitor for telecommunication qubits despite extensive research on it. Here, we demonstrate an efficient difference-frequency conversion of UV photons, emitted from a trapped Yb + ion, into a visible range. We provide experimental evidence that confirms the converted photons are radiated from the Yb + ion.

We have conducted a detailed theoretical analysis of the piezoelectric properties of this piezoelectric device. By utilizing a coplanar electrode piezoelectric mode, pressure applied to one electrode generates a potential difference between the two electrodes. Notably, the piezoelectric performance of the device can be adjusted by modifying its structure. Numerical simulations and experimental results indicate that the piezoelectric performance reaches an optimal value when the distance between the electrodes is equal to one-half of the electrode length. Additionally, we have developed a method to enhance the piezoelectric voltage output capability of the device under low load resistance conditions. Specifically, by introducing charge carriers into the piezoelectric layer from the doped silicon substrate, the device&#39;s resistance is reduced due to the Schottky contact. The piezoelectric operating mode proposed in this paper facilitates energy harvesting and self-powered sensing, distinguishing it from the d 31 and d 33 operational modes associated with traditional sandwich device structures, thereby allowing for more versatile device configurations.},

Here, by introducing grain boundary trapping states into the AgSbTe 2 matrix, the thermally activated release of carriers at elevated temperatures enhances electrical conductivity, while the increased barrier potential induces an energy filtering effect that sustains a high Seebeck coefficient. This synergistic optimization of electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient significantly enhances the power factor. Additionally, numerous point defects and a higher density of grain boundaries further enhance phonon scattering, resulting in a 33% reduction in glass-like thermal conductivity compared to the pristine sample. With enhanced power factor and reduced lattice thermal conductivity, Fe-doped AgSbTe 2 achieves a remarkable peak zT of 1.8 at 623 K and an impressive zT avg of 1.4 over the temperature range of 323–623 K, showcasing its leading performance in the field.

The enhanced nonreciprocal thermal radiation is attributed to the field enhancement of epsilon-near-zero layer and nonreciprocal guided resonances excited in the WSM film. By studying the magnetic field distribution, the physical mechanism of multi-band nonreciprocal thermal radiation is revealed, which can be verified by the impedance matching theory. Furthermore, the dependence of the structure dimensions and the axial vector b of the Weyl semimetal on the performance of the nonreciprocal radiation is investigated in detail.

  abstract     = {Nanoscale Co/CoO/Co point contact devices are promising for spintronics, magnetic sensors, single-electron transistors, and memory devices. We fabricated Co/CoO/Co point contact devices and studied their random telegraph signal (RTS) characteristics at various temperatures. In the time domain, the current fluctuates asymmetrically with respect to zero bias, with RTS behavior emerging above a certain voltage threshold. In the frequency domain, the RTS power spectral density exhibits Lorentzian lines. As temperature increases from 50 to 300 K, two RTS behaviors are observed: at ≤100 K, the high current state dominates; at ≥200 K, the low current state prevails, with RTS absent at 150 K. Single exponential fitting shows that RTS state lifetimes decrease with temperature. The charge capture and release model explains the RTS origins and temperature-dependent behavior from an energy band perspective. This study provides insights into charge dynamics, single-electron transport, and the noise mechanisms affecting the reliability of nanoscale devices.},

  abstract     = {Tunnel field-effect transistor (TFET) is emerging as a promising alternative to overcome the thermionic limit of 60 mV/dec in subthreshold swing (SS) inherent to metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor through the band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) mechanism. TFET offers significant potential for applications in future industries, such as low-power sensors and wearable devices, where extreme energy efficiency is critical. Notably, due to the characteristic of the BTBT mechanism, TFET can maintain stable SS performance even at high temperature, enabling low-power operation under such condition. Although numerous theoretical predictions and simulations support this capability, experimental validation has not yet been demonstrated. As electric and autonomous vehicles advance, the demand for automotive semiconductors has increased, highlighting the importance of transistor technology that remains stable at high temperatures and consumes less power. Here, we report high temperature TFETs showing SS &lt; 60 mV/dec through vertical heterojunction of two-dimensional semiconductors. n-TFET and p-TFET were implemented via BP-MoS 2 and WSe 2 -ReS 2 heterojunction, respectively. Both TFETs reached SS min under 50 mV/dec at room temperature and maintained SS 1dec_avg under 60 mV/dec up to 400 K. These findings pave the way for low-power circuits capable of operation in harsh environments.},

Through the in situ ALD of 10–30 cycles Ga 2 O 3 dipole layer, a 1.09–1.59 V flatband voltage positive modulation range is obtained with a small 0.05–0.36 nm equivalent oxide thickness penalty, respectively. The modification of the band alignment is verified by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurement on the gate stacks before and after Ga 2 O 3 dipole layer insertion. The valence band offset between SiO 2 /HfO 2 has been suppressed by the insertion of Ga 2 O 3 , proving a p-type dipole nature of Ga 2 O 3 dipole layer. The first interface of SiO 2 /Ga 2 O 3 more dominantly decides the p-type nature, and the second Ga 2 O 3 /HfO 2 suppresses it.

  abstract     = {One-dimensional structures such as nanowires (NWs) show great promise in tailoring the rates of hot carrier thermalization in semiconductors with important implications for the design of efficient hot carrier absorbers. However, the fabrication of defect-free crystal structures and control of their intrinsic electronic properties can be challenging, raising concerns about the role of competing radiative and non-radiative recombination mechanisms that govern hot carrier effects. Here, we elucidate the impact of crystal purity and altered electronic properties on the hot carrier properties by comparing two classes of III–V semiconductor NW arrays with similar bandgap energies and geometries, yet different crystal quality: one composed of GaAsSb NWs, which host antisite point defects but are free of planar stacking defects, and the other InGaAs NWs with a very high density of stacking defects. Photoluminescence spectroscopy demonstrates distinct hot carrier effects in both NW arrays; however, the InGaAs NWs exhibit stronger hot carrier effects, as evidenced by increased carrier temperature under identical photo-absorptivity. This difference arises from higher rates of Auger recombination in the InGaAs NWs due to their increased n -type conductivity, as confirmed by excitation power-dependent measurements. Our findings suggest that while enhancing material properties is crucial for improving the performance of hot carrier absorbers, optimizing conditions to increase the rates of Auger recombination will further boost the efficiency of these devices.},

  abstract     = {Zero-dimensional/one-dimensional (0D/1D) heterojunctions have excellent potential in the field of optoelectronic devices due to the synergy effect of different dimensions. Most reported 0D/1D heterojunction photodetectors only focus on optimizing the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers at the interface. However, the carriers within the quantum dots (QDs) cannot be transferred to the electrodes, resulting in recombination of photogenerated carriers separated at the interface. Therefore, the response speed of most 0D/1D heterojunction photodetectors is still limited to the order of seconds (s) and milliseconds (ms). In our work, we demonstrate a nanosecond (ns) scale ZnO/CuO heterojunction photodetector with efficient photoelectric conversion by engineering the type-II 0D/1D heterojunction interface. Herein, the surface defect states of ZnO QDs are deliberately introduced as “electrons storage pool” to suppress carrier recombination and further promote separation, which has been confirmed by photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL). As a result, the photodetector exhibited excellent performance with ultrafast response speed of 20 ns, responsivity of 213 A/W, and detectivity of 2.95 × 10 11 Jones, respectively. This defect related interface engineering provides a feasible strategy for the development of high-performance 0D/1D heterojunction photodetectors.},

The channel lengths ( ⁠ L c ⁠ ) for investigated nanoscale spin-FETs are shorter than 6 nm. The spin transport properties of these nanoscale spin-FETs are subsequently studied by using the nonequilibrium Green&#39;s function method in combination with density functional theory. Due to the strong electronic coupling at the interfaces between electrodes and channel, p-type Ohmic contacts are obtained for spin down.

Very-low subthreshold swing (SS) values below 60 mV/dec are found for spin-FETs with L c ≥ 4.05 nm, and the lowest SS value is 39 mV/dec for the spin-FET with L c = 5.75 nm. At room temperature, the values of MR exceed 10 6 % ⁠ , and the corresponding SS values are below 92 mV/dec with a minimum SS of 82 mV/dec, still demonstrating high performance for designed nanoscale spin-FETs.

This technique utilizes a nano-transistor as a thermometer, placed in close proximity to the inversion layer under investigation, enabling measurements of the electron temperature for values above approximately 10 K. When applied to Joule-heating experiments, this method reveals a notable discrepancy between the measurement results and predictions made by the conventional theory based on the deformation-potential coupling with low-energy acoustic phonons. Specifically, the injected-power dependence of the electron temperature is much weaker than expected.

For LIM circuits, the complementary structure is desirable for low-power consumption. To date, there have been rare reports on the n-channel organic thin-film transistor nonvolatile memories (OTFT-NVMs), which is indispensable for building the complementary LIM circuits. In this Letter, we demonstrate a route to achieve the low-voltage operatable n-channel OTFT-NVMs, by blade-coating an ultrathin tetratetracontane buffer layer on the oxygen plasma treated ferroelectric terpolymer insulator with a low coercive field. The n-channel OTFT-NVMs exhibit good performances, with a high electron mobility over 0.1 cm 2 /V s, highly reliable endurance over 1000 cycles, and highly stable retention over 10 000 s. The mechanism for improving device performances is discussed. Moreover, the mechanism and the route for improving performances are also suitable for p-channel OTFT-NVMs. Furthermore, the LIM architecture-based complementary organic inverters are constructed by integrating the n-channel and p-channel OTFT-NVMs, which can well perform logic and memory operations at the low voltage of 10 V.

  abstract     = {Improving the energy storage density of dielectric capacitors, which are widely used in power electronic devices, is a continuous challenge. In this work, a site-selection multi-element co-doping strategy was used by doping Pr atoms at the A-site and then doping Mn atoms at the B-site in bismuth-based layered perovskite-like structure prototype ferroelectrics Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 due to its large polarization and high Curie temperature. On the one hand, the substitution of Bi 3+ with Pr 3+ at the A-site introduces significant cation disorder, which disrupts the long-range ferroelectric order, consequently leading to a reduction in remnant polarization. On the other hand, the substitution of Ti 4+ by Mn 4+ at the B-site results in delayed polarization saturation due to the different electronic configurations between d 3 Mn 4+ and d 0 Ti 4+ . In addition, the leakage current of the thin film exhibits a continuous decrease with doping concentration, which can be attributed to microstructural modifications including reduced grain size and the formation of amorphous regions, consequently leading to an enhanced breakdown field. Finally, a recoverable energy storage density of 42.1 J cm −3 and an efficiency of 69.9% were obtained for the BPT film, and a recoverable energy storage density of 81.8 J cm −3 and an efficiency of 73% were achieved in the BPTM film. The enhanced energy storage density can be attributed to the synergistic effect of co-doping of A- and B-sites on polarization and breakdown. Besides, the doped films have excellent frequency, temperature, and cycling stability. This work provides a guide to substantially enhance dielectric energy storage by a site-selection multi-element co-doping strategy.},

We compare the effects of bipolar and unipolar electric fields applied in the reverse poling direction, analyzing the changes in permittivity and piezoelectric resonance. Piezoresponse force microscopy is employed to characterize domain configurations in poled and electrically depoled samples. Our findings suggest that property degradation may arise from the nucleation and growth of domains oriented opposite to the initial arrangement.},

  abstract     = {Flexible magnetoelectric composite devices have exceptional features and potential in peculiar scenes. However, maintaining the magnetoelectric response under extreme bending conditions remains a challenge. Polyvinylidene fluoride-based polymers, possessing favorable piezoelectric properties and high flexibility, provide a viable solution for magnetoelectric composites. This work constructed multiferroic core-shell nanoparticle-embedded flexible membranes and achieved a retainable high magnetoelectric (ME) coupling coefficient in the curved composite materials. A maximum ME coefficient of 74 mV cm −1 Oe −1 was obtained, far higher than the 0–3 ME nanocomposites reported thus far. The ME coefficient can be maintained above 40 mV cm −1 Oe −1 when the bending angle is less than 90° and expresses high sensitivity within the H dc range of 100–2400 Oe. Based on crystal structure analysis and phase-field simulation, the synergy magnetoelectric effects accounting for the multiferroic core-shell nanoparticles, copolymer matrix, and magnetic cores contribute to the promoted ME coefficient in the flexible composites. This work provides a feasible pathway for next-generation flexible devices in the wearable and portable fields.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) materials offer vast potential for designing ferroelectrics with desired properties through simple layer stacking. Here, based on first principles, we demonstrate that the vdW layered crystals RuX 2 (X = Cl, Br, and I) are a class of 2D multiferroic sliding ferroelectrics. The stacking of two magnetic RuX 2 monolayers with the same orientation breaks the spatial inversion symmetry, resulting in a stable vertical polarization. In addition, the direction of polarization can be reversed through slight interlayer sliding, in which it only needs to overcome the small energy barrier of 7.16 meV. Among these layered crystals, the bilayer RuI 2 not only possesses a remarkable sliding ferroelectricity of 0.49 pC/m but also exhibits stable long-range magnetic order due to its large magnetic anisotropy energy. When the RuI 2 stack is increased to trilayers, the polarization significantly increases to 1.03 pC/m, which is much larger than that of its bilayer structure. Furthermore, the application of compressive strain results in a substantial increase in vertical polarization. This work provides an efficient method for designing 2D multiferroic sliding ferroelectric materials by stack engineering.},

However, no superconducting diodes reported in the literature have a forward current carrying capacity exceeding 1 A, and hence are not suitable for use in superconducting power applications. Here, we present a high- T c superconducting diode that leverages permanent magnets to induce an asymmetry in the critical current of a superconducting coated conductor upon current reversal. The magnets are arranged to replicate the self-field of the conductor at I c ⁠ , causing constructive or destructive interference with the transport current&#39;s self-field depending on the current direction. This interference generates asymmetric internal magnetic field distributions, leading to the directional suppression of the critical current density and a diode effect. We demonstrate Δ I c values &gt; 150 A and a half-wave transformer rectifier using a single high- T c flux diode submerged in liquid nitrogen, which rectifies 30 A into a 220 μ H superconducting magnet.},

  abstract     = {Spin transport across an interface in energy-efficient spintronic devices, especially for spin–orbit torque applications, has sparked interest in the spintronics community. Here, we employ a rare-earth metal spacer Dy to modify the interface of a Py-based heterostructure, with the aim of modulating the spin dynamics of the system and thereby controlling the spin–orbit torques. As the thickness of Dy increases, it is found that the saturation magnetization of Py/Dy decreases and eventually reaches a plateau, suggesting the induced magnetic moment of Dy that aligns opposite to the Fe and Ni moments. Such a self-assembled antiferromagnetic interface can be destroyed by the insertion of a Cu layer between Py and Dy. Utilizing this interface effect, an additional spin dissipation is observed by enhancement of spin dynamic damping, which has achieved a high spin mixing conductance at the interface of Py/Dy according to spin pumping theory. Utilizing the Py/Dy interface, an unconventional in-plane field-like torque spin–orbit torque (SOT) in a Py/Dy/Pt structure is achieved, while the field-like SOT efficiency experiences a notable enhancement in the Py/Dy/Pt system. By optimizing the interface between the Dy layer and Pt, it is possible to further enhance the performance and efficiency of the devices, thereby promoting the development of spintronic devices. This discovery has significant implications for the future design of low-power spintronic devices.},

At ambient pressure, MnF 2 in the rutile structure displays antiferromagnetic properties along with significant altermagnetic characteristics. Upon increasing pressure, MnF 2 undergoes sequential phase transitions from the rutile structure to the SrI 2 -type structure and further to the α-PbCl 2 -type structure. Under high pressure, all three structures of MnF 2 exhibit stable altermagnetism, with the maximum spin splitting of 307.5 meV at 3 GPa for the rutile structure, 133.6 meV at 12 GPa for the SrI 2 -type structure, and 58.4 meV at 20 GPa for the α-PbCl 2 -type structure. Additionally, our findings suggest that the magnitude of spin splitting can be effectively controlled by modulating the antiferromagnetic exchange interactions and the electron hopping parameters between sublattices.

  abstract     = {High-performance artificial synaptic devices that emulate the functions of biological synapses are crucial for advancing energy-efficient brain-inspired computing systems. Current studies predominantly focus on memristive devices, which achieve synaptic functions through nonvolatile electric current-assisted carrier modulation. However, these methods often suffer from excessive energy consumption. Here, a type of low-energy-consumption artificial synapse based on strain-mediated electric-field control of magnetic skyrmion&#39;s radius is demonstrated, where the energy consumption is 10 fJ per state and the non-volatility is achieved by local ferroelectric domain switching under bipolar electric fields. The proposed skyrmion-based synaptic device can replicate essential synaptic behaviors, including long-term potentiation (LTP), long-term depression (LTD), paired-pulse facilitation, paired-pulse depression, and spiking-time-dependent plasticity, aligning it closely with the biological synaptic system. The synaptic weight change and non-linearity of the artificial synapse are emulated by modulating the magnetic skyrmion&#39;s radius through precisely engineering the applied electric-field pulses. Simulation using the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database reveals that the pattern recognition rate decreases exponentially with increasing LTP/LTD non-linearity, quantifying the effect of the LTP/LTD non-linearity on the pattern recognition rate. This work underscores the potential of strain-mediated electric-field control of single skyrmion&#39;s radius as a groundbreaking approach for developing high density and low-energy consumption artificial synaptic devices.},

Using super-Nyquist sampling magneto-optical Kerr effect microscopy and micromagnetic simulations, we demonstrate that these resonators can induce a π phase shift in the transmitted spin wave. The phase shift is highly sensitive to the magnetization alignment within the resonator, allowing for on-demand control via magnetic switching.

Realization of such schemes necessitates the development of device analogs to biological neurons and synapses. Particularly, in spin-based artificial synapses, the spin–orbit torque (SOT) can be utilized for changing between multiple resistance states of the synapse. In this work, we demonstrate synaptic behavior, namely long-term potentiation and long-term depression in a ferrimagnet (GdFe) via SOT generated using a heavy metal (Pt). The dependence of the synapse-like output on the input parameters is extensively investigated. Synaptic arrays based on experimental results are simulated and used to perform the classification of a handwritten digit dataset. Correlating the classification accuracy with the experimentally observed synaptic behavior, the performance of the synapse is found to depend on the critical switching currents. Understanding the correlation between the input parameters and synaptic performance could accelerate the development of artificial spintronic synapses possessing high operation speed, nonvolatility and plasticity, thereby enabling efficient compute in-memory systems in the near future.},

Herein, we report the high-frequency magnetic properties of the modified Ba 5 Cu 2- x Ni x Ti 3 Fe 12 O 31 (Cu–Ni 18H) ferrites, achieving a relatively high permeability of 1.6 and a low magnetic loss of 0.05 at 6 GHz, which is much better than previous reports. Such excellent performance is attributed to the expanded mono-domain critical size and reduced damping of magnetic moment precession. Moreover, deploying Cu–Ni 18H ferrites as a substrate on a patch antenna working at 6 GHz can reduce the antenna dimensions to 35% of traditional commercial materials. The present work provides a proven and promising candidate material for 5G communications and expands the research landscape for the high-frequency magnetic properties of microwave ferrites.},

  abstract     = {Large interfacial perpendicular magnetocrystalline anisotropy (iPMA) and low Gilbert magnetic damping constant ( ⁠ α ⁠ ) in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) are desired to achieve higher storage density and lower standby power operations in magnetic random-access memory. This work theoretically investigates effects of nitrogen and fluoride anions (N-anion and F-anion) substitution on the MgO barrier interface of Fe/MgO/Fe MTJ for iPMA and α using first-principles calculations. We find that the N-anion substitution significantly enhances iPMA by four times and reduces α by 65% compared to the pristine Fe/MgO/Fe, indicating a guideline toward an MTJ with large iPMA and low α simultaneously. The mechanism is explained by a band realignment at the Fermi level ( E F ) where Fe d ±1 ( d xz ,d yz ) orbitals at the interface are pushed above and below E F but Fe d ±2 ( d xy , d x 2 −y 2 ) orbitals remain at E F by the N-anion substitution.},

  abstract     = {The optimization of physical parameters serves various purposes in device development, including in system identification and efficiency. Spin-torque oscillators have been experimentally and theoretically applied to neuromorphic computing, but their physical parameters are usually optimized via grid search procedures. In this paper, we propose a scheme to optimize the dynamics parameters of macrospin-type spin-torque oscillators using the gradient descent method with automatic differentiation. First, we numerically create dynamic data for teaching and tune the parameters to reproduce the dynamics. This approach can be applied to determine the correspondence between spin-torque oscillator simulations and experiments. Next, we solve an image recognition task with high accuracy by connecting a coupled system of spin-torque oscillators to the input and output layers and training all of them through gradient descent. Combining this approach with experimentation makes it possible to design an experimental setup and physical system to solve a task with high precision using a spin-torque oscillator.},

  abstract     = {This study systematically investigates the optimization mechanism of NaClO solution treatment on Mo substrates for enhancing the optoelectronic performance of CZTSSe thin film solar cells. Experimental results demonstrate that a 10 s NaClO soaking forms a “spike-like” texture on the Mo surface, increasing the average surface roughness difference from 34.52 to 77.75 nm. This significantly enhances light scattering, particularly for photons reaching the back Mo electrode, thereby extending the optical path and promoting photon reabsorption. Additionally, the roughened Mo surface improves the wettability of the precursor solution (contact angle decreases from 19.3° to 12.7°), facilitating the formation of larger CZTSSe grains. Electrical characterization reveals that the NaClO-treated Mo substrate significantly reduces the density of negative charge traps at CZTSSe grain boundaries (contact potential difference increases from −1.1 V to −263 mV), suppressing hole recombination and optimizing carrier collection efficiency. The spike-like structure of the Mo surface also shortens the transport path of hole carriers generated by short-wavelength light, further enhancing collection efficiency. Ultimately, the PCE of CZTSSe devices based on the Mo-10 substrate increases from 9.34% to 11.07%, attributed to the reduction in R s and J 0 . This study highlights the critical role of a back electrode interface microstructure design in synergistically optimizing light absorption and carrier transport.},

However, challenges remain in synthesizing high-quality crystals with low defect concentrations, high homogeneous thermal conductivity, and high yields using the conventional chemical vapor transport method. In this study, we report the synthesis of high-yield c -BAs single crystals using the Bridgman method. The crystals exhibit high uniformity, reduced defect densities, and lower carrier concentrations as confirmed through x-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, temperature-dependent photoluminescence, and electrical transport measurements.

  abstract     = {In this study, we report on the intentional nitrogen doping of plasma-assisted MBE (PAMBE)-grown (010) β -Ga 2 O 3 films by generating the growth plasma with an O 2 and N 2 gas mixture. A nitrogen doping range of 1.3 × 10 18 to 4.5 × 10 19 cm −3 was achieved. The nitrogen doping profiles have top-hat shapes with sharp turn-on and turn-off. Nitrogen doping was found to have a negligible impact on surface morphology. Nitrogen incorporation was unaffected by gallium flux and growth temperatures over a large growth window. An incorporation dependence on plasma power and total gas flow rate was observed. This was attributed to the N 2 triple bond strength compared to the O 2 double bond strength, which makes N 2 harder to crack in the plasma source. Increasing the plasma power from 140 to 230 W increased nitrogen incorporation by 1.6×, while increasing the total gas flow rate from 0.8 to 2.0 sccm decreased incorporation by 3.2×. The compensation effect of nitrogen was verified by characterizing effective carrier concentration in conducting tin and nitrogen co-doped films. A 2.1 V built-in voltage was extracted from a nitrogen-doped, n − junction device using CV measurements. The device was found to exhibit rectifying behavior with a 100 A/cm 2 current density at 2.9 V. The junction demonstrated here can play a key role in field management and electrostatic engineering for β -Ga 2 O 3 -based power devices. Overall, the controllability of PAMBE nitrogen doping and the properties of nitrogen-doped films suggest PAMBE-grown, nitrogen-doped layers have promising power device applications.},

  abstract     = {Electron paramagnetic resonance of Cr 3+ ions in β -Ga 2 O 3 is investigated using terahertz spectroscopic ellipsometry under magnetic field sweeping, a technique that enables the polarization resolving capabilities of ellipsometry for magnetic resonance measurements. We employed a single-crystal chromium-doped β -Ga 2 O 3 sample, grown by the Czochralski method, and performed ellipsometry measurements at magnetic field strengths ranging from 2 to 8 T, at frequencies from 82 to 125 and 190 to 230 GHz, and at a temperature of 15 K. Analysis of the frequency-field diagrams derived from all Mueller matrix elements allowed us to differentiate between the effects of electron spin Zeeman splitting and zero-field splitting and to accurately determine the anisotropic Zeeman splitting g -tensor and the zero-field splitting parameters. Our results confirm that Cr 3+ ions predominantly substitute into octahedral gallium sites. Line shape analysis of Mueller matrix element spectra using the Bloch–Brillouin model provides the spin volume concentration of Cr 3+ sites, showing very good agreement with results from chemical analysis by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy and suggesting minimal occupation of sites with inactive electron paramagnetic resonance. This study enhances our understanding of the magnetic and electronic properties of chromium-doped β -Ga 2 O 3 and demonstrates the effectiveness of high-frequency/high-field electron paramagnetic resonance generalized spectroscopic ellipsometry for characterizing defects in ultrawide-bandgap semiconductors.},

Typically, time constants are measured by expensive, ultra-fast instruments with high temporal resolution. Instead, here, we demonstrate an alternate, inexpensive, cyclostationary measurement technique to characterize self-heating (and cooling) with sub-microsecond resolution.

However, a bottleneck also existed in LDs with extremely steep interfaces, where the diode characteristics could not be obtained due to the device&#39;s high resistance. This study highlights the trade-off between the steepness of the interfaces in the AlGaN heterostructure and diode performance, indicating the need for further optimization to achieve high-performance UV-B LDs.

The inclusion-induced internal stress decreased exponentially along the radial direction. However, the internal stress, though reduced to a small magnitude, was unexpectedly maintained and propagated over long distances. A stress localization phenomenon, which was out of the prediction of classic elasticity theory, was also observed. The inclination of threading dislocations was found to be substantially influenced by the unreported distribution of internal stress. Four characteristic dislocation inclination patterns were identified: the two-short-tooth pattern, two-long-tooth pattern, gear pattern, and sun-like pattern. The dependence of internal stress on the dislocation inclination pattern was revealed. Based on this dependence, a method to predict the stress field in crystal based on dislocation pattern without corrosion was proposed.},

However, current assessments of MNGPNs thermal management performance are primarily conducted under laboratory static conditions, which do not fully represent the complex overload environments encountered in practical applications. In this study, we conducted strain freezing experiments using a split Hopkinson pressure bar and performed recovery analysis to investigate the influence of dynamic loading on thermal behavior through postmortem microstructural characterizations. Our findings reveal significant thermodynamic coupling effects in the in-plane direction, while coupling effects in the out-of-plane direction were less apparent. Specifically, the increase in internal thermal resistance under impact loading, due to the cracking, shedding, and directional changes in the graphene structure, diminishes the heat transfer capacity of MNGPNs in the in-plane direction. Alternations in interfacial thermal resistance caused by the layer compression and shedding affect the out-of-plane heat transfer capacity. Furthermore, the thermal behavior of MNGPNs was validated through heat dissipation experiments.

  abstract     = {Plastic crystals have large entropy change during first-order phase transitions due to strong molecular orientation disorder and volume changes. This feature has revived interest in plastic crystals, as they have great potential in solid-state refrigeration applications induced by external pressure. However, the reversible barocaloric effect in most plastic crystals does not compare favorably with their isothermal entropy change. Here, we demonstrate that controlling the particle size of the plastic crystal KPF 6 can help achieve a compromise between the phase transition resistance at grain boundaries and the phase transition correlation within grains and induce a giant reversible barocaloric effect at low pressure. In particular, the 75–150 μ m plastic crystal KPF 6 displays the lowest thermal hysteresis, with a giant reversible barocaloric entropy change of 50.0 J · kg −1 · K −1 under a pressure change of 40 MPa. The reversible barocaloric effect can be more than doubled by simply optimizing the microstructures of the plastic crystal KPF 6 . Our work provides an effective way to enhance the reversible barocaloric effect in plastic crystal materials. We also give insight into the physical mechanism that enhances the reversible barocaloric effect through transmission electron microscopy analysis.},

  abstract     = {Chalcogenide perovskites with distorted structures, such as BaZrS 3 and SrZrS 3 , are promising photovoltaic materials due to their high stability, strong absorption, and excellent electrical transport properties. Researchers have explored BaZr 1- x Ti x S 3 and BaZrS 3- x Se x alloys to reduce their band gaps, allowing them to absorb lower-energy photons. However, the hexagonal structures of BaTiS 3 and BaZrSe 3 , along with the incompatibility of Ti or Se atoms in BaZrS 3 , lead to phase separation in these alloys. In this work, using EuZrS 3 and Sr 0.7 Eu 0.3 ZrS 3 alloys as examples, we demonstrate that the band structure of chalcogenide perovskites can be tuned by using Eu as the A-site cation. In EuZrS 3 , the Eu 4f orbitals contribute to the valence band maximum, thereby raising the valence band and resulting in a narrow bandgap of 0.54 eV. Furthermore, due to the structural and atomic compatibility of Eu with SrZrS 3 , the Sr 1- x Eu x ZrS 3 alloy is designed to fine-tune the band structures of both SrZrS 3 and EuZrS 3 . EuZrS 3 also exhibits typical semiconducting characteristics, making it promising for potential optoelectronic devices.},

The clean tips with a radius of curvature less than 100 nm were reproducibly obtained by applying the sinusoidal voltage in the frequency ( ⁠ f 0 ⁠ ) of 900 Hz ≤ f 0 ≤ 1500 Hz with amplitude modulation by the sinusoidal wave in the modulation frequency ( ⁠ f s ⁠ ) of f s = 0.1 f 0 in CaCl 2 /H 2 O/acetone solution. The analyses by scanning electron microscopy with an energy-dispersive x-ray analyzer and atom probe tomography showed that a uniform Pt/Ir alloy was exposed on the tip surface as a clean surface without O or Cl contamination. The scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) imaging using the fabricated tip showed that it is more suitable for investigating rough surfaces than conventional as-cut tips and applicable for atomic-resolution imaging. Furthermore, we applied the fabricated tip to qPlus atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis in liquid and showed that it has atomic resolution in both the horizontal and vertical directions. Therefore, it is concluded that the amplitude-modulated AC etching method reproducibly provides sharp STM/AFM tips capable of both atomic resolution and large-area analyses without complex etching setups.},

However, the strong coupling of BICs with quantum emitters in single-particle systems has not been reported. In this paper, we propose a dielectric nanodisk integrated with a monolayer of transition metal dichalcogenides. A supercavity mode known as Friedrich–Wintgen BIC is launched in the nanodisk to enable strong coupling of BIC with WS 2 excitons. We demonstrate that the reduction in coupling strength as the quasi-BIC quality factor increases is due to a decrease in the number of excitons participating in the coupling. Additionally, the coupling strength can be manipulated by adjusting the shape and aspect ratio of the nanoresonators, enabling a transition from strong to weak coupling regimes. Near-field analysis shows that the manipulation of the BIC–exciton interaction arises from the overlap of the BIC mode&#39;s near-field with the excitons. Our findings offer a promising strategy for manipulating light–matter interactions and enhance the potential applications of BIC resonances in photonics.},

This reconfigurability is achieved through engineering angular dispersion at electric and magnetic Mie-type resonances. The customized metasurface exhibits an angle-dependent transmittance profile in the amorphous state of Sb 2 S 3 meta-atoms for efficient isotropic edge detection, and an angle-independent profile in the crystalline state for uniform bright-field imaging.

The excitation of Mie modes of different orders in nanowires causes TMOKE enhancement. The in-plane magnetic dipole mode leads to the largest TMOKE enhancement compared to other Mie modes. Changing the width of silicon nanowires entails a modification of that mode, thereby ensuring tailoring of the TMOKE within the range of 2.2%–3.8%. This tunability is associated with the modification of the near-field localized at the Si/Ni interface and the far-field response of the excited magnetic dipole mode. Adjusting these two quantities allows one to achieve the highest values of the TMOKE caused by individual Mie modes in silicon nanowires.},

Solutions are thus not necessarily bound to wave functions physically realizable by the optical system. A method is presented to characterize reconstructed probes by conventional lens aberrations. The fitted aberrations are then used to investigate the quality of the retrieved probes, and their consistency is examined in a systematic study using a 4D-STEM focal series recorded for a thin SnS 2 2D flake. Additionally, the influences of partial coherence and limited electron dose on the retrieved probes are analyzed, and the usefulness of the retrieved probes for different ptychographic methods, such as single sideband, Wigner distribution deconvolution ptychography, and gradient descent-based schemes, is elucidated.

Conventional methods for achieving this property often rely on additional organic coatings to lower the surface energy; however, they are very prone to chemical decomposition and even flaking during practical usages. Here, we demonstrated that the laser-induced phase transition in hierarchical structures of metal surface can act as an effective approach to directly produce the superhydrophobic effect without any organic decorations. Through gradual increasing numbers of the femtosecond laser processing, we transfer the surface structures from the initial polycrystalline material into the super-nanometer-sized dual-phase and three-phase material that consists of nano and para-crystallinity embedded in amorphous substance, both of which contribute to lowering the surface energy. Meanwhile, the geometrical profiles of the surface structures become richer and more complicated for improving the stability of air pockets. Remarkably, it is found that both the mechanical and chemical durability of such superhydrophobic surfaces are enhanced significantly for the three-phase based material. This study describes the great value of the metal phase transition in achieving the inherent superhydrophobic properties, which provides a different route to develop high-performance coating-free superhydrophobic surfaces.},

Within this bandgap, where the QDs preferably emitted right-handed circularly polarized light, we observed a distinct cavity mode peak characterized by left-handed circular polarization (CP). This observation indicates that the chiral PhC modifies the optical density of states for left-handed circular polarization to be suppressed in the polarization bandgap and be largely enhanced at the cavity mode. The results obtained may not only provide photonic devices such as compact circularly polarized light sources but also promote strong coupling between circularly polarized photons and excitons in solid states or molecules, paving the way for advancements in polaritonics, spintronics, and quantum information technology.},

The maximum responsivity of 4.7 mA/W (−1.8 mA/W) under the UV (IR) illumination and fast response time (19.6/36.8 μ s) are achieved. Dual-band optoelectronic logic operations, including OR, AND, NOR, NOT, and NAND, are realized with a single photodetector by precisely regulating the UV and IR illumination. This work paves an approach for the development of visible-blind bipolar photodetection and all-in-one optoelectronic logic gates.},

  abstract     = {The ideal combination of high sensitivity and fast response speed is crucial for advanced photodetectors. Herein, we present a normally-off, visible-blind ultraviolet (UV) AlGaN/GaN phototransistor featuring a fluorine-ion-implanted trench gate structure. This design effectively disrupts the conductive channel of the AlGaN/GaN heterostructure, drastically reducing the dark current to the magnitude of 0.1 pA. The trench structure enhances the localized electric field in the confined gate region, significantly improving UV detection sensitivity. Additionally, the finite electric field enhancement induced from fluorine ions (F − ions) accelerates the establishment of photogenerated electron channels. Consequently, the phototransistor exhibits ultrafast response speed, with rise and decay times of 1.5 and 6.7 μ s, respectively, along with an exceptional specific detectivity of 3.45 × 10 16 cm·Hz 1/2 W −1 . The detection of weak UV light reaches as low as 76.0 nW/cm 2 . This remarkable detection capability allows the device to perform high-fidelity single-pixel imaging and facilitates real-time UV communication. The proposed AlGaN/GaN phototransistor, characterized by a straightforward fabrication process and excellent photoresponse performance, presents enticing prospects for multiple performance compatible optoelectronic devices.},

In addition, light beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) allow studies of light–matter interactions mediated by OAM couplings. In this work, we present an alternative approach to generating high-order harmonic vortices using elegant Laguerre–Gaussian (eLG) beams. We examine the spatiotemporal characteristics of these harmonic vortices in the far-field regime and demonstrate how the low divergence of eLG beams makes them suitable for producing extreme ultraviolet (XUV) twisted attosecond pulses. Additionally, by solving the far-field Fraunhofer integral, we analyze the influence of azimuthal and radial indices on the spatial profile of vortex beams, thereby exploring the impact of larger topological charges. This study extends the concept of harmonic vortices generated by Laguerre–Gaussian beams to applications beyond the paraxial approximation.},

The array is grown in the pores of an anodic aluminum oxide membrane by the solid-state dewetting process. Control over the nanoparticle size and spacing between particles was achieved by sequential metal deposition and annealing processes, yielding nanoparticles with diameters ( D ) ranging from 50 to 70 nm and corresponding interparticle distances ranging from 12 to 30 nm. The advantage of this technique is that the nanoparticle size, spherical shape, and hexagonal close-packed ordering of the array can be precisely controlled, allowing for fine tuning of the plasmonic absorption properties. The important parameters that determine the size, shape, and distribution of nanoparticles in the array are the template morphology (dimple geometry) and the thickness of the evaporated metal layer. Above a certain critical film thickness, the nanoparticles coalesce to form nano-islands. The significance of this work is that it provides a reliable technique to assemble metal nanoparticles into high density arrays, with good control over particle shape and distribution. Such arrays can be used to generate highly concentrated electromagnetic fields for plasmonic sensor applications.},

This work aims to investigate the effect of substituting Fe on the thermoelectric properties of the CTS system. It is found that the electrical conductivity enhanced after Fe substitution due to the simultaneous enhancement of carrier concentration, as well as a reduced bandgap from 0.88 to 0.5 eV. The high power factor of ∼514 μ W/mK 2 was obtained for the Cu 2 Sn 0.7 Fe 0.3 S 3 sample. The Fe substitution generated different types of phonon scatterings, such as mass fluctuation scattering arising from the difference in atomic mass of Sn and Fe and strain field scattering as a result of size and interatomic coupling force difference between Sn and Fe. Accordingly, the Fe-substituted CTS samples obtained the thermal conductivity of 0.45 W/mK at 753 K. In addition, the density functional theory calculations reveal that the substitution of Fe in Cu 2 SnS 3 significantly alters the electronic structure and reduces the bandgap, resulting in enhanced electrical conductivity and power factor, thereby a high zT of ∼0.5 is obtained in Cu 2 Sn 0.7 Fe 0.3 S 3 .},

This transition in temperature corresponds to the cathode&#39;s transition from the so-called spot mode to the plume mode. The electron Mach number is found to be between 0.2 and 0.8 for all flow rates. The scaling of the Mach number with the ratio of electron temperature to ion temperature is examined, which reveals a non-monotonic relationship that can be approximately described by the assumption of marginally stable wave growth. The possibility of leveraging this assumption as a zero-equation closure for the electron fluid equations is discussed in the context of past experiments.},

Traditional methods like optical tweezers and dielectrophoresis often require complex setups, making them less suitable for scalable laboratory-on-a-chip (LOC) systems. While strain-mediated magnetoelectric (ME) micro-motors offer a promising alternative, they are limited by a 45° rotation when using planar electrode systems, the complexity of multi-electrode systems for rotations beyond 45°, and the lower thermal stability of symmetrical ferromagnetic (FM) rings or disks. This work introduces a ME-based LOC device that incorporates strain-mediated micro-magnetic motors, utilizing shape-anisotropic FM elliptical rings on a ferroelectric substrate to achieve MB rotations up to 90° experimentally with a simple planar electrode system. The inherent high thermal stability of elliptical FM rings enables this rotation without the need for multi-electrode designs. Micromagnetic simulations are employed to identify the optimal elliptical ring structures that generate the localized stray magnetic fields necessary for trapping and rotating MBs. Effective single MB trapping with optimized MB concentrations and flow rates is demonstrated with 40 % capture probability. Under an applied electric field of 0.8 MV/m, a 90 o rotation is achieved for a 1.5 μ m wide elliptical ring, closely aligning with micromagnetic modeling results. The ability to achieve 90° MB rotation without complicated experimental setup opens possibilities for critical biotechnology applications, such as photothermal and hyperthermia therapy, where the thermally stable, highly shape-anisotropic FMs in ME-based LOC devices could be transformative.},

  abstract     = {Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in phosphorus-doped diamond have potential applications in quantum technologies because their electron spin has the longest spin coherence time among those in solid systems at room temperature (RT) and because their negative charge state is more stable than that in undoped diamond. However, the conventional phosphorus source, phosphine, is toxic and explosive; a safer precursor is therefore preferred. We consequently attempted to synthesize phosphorus-doped diamonds using tert -butylphosphine (TBP), which has lower toxicity and explosivity than phosphine. However, controlling phosphorus incorporation during doping with TBP is difficult because it condenses easily and remains in the synthesis reactor due to its low boiling point. Here, we report controlling the incorporation of impurities by optimizing the synthesis conditions, such as the synthesis pressure. Comparing diamonds synthesized at 15 and 50 kPa reveals that the phosphorus concentration was reduced by 93% and the nitrogen concentration by 72% in the diamond synthesized at 50 kPa. For diamonds prepared under optimized conditions in our synthesis reactor, a long spin coherence time ( T 2 = 2.23 ms) for NV centers with almost perfect selective alignment of the NV axes was achieved. The T 2 was comparable to the longest reported length for NV centers in a sample synthesized with phosphine, indicating that TBP is a promising phosphorus source for obtaining NV centers with excellent properties. We also achieved high electron mobility [580 cm 2 /(V s) at RT] in diamonds synthesized with TBP; this value is comparable to that for diamonds synthesized with phosphine.},

Using experimental data and simulations, we show that the ICTA has near-quantum-limited noise as long as low-frequency voltage noise, expressed as broadening of the Josephson frequency line, is narrower than the amplification bandwidth. We observe a gain of 20 dB across a 11 MHz bandwidth with noise below 1.7 times the quantum limit when the full width at half maximum of the Josephson frequency linewidth is 5.6 MHz.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic heating by alternating magnetic field (AMF) is a fascinating solution to break the bottleneck in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst improvement. However, practical applications of AMF in electrochemistry are always impeded by the inherent characteristics of the catalyst (i.e., non-magnetic nature and oxidizable feature). Here, a self-heating working electrode substrate of C/Fe 3 O 4 /C is proposed to be fabricated, on which non-magnetic Ru nanoparticles confined within the amorphous carbon matrix are deposited as the catalytic layer. Under AMF, magnetic Fe 3 O 4 particle can be stimulated and generate the magnetic heating associated with Néel relaxation, which improves the OER efficiency of Ru nanoparticles with the overpotential at 10 mA cm −2 reduced by 72 mV. Together with the high stability rendered by confined structure, the exploitation of AMF on non-magnetic catalyst is confirmed, and the developed strategy offers a general pathway to advance OER catalyst performance in the future.},

  abstract     = {Harvesting wideband and random vibration energy in the vehicle environment is a promising route to power mobile electronic devices. Conventional energy harvesters cannot realize steady-state output, making the energy management circuit design difficult. This work presents an electromagnetic harvester with a counterweight unit, a gearbox, and a generator, which can be adapted to wideband automatic energy storage and quantized output release. The counterweight unit with the low-frequency response can effectively sense the weak vibration. The coil spring in the energy storage gear train is in particular used to store low-frequency random vibration energy in the environment and release the energy stored by the coil spring by switching the gear train. Finally, the coil spring drives the generating gear train to realize the steady-state output of mechanical energy to electrical energy. At a frequency of 2.5 Hz and an acceleration of 0.4 g, the average output power of the automatic energy storage and steady-state output release energy harvester (ASSR) by using a coil spring to first store energy and then quantize the output is 114.5 times higher than that of the method of continuous generating without using a coil spring. The ASSR&#39;s energy output can charge the lithium battery (3.7 V, 40 mAh) from 2.6 to 3.716 V during a 60 km ride at an average speed of 12.7 km/h while powering the mobile phones and Bluetooth devices continuously through the energy management circuit.

Also, the power generation characteristics were readily adjusted by the flow channel forming the Venturi effect without modifying the PWVEH structure. So, the VE-PWVEH could possess both great power-generating capability at low wind speed and strong robustness at high wind speed. The results demonstrated that both the output voltage and cut-in wind speed were affected by the attack angle of two rectangular plates used for stimulating the constricted channel. There was an optimal attack angle of 60° where a maximum peak voltage of the VE-PWVEH was increased by 621% and the cut-in wind speed was reduced by 171% compared with the harvester without the Venturi effect. Besides, it demonstrated the VE-PWVEH could achieve an output power of 0.863 mW and illuminate about 120 blue LEDs in series. The introduction of the Venturi effect provides a simple and viable method of flow field disturbance to tune the performance of PWVEHs.},

However, the output voltage of the present TMDC-based WTEGs remains at a relatively low level. In this study, we precisely modulate the electronic structure of titanium disulfide (TiS 2 ) nanosheets in a restacked film by surface modification, leading to the decoupling phenomenon of a simultaneous rise in the electrical conductivity and the Seebeck coefficient. This method enhances the thermoelectric power factor by approximately 14 times compared to pre-modified samples. We fabricated a flexible self-reassembly WTEG using 1T-phase molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) nanosheets as p -type material and modified TiS 2 nanosheets as an n -type material.

To understand the process of flagellar bundling, especially propulsion force generation, we develop a multi-functional macroscopic experimental system and employ advanced numerical simulations for verification. Flagellar arrangements and phase differences between helices are investigated, revealing the variation in propulsion contributions from individual helices. Numerically, we build a time-dependent model to match the bundling process and study the influence of hydrodynamic interactions. Surprisingly, it is found that the total propulsion generated by a bundle of two filaments is constant at various phase differences between the helices. However, the difference between the propulsion from each helix is significantly affected by a phase difference, and only one of the helices is responsible for the total propulsion when the phase difference is equal to π ⁠ . Building on our experimental and computational results, we develop a theoretical model considering the propulsion contribution of each filament to better understand microbial locomotion mechanisms, especially the wobbling behavior of the cell. Our work also sheds light on the design and control of artificial microswimmers.},

In the traditional dual-channel SPR sensor structure, it is necessary to coat different metal films on two channels to obtain two independent SPR signals in one probe. In this work, the dopamine hydrochloride was used to separate two resonance peaks. Sensing channel 1 is used as an immunosensing road by using the LSPR effect, coating its surface with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)/IRMOF-3/thiomalic acid and adsorbing rabies virus antigens to enhance the loading of biomolecules on the surface of the sensor and the immune response. The sensing channel 2 adopts a silver film to excite the SPR effect, then the position of the SPR resonance peak is shifted back by dopamine hydrochloride, and, finally, a layer of polydimethylsiloxane is coated as a temperature sensing channel. The results show that the sensitivity of the sensor is 0.504 nm/°C in the temperature range of 30–35 °C, and it has good temperature stability. The high sensitivity detection of rabies virus was achieved in the range of 0.1–10 3 pg/ml. The sensitivity and detection limit are 3.065 nm/(log(pg/ml)) and 0.234 pg/ml, respectively. It performed well in the clinical sample detection. The sensor has a good prospect in the clinical detection of rabies virus.},

The results showed that devices utilizing hybrid-contact architectures exhibit higher output currents and are much less sensitive to variations in barrier height compared to single-contact devices, implying that these devices can more easily achieve consistent electrical properties. Experimentally, hybrid-contact IGZO SBTFTs were fabricated using chemically stable cobalt (Co) as the source/drain electrodes. The devices, utilizing an optimized two-step annealing process, exhibited ultra-small hysteresis and excellent electrical stability under both negative bias illumination temperature stress and positive bias temperature stress.

The effect was observed over a broad temperature range with local piezoresponse spectroscopy in unpoled samples, while no negative piezoresponse was observed when the material was pre-poled. These measurements suggest that the effect, which is promising for power-generation applications, originates from non-ergodic behavior. Complementary macroscale impedance and dielectric constant measurements as a function of temperature and frequency supported the mesoscopic findings.

The phase transition processes in these ceramics differ significantly between static and dynamic compression, presenting a long-standing controversy in the field. This study investigates the phase transition of PZT95/5 under dynamic shock compression using a shock response model. The findings indicate that the dynamic phase transition begins at lower pressures and completes at higher pressures compared to hydrostatic conditions, resulting in a broader pressure range for the phase transition. Theoretical modeling, grounded in ferroelectric and piezoelectric effects, combined with one-dimensional uniaxial stress density functional theory calculations across various orientations and three-dimensional Python visualizations, clarifies the physical mechanisms driving the progressive phase transition of ceramics under dynamic conditions. Additionally, the dynamic phase transition ratio of the ferroelectric material is quantified. Under hydrostatic pressures, the phase transition is independent of grain orientation, resulting in consistent transition pressures across all directions. In contrast, under anisotropic stress, grains with different orientations exhibit varying sensitivity to pressures, leading to distinct transition pressures in each direction. These insights advance the understanding of the phase transition mechanisms governing ferroelectric ceramics under both static and dynamic pressures.},

  abstract     = {Scaling silicon-based transistors to sub-ten-nanometer technology nodes presents significant challenges due to the difficult in achieving both atomic-scale thickness and excellent tunneling performance simultaneously. In this work, we employed first-principles calculations to investigate the dielectric properties of two recently reported van der Waals layered materials, Bi 2 SeO 5 and Bi 2 TeO 5 . Our results reveal that Bi 2 SeO 5 and Bi 2 TeO 5 monolayers exhibit out-of-plane dielectric constant of 15.2 and 7.6, respectively, with in-plane dielectric constant reaching as high as 39.0 and 26.0. To evaluate their potential as gate dielectrics, we calculated the band offsets and equivalent oxide thicknesses (EOTs) of Bi 2 SeO 5 and Bi 2 TeO 5 monolayers. The results show that both materials exhibit favorable band offsets relative to silicon and transition-metal dichalcogenide channel materials, along with low EOT. Finally, we estimated the dielectric leakage current density utilizing Bi 2 SeO 5 and Bi 2 TeO 5 based on a p-doped silicon-channel transistor, predicting a low leakage current (&lt;10 −8 A cm −2 ). Our study provides theoretical insights into the potential application of bismuth selenite and bismuth tellurite monolayers as gate dielectrics in two-dimensional electronics.},

  abstract     = {Topological half-metallic ferromagnets, featured by topologically nontrivial states and fully spin-polarized electronic carriers at the Fermi level, are fertile playgrounds for exploring topo-spintronic applications. However, such exotic compounds are still limited. Here, we systematically study a self-intercalated van der Waals magnet Cr 3 Si 2 Te 6 by combining first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo simulations. We demonstrate that Cr 3 Si 2 Te 6 is thermodynamically stable and a half-metallic ferromagnet with a Curie temperature up to 485 K, much above room temperature. Excitingly, we find that topological nodal lines and Weyl nodes coexist in the Cr 3 Si 2 Te 6 bulk. Correspondingly, the Cr 3 Si 2 Te 6 bulk exhibits a large anomalous Hall conductivity of 160 and 427 Ω − 1 c m − 1 when its magnetization is along its magnetic easy and hard axes, respectively. Moreover, its anomalous Hall conductivity can be increased to 374 (882) Ω − 1 c m − 1 by doping electrons (holes). Finally, we disclose that the 7-layer Cr 3 Si 2 Te 6 thin film possesses half-metallic ferromagnetism with a high T C of 425 K, strong out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy energy, and large anomalous Hall conductivity. Our findings suggest that Cr 3 Si 2 Te 6 is a room-temperature topological half-metallic ferromagnet, which could have promising prospects for practical applications in next-generation topo-spintronic and nanoscale electronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Contrary to the conventional spin current with the in-plane spin polarization, spin current with the out-of-plane spin polarization can achieve efficient all electrical control of perpendicular magnetization by spin–orbit torques (SOTs) without an external magnetic field. This feature is essential for high-density magnetic memory and logic devices. While such spin current with the out-of-plane spin polarization has been demonstrated in a limited number of high-quality low crystal or magnetic symmetry systems, its generation in conventional heavy metal is challenging but crucial for field-free spintronic devices. Here, we show that overcoming this challenge is possible by fabricating a crystalline phase gradient in heavy metal tantalum, where the out-of-plane spin polarization was induced and triggers an out-of-plane SOT providing the field-free switching for perpendicularly magnetized ferromagnet in Pt/Co/Ta (crystalline phase gradient) heterojunction. Meanwhile, the critical switching current density is lower than that of the Pt/Co/Ta (non-crystalline phase gradient) control case, and the polarity of field-free switching is determined by the sign of the crystalline phase gradient. Our work demonstrates that the crystalline phase gradient is a promising platform to generate the spin current with the out-of-plane spin polarization and achieve efficient field-free magnetization switching based on heavy metal tantalum, thus opening an avenue toward energy-efficient spintronic devices.},

Their inherent topological stability, nanoscale size, and efficient manipulation via spin currents make them promising candidates for high-density data storage and advanced computing paradigms. We micromagnetically investigate the nucleation dynamics of magnetic skyrmion pairs excited underneath two 30 nm nanocontacts with varying separations on top of an extended Co/Pt bilayer thin film. At close separation of 100 nm, the magnetization configurations strongly interact, giving rise to the formation of stable merged skyrmion states. As the separation increases beyond 200 nm, topologically distinct metastable configurations emerge, including the coexistence of tunable skyrmion–antiskyrmion pairs through Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction strengths and current pulse amplitudes. These metastable states eventually relax into two stable skyrmions that can be independently toggled ON and OFF using a weak in-plane magnetic field, enabling complex logic operations and more flexible circuit designs. Beyond the fundamental interest in skyrmion interaction dynamics, the independent control of skyrmion–antiskyrmion states holds promise for next-generation spintronic devices, with potential applications in memory, logic, and computing.},

However, there are a few reports on the direct measurement of variation in the metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) interface band structure during operation, and further investigation is required. This paper focuses on elucidating the changes in the band structure at buried interfaces under applied bias using a nondestructive approach. We conducted measurements using bias-applied laboratory hard x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Lab. HAXPES) with liquid gallium (Ga) x-ray source on MOS structures, which are widely recognized as fundamental and commonly used devices. We utilize HAXPES with Ga x-ray, providing high-energy/intensity x-rays, to achieve sufficient detection depth and enable observation of the deeper regions of the silicon substrate buried under gold and silicon dioxide layers. As a result, this approach allowed us to observe bias-dependent peak shifts resulting from changes in the band structure in detail. We observe HAXPES peak shift caused by the different substrate concentrations.

  abstract     = {Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy are employed to study near-band edge excitonic emission lines in an aluminum nitride (AlN) film over a range of temperatures. The thermal quenching of the neutral silicon-bound exciton (Si 0 X) emission peak in AlN is observed, which is caused by the thermally activated processes from Si 0 X to two types of free exciton (Γ 1 and Γ 5 ), along with a two-electron satellite (TES) transition as a competing pathway. Among these, the activation process to the higher-energy Γ 1 free exciton state is predominant, which may be related to the symmetry of the exciton states. The non-monotonic temperature dependence of the TES emission intensity is observed, which originates from the predominance of the thermally activated TES transition rate at low temperatures, as opposed to the delocalization tendency of Si 0 X. Due to the rapid reduction in the nonradiative recombination lifetime, the PL lifetime of the Si 0 X emission peak decreases from 160 ps at 4.5 K to 15 ps at 80 K. Meantime, the radiative recombination lifetime increases with temperature, which further accelerates the thermal quenching of the Si 0 X emission peak to some extent.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides and their alloys provide a unique platform for exploring interlayer charge transfer in van der Waals heterostructures. These structures are crucial for advancing the next-generation electronic, optoelectronic, and quantum devices. In this study, interlayer charge transfer in heterostructures composed of MoSe 2 , MoS 2 , and their alloy, MoSSe, is investigated using transient absorption, Raman, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The experimental results reveal that electron transfer in the alloy heterostructures, MoSSe/MoS 2 and MoSe 2 /MoSSe, is faster than in the pure MoSe 2 /MoS 2 heterostructure, despite the smaller conduction band offsets of the alloy systems. Raman spectroscopy confirms that alloy layers support phonon modes matching those of the pure layers, aligning with theoretical models of phonon-assisted interlayer charge transfer. Additionally, efficient hole transfer is observed in both alloy heterostructures. The findings suggest transition metal dichalcogenides alloys can be used for engineering heterostructures with desired charge transfer properties. By leveraging compositionally tunable band gaps and optical properties, alloy-based heterostructures offer opportunities for designing tailored materials suitable for diverse applications such as photodetectors, light-emitting devices, and flexible electronics. Moreover, the ultrafast charge transfer observed in these systems provides insights into the fundamental mechanisms governing interlayer interactions in 2D materials.},

It is widely accepted that enhanced NTE can be achieved in PbTiO 3 -based ferroelectrics by improving the tetragonality of PbTiO 3 ( c / a = 1.064) through chemical substitutions. Nevertheless, most substituted PbTiO 3 -based ferroelectrics exhibit reduced tetragonality and weakened NTE, while enhanced NTE has only been achieved in those materials with enhanced tetragonality so far.

A fully connected neural network is developed to predict transmission mapping, transmission spectra, multipole scattering, and TD components. Comparison with numerical simulations shows that the neural network predicts TD resonance efficiently and accurately. Experimental validation through fabricated samples further confirms the strong TD response.

Here, a dual-metal hybrid metasurface is demonstrated for polarization-selective perfect absorption and reflection with liquid tuning capabilities in the infrared band. Based on the metal–insulator–metal architecture, the metasurface composed of Al/Ti nanostrips enables an intense absorption resonance at x -polarization and reflects light as a mirror at y -polarization, thus acting as a high-performance linear polarizer. The absorption peak wavelength can be continuously tailored from 1200 to 1850 nm with an average absorption &gt; 99% by scaling the unit-cell period of metasurfaces. Furthermore, the perfect absorption wavelength of the metasurface exhibits a large range switch (&gt;750 nm) through immersion tuning, and its absorption remains above 99.5%. The proposed dual-metal hybrid metasurface for liquid-tunable absorption can promote practical technologies of dynamic polarizers, photodetectors, and optical imaging.},

However, previous explorations toward higher-order TBICs have been limited to the Hermitian assumption, omitting the nonconservative characteristics present in many artificial materials. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an acoustic lattice model supporting higher-order TBICs that solely rely on non-Hermiticity, in which the non-Hermiticity is implemented by strategically applying additional loss to specific sites in the lattice. Importantly, these in-band corner states are protected by chiral symmetry and can be spectrally switched by introducing perturbations to the corner sites or couplings. Our findings highlight the distinctive role of non-Hermiticity in constructing higher-order TBICs, which may inspire sophisticated and externally tunable approaches for designing high- Q devices in wave-based technologies.},

A resistance enhancement of ∼8% at room temperature was achieved at an electric field of −1 kV/cm, which indicates that such 2DEG is rather sensitive to the strain in the TiO 2 layer.

We experimentally test a range of geometries, comparing shear adhesion strength to understand structure–function relationships in our chosen parameter space. Our findings indicate that introducing cuts to form serpentine paths in a disk results in longer effective lengths and enhanced compliance, thus requiring less energy to deform into a rough surface. Leveraging this insight and associated scaling analysis, we conclude that serpentine-like features arranged in a radially symmetric wedge configuration achieve high levels of adhesion, even on rough surfaces, enabling robust adhesion relative to featureless electroadhesive disks.},

  abstract     = {Two monolithic edge-emitting passively mode-locked InAs/InGaAs semiconductor quantum dot lasers generating ps optical pulses at repetition rates of 10 GHz and optical frequency combs centered at 1260 nm are mutually coupled in an all-optical passive synchronization experiment. The two lasers, with different free-running repetition rates, are coupled through a long delay fiber path, they synchronize, and generate optical pulse trains with identical repetition rates in a wide range of experimental conditions (optical frequency, optical delay, and coupling strength). The common repetition rate can be easily fine-tuned with the control of the external coupling path length. In synchronized state, both lasers operate with significantly reduced timing jitter with respect to their free-running values. Finally, under specific conditions, the repetition rate locking is accompanied by partial mutual coherence between the lasers, as indicated by the formation of interferometric fringes.},

However, these plasmas can be subject to the formation of plasma non-uniformities propagating in the E × B direction. These rotating plasma structures (or “spokes”) enhance the transport of charged species across the magnetic field, which can harm the gentle processing capability of the plasma. In this work, we investigate the role of electrostatically active boundaries on the spoke formation by incorporating a variable bias conducting boundary (known as an anticathode) placed on the axially opposite side of the cathode. Our findings indicate azimuthal mode suppression occurs when the anticathode is electron collecting. Furthermore, we show selective azimuthal mode suppression by biasing the anticathode to an intermediate potential between the cathode and anode potentials. These findings suggest a link between the axial electron confinement in the e-beam generated plasma and azimuthally propagating plasma structure formation.},

However, leveraging defects to tune the intrinsic electronic structure of REO to enhance electrochemical performance, as well as understanding the underlying physical mechanisms at the atomic level, remained an open challenge. Density functional theory plus U calculations revealed that doping and oxygen vacancies not only regulated Li-ion insertion stability but also reduced the migration energy barriers in CeO 2 . Doping also decreased the volume change rate of CeO 2 during Li-ion insertion. Oxygen vacancies lowered the Li-ion migration energy barrier in CeO 2 from 1.516 to 0.903 eV. In comparison, Li-ion migration energy barriers in the La 2 O 3 series structures were significantly lower than those in CeO 2 . Experimental results confirmed that the Li-ion diffusion coefficient of La 2 O 3 was markedly higher than that of CeO 2 . Upon Li-ion insertion, the bandgap of CeO 2 decreased from 2.18 to 1.60 eV, and density of states analysis revealed the profound impact of lithiation on the electronic structure.

However, the undesired growth of zinc dendrites and the prevalence of side reactions pose significant challenges that limit the practical application of ZIBs. The sophisticated structural design and crystal orientation of the Zn anode can effectively suppress the occurrence of zinc dendrites and side reactions. Herein, a highly oriented Zn (002) lattice plane on 3D conductive frameworks [Zn/TiN nanotubes (NTs)] is designed to address uncontrolled dendrite growth, water-induced side reactions, and suboptimal Zn metal utilization in ZIBs. By leveraging an abundance of active sites for Zn 2+ adsorption, minimal charge transfer resistance, and the controlled growth of Zn crystal facets, the reversibility and stability of ZIBs can be significantly enhanced during the Zn plating/stripping process. Remarkably, fiber-ZIBs based on Zn/TiN NTs exhibit a large specific capacity, long-term cycling durability, and excellent mechanical properties. This work proposes an approach to achieve highly reversible zinc anodes from the perspective of nanostructure and crystal orientation.},

However, the evolution of point defects during gamma ( γ )-irradiation is still poorly understood. In this paper, we report the evolution of point defects in Bi 2 Te 3 materials subjected to varying doses of γ -irradiation and their impact on TE performance. Precisely, Bi 0.5 Sb 1.5 Te 3 and Bi 2 Te 2.7 Se 0.3 materials, along with TE modules, were fabricated and subsequently subjected to γ -irradiation. The segregation of Te elements in Bi 2 Te 3 was observed under low irradiation dose, attributing to the formation of interstitial atom–vacancy pair of Te induced by γ -irradiation. In addition, the formation of point defects has a positive relation with the irradiation dose. The positron annihilation (PA) measurements revealed that the number of vacancies in Bi 2 Te 3 diminished with increasing irradiation dose. The accompanying changes in carrier concentration ( n H ) and mobility ( μ H ) suggest that γ -ray drives Bi atoms to occupy Te vacancies, forming antisite defects. The TE performance of Bi 2 Te 3 was subsequently evaluated, and the findings revealed a strong correlation with the evolution of point defects. This study provides insights into the damage mechanisms and property alterations of Bi 2 Te 3 materials under γ -irradiation.},

For practical applications, the major challenge for SWCNTs is improving the thermoelectric performance and thermal durability of n -type SWCNT films. Here, SWCNT inks were prepared using a dopant, which is a cationic surfactant of dimethyldioctadecylammonium chloride (DODMAC), by changing the mass ratio of DODMAC/SWCNT. The SWCNT films were fabricated by vacuum filtering, followed by heat treatment at 423 K. The in-plane thermoelectric properties were measured at 300 K, and the Seebeck coefficient changed from positive to negative values when the DODMAC/SWCNT was 10 −2 . The highest dimensionless figure-of-merit, ZT , of 1.0 × 10 −2 was exhibited at a DODMAC/SWCNT of 80, which was close to saturation concentration. This ZT was achieved mainly because the thermal conductivity decreased significantly to 0.16 W/(m · K), and it is currently one of the highest values among those of n -type SWCNT films with various dopants. To demonstrate power generation, we fabricated a SWCNT-TEG consisting of n -type SWCNT films with the highest ZT . The SWCNT-TEG exhibited an output voltage of 24 mV and a maximum power of 0.9 μ W at a temperature difference of 80 K. Furthermore, to investigate the thermal durability of n -type SWCNT films, thermal cycling tests were performed at temperatures ranging from 300 to 423 K. The SWCNT film with a DODMAC/SWCNT of 80 exhibited the highest durability. These findings will contribute to the widespread use of SWCNT-TEGs as power sources for IoT sensors.},

The composite array consists of a reflection phase gradient metasurface array and a horizontal omnidirectional antenna, with a central operating frequency of 5.8 GHz. The reflection phase gradient metasurface array elements are insensitive to the polarization of the incident wave and are arranged radially around the array center. This configuration creates a radial reflection phase gradient that efficiently converts incident plane waves of different polarizations into surface waves converging toward the center. The surface wave energy is then extracted by the horizontal omnidirectional antenna and converted into direct current (DC) by a rectifier. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the composite array maintains effective surface wave excitation and propagation toward the center for both circularly polarized and various horizontally polarized plane waves, achieving a plane wave-to-surface wave conversion efficiency of 74.89%. Experimental validation shows that the proposed array achieves a maximum energy collection efficiency of 62.23% and an RF-DC conversion efficiency of 39.96% over a broad frequency range of 5.6–6.0 GHz. This study achieves polarization insensitivity while simultaneously enhancing the operational efficiency of microwave energy receivers.

The ON-OFF effect of the modulator is achieved through the cascade&#39;s electrical length reconstruction, and the reflections are effectively suppressed from the ON state to the OFF state. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed modulator achieves a broadband low-reflection effect in the 170–260 GHz band, with a Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR) of less than 1.5 over a bandwidth of 60 GHz and an optimal VSWR of 1.1. It has the potential to support high-speed response as well as the large-capacity, high-rate data transmission. Accordingly, the proposed modulator offers a promising solution for the design of high-performance terahertz modulators and multi-channel integrated terahertz communication systems.},

  abstract     = {To meet the demands for more advanced computer chips, creating devices with advanced 3D architectures is becoming commonplace in the semiconductor industry. To ensure alignment between the different layers, the bottom-up technique of area-selective deposition (ASD) is promising. However, ASD may not always be feasible depending on the various surface chemistries present during manufacturing of complex semiconductor devices. Topographically selective deposition (TSD) is emerging as an alternative, focusing on differences in surface orientation rather than chemical properties. This work demonstrates a TSD supercycle approach in which atomic layer deposition (ALD) is directed to proceed exclusively within a 3D trench structure, by covering the top of the trench with an amorphous carbon (aC) inhibition layer. The aC layer is applied selectively on the top surface of the trench by exploiting the ion-radical synergy required for its deposition. Since the aC layer lacks adsorption sites for ALD precursors, growth of the target material is inhibited on the top surface of the trench, whereas it occurs selectively within the trench. After several ALD cycles of selective deposition of the target material, the aC layer is removed and reapplied in a supercycle recipe until sufficient material has been deposited in the trench. The selective deposition of an aC inhibition layer on the top surface of the trench, as well as the selective deposition of 3.0 ± 0.1 nm of TiO 2 in a trench is demonstrated on a 3D nanostructure.},

Furthermore, the validity of our results was additionally confirmed by measuring the breakdown voltage and applying positive-bias stress to the fabricated devices exposed to radiation for accelerated tests.},

With a combination of in situ GaON and large bandgap Al 2 O 3 on top of the recessed gate region, normally-off HEMT was achieved with high On/Off current (I ON /I OFF ) ratio of 10 9 , low V TH hysteresis less than 60 mV, and low-interface trap density (D it ) in the range of 4 × 10 11 –2 × 10 12 cm −2 ·eV −1 . Thanks to the sharp GaN/oxide interface with narrow distribution of lattice constant, uniform strain distribution and significantly reduced trap density were obtained. More importantly, our proposed bi-layer gate dielectric is perfectly compatible with the conventionally utilized gate recessing technique compared to the conventionally utilized in situ SiN x , demonstrating itself as a promising candidate in GaN power devices.},

  abstract     = {Si-based spin qubits are promising due to their long decoherence time and the compatibility with state-of-the-art semiconductor technology and have been demonstrated using quantum dots (QDs) to host single electrons for spin manipulation. In this work, we simulate the electrostatics and quantum transport properties of quantum dots on a Si metal–oxide–semiconductor platform and a Si/SiGe heterostructure. We investigate the effects of gate configurations and the SiGe spacer thickness on device characteristics, such as gate capacitances, Coulomb blockade, and charge stability. For a single quantum dot, placing its barrier gates (BGs) under the plunger gate improves the charge stability, while swapping the positions of those gates reduces the effects of the barrier gate biases on the charge stability. A thicker SiGe spacer further suppresses the effects of the barrier gate biases on the charge stability for quantum dots on the Si/SiGe heterostructure but leads to stronger crosstalk between neighboring quantum dots. Wider barrier gates can help to mitigate the crosstalk effects for multiple quantum dots. These findings provide key insights into the optimization of the gate configurations and material selection to improve the charge stability and minimize the crosstalk by different gates for future development of scalable Si-based quantum dots.},

  abstract     = {Rare earth (RE) ions are important dopants to modulate semiconductor properties because of their abundant energy levels. Herein, a simple Er–Yb co-doping strategy was developed to enhance the near-infrared optoelectronic properties of SnS 2 nanosheets. The constructed device based on Er–Yb co-doping SnS 2 has a detectivity of ∼4.97 × 10 8 Jones at 980 nm. The enhanced photoresponse of the doped system at 980 nm could be attributed to the upconversion behavior of the Er–Yb ion pairs. The Yb 3+ ions as sensitizers significantly enhance the upconversion emission and near-infrared photoresponse properties of the material. The energy transfer from Yb 3+ to Er 3+ ions can occur between different layers of co-doping nanosheets by investigating the properties of the constructed SnS 2 :Er/SnS 2 :Yb homojunction nanosheets. Density functional theory calculations reveal that Er or Yb doping introduces slight structural and charge distribution changes owing to the similarity in the metal–atom coordination structure between SnS 2 and RE sulfide. Our study demonstrates that RE doping is an effective way to improve the near-infrared photoresponse of 2D materials and clarifies the relationship between luminescence and photoelectric properties.},

To enhance the optoelectronic properties of Ga 2 O 3 films, a controllable doping strategy is proposed in this work. Using a sol-gel method, Ga 2 O 3 films doped with magnesium (Mg) are prepared, with the Mg concentration adjustable through the precursor solution. The results indicate that the bandgap of Ga 2 O 3 increases with higher doping levels, while the electrical conductivity decreases proportionally. To evaluate their optoelectronic characteristics, a series of photodetectors with Mg-doped Ga 2 O 3 active layers are fabricated. Under a 254 nm incident light, the device with an optimal doping concentration of 4.2% demonstrates the best performance, achieving the highest responsivity ( R ) of 1.97 A/W and a photo-dark current ratio of 2.6 × 10 3 . Furthermore, density functional theory calculations are employed to provide a detailed analysis of the fundamental mechanisms behind the enhanced optoelectronic properties.

Using Hall and photo-Hall measurements, we identify macroscopic separation of negative and positive carriers as the most likely origin for delayed photoconductivity decay, with a strong electron localization expected at grain boundaries or cracks within the polycrystalline films. Additionally, measurements on perovskite films with varying morphology and SnF 2 additive content reveal that large apparent grain size (&gt;5 μ m ⁠ ) and effective passivation of recombination centers combine to provide a path for achieving PPC extending over 100 h at room temperature.},

However, In 2 O 3 nanofiber FETs typically exhibit deteriorated electrical performance and bias stability due to the disordered arrangement of nanofibers and a high concentration of oxygen vacancy defects. In this study, In 2 O 3 nanofibers were prepared by electrospinning, and the effects of nanofiber orientation and Y 2 O 3 passivation on FET electrical performance were systematically investigated. The results indicate that after Y 2 O 3 passivation, the aligned In 2 O 3 nanofiber FETs exhibit enhanced electrical performance and superior positive bias stress and negative bias illumination stress stability. The Y 2 O 3 passivation layer effectively prevents the penetration of external O 2 and H 2 O molecules, while the diffusion of Y 3+ into the back channel reduces oxygen vacancies, thereby improving device stability. When Al 2 O 3 was employed as the dielectric layer, the electrical performance of aligned In 2 O 3 nanofiber FET with Y 2 O 3 passivation was further optimized, achieving a mobility of 18.2 cm 2 /V s and a subthreshold swing of 85 mV/dec. Meanwhile, the FET exhibits excellent environmental stability after 60 days of atmospheric exposure.

Herein, the heterostructures composed of bismuth sodium titanate (BNT) ferroelectrics and silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) are constructed to promote the photocatalytic CO 2 performance. The large spontaneous polarization of BNT optimizes the transfer dynamics of photoinduced electrons and holes and causes energy band bending with strong intrinsic electric field. With the aid of Ag NPs, the BNT@ x Ag heterojunctions exhibit intensified light absorption due to the phenomenon of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), which extends the visible light absorption spectrum and strengthens charge transfer. The modified catalysts demonstrate improved charge separation capacity and notably prolonged electron lifetime up to 40.95 ns. The synergistic effect of LSPR and intrinsic polarization significantly boosts the photocatalytic efficiency together with ultrahigh CO product selectivity, which is outstanding among the ferroelectric and other representative photocatalysts.

We demonstrate that thinner films exhibit a greater fraction of the non-polar tetragonal phase (t-phase), with increased V O concentration at the interface, affecting the device performance. Electrical measurements reveal contrasting wake-up and fatigue behavior between the two thicknesses, with thinner films showing decreased remanent polarization (2P R ) due to t-phase dominance and V O redistribution during field cycling.

  abstract     = {Orbitronics has been extensively explored theoretically and experimentally in orbital-charge conversion. The spin-charge conversion efficiency induced by the orbital Hall effect can be much larger than that of the spin Hall effect. However, orbitronics focuses primarily on light metal elements and their oxides, while exploring heavy metal elements and oxides is rare. In this Letter, we report significant enhancements in the ultrafast spin (orbit)-charge conversion for the CoFeB/Pt/SrIrO 3 (SIO) trilayer using the terahertz emission spectroscopy, where the maximum enhancement calculated by the normalized terahertz emission amplitude is about three times that for the CoFeB/Pt bilayer. In addition, we observe a ∼2 orders of magnitude enhancement in the THz emission due to significant orbital transport in Pt-insertion heavy metal layer in the CoFeB/Pt/SIO heterostructure as compared to the CoFeB/SIO bilayer. Our findings not only demonstrate that the transition metals and their oxides exhibit strong inverse orbital Hall effect but also show that multilayer structures allow enhancing the spin-to-charge current conversion efficiency for THz applications, providing a direction to tailor THz emitters.},

  abstract     = {Charge–spin interconversion is a key issue in spintronics. It gives rise to a series of new phenomena, such as spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR). In the present work, we report the peculiar SMR behaviors in heterostructures composed of polycrystalline WTe 2 nanoplate and Ni 80 Fe 20 (Py) film. We observe a negative SMR, which is contrary to the positive SMR usually measured in heavy metal/ferromagnet bilayers. We further observe a transition from negative to positive SMR with increasing thickness of the WTe 2 layer, as well as SMR sign reversal with increasing temperature in heterostructures with thicker WTe 2 . The peculiar SMR behaviors in polycrystalline WTe 2 /Py heterostructures are attributed to the interface-induced spin current and its competition with the spin Hall-induced spin current. The findings in this work offer a fundamental input for the future exploitation of heterostructures based on two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides.},

The magnetic moment of the polymer microvolcanoes varied with the change of the magnetic field bias direction inside the YIG films, which was shown by 2D mapping of the outer surface of the films. The good correlation of micromagnetic modeling and experimental data of spin wave propagation in the multistructure as a function of the applied magnetic field was clarified by the convergence parameters of the obtained polymer 3D magnetic microvolcanoes fields and the standard theory of spin wave propagation.

  abstract     = {The construction of irradiation-tolerant anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) sensors is crucial for weak-field detection in scenarios of aerospace and radiotherapy. Presently, the utilization of the NiFe/oxide composite structure was considered to be an effective scheme to optimize the spin-dependent transport property; however, it exhibited poor anti-irradiation ability due to the crystal instability of oxide. Here, a strategy was proposed to break through the limitation based on the electronic reconstruction and structural stabilization. By introducing an oxygen-affinitive Hf intercalation into the Ta/MgO/NiFe/MgO/Ta multilayer, the electron coordination was modified to tune the 3d orbital occupancy of Fe, apparently boosting the s-d electron scattering and spin-related transport property. Meanwhile, the irradiation stability of electronic and crystal structures was effectively improved due to the emergence of the Hf–O–Mg bond with high dissociation energy. Therefore, we constructed a highly reliable AMR sensor with both the ultrahigh sensitivity of 3.1 mV/V/Oe and excellent irradiation-tolerant ability capable of resisting the γ-ray irradiation of 1000 Gy. These results not only build an important basis for the sensor application in the irradiation environment but also provide a possible idea for the anti-irradiation design in spintronic devices.},

The Gaussian-distributed plane wave heats the medium adjacent to the Fresnel reflection surface. Meanwhile, a continuous probe light traverses the heating field, and the periodic temperature change then modulates the phase of the probe light. A multi-beam interferometer formed by aligning the Fresnel reflection surface to a gold-coated high-reflection surface possesses high resolution and sensitivity, significantly enhancing the detection performance. A well-established theoretical model of instantaneous PT transduction and optical phase modulation is employed to obtain the optimized interferometric configuration. To validate the effective interferometric phase transformation within the cavity, a comparison is made between the simple silicon cavity and the gold-coated cavity. The limitation of detection of such extrinsic fiber-tip PT sensors indicates one magnitude lower as compared to the conventional PT interferometric gas sensor with such robust and compact sensing designs.

It is clearly shown that the capacitance signal associated with the electron emission from a trap level previously identified in the literature as E14 and characterized by an activation energy of 0.18 eV is found to be a superposition of electron emissions from two closely spaced energy levels. Furthermore, we noted that the corresponding L-DLTS signal splits into two well separated components with activation energies of 196 and 209 meV, and the splitting occurs as the electric field in the space charge region of a Schottky diode exceeds 2 × 10 7 V/m (0.2 MV/cm). Additionally, a strong dependency of DLTS and L-DLTS signals on the electric field strength and resulting enhancement of the electron emission from these two trap states agree well with the 1D Poole–Frenkel (PF) model, suggesting donor-like behavior of both states. Finally, we found that the barrier height for thermal emission of the electrons is significantly reduced in our samples by 121 meV due to the PF effect for experimental conditions corresponding to an electric field of 3.5 × 10 7 V/m (0.35 MV/cm).},

With the assistance of S-parameter characterization combined with secondary ion mass spectroscopy analyses, the incorporated oxygen impurity has been identified to be the main source bringing about the severe RF loss of N-polar GaN. The compensation of Fe-doping enables an effective reduction in RF loss. Moreover, the unintentionally doped (UID) GaN layer grown on top of the Fe-doped GaN buffer requires a careful design due to the distinct memory effect of Fe-doping in N-polar GaN. With an optimization of its thickness, a very low RF loss of 0.36 dB/mm at 94 GHz has been attained. Furthermore, by fitting the Fe concentration profile of UID-GaN according to the mass balance rate equation, it is found that the desorption of Fe on the N-polar GaN surface is significant. A bond-based model is introduced to elucidate the difference of the Fe memory effect between Ga-polar and N-polar GaN.},

Among various innovative materials, two-dimensional (2D) materials have garnered attention as frontrunners for next-generation device fabrication. In this work, we report the fabrication and comprehensive characterization of a memristor based on 2D PtTe 2 . The device demonstrates exceptional performance metrics, including a high OFF/ON ratio, low switching voltage, and long data retention time. Leveraging density functional theory calculations, we unravel the underlying conduction mechanism, revealing the pivotal role of Ag conductive filaments in resistive switching behavior. Furthermore, the neuromorphic capabilities of the PtTe 2 memristor were evaluated through its emulation of key brain-inspired synaptic functionalities, such as long-term depression/enhancement, paired-pulse facilitation, and spike-timing-dependent plasticity. By modulating its electrical conductance, we implemented a convolutional neural network for MNIST handwritten digit recognition, achieving a remarkable accuracy of 97.49%. To further illustrate its adaptive learning capabilities, we demonstrated a Pavlov&#39;s dog experiment using the device. This study establishes 2D PtTe 2 as a promising material for neuromorphic applications and represents a critical step forward in bridging the gap between advanced materials and next-generation computing architectures.

Our results indicate that an optical transition involving O N − (a DX center) gives rise to an absorption band peaked at 2.22 eV, suggesting it is a source of the absorption band with an onset at ∼ 2 eV observed in oxygen-containing samples. We also propose that neutral O N – DX complexes can form, which would give rise to absorption peaking at 3.06 eV. In addition, we find that oxygen, in spite of its DX character, may behave as an “optically shallow donor” and be involved in optical transitions from deep defect states to the conduction band.

The emission centers are generally attributed to either intrinsic or extrinsic point defects embedded into hBN. Nevertheless, the microscopic structure of most of these defect emitters is uncertain. Here, through density-functional theory calculations, we studied the native antisite defects in hBN. We find that the neutral boron antisite might be a nonmagnetic single photon source with zero-phonon-line (ZPL) at 1.58 eV and such a line shape is often observed in experiments. Furthermore, the positively charged nitrogen antisite might be associated with a dim color center recently observed as a blue emitter with ZPL at 2.63 eV. These simple single substitution defects indicate the existence of out-of-plane phonon mode, which significantly affects the optical properties. Our results could provide useful information for the identification of quantum emitters in hBN.},

  abstract     = {The van der Waals crystal NbOX 2 (X = Cl, Br, I) has recently attracted much attention due to its remarkable in-plane anisotropy and substantial second-order nonlinear optical response. Moreover, the importance of modulating its physical properties through strain has become increasingly prominent. Herein, we investigate the anisotropic phonon response of NbOX 2 along various crystallographic directions under uniaxial tensile strain by Raman spectroscopy. The results show that opposing frequency shifts manifest in the Raman modes when uniaxial tensile strain is applied either parallel or perpendicular to the polar axis, and the highest frequency peak, P5, shows significant blue or red shifts. Density functional theory calculation results are consistent with the observed Raman shifts under strain. The change in Nb–O bond length is the main reason for the significant blue shift of P5. The anisotropic and pronounced frequency shifts of NbOX 2 under strain can serve as sensitive indicators for strain modulation, offering insights for potential applications such as flexible optoelectronic devices and strain sensors.},

It is revealed that all the alkalis (Na, K, Rb) prefer to accumulate in the surface region of the absorber with occupying Cu sites. A hole barrier can be introduced in the absorber surface region, and the electron barrier at CdS/CuInSe 2 interface is nearly changed after alkali incorporation. Distinct effects of Na and heavier alkalis (K and Rb) are explored. Post-deposition treatment (PDT) with Na leads to form Na x Cu 1−x InSe 2 in the near-surface region. While monoclinic KInSe 2 (or RbInSe 2 ) secondary phase tends to form at the surface during K (or Rb) PDT. The hole barrier introduced by Na PDT can be much lower than that in the case of heavy alkali PDT due to the limited Na solubility in Na x Cu 1−x InSe 2 . The improved V O C in CIGS solar cells by heavy alkali PDT is mainly attributed to the absence of interfacial states and the elimination of isolated In Cu and V Cu defects in the surface region.},

P-type Schottky contacts are obtained in all 1T/H-XA 2 contacts to Cs 3 Bi 2 I 9 , and the contacts can be engineered from Schottky to Ohmic contacts via external electric fields.

Finally, Curie temperature ( ⁠ T c ⁠ ) of magnetic systems were calculated using the Monte Carlo method, and the T c of 1H-VS 2 /Cs 3 Bi 2 I 9 significantly enhances largely to surpass room temperature, thereby expanding the application field of spintronic devices.

The monolayered SMoSiN 2 possesses excellent stability and direct bandgap at the K / K ′ valley, making it a promising candidate for valleytronic semiconductor. The ferromagnet CrCl 3 substrate induces a sizable valley splitting via proximity coupling. The valley-contrasting property of the top-stacking is significantly tunable by both in-plane sliding and vertical strain engineering, leading to extraordinary tunability of valley splitting in the range 1.6–9.4 meV. In contrast, the valley-contrasting property of the bottom-stacking is comparably robust due to the screen effect originating from the outmost N sublayer to reduce the proximity interaction. Our investigation reveals that the stacking order is a degree of freedom to manipulate the valley-related properties of various vdW heterostructures, facilitating the achievement of versatile valley-contrasting properties.},

The effects of the counter-electrode&#39;s curvature on the apex field enhancement factor ( ⁠ γ Ca ⁠ ) of the emitter are still not understood. In this Letter, we theoretically explore how the apex field enhancement factor of an emitter, represented by a hemisphere on a cylindrical post (HCP) with apex radius r a = 50 nm, is influenced by the curvature of a sphere-shaped counter-electrode. Importantly, our results show that for HCPs with sharpness aspect ratios typically between 10 2 and 10 3 ⁠ , there is a universal scaling such that γ Ca = γ Pa Ψ ( R / d gap ) ⁠ , where γ Pa represents the apex field enhancement factor for the emitter assuming a planar counter-electrode, and Ψ ( R / d gap ) is a universal scaling function such that Ψ ∼ 1 for R / d gap ≫ 1 and Ψ ∼ ( R / d gap ) α ⁠ , with α close to unity, for R / d gap ≪ 1 ⁠ . These findings help partially explain discrepancies observed in orthodox field electron emission experiments, where it was reported that the effective γ Ca values extracted from the current–voltage characteristics of single-tip carbon nanotubes typically underestimate the theoretical γ Pa values when R ∼ d gap ≫ r a ⁠ , a trend that is predicted by our results.},

  abstract     = {At micro- and nanoscales, momentum transfer between surfaces is influenced by various physical mechanisms, including quantum fluctuations, electromagnetic interactions, electric charges, and the dynamics of (rarefied) gases. Under non-isothermal conditions, rarefied gases give rise to thermal Knudsen forces whose magnitudes strongly depend on the gas species and surface characteristics. Knudsen forces are particularly relevant in nanotechnology, optical manipulation, and aerospace systems, where gas rarefaction occurs due to highly confined geometries, sub-micrometer length scales, and reduced particle densities. Despite their significance, predictive modeling of Knudsen forces is limited by a lack of comprehensive experimental data across diverse materials and surface morphologies. In this work, we present a highly sensitive and adaptable measurement platform capable of directly quantifying Knudsen forces using a suspended, interchangeable micro-cantilever within controlled rarefied helium and nitrogen environments. The system integrates optical fiber interferometry to precisely capture out-of-plane displacements at sub-micrometer resolution, driven by Knudsen forces. From the empirical data, we derive a robust correlation linking the magnitudes of Knudsen forces to energy accommodation coefficients, offering deeper insights into the underlying gas–surface interaction mechanisms.},

This “asymmetric” waveguide design is potentially advantageous, since it improves the active-core optical confinement factor, as well as the overall thermal conductance, especially for epitaxial-side-down mounted devices. When operated in pulsed mode, the broad-area ICL featured a characteristic temperature of 57 K and a threshold current density as low as 95 A/cm 2 at 25 °C, which is the lowest ever reported for an ICL operating at a similar temperature.

Numerous studies have focused on 2D/2D heterostructures, but research on 1D/2D heterostructures is comparatively limited, and the interface electron transfer mechanism needs to be further explored. In this study, we leverage the inherent band structure alignment characteristics of 1D Bi 1.3 In 0.7 Se 3 and 2D WSe 2 to create Bi 1.3 In 0.7 Se 3 /WSe 2 heterostructure with Type-I band alignment.

The Bi 1.3 In 0.7 Se 3 nanowire enhances the PL intensity and red-shifts the PL peaks of WSe 2 . This strong local electric field at the heterojunction interface improves the photoresponse performance of the Bi 1.3 In 0.7 Se 3 /WSe 2 heterostructures devices. They achieve excellent photoresponce properties in a wide spectral range from solar-blind ultraviolet C (254 nm) to near-infrared (980 nm) region, with a large responsivity of 98 A/W, a high detectivity of 1.16 × 10 13 Jones, and a fast photoresponse time of 500 μ s ⁠ . In addition, the optoelectronic performance of the device is controlled by modulating the Fermi level of the heterostructure by the applied gate electric field. Our work paves the way for the development of 1D/2D heterostructures for multifunctional optoelectronic applications.},

  abstract     = {Acoustic holography is a promising technique for contactless manipulation, remote sensing, and energy harvesting. It involves retrieving holograms used to modulate acoustic sources for reconstructing target acoustic fields. The performance of reconstruction is primarily determined by two key criteria, including the spatial bandwidth product, which measures the pixel number representing information capacity, and the resolution, which quantifies the pixel size supporting detail gain. However, existing techniques face limitations in reconstructing high-fidelity, dynamic, and real-time acoustic fields with enhanced spatial bandwidth product and resolution across the entire aperture size. These challenges stem from the reliance on physically constrained holograms with static nature or relatively low spatial bandwidth product and resolution. Here, we introduce super-resolution acoustic holography, wherein the spatial bandwidth and resolution of the reconstructed target acoustic fields surpass those of the retrieved source holograms, especially within the same aperture size. We further develop a deep learning strategy that combines a classical neural network architecture with a linear accumulation based physical model, allowing for the customization of reconstructed acoustic planes with higher resolution while maintaining the same lateral coverages. Extensive algorithmic validations, numerical simulations, and practical experiments demonstrate the capability of our method to achieve high-fidelity, dynamic, real-time super-resolution acoustic holography, rendering its potential to advance practical applications in holographic acoustics.},

The Au NPs were facilely obtained by thermally annealing a thin Au film grown on a Si substrate, which did not influence the subsequent growth of ZnO thin films. Electric measurements verified typical RS behaviors in the Au/ZnO/Si devices, which are related to the recovery and rupture of conductive filaments due to electric field-driven oxygen vacancy migration. Notably, COMSOL-based electrostatic field simulations on Au/ZnO/Au structures have shown that an enhanced local electric field with 4.5 times enhancement was produced at the tip of Au NPs, which facilitated the oxygen vacancies migration around the tip of Au NPs. Accordingly, controlled formation and rupture of conductive filaments are proposed in the Au/ZnO/Au NPs/Si devices, which greatly improved the RS window, stability, and endurance. The results shown in this work may pave the way for the fabrication of high-performance oxide-based RS devices in the future.},

We investigate how the parameters used to burn the spectral hole impact its shape, and how these factors determine the minimum achievable linewidth. In addition to the stability of the hole&#39;s center frequency, the linewidth and contrast play a crucial role in frequency locking. At sub-kelvin temperatures, the temperature-dependent T 7 broadening from two-phonon Raman scattering is expected to be negligible, and the spectral hole&#39;s linewidth should therefore remain constant in this interval. We observe however a linear broadening with increasing temperature, highlighting the need for further investigation into the mechanisms governing the linewidth at ultra-low temperatures.},

Electrochemical measurements suggest that OER performance of CoSe 2 nanosheets is improved under a 200 mT magnetic field, with the overpotential at 10 mA cm −2 reduced by 81 mV. Moreover, magnetic force microscopy observations on CoSe 2 nanosheets reveal that spin disorder in the magnetic domain wall region transforms to spin order under the 200 mT magnetic field, resulting in improved OER performance. Although the magnetic field has a negligible effect on the OER performance of single-domain CoSe 2 nanosheets, these findings reveal the decisive role of magnetic domain walls in enhancing OER performance under an applied magnetic field, pointing to the potential for industrial applications of magnetic field-assisted catalysis.},

  abstract     = {Pressure-induced evolution of the bandgap, structural phase transitions, and changes in exciton effects can significantly modulate the luminescent properties of lead halide perovskites (LHPs) quantum dots (QDs). Previous studies have indicated that CH 3 NH 3 PbBr 3 (MAPbBr 3 ) QDs, as a typical low-dimensional LHP material, and their photoluminescence (PL) at ambient conditions are mainly attributed to the radiative recombination of the initially generated excitons upon light absorption and the excitons involving surface states, while the existence of biexciton radiative recombination remains unclear. In this work, we confirm the existence of biexciton radiative recombination in MAPbBr 3 QDs at ambient conditions through experimental measurements of excitation-intensity-dependent PL and time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra at ambient conditions as well as temperature-dependent PL spectra (80–260 K) at ambient pressure. We also establish that the PL of MAPbBr 3 QDs primarily originates from the combined effects of three excitons radiative recombination physical processes: biexcitons, initially generated excitons upon light absorption, and excitons involving surface states. Furthermore, through in situ high-pressure PL, absorption, and TRPL spectroscopy measurements, we reveal that the recombination lifetimes and the relative contributions of these three excitons in MAPbBr 3 QDs are all subject to alteration in response to the pressure-induced bandgap evolution and the structural phase transitions, thereby modulating their PL emission characteristics.},

However, concerns about electrochemical degradation under high-energy radiation hinder their widespread use in space. To this end, a NASICON-type Li 1.3 Al 0.3 Ti 1.7 (PO 4 ) 3 (LATP) electrolyte with high ionic conductivity at room temperature was selected, and the effects of high-dose electron irradiation on the microstructure as well as electrochemical and mechanical properties of electrolyte were investigated by using neutron powder diffraction (NPD), NPD stress analysis, micro-computed tomography, nanoindentation, and XRD residual stress test. It was confirmed that LATP SSEs held good resistance to irradiation at absorbed doses of 1 and 2 MGy with negligibly performance degradation, while irradiation at high doses induced a rapid decrease in the Young modulus and hardness of SSEs and introduced a tensile stress of 65.79 MPa at up to 10 MGy absorbed dose, which increased the cracking tendency and the risk of lithium dendrite growth in the solid-state electrolyte. NPD revealed that the reduction of lithium vacancies at the M1 site of the irradiated SSEs was the critical factor for the ion transport performance degradation. This is evidenced by a significant increase in impedance, up to 453 Ω, and an increase in the activation energy for ion transport to 0.501 eV.},

  abstract     = {GeSe has recently gained attention for its structural similarity to SnSe, an excellent thermoelectric material. However, for the orthorhombic GeSe, the maximum zT is limited to ∼0.2 at 700 K. A significant improvement in the thermoelectric performance is observed when GeSe is stabilized in a rhombohedral or cubic structure; thus, the crystal structure plays an important role in GeSe for improved zT. In this study, we investigated the structural transitions and thermoelectric properties of Te-substituted GeSe. Increasing Te substitution in GeSe 1-x Te x (x = 0.00–0.50) induces a transition from orthorhombic to rhombohedral crystal structure at ambient conditions with the maximum zT ∼ 0.58 observed in rhombohedral GeSe 0.6 Te 0.4 at 573 K. The improved thermoelectric performance in the rhombohedral phase is due to a concurrent increase in the power factor and a decrease in lattice thermal conductivity. The phonon dispersion calculation tells that the high-frequency optical phonon modes significantly increase the phonon–phonon scattering for the rhombohedral phase, enhancing the lattice anharmonicity and reducing the lattice thermal conductivity. This behavior aligns with the presence of metavalent bonding in rhombohedral GeSe. Additionally, peak broadening observed in the Raman spectra of the rhombohedral phase indicates pronounced lattice anharmonicity and phonon modes softening due to the metavalent bond character.},

First, a low-magnification telecentric lens is used for sparse axial sampling within a large depth-of-field range to obtain a coarse estimate of vascular depth. Then, based on the frequency-depth characteristics of dynamic blood flow signals, a TFDA-based focusing evaluation function is established in combination with Lambert–Beer&#39;s law, achieving a mean absolute percentage error of 2.06%. Finally, validation on a 3-day-old chicken embryo demonstrated a lateral spatial resolution of 2.95 μ m and imaging time of 11.5 s for a 4.95 × 4.95 × 0.7 mm 3 sample. Our method provides effective blood flow depth localization by assessing focal modulation intensity relative to focal plane and blood flow position, offering promising support for vascular disease research.},

While synergy among them has never been achieved. Herein, we reported an effective strategy to boost the triboelectric charge transfer efficiency by synergizing the strong ferroelectric polarization and high permittivity of embedded lead zirconate titanate fillers. The influence of interfacial polarization intensity and the dielectric permittivity, as well as corona poling, on the triboelectrification of composite film was systematically investigated. Notably, the switching of interfacial polarization direction renders an increase (207%) or a decrease (71%) in the triboelectric output in comparison with the non-poled counterpart. Theoretical modeling was established by combining Kelvin probe force microscopy characterization with the electron cloud overlap energy band derivation. This work not only offers unprecedented insight into the fundamental mechanism of triboelectrification but also opens up a possibility in the development of next-generation wearable electronics.},

To maximize the output power of such transducers, operation at their mechanical resonance frequency is imperative. However, a reduction in size along the direction of oscillation is intrinsically accompanied by an increase in resonance frequency. Here, we report on a computational shape optimization strategy to minimize the resonance frequency in magnetoelectric transducers by ≈38% within a set of given optimization constraints. We show that our algorithm can be used to guide the design of magnetoelectric transducers optimized to operate at different resonance frequencies and allows for consistent frequency spacing between transducers, thus enabling separately addressable devices and clustered operation. Finally, we propose four needle-shaped devices that could be used as bioimplants that impose minimal tissue damage upon direct insertion into tissue. The increase in resonance frequency associated with the needle shape is overcompensated by a frequency minimization step. Our work paves the way for computationally guided resonance frequency tuning in the field of magnetoelectric transducers.},

  abstract     = {This study presents the use of micro-ring resonator (MRR) devices to extract and enhance nonlinear signals. MRRs “trap” incoming light and, therefore, have been shown to achieve extremely high local intensities of light. Thus, they can be used to facilitate highly nonlinear optical signals that are usually weak in intensity and require high excitation power. By embedding materials that host nonlinear optical processes inside the MRR, we expect to observe an enhancement in the strength of the nonlinear optical signals. This concept is demonstrated here by extracting the Raman signature of graphene that is placed inside a MRR device. A highly doped silica MRR featuring an optical bus waveguide coupled to a ring tuned to near-infrared wavelengths is used. Raman signal with an excitation wavelength of 522 nm via third-harmonic generation inside the MRR is observed. The higher-order Raman signal of the embedded graphene is also observed at the 1597.6 nm excitation wavelength. This work demonstrates the feasibility of the MRR as a nonlinear signal enhancer using high-Q MRR device setups.},

  abstract     = {In this study, a P3HT-based multi-gate frequency-dependent synaptic transistor is fabricated, which demonstrates significant advantages in mimicking the transmission characteristics of biological synaptic activities. The proposed device simulates outputs related to frequency and gate voltage modulation. This device can respond differently to inputs ranging from 0.75 to 11.11 Hz, and at the same input frequency, it exhibits different responses by varying the control gate voltage from 0 to −0.8 V. This innovative design can dynamically adjust the cutoff frequency, enhancing edge feature processing in images, thereby significantly improving the recognition accuracy of information in blurry images that can be difficult for humans to distinguish. Our results provide a hardware edge-computing image processing method, overcoming the limitations of traditional single-gate transistors that typically have fixed parameters. The recognition accuracy of information in blurry images preprocessed by this device improved significantly from 80% to 100%. Combined with the multi-gate design, this synaptic device excels not only in edge enhancement and image processing but also offers robust hardware support for future neuromorphic electronics.},

Recently, 2D anisotropic/isotropic heterostructures have shown promise in breaking isotropic symmetry and inducing anisotropic responses through precise control of interfacial structures, such as moiré patterns. However, detailed experimental investigations into the correlation between anisotropic behaviors and anisotropic moiré patterns remain scarce. Here, we report optical anisotropy in WS 2 by stacking a WS 2 /ReS 2 heterostructure. Through measurements of polarized photoluminescence spectra, we observe that the intralayer excitons (both localized-state exciton LX and neutral exciton X A ) of WS 2 in the heterostructure exhibit pronounced anisotropy, which remains robust at both room temperature and a low temperature of ∼10 K. Furthermore, the angles between the linear polarization directions and the orientation of the corresponding one-dimensional moiré patterns remain approximately constant values (∼60° for LX and ∼45° for X A ), demonstrating a clear correlation between anisotropic exciton emission and the anisotropic moiré patterns. Our work offers valuable insights into achieving artificial optical anisotropy using anisotropic/isotropic heterostructures, paving the way for enhanced performance in anisotropic sensing devices.},

In our work, we propose a stable monolayer Janus Nb 2 SeTeO with altermagnetic ground state and spin-valley locking (SVL) effect. The monolayer Janus Nb 2 SeTeO exhibits a multipiezo effect with a large out-of-plane piezoelectricity and piezovalley effect with large valley polarization. The piezovalley effect is induced by uniaxial strain effect in different directions, which contributes the anomalous valley Hall effect (AVHE) observed in AM systems. Moreover, compressive uniaxial strain could induce quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) in the AM system, where the dissipationless topological edge states&#39; chirality could be manipulated by the direction of uniaxial strain. These manifest topological phase transitions could be realized via piezovalley effect in the AM system. Furthermore, the AM quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE) could be induced by biaxial strain effect, which contributes quantized spin Hall conductance. Our work reveals that strain-engineering technique could serve as an important method to tune dissipationless edge states in monolayer Janus Nb 2 SeTeO. By designing the SVL effect, topological physics could be emerged in AM systems such as AVHE, QAHE, and QSHE.},

  abstract     = {Graphene exhibits a pronounced photo-thermoelectric effect (PTE) in its in-plane carrier transport and has attracted attention toward various optoelectronic applications. In this study, we demonstrate an out-of-plane PTE by utilizing electron tunneling across a barrier, namely, the tunneling photo-thermoelectric effect (TPTE). This was achieved in a monolayer graphene (MLG)/bilayer hexagonal boron nitride ( h -BN)/bilayer graphene (BLG) asymmetric tunnel junction. MLG and BLG exhibit different cyclotron resonance (CR) optical absorption energies when their energies are Landau quantized under an out-of-plane magnetic field. We tuned the magnetic field under mid-infrared irradiation to bring MLG into CR conditions, whereas BLG was not in CR. The CR absorption in the MLG generates an electron temperature difference between the MLG and BLG and induces an out-of-plane TPTE voltage across the h -BN tunnel barrier. The TPTE exhibited a unique dependence on the Fermi energy of the MLG, which differed from that of the in-plane PTE of the MLG. The TPTE signal was large when the Fermi energy of the MLG was tuned near the transition between the quantum Hall state (QHS) and non-QHS. The TPTE allows one to measure the PTE on vertically stacked tunnel junctions, thus providing another degree of freedom for probing the electronic and optoelectronic properties of two-dimensional material heterostructures.},

Phase-field simulations, incorporating electrical, thermal, and mechanical breakdown mechanisms, investigate the influence of nanofiller volume fraction, size, and dielectric constant on the dielectric response and breakdown behaviors under high temperature and electric fields.

Nevertheless, due to varying physical mechanisms, achieving and fine-tuning multiple such phenomena within a single S-N system continues to be a challenge. In this work, we employ NbSe 2 and WTe 2 to fabricate an S-N-S heterostructure. Below the superconducting transition temperature of NbSe 2 , two distinct resistance-temperature behaviors are observed: a continuous decrease in junction resistance with temperature decrease, indicative of the superconducting proximity effect and consistent with the BCS model, and an increase in resistance attributed to competition between Andreev reflection (AR) and normal reflection at a low-transparency interface, which can be suppressed by applying a small bias current or a magnetic field. Our results indicate the signature of the coexistence of proximity-induced superconductivity with AR in the measured S-N-S heterojunction, demonstrating the tunability of charge carrier transport behavior at the interface. This finding enhances our understanding of such systems and holds potential for the development of superconducting electronics, quantum computing, and energy harvesting technologies.},

Strong, circularly polarized luminescence reflecting the spin-polarized electron states generated by a GaNAs spin filter is needed to realize practical opto-spintronics applications. This study examined the impacts of the GaNAs thickness on the room-temperature spin-polarized luminescence properties of tunnel-coupled InAs quantum dots (QDs) through polarization- and time-resolved photoluminescence in combination with a rate equation analysis. Reducing the GaNAs thickness from 20 to 5 nm increased the QD luminescence intensity by over an order of magnitude at low excitation powers. This increased luminescence was attributed to decreased electron capture in the deep-level defect states of GaNAs, which resulted from fewer defects in thinner GaNAs layers. Furthermore, the reduction in GaNAs thickness decreased the excitation power needed to maximize electron spin polarization of QDs while maintaining a near-maximum value. This efficient spin-amplified luminescence of QDs was achieved through spin-selective capture of QD electrons by defect states under low excitation spin densities. These results demonstrate that using a thin GaNAs spin filter can result in strong QD luminescence and high circular polarization at room temperature and low excitation spin densities. The findings give valuable implications for the development of spin-functional optical devices utilizing a GaNAs spin filter.},

However, as a potential spintronic material, its spin related properties have not been fully understood yet. We investigate the efficiency of spin current detection in GeSn by using the technique of ferromagnetic resonance drive spin pumping. Some fundamental spintronic parameters can be extracted from our experimental results to measure the change of spin injection/conversion efficiency. A Co layer is deposited on the top GeSn thin films to serve as the spin current generator. Here, the effective spin mixing conductance ( ⁠ g eff ↑ ↓ ⁠ ) and the product of spin diffusion length and spin Hall angle [ λ s θ ISHE (%)] represent the spin injection efficiency and the spin-charge conversion efficiency, respectively. g eff ↑ ↓ and λ s θ ISHE (%) are 9.3 × 10 19 m −2 and 1.39 nm for p -type GeSn; and 7.4 × 10 19 m −2 and 2.09 nm for n -type GeSn. The high-efficient spin injection in both p- type and n- type Co/GeSn systems is attributed to a low barrier height at the Co/GeSn interface because the spin current at the interface is proportional to the square root of barrier height. Our experimental results show that GeSn is effective as a spin current sink.},

The results show that the film levitates at the height of the original standing wave node and at discrete horizontal positions approximately every transducer interval. The levitated film vibrates at the same frequency as the ultrasonic transducer and cannot be regarded as rigid against ultrasonic waves. Different film materials and thicknesses were examined, including metal foils and wood papers. In this study, the maximum surface density of the films that levitated was 3.5 × 10 − 2 mg/mm 2 .

To date, the role of such effects in the accuracy and limitations of the measurement has not been addressed. Here, we present an advanced thermal model to capture the role of material properties, laser power, and film thickness in the thermal size effects, based on the three-dimensional (3D) gray phonon Boltzmann transport equation. Recalling that laser-induced thermal size effects can lead to unexpectedly high local temperatures, even damaging the measured materials, our advanced 3D model gains particular importance for the accurate measurements of directional thermal conductivities in submicrometer structures using future high-resolution optical pump–probe techniques.},

  abstract     = {The phase change of a liquid into vapor results in a sharp volume expansion, generating a powerful driving force, which is fundamental for the operation of pulsating heat pipes (PHPs). However, the performance of PHPs is hindered by instability arising from the lack of directional control over the expansion process. In this work, we propose a PHP incorporating thermal-to-mechanical energy conversion (TMC) microstructures, which direct the TMC by controlling the expansion in desired directions, thereby more efficiently utilizing the driving force. Two designs for enhancement of TMC, i.e., one featuring a vapor actuator microstructure (VA-PHP) and another with diameter-variant channels (DVC-PHP), were fabricated and experimentally investigated under low inclination angles and horizontal orientations (0°, 1°, 5°, and 9°). The experimental results indicated that the incorporation of the TMC microstructures into the PHPs facilitated more efficient startup, enhanced unidirectional circulation, and reduced the dependence on the inclination angle. Notably, while the conventional PHP failed to operate at small inclination angles, the VA-PHP achieved stable operation at 1°, and the DVC-PHP further maintained stable operation even at 0°. The robust performance of the proposed PHPs at low inclination angles demonstrates the potential of TMC microstructures to overcome orientation-dependent limitations, thereby delivering a practical solution for improving the effectiveness of PHPs.},

It is, therefore, in hot pursuit of seeking solid-state electrolyte materials with high energy density and flexible operation conditions. Here, we verified a class of two-dimensional superionic conduction in A(BC) 2 , in which A are alkaline earth metals such as Be, Mg, and Ca, and boron–carbon (BC) form graphene-like layers. Our first-principles molecular dynamics simulation, boosted by high-accuracy machine-leaning potentials, shows that alkaline metal becomes super-ions under high-temperature conditions, moving freely between BC layers. Differences in superionic conduit lead to the diffusion in Be(BC) 2 driven by the vacancy mechanism. In contrast, the diffusion in Mg(BC) 2 and Ca(BC) 2 is jointly driven by both the vacancy and cooperative mechanisms. We demonstrate that the superionic transition temperature is controlled by the deficiency of mobile super-ions, tuning from 1300 to 1600 K, with up to 2.5% cation defects. With superior thermal stability, these two-dimensional compounds are promising electrolyte materials with ultrahigh heat resistivity capable of operating under high-temperature environments such as deep drills and aerospace devices.},

  abstract     = {Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) is sustainable and environmentally friendly. Titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) is commonly chosen as a photocatalyst of PHE due to its non-toxicity, robust stability, and superior photocatalytic activity. However, the efficacy of TiO 2 is restricted by rapid electron–hole pair recombination, limited electron mobility, and sluggish surface reactions. To address these issues, we have synthesized a Ni–P alloy onto the surface of TiO 2 (Ni–P/TiO 2 ) using a safe and efficient photo-deposition method, thereby constructing a Schottky heterojunction photocatalyst. The construction of the heterojunction significantly reduces the recombination rates of photoinduced electron–hole pairs and enhances the charge transfer rates within the photocatalyst. Additionally, the incorporation of the Ni–P alloy increases the density of oxygen vacancies, providing abundant active sites for the reduction reaction. The metallic properties of the Ni–P alloy improve the overall light absorption capacity. As a result, Ni–P/TiO 2 exhibits exceptional photocatalytic hydrogen production capability. When the mass ratio of the Ni–P alloy to TiO 2 is 12 wt. %, the hydrogen evolution rate reaches its maximum value at 1654.2 μ mol g −1 h −1 . Furthermore, density functional theory calculations substantiate that the formation of an internal electric field between the Ni–P alloy and TiO 2 facilitates electron migration and carrier separation. This investigation provides a promising strategy for constructing TiO 2 -based Schottky heterojunctions to improve the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance.},

The ELO technology reduced the damage of AlN thin films and Si wafer during the ELO process due to the selective etching of AlN and BaF 2 .

Subsequent post-annealing of the as-grown VO x thin films at 500 °C in atmospheres of air, 1 Pa O 2 , and vacuum (10 −4 Pa) could, respectively, result in the crystallization of V 2 O 5 , VO 2 , and V 2 O 3 phases, as verified by x-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) reveals that the valence states of vanadium in the annealed thin films exhibit dramatic changes with the variation of annealing atmosphere toward the targeted phases. The VO 2 thin film exhibits a sharp metal–insulator transition (MIT) near 340 K with a resistivity change exceeding three orders of magnitude. The V 2 O 3 thin film features a characteristic MIT with obvious thermal hysteresis between the cooling and warming processes, whereas the V 2 O 5 thin film is highly insulating. The spectral weight near the Fermi level revealed by the XPS in the valence band region coincides with the changes of VO x phases and consequent transport properties due to post-annealing. Our results demonstrate that the combination of ALD and post-annealing provides a facile method for the synthesis of multivalent VO x thin films for practical applications.},

  abstract     = {The quantum Hall effect arises when electrons in a two-dimensional plane are subjected to a magnetic field, causing them to undergo cyclotron motion and form discrete energy levels, known as Landau levels. These levels play a critical role in condensed matter physics. However, practical limitations of applying a magnetic field have led to the introduction of pseudomagnetic fields, which can similarly induce Landau levels. Such pseudomagnetic fields are typically generated through synthetic strain, achieved by deforming geometric patterns, and have been applied to systems like graphene, photons, and phonon crystals. Building on previous research in electronics and optics, we present a plasmonic metasurface that induces Landau levels via synthetic strain in the microwave frequency range. This strain is realized by printing metal structures of specific shapes on a dielectric substrate using printed circuit board technology. The fundamental unit of the plasmonic metasurface is a C 6 symmetric structure composed of six localized surface plasmon patches. By applying a displacement function along the transmission direction, we discretize the dispersion curve, leading to band degeneration and the emergence of edge states. The distribution of these edge states is influenced by the strength of the pseudomagnetic field, which is controlled by the magnitude of the displacement function. We validate our design through fabricated models and demonstrate the existence of edge states using near-field scanning experiments. Our work, which combines synthetic magnetic fields and plasmonic metasurface, provides valuable insights for the development and application of integrated photonic devices.},

  abstract     = {Crude oil spill accidents cause extreme environmental damage, with huge economic costs that include the loss of oil resources. Despite the advances in conventional oil spill cleanup technology, such as dispersants, absorbents, and skimmers, there is still a need for more efficient solutions. In this study, we introduce a Joule-heated stearic acid/carbon nanotube-wrapped polyurethane sponge (SCPU) for rapid and all-weather recovery of leaked crude oil. SCPU is both hydrophobic and oleophilic and is electrically conductive. When 6 V were applied across the SCPU, the surface temperature increased to 146 °C within 70 s, which reduced the viscosity of crude oil and shortened the recovery time by over 99%. In addition, the Joule-heated SCPU can continuously recover crude oil floating on the water surface when connected to a peristaltic pump. This Joule-heated SCPU has a high crude oil adsorption capacity, a scalable preparation method, and is mechanically stable, and thus is expected to provide an efficient and practical solution for responding to crude oil spill accidents.},

An asymmetric electrode structure can effectively separate photogenerated electron–hole pairs by introducing an internal electric field, thereby facilitating faster carrier transport and significantly reducing the response time. In this study, we utilized PdSe 2 , a semi-metal, as an electrode to construct an asymmetric electrode structure in conjunction with Ti–Au electrode, aiming to enhance the performance of Bi 2 O 2 Se NIR photodetectors. The response time of the PdSe 2 /Bi 2 O 2 Se/Ti–Au photodetector was 21 and 16 μ s under 1064 and 1550 nm light sources, respectively, with a responsivity of 121 mA/W at 1064 nm.

  abstract     = {Mode-locked lasers with narrow spectral bandwidths and high power spectral density are valuable for various applications that require selective and efficient light–matter interactions. However, mode-locked lasers in the mid-infrared (MIR) region so far face significant challenges in both narrowing the spectral width and expanding the tunable range. In this work, we demonstrate a Fourier transform-limited pulsed laser with ultra-narrow bandwidth by utilizing the frequency-modulated (FM) mode-locking technique in a Cr:ZnS laser. The proposed laser achieves a spectral width of ∼2 GHz (∼40 pm) and a pulse duration of ∼200 ps within a wide tunable range from 1966 to 2572 nm. By incorporating an etalon into the cavity, the spectral width is further narrowed to ∼500 MHz (∼8 pm), and the pulse duration is extended to ∼1 ns. We also find unique detuning characteristics of the FM mode-locked laser in that the narrowband mode-locked state is maintained over a large detuning frequency of ∼20 kHz, while its operating wavelength varies linearly with detuning. This property indicates a significantly better resistance to cavity length fluctuations compared to other active mode-locking schemes as well as a promising way to achieve precise wavelength fine-tuning through electronic control. The demonstrated laser, featuring an ultra-narrow spectral width at a desired mid-infrared wavelength, offers a powerful tool for high-resolution and high-sensitivity spectroscopy and coherent control of molecular vibrations.},

Therefore, improving the manipulation of strong-field THz coupling and propagation characteristics, particularly through the use of metal wire waveguides, is crucial. To this end, we systematically investigate the coupling and propagation characteristics of strong-field THz waves on the surface of tungsten wires and implement two effective coupling methods: two-wire coupling and crossover coupling. This allows for a propagation distance of up to 100 mm along the tungsten surface as THz surface waves. This effective control of strong-field THz waves using metal wires enables the guidance of THz waves from free space into transmission lines and waveguides, which holds significant value for various specific applications.},

Despite their promising applications in optical document security, they have been the subject of only a handful of research efforts, underscoring the need for further exploration in this area. Here, we propose a hybrid metasurface that achieves this functionality and thoroughly characterize its performance using simulations. In our device, nanohole arrays in an aluminum film function as plasmonic color filters for blue, green, and red channels with low crosstalk. Amorphous titanium dioxide (aTiO 2 ) nanopillars comprise the hologram metasurface, which modulates the outgoing light&#39;s phase to produce a holographic image. Due to the subwavelength dimensions of the unit cell of the color filter (e.g., 415 nm for red, 315 nm for green, and 255 nm for blue wavelengths) and metasurface hologram (e.g., 430 nm for red, 360 nm for green, and 305 nm for blue wavelengths), the color print and holographic images can have very high resolution. Simulations reveal that the metasurface can be perceived as a tricolor image under incoherent white light, whereas under illumination from red, green, and blue lasers, three distinct holographic images can be observed.},

High- Q Si photonic nanocavities with asymmetric claddings offer mechanical stability, high functionalities from heterogeneous materials, and vertical integration of optoelectronic devices. However, achieving a high Q factor in an asymmetric structure remains challenging because of the TE–TM coupling loss in the Si slab. To suppress the TE–TM coupling, we designed a high- Q two-dimensional (2D) Si photonic crystal slot cavity by significantly reducing the electric field components in the slab, leveraging a large dielectric discontinuity between Si and the low-index slot. We fabricated 2D Si photonic crystal slot nanocavities with asymmetric claddings consisting of a lower cladding of thermal oxide ( n lc = n BOX = 1.45) and an upper cladding of infiltrated spin-on glass ( n uc = n SOG = 1.3). The Q factor of this slot cavity is as high as 6.32 × 10 5 , which is the highest Q value ever recorded among nanocavities with asymmetric claddings. Our results are useful for heterogeneous integration of Si photonic crystal nanocavities with various functionalities such as active and nonlinear optical materials, which are unattainable in conventional Si photonics.},

A performance evaluation framework based on the analytic hierarchy process technique for order preference by similarity to the ideal solution method identified the insulation–polarization–polarization–insulation topology as the optimal configuration. This structure enhanced the dielectric performance (ε r /tan δ) by 239.44% over pure PVDF at 10 3 Hz, increased thermal conductivity by 60.45%, and improved breakdown field strength. In addition, charge–discharge efficiency at 300 MV/m reached 75%, with a discharge density of 6.3 J/cm 3 , which is 152% higher than PVDF. The multilayer design effectively integrates the strengths of each layer to significantly enhance the overall performance, demonstrating that operational research methods are practical for evaluating dielectric materials and guiding design.},

  abstract = {2 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) field-cycling relaxometry and broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS) studies show that water dynamics in silica pores with similar diameters (∼6 nm) strongly depend on the functionalization of the inner surfaces. In all studied confinements, we observe two prominent changes in the temperature dependence of water reorientation. Specifically, the activation energy of E a ∼ 0.3 eV in the fully liquid state more than triples to E a ∼ 1.0 eV upon partial crystallization at T m ∼ 258 K. Furthermore, in the partially crystallized state, the liquid fraction shows a dynamical crossover at ∼185 K, where the common low-temperature behavior of confined water with E a = 0.4–0.5 eV is established. However, the correlation times of water reorientation are up to two orders of magnitude longer in amino-acid functionalized silica pores than in pristine ones. Comparing the results for different functional groups, NMR and BDS consistently show that the slowdown is strongest for basic lysine followed by neutral alanine and, finally, acidic glutamic acid. Based on this order, one may speculate that the changed dynamics are a consequence of different pH values of water in confinements with different functional groups. Although pH measurements confirm that the pH value strongly depends on the amino-acid functionalization, this speculation must be rejected due to the observation that water with very different pH values does not show diverse reorientation dynamics when enclosed in identical pores.},

  abstract = {In this study, N-doped few-layer MoS 2 piezocatalysts were successfully prepared by a one-pot hydrothermal method with urea as a nitrogen source. Benefiting from the optimized proportion of minority layers at edge positions and higher conductivity by N doping, the optimal N-doped few-layer MoS 2 (120 mg of added urea) sample showed the optimal piezocatalytic activity for Rhodamine B (RhB) and levofloxacin (LEV), reaching 84.6 and 73.1% with the reaction kinetic rate constant of 0.020 86 and 0.017 05 min −1 , respectively. In addition, the generation of superoxide radicals (·O 2 − ) from the 120-MoS 2 sample was determined to be greater than that from the 0-MoS 2 sample in the piezocatalyst process by free radical scavenging experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance tests. Based on experimental data, a potential mechanism has been proposed to explain the enhanced piezocatalyst performance of N-doped few-layer MoS 2 . This research sheds new light on the development of efficient, cost-effective MoS 2 piezoelectric catalysts through the doping of non-metallic dopants.},

  abstract = {Crystallization due to liquid → solid transformation is observed in many natural and engineering processes. Extant literature indicates that crystallization in supercooled liquids is initiated by precursory metastable phases or states, also called non-classical nucleation. For face-centered cubic (FCC) materials, latest experimental and computational studies suggest that metastable hexagonal-closed packed (HCP) structures facilitate equilibrium FCC formation. However, the underlying nucleation mechanism remains unclear. Here, we examine structural changes and energetic barriers associated with such a non-classical mechanism, by performing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using pure Al, Al-0.5 at. %Cu, and Al-0.5 at. %Ni (all FCC-formers) and phenomenologically coupling MD results with phase-field (PF) modeling. Such a coupling involved initializing PF simulation domains and constructing Landau polynomials—consistent with MD observations. Unsupervised machine learning was utilized to capture nuclei structures from MD simulations, while neural networks helped in extracting equilibrium interfacial energies from PF modeling. Atomistic simulations showed that precursory nuclei are comprised of collection of metastable-HCP states with medium ranged ordering. The pockets of HCP states later transform to critical nuclei—containing an FCC core and an outer layer of HCP. PF modeling qualitatively replicated the precursory-to-critical nuclei transformation and showed that the energetic barriers between the precursory and critical nuclei are substantially smaller than predictions obtained from classical nucleation theory. Together, these observations permitted us to propose a holistic non-classical mechanism that links triangular motifs within Al-based supercooled liquids to the critical nuclei via in-liquid structural transformations.},

We clarified that for rigid molecules aligned by dipole transitions, the positions of any two atoms depend on the molecular chirality, owing to the parity-odd second-rank tensors. This type of asymmetry, hidden in the so-called one-dimensional alignment, such as cos 2 θ , can be understood on the basis of the equivalence of inversion and rotation for any two points in space. Perfect chiral sensitivity is achieved when the transition dipole moment is 45° to an axis perpendicular to both position vectors of the two atoms. The positions of two specific atoms are calculated for a chiral isotopomer and methyloxirane using the spherical harmonic addition theorem. We discuss the absolute configuration and the orientation of chiral molecules.},

The solvated electrons were generated by the propagation of a femtosecond laser pump pulse. In the area with a pump laser intensity over 2 × 10 13 W/cm 2 , where a high density of free electrons was produced, solvated electrons exhibited an additional rapid increase in optical density (OD) at 800 nm, 7–9 ps after the pump pulse excitation. In contrast, no two-step increase in OD was observed when probed at 400 nm, suggesting that the absorption coefficient of the solvated electrons rapidly changed around 800 nm after femtosecond laser excitation for a few picoseconds. This observation might indicate the structural and electronic modulation of solvated electrons owing to the high density of free electrons in water, accompanied by femtosecond-laser-induced plasma generation.},

  abstract = {Benzophenone serves as a prototype chromophore for studying the photochemistry of aromatic ketones, with applications ranging from biochemistry to organic light-emitting diodes. In particular, its intersystem crossing from the first singlet excited state to triplet states has been extensively studied, but experimental or theoretical studies on the preceding internal conversion within the singlet manifold are very rare. This relaxation mechanism is particularly important because direct population transfer of the first singlet excited state from the ground state is inefficient due to its low oscillator strength. In this work, our aim is to fill this gap by employing mixed quantum-classical and full quantum dynamics simulations and time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy for gas-phase benzophenone and meta -methyl benzophenone. Our results show that nonadiabatic relaxation via conical intersections leads to an increase in the population of the first singlet excited state, which appears linear within the simulation time of 500 fs. This population transfer due to conical intersections can be directly detected by a bifurcation of the photoelectron signal. In addition, we discuss to clarify the role of the third singlet excited state degenerate to the second excited state—a topic that remains largely unexplored in the existing literature on benzophenone.},

Atomic oxygen was detected using the Raman transitions between the spin–orbit coupled triplet ground states. Atomic oxygen was generated in an H 2 /O 2 /Ar diffusion flame and an O 2 /Ar pulsed plasma discharge. Single exponential decays were observed for the O( 3 P 2 )–O( 3 P 1 ) Raman transition at 158.3 cm −1 and the O( 3 P 2 )–O( 3 P 0 ) Raman transition at 227 cm −1 . From the decay measurements, the atomic O Raman linewidths were obtained from 25 to 150 Torr in non-equilibrium plasma and at 760 Torr in a flame. Enhanced signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of atomic oxygen and atomic to molecular oxygen signal contrasts were obtained by taking advantage of electronic triplet coherence beating. Enhancement of up to seven times in the atomic O SNR was observed. We also found that the dephasing rates of O 2 (v = 0–3, N = 37) were similar, which provides evidence for the assumption that vibrational excitation does not influence the dephasing of diatomic molecular rotational CARS transitions.},

In this work, we employ the highly accurate hierarchical equations of motion method to characterize the spin states and track the real-time coherent flip-flop spin dynamics in a surface-adsorbed hydrogenated Ti dimer. Our simulations accurately reproduce the experimental observations and reveal the influences of substrate and pulse duration on the spin decoherence process of the dimer.

While the original q-space PFG NMR relies on strong magnetic field gradients in order to achieve high spatial resolution, our current approach reaches comparable or higher resolution using much weaker gradients. As a model system, we simulated gas diffusion for xenon confined within carbon nanotubes over a range of temperatures and nanotube diameters in order to unveil manifestations of confinement in the diffusion behavior. We report a multiscale scheme that couples the above-mentioned MD simulations with the generalized Langevin equation to estimate the transport properties of interest for this problem, such as diffusivity coefficients and NMR line shapes, using the Green–Kubo correlation function to correctly evaluate time-dependent diffusion. Our results highlight how NMR methodologies can be adapted as effective means toward structural investigation at very small scales when dealing with complicated geometries.

  abstract = {Delta-T shot noise is activated in temperature-biased electronic junctions, down to the atomic scale. It is characterized by a quadratic dependence on the temperature difference and a nonlinear relationship with the transmission coefficients of partially opened conduction channels. In this work, we demonstrate that delta-T noise, measured across an ensemble of atomic-scale junctions, can be utilized to estimate the temperature bias in these systems. Our approach employs a supervised machine learning algorithm to train a neural network, with input features being the scaled electrical conductance, the delta-T noise, and the mean temperature. Due to limited experimental data, we generate synthetic datasets, designed to mimic experiments. The neural network, trained on these synthetic data, was subsequently applied to predict temperature biases from experimental datasets. Using performance metrics, we demonstrate that the mean bias—the deviation of predicted temperature differences from their true value—is less than 1 K for junctions with conductance up to 4 G 0 . Our study highlights that, while a single delta-T noise measurement is insufficient for accurately estimating the applied temperature bias due to noise contributions from other sources, averaging over an ensemble of junctions enables predictions within experimental uncertainties. This suggests that machine learning approaches can be utilized for estimation of temperature biases and similarly other stimuli in electronic junctions.},

  abstract = {Peptide classification using nanopore-based devices promises to be a breakthrough method in basic research, diagnostics, and analytics. However, the measured blockage currents suffer from a low signal-to-noise ratio and a high information density that has hitherto not been fully deciphered. Some simple machine learning approaches using average current blockade depths and dwell-times have been investigated to improve this situation. In this work, a comprehensive statistical analysis of nanopore current signals is performed and demonstrated to be sufficient for classifying up to 42 peptides with over 70% accuracy. Two sets of features, the statistical moments and the catch22 set, are compared both in their representations and after training small classifier neural networks. We demonstrate that complex features of the events, captured in both the catch22 set and the central moments, are key to classifying peptides with otherwise similar mean currents. These results highlight the efficacy of purely statistical analysis of nanopore data and suggest a path forward for more sophisticated classification techniques.},

  abstract = {Aqueous phase heterogeneous catalysis is important to various industrial processes, including biomass conversion, Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, and electrocatalysis. Accurate calculation of solvation thermodynamic properties is essential for modeling the performance of catalysts for these processes. Explicit solvation methods employing multiscale modeling, e.g., involving density functional theory and molecular dynamics have emerged for this purpose. Although accurate, these methods are computationally intensive. This study introduces machine learning (ML) models to predict solvation thermodynamics for adsorbates on a Pt(111) surface, aiming to enhance computational efficiency without compromising accuracy. In particular, ML models are developed using a combination of molecular descriptors and fingerprints and trained on previously published water–adsorbate interaction energies, energies of solvation, and free energies of solvation of adsorbates bound to Pt(111). These models achieve root mean square error values of 0.09 eV for interaction energies, 0.04 eV for energies of solvation, and 0.06 eV for free energies of solvation, demonstrating accuracy within the standard error of multiscale modeling. Feature importance analysis reveals that hydrogen bonding, van der Waals interactions, and solvent density, together with the properties of the adsorbate, are critical factors influencing solvation thermodynamics. These findings suggest that ML models can provide rapid and reliable predictions of solvation properties. This approach not only reduces computational costs but also offers insights into the solvation characteristics of adsorbates at Pt(111)–water interfaces.},

We have performed dynamics simulations in four ab initio molecular models for which benchmark ab initio multiple spawning (AIMS) data have been published. We find that the spin-LSC and the previously reported symmetric quasi-classical (SQC) approaches provide nearly equivalent population dynamics. While we expected the more involved spin-PLDM method to provide superior accuracy compared to the other mapping-based approaches, SQC and spin-LSC, we found that it performed with equivalent accuracy compared to the AIMS benchmark results. We further explore the underpinnings of the spin-PLDM correlation function by decomposing its N 2 density matrix-focused initial conditions, where N is the number of states in the quantum subsystem. Finally, we found an approximate form of the spin-PLDM correlation function, which simplifies the simulation and reduces the computational costs from N 2 to N .},

This allows us to fully include the impact of spin–orbit coupling in relativistic calculations and for applications to finite magnetic fields. For the latter, we use London atomic orbitals to ensure gauge origin invariance. It is shown that this formalism is superior to the more common canonical noncollinear approach in relativistic calculations, as it naturally includes all three spin current densities in the closed-shell limit and avoids the projection onto the spin magnetization vector. This is important to easily restore rotational invariance in this limit. In addition, the Scalmani–Frisch approach can be made numerically stable and may lead to a nonvanishing local magnetic torque. However, both formalisms are rotationally invariant for open-shell systems and in finite magnetic fields.},

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations applied to various special tasks such as thermostats, barostats, external volume control, or external magnetic fields often require tailored integration methods, complicating software development. Here, we propose a unified integration scheme for solving the common sets of equations of motion in MD. To achieve this, we adapted the traditional SHAKE method for treating rigid bonds to a predictor–corrector integration scheme and combined it with the existing time-reversible velocity predictor and box predictor. This new approach enables using both the time-honored Verlet method and the recently improved Gear methods. The resulting unified integration scheme was tested on two simple models and two MD systems: SPC/E water and ionic liquid (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoridoborate). Trajectories in microcanonical, Nosé–Hoover canonical, and MTK isobaric ensembles were generated. The results for Verlet-based methods were in excellent agreement with those obtained using conventional integration methods. For particular tasks, the use of higher-order methods can be beneficial. Overall, in comparison with standard approaches, our universal scheme provides a significantly simpler route to devising new integrators and maintaining existing simulation software. Furthermore, our family of new integrators can be efficiently deployed in massively parallel MD software.},

Following our earlier bond energies from bond orders and populations model that takes a similar form as an extended Hückel model but uses well-conditioned orbital populations, this work demonstrates a proof of concept for approximating ZPEs, an important component in thermochemistry calculations, while eschewing unfavorably scaling algorithms involving Hessian matrices. The ZPE-BOP1 model uses Mulliken orbital populations from hybrid Kohn–Sham density functional theory calculations within an extended Hückel-type model that defines vibrational bond energy terms using two atom-pairwise parameters that are fit to reproduce ZPEs from B3LYP calculations. The more accurate ZPE-BOP2 model uses Mulliken orbital populations from Hartree–Fock calculations within a different extended Hückel-type model that includes a short-range anharmonic energy term and a coupled three-body oscillator energy term with seven atom-pairwise parameters. Both models predict ZPEs in molecules involving first row elements, but ZPE-BOP2 outperforms ZPE-BOP1 in strained and long-chain molecules and provides ZPEs more competitive with those from semi-empirical QM methods (e.g., AM1, PM6, PM7, and XTB-2) that compute ZPEs with Hessian calculations. This work shows progress and an outlook toward computational models that use well-conditioned orbital populations to efficiently predict useful physicochemical properties. It also shows opportunities for approximate QM models that would shift traditional computational bottlenecks away from costly algorithms such as Hessian calculations to others that focus on reliable orbital populations.},

Rather than evaluating the evolution of the mixed quantum–classical density operator, we derive exact equations of motion for the nonequilibrium average values of a set of operators or variables, along with correlation function expressions for the dissipative coefficients that enter these equations. These equations are obtained by requiring that the exact nonequilibrium averages are equal to local nonequilibrium averages that depend on auxiliary fields whose values satisfy evolution equations obtained using projection operator methods. The results are illustrated by deriving reaction–diffusion equations coupled to fluid hydrodynamic equations for a solution of quantum particles that can exist in two metastable states. Nonequilibrium steady states are discussed along with the reaction rate and diffusion correlation functions that characterize such states.},

Accelerated tasks include matrix multiplication, diagonalization, and inversion, as well as Cholesky decomposition. The scaling of the implemented strategy over multiple accelerating devices is assessed in the range of 1–8 GPUs per node and found to be remarkably regular. Tests are performed on three systems: α -quartz, a microporous zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8), and a giant mesoporous metal–organic framework (bio-MOF). Scaling with system size is investigated via supercells of increasing size of both α -quartz and ZIF-8 (up to 648 and 2208 atoms per cell, respectively). The bio-MOF model structure has 2808 atoms per cell, with 33 672 basis functions. We test the performance of the accelerated code with both generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and hybrid GGA exchange–correlation functionals. The efficiency of the new accelerated code is compared to the previous central processing unit (CPU)-only parallelization strategies based on MPI or MPI/OpenMP within either replicated or distributed memory (i.e., massively parallel) approaches. Such a comparison highlights how the new GPU-accelerated code enables calculations on large systems at a significantly reduced computational cost relative to CPU-only strategies. For instance, we find that for the bio-MOF system, the computing time of the linear algebra tasks from a single GPU is comparable to that from the reference approach in the range of 512–1024 CPU cores and 4–8 nodes.},

In this context, computer simulation setups with well-defined open-boundary equilibrium starting states are essential in understanding and assisting experimental studies. However, open-boundary computational methods are scarce and do not typically satisfy all the equilibrium conditions imposed by reality. Namely, in the absence of external gradients, (1) the system of interest (SoI) must be at thermodynamic and chemical equilibrium with an infinite reservoir of particles; (2) the fluctuations of the SoI in equilibrium should sample the grand canonical ensemble; (3) the local solvation thermodynamics, which is extremely sensitive to finite-size effects due to solvent depletion, should be correctly described. This point is particularly relevant for out-of-equilibrium systems; and (4) finally, the method should be robust enough to deal with phase transitions and coexistence conditions in the SoI. In this study, we demonstrate with prototypical liquid systems embedded into a reservoir of ideal gas particles that the adaptive resolution simulation (AdResS) method, coupled with particle insertion/deletion steps (AdResS+PI), satisfies all these requirements. Therefore, the AdResS+PI setup is suitable for performing grand canonical and stationary non-equilibrium simulations of open systems.},

Interestingly, cluster aggregates at moderate/low temperatures approach a cluster glassy phase, whereas cluster particles retain a local liquid-like structure.

  abstract = {Cross-linked networks of semiflexible biopolymers are one of the essential building blocks of life as they are the scaffolds providing mechanical strength to biological cells to handle external stress and regulate shape. These protein structures experience strain at different rates often under confinement such as a membrane. Here, we compute the steady-state dynamics of stress and stress fluctuations in a wall-confined, continuously sheared, reversibly cross-linked, sticker–spacer model of a semiflexible biopolymer network. We find that the averages and fluctuations of shear stress and pressure increase by orders of magnitude when the strain rate is increased above a certain regime. The shear viscosity decreases with increasing strain rate except near the critical strain rate regime where it exhibits an inflection. Upon increasing the strain rate, we note a shift from a long time autocorrelation to an oscillatory and then to a sharply dropping autocorrelation function, endorsed by corresponding changes in the power spectrum of the stress. These outcomes indicate a transition from stick to stick - slip ( stress buildup and relaxation ) and then to slip upon increasing the strain rate, and we posit that this has to be a hallmark intermittent response of a dynamically cross-linked network under continuous shear deformations. We suggest that a fluctuation–dissipation type framework, where the stress is a stochastic process and “resistance to stress” is a function of strain rate, can help us understand the stress dynamics in biopolymer networks.},

  abstract = {This study presents a novel methodology for the separation of quartz and feldspar under neutral and weakly alkaline conditions. Ethyl-bis(dodecyl dimethyl ammonium bromide) (Gemini) is introduced as a new collector in the flotation process, combined with sodium oleate (NaOL) to enhance separation efficiency. The investigation focuses on the adsorption mechanism of these combined collectors on mineral surfaces. While the individual collectors, Gemini and NaOL, were ineffective in differentiating between quartz and feldspar, their combination resulted in significantly improved separation outcomes. Flotation tests indicated that at a pulp pH of 7, with Gemini and NaOL at concentrations of 12 × 10 −5 mol l −1 and molar ratios of 1:1 and 1:2, the flotation recovery of quartz was 46.51% and 40.57% higher than that of potassium feldspar, respectively. Zeta potential measurements, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses, and molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that the Gemini collector predominantly influences the flotation performance of quartz and feldspar. NaOL molecules do not directly adsorb onto the quartz surface; instead, they co-adsorb via electrostatic interactions with Gemini, which minimally affects the interaction dynamics. In contrast, NaOL preferentially adsorbs onto the aluminum, silicon, and other reactive sites on the feldspar surface through its –COO functional group, leading to competitive adsorption with Gemini and consequently diminishing Gemini’s effectiveness on feldspar. This study elucidates the selective separation mechanism of quartz and feldspar using Gemini and NaOL and aims to provide insights into employing combined collectors in diverse separation scenarios to enhance quartz quality.},

  abstract = {Carbonaceous materials have demonstrated extensive potential as anodes for sodium ion batteries (SIBs). Nevertheless, large-scale commercial use is severely hampered by the slow reaction kinetics and rapid capacity fading. Heteroatom doping can create abundant active sites to improve the ion adsorption properties of carbon materials. Here, we report a novel nitrogen/boron co-doped carbon nanosheet (NB-CN) with abundant N–B bonds for efficient Na + storage. B-doped MIL-68 as a carbon precursor can not only achieve uniform B doping but also serve as the nitrogen doping site to form N–B bonds. N, B co-doping could promote ion adsorption with improved hydrophilicity, while the 2D porous structure can accelerate the Na + transfer kinetics. Benefitting from the synergistic effect of dual-doping and hierarchical porosity, NB-CN shows improved Na + storage performance, NB-CN displays a high capacity of 307.1 mA h g −1 in SIBs at 0.1 A g −1 , and still has a reversible capacity of 157 mA h g −1 for SIBs at 4 A g −1 after 8000 cycles. Moreover, the assembled NB-CNs//Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /C full cell also exhibits the potential application prospect. This work provides an insight for designing dual-doped carbon materials for high-performance SIBs.},

  abstract = {Modeling the evolution of the melt front under gravity in the presence of a horizontal thermal gradient is a challenging issue, hitherto tackled exclusively with the concepts and tools of computational continuum thermomechanics, too phenomenologically driven to have satisfactory predictive capabilities. Here, we show that this complex phenomenon is amenable to treatment by the methods and tools of Non-Equilibrium Molecular Dynamics (NEMD). To do so, we addressed all the difficulties caused by the necessity of applying suitable boundary conditions and minimizing surface effects so that the bulk behavior of the system in non-equilibrium conditions can be detected. Sufficient adiabatic separation of the time scales permits us to use macroscopically relatively short—but microscopically long enough—time averages to get the macroscopic bulk behavior of the system accurately. To get an adequate signal-to-noise ratio, we had to use an unphysically large value of the gravity. However, we know from NEMD simulations in transport studies that the phenomena produced are stable over many orders of magnitude. In conclusion, our work proves that molecular simulation can be a good tool to study this family of non-equilibrium phenomena, although further work is needed to achieve quantitative predictive capabilities.},

The selection of the accurate TIP4P/2005 potential for water and the adoption of scaled charges for ions, ±0.85 e for monovalent ions and ±1.70 e for divalent ions, are the key features of the model. The use of scaled charges enhances the description of several properties, including solubility, transport properties, the density maximum, and the water activity in ionic solutions. In this study, we will investigate the performance of scaled charges in describing the properties of inorganic salts containing Cl − , Li + , Na + , and Ca +2 in another polar solvent, methanol. The ion charges and ion–ion interactions were taken from the Madrid-2019 potential, while the accurate OPLS/2016 model was selected for methanol. The protocol used in the development of the Madrid-2019 model, particularly regarding the selection of target properties in the fitting procedure, was applied to create this potential using LiCl, NaCl, and CaCl 2 as inorganic salts. Its predictive ability was evaluated by calculating the density, dielectric constant, self-diffusion coefficients of methanol and ions, and viscosity for methanolic solutions of these three salts. As will be shown, the experimentally observed effects of salt addition are reproduced by the new model, not only qualitatively but also quantitatively. Furthermore, since the interaction potential is compatible with the Madrid-2019 model, we also demonstrated its accurate predictive ability in the ternary system methanol + water + NaCl.},

  abstract = {This paper reports two bimodal first-order transformations in the disordered form III of linezolid. The most notable result was the identification of a transient apparently amorphous state, different from the glass, during slow heating from the glass. This transient state was interpreted as resulting from the competition between two organizations, i.e., a locally preferred structure reminiscent of the ordered form and the long-range order of the disordered form, energetically closer to the undercooled liquid than the ordered form. The first-order transformation of the undercooled liquid in this short lifetime amorphous state reflects a polyamorphism in a pharmaceutical active ingredient, which is a very unusual feature in the domain of solid-state transformations in molecular materials. Meanwhile, the bimodal polymorphic transformation of the stable crystalline form II into form III via a transient liquid state during rapid heating can also be considered as an uncommon feature for a polymorphic transition. It was found that both atypical transformations assisted by thermally activated conformational motions into the disordered crystalline form III could be kinetically hindered by the high energy barrier between conformational polymorphs. As a consequence, the polyamorphic transformation can only be detected using the rapid acquisition capability of a low-frequency Raman spectrometer, probing the molecular organization from short- to long-range order.},

  abstract = {Quantum batteries (QBs) have garnered attention as candidates for energy storage devices due to their inherent quantum advantages over classical electrochemical batteries. However, owing to the vulnerability of quantum resources to disorder, the ability of a charged QB to effectively store and discharge energy may be adversely affected by mechanical motions, thermal fluctuations, impurities, and defects in the QB. In this connection, we study the effects of (i) Gaussian static disorder, Gaussian white noise, and Gaussian colored noise in the onsite energies and electronic couplings and (ii) periodic oscillations in the electronic couplings on the exciton storage efficiency and exciton discharge rate of an open excitonic QB model—an open quantum system that stores and discharges excitons. To efficiently average over the many possible noise realizations, we employ an accurate mixed quantum–classical dynamics method that treats the QB quantum mechanically and the thermal baths in a classical-like way. The results reveal that the exciton storage efficiency decreases as the disorder strength increases, with static disorder causing the largest reductions followed by colored noise and white noise. In contrast, the exciton discharge rate remains mainly unaffected by the different types of disorder, even under very strong disorders. Moreover, depending on the model parameters, the incorporation of periodic oscillations into the electronic couplings could either enhance, have no significant effect on, or decrease the exciton discharge rate. Overall, our study elucidates the effects of different types of disorder and inter-site vibrations on the exciton dynamics in a charged QB, thereby shedding light on the importance of environmental noise engineering and mitigation in open QBs.},

The PES was constructed based on more than 51 000 ab initio points, which were calculated at the multi-reference configuration interaction level with Davidson correction using the augmented correlation consistent polarized valence triple zeta basis set. Based on the newly constructed PES, quasi-classical trajectory calculations were carried out to study the photodissociation dynamics of HPCO at the total energy ranging from 4.0 to 5.6 eV. At low total energies, the HP + CO product is dominant, while the product H + PCO becomes increasingly favored at higher energies. Furthermore, the translational energy distributions of two products are found to be energy-dependent. Owing to the strongly repulsive PES along the HP + CO dissociation pathway, the translational energy distributions of HP + CO are dominated by relatively higher energies in contrast to H + PCO. The diatomic products HP and CO are found to possess the vibrational distributions decaying monotonically with the vibrational quantum number and relatively cold rotational state distributions, consistent with the strongly repulsive potentials toward the HP + CO channel. In addition, the vibrational distributions of HP and CO are found to be quite similar due to their close frequencies, while the rotational distributions of CO have a much more highly excited rotational degree of freedom owing to its rotational constant approximately four times smaller than that of HP.},

Compared to experiments that focus solely on CD 3 ( v 2 = 0), our theoretical calculations give a more global picture. It is found that the vibrational enhancement factors of the total ICS are less than 1 only in the very low collision energy region (&lt;0.55 kcal/mol); moreover, the CH stretch-excited reaction also produces vibrationally cold HCl. These two findings indicate that Polanyi’s rules apply to this late-barrier polyatomic reaction, not only in terms of the energy requirement in the breaking bond but also in the energy disposal in the newly formed bond. In addition, although the experimental and theoretical product HCl( v 1 = 1) branching fractions for CD 3 ( v 2 = 0) are in quantitative agreement, the new quantum vibrational enhancement factor for CD 3 ( v 2 = 0) is ∼2.7 times greater than the experimental results.},

  abstract = {The mechanism of the chemical transformations of isolated small organic molecules induced by high-energy radiation is of basic interest for astrophysics and astrochemistry. In this work, we first applied a combination of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to identify the products of the radiation-induced transformations of isolated CH 3 COOH and CD 3 COOH molecules. As revealed by EPR, · CH 3 (or · CD 3 ) is the principal primary radical generated from acetic acid in solid argon and xenon, while the FTIR results suggest that this radical is trapped mainly in the form of the · CH 3 ⋯CO 2 radical–molecule complex. The assignment of this previously unknown complex was based on the complexation-induced shifts of the absorption bands corresponding to CH 3OPLA and CO 2bend vibration modes, confirmed by analysis of the kinetic curves, photochemical behavior, and comparison with the results of ab initio computations at the spin-unrestricted coupled-cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triples level of theory. Most likely, the complex in matrices adopts the geometry close to the theoretically predicted structure with C s symmetry stabilized by the C⋯C and O⋯H interactions. It was suggested that the complex could be produced via the intermediate formation of a CH 3 COOH +· radical cation deprotonating to the CH 3 COO · radical, which promptly decomposed to · CH 3 + CO 2 fragments. We believe that the results obtained in this study may contribute to a better understanding of the processing of acetic acid molecules in astrophysically relevant ices under high-energy irradiation and give a valuable insight into the understanding of weak intermolecular interactions involving radicals relevant to atmospheric chemistry, combustion, and carbon dioxide conversion.},

In this work, the adsorption of methanol on Co n + ( n = 1–60) clusters is investigated using low-pressure collision cell experiments in combination with time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Experiments are conducted using both methanol and deuterated methanol in order to examine potential isotope effects and to gain insights into the reaction mechanism. Kinetic data and Rice–Ramsperger–Kassel–Marcus calculations indicate the absence of methanol desorption for n &lt; 10 cluster sizes, suggesting dissociative chemisorption of methanol for those sizes. For larger clusters, the reaction involves a combination of association and desorption, with a pronounced size dependence of the corresponding reaction rates. This size dependence is anti-correlated with the promotion energy of an electron from an occupied frontier orbital to the lowest unoccupied d-state.},

  abstract = {The Gibbs method of surface excesses was extended to nanosized objects and exemplified by evaluations of the specific (per unit area) surface excess energies of Ih nanoclusters of fcc metals (Ag, Au, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Pt), the specific (per unit length) line energies of edges of Ih nanoclusters, and excess point energies of their vertices. In particular, for this purpose, an original interpretation of the Gibbs equimolecular surface concept has been employed. To perform all the above-mentioned evaluations, the extended Gibbs method was combined with the nearest neighbor interaction model. The results of our evaluations of the specific surface energy agree with the experimental values of the specific surface energy for corresponding solid bulk fcc metals. Then, we have found that the values of the specific excess line energy of the Ih nanocluster edges are positive and fall in order of magnitude within the range of 10 −10 to 10 −9 J/m, which agrees with the available evaluations for other types of linear boundaries. The vertex point energy was found to be on the order of 10 −20 J and positive as well. A hypothesis is put forward that the positivity of the excess energies of the edges and vertices results in their instability, i.e., in a trend for the formation of a more rounded shape of polyhedral nanoparticles, especially in the vicinity of their melting temperatures. In addition, some molecular dynamics results on Ih metal nanoclusters are discussed. For Au and Pt Ih nanoclusters, the theoretically calculated values of the specific surface energy are compared with those obtained by combining the Gibbs method with our molecular dynamics results on the size dependence of the potential term into the specific (per atom) internal energy of Ih nanoparticles.},

  abstract = {An elusive short-lived mixed dihalide radical anion (BrCl ·− ), produced in water by radiation-induced reactions, has been observed and analyzed by time-resolved resonance Raman spectroscopy (TRRR) and density functional theory. The Raman spectrum of the radical consists of a prominently enhanced stretching vibration, represented by a band at 212 cm −1 and its overtones. Calculations by range-separated hybrid density functionals (ωB97x and LC-ωPBE) reproduce the experimental vibrational frequency well, with a corresponding bond length of 2.713 (±0.028) Å. A first order anharmonicity of ∼1.42 cm −1 determined for the Br–Cl stretching mode in the radical suggests a convergence of vibrational states at an energy of ∼1.01 eV, using the Birge–Sponer extrapolation. This value, estimated for the radical confined in the solvent cage, compares fairly well with the calculated gas-phase energy, 1.06 eV, required for the radical to dissociate into Br · and Cl − fragments. The Raman detection of a closely related radical, ICl ·− , in water was unsuccessful. The reaction pathways and equilibria have been analyzed to discuss the observability of mixed dihalide and analogous radical species.},

  abstract = {Clusters bound by weak, non-covalent forces, such as van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonds, are ubiquitous in dilute media ranging from aerosols to molecular fluids and biological structures, their interest being not only fundamental as in astrochemistry but also more applied as in organic electronics. Neutral clusters of up to six 1-hexene molecules produced by supersonic expansion of a gas mixture were ionized, mass selected, and spectroscopically characterized using synchrotron-based VUV photoelectron photoion coincidence technique. Ionization energies inferred from these measurements show decreasing trends as the cluster size increases, by about 0.5 eV over the range of 1–6 molecules. Dedicated theoretical DFT-based calculations were performed to unravel the possible structures of these clusters and determine their vertical and adiabatic ionization energies. Our computational search for stable structures considered the possible chirality effects associated with most conformers of the monomer having enantiomers, in an approach with a broad structural sampling employing classical force fields followed by systematic re-optimization using an efficient quantum chemical method. Vertical and adiabatic ionization energies obtained using wavefunction-based methods exhibit significant dispersion due to conformational flexibility already in the monomer, but these effects are magnified in clusters due to their fluxionality at the experimental temperature of about 130 K. Overall, the trends obtained for the calculated vertical ionization energies agree well with the measured data and suggest that possible chiral recognition effects that could stabilize specific structures are likely to be hampered under the present experimental conditions.},

The inclusion of GP is found to have a large impact on the scattering resonances and more generally on both the integral cross section (ICS) and differential cross section (DCS).

  abstract = {Coexistence of excitons and free charge carriers can complicate conventional spectroscopic studies of transport mechanisms in layered perovskite solar cells. Because of their large concentrations and absorbance cross sections, excitons tend to dominate spectroscopic signals and obscure observations of free charges in this class of systems. To investigate the effects of interstitial organic molecules on charge transport in photovoltaic devices, we apply a newly developed four-pulse transient grating method with photocurrent detection to layered perovskites possessing a range of quantum well thicknesses. In this method, a phase-stabilized “pump” pulse-pair photoexcites a carrier density grating in the active layer of a photovoltaic cell, whereas transport is time-resolved using the carrier density grating generated by a subsequent “probe” pulse-pair. Carrier diffusion mechanisms are revealed by measuring the recombination-induced nonlinear response of the device while varying the delay between pulse-pairs and phase difference between density gratings. Like drift velocity dispersion, our data suggest that encounters with inorganic–organic interfaces broaden the range of diffusivities in addition to skewing the distributions toward slower transit times. Rather than tunneling through the potential energy barriers associated with the organic material, the experimental measurements support a physical picture in which the photoexcited carriers traverse circuitous paths through the active layer while occupying the phases of the thickest quantum wells.},

  abstract = {The standard paradigm for state preparation on quantum computers for the simulation of physical systems in the near term has been widely explored with different algorithmic methods. One such approach is the optimization of parameterized circuits, but this becomes increasingly challenging with circuit size. As a consequence, the utility of large-scale circuit optimization is relatively unknown. In this work we demonstrate that purely classical resources can be used to optimize quantum circuits in an approximate but robust manner such that we can bridge the resources that we have from high performance computing and see a direct transition to quantum advantage. We show this through the sparse wave function circuit solvers, which we detail here, and demonstrate a region of efficient classic simulation. With such tools, we can avoid the many problems that plague circuit optimization for circuits with hundreds of qubits using only practical and reasonable classical computing resources. These tools allow us to probe the true benefit of variational optimization approaches on quantum computers, thus opening the window to what can be expected with near term hardware for physical systems. We demonstrate this with a unitary coupled cluster ansatz on various molecules up to 64 qubits with tens of thousands of variational parameters.},

The characterization of their extent of delocalization is a crucial element in understanding these quasiparticles. In this paper, I will revisit the most common delocalization measures applied to Frenkel-type excitons. Based on this analysis, I propose to use a so-far ignored measure. The key advantage of this measure, which I will denote as the Manhattan exciton size, is that it directly connects with the oscillator strength of the excitons. It provides a strict upper bound on the oscillator strength of any given exciton for linear aggregates. Finally, I demonstrate that this exciton delocalization measure is more sensible for analyzing super-radiant states compared to, for example, the most commonly applied measure, i.e., the (inverse) participation ratio. However, these two measures together provide insight into the degree of exciton confinement.},

  abstract = {Solvation plays a pivotal role in chemistry to effectively steer chemical reactions. While liquid water has been extensively studied, our molecular-level knowledge of other associated liquids capable of forming H-bond networks, such as liquid methanol, remains surprisingly scarce. We use large-scale ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to comprehensively study the structural, dynamical, and electronic properties of bulk methanol under ambient conditions. Methanol is an interesting species in the liquid state since it can only donate one H-bond while a significant fraction accepts two H-bonds, which imprints one-dimensional linear and cyclic H-bonding patterns subject to significant bifurcations. After validation of radial distribution functions and the self-diffusion coefficient with respect to experimental data, we carried out detailed analyses of the H-bond network topology in terms of chain-like, ring-like, and branched H-bonded aggregates, including lifetime assessment. The analysis revealed that nearly all methanol molecules are actively engaged in filamentary H-bonding, predominantly forming branched linear chains with a significant contribution arising from tetrameric to hexameric rings—in stark contrast to the compact three-dimensional H-bond network of water. Five-membered rings turned out to be the most long-lived cyclic structures with an intermittent lifetime of 4 ps, while rings consisting of only three methanol molecules as well as very large cyclic structures are merely transient motifs. Detailed analyses of the effective electric molecular dipoles disclose a pronounced sensitivity of non-additive polarization and charge transfer effects of the individual methanol molecules to the particular H-bond network structure they are a member of, including its topology, be it linear or cyclic.},

Therefore, this work explores whether atom-pairwise and many-body dispersion treatments represent viable alternatives to using the vdW-DF2 functional with BEEF-vdW. To this end, we investigate the performance of commonly used atom-pairwise corrections [i.e., the Tkatchenko–Scheffler (TS) and the exchange-hole dipole moment (XDM) approaches] and many-body dispersion (MBD) treatments for molecular, surface, and solid-state systems. The results indicate that atom-pairwise methods such as TS and particularly XDM provide a good balance of cost and accuracy across all systems.},

  abstract = {Reaction coordinates are a useful tool that allows the complex dynamics of a protein in high-dimensional phase space to be projected onto a much simpler model with only a few degrees of freedom, while preserving the essential aspects of that dynamics. In this way, reaction coordinates could provide an intuitive, albeit simplified, understanding of the complex dynamics of proteins. Together with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, reaction coordinates can also be used to sample the phase space very efficiently and to calculate transition rates and paths between different metastable states. Unfortunately, ideal reaction coordinates for a system capable of these performances are not known a priori , and an efficient calculation in the course of an MD simulation is currently an active field of research. An alternative is to use geometric reaction coordinates, which, although generally unable to provide quantitative accuracy, are useful for simplified mechanistic models of protein dynamics and can thus help gain insights into the fundamental aspects of these dynamics. In this study, five such geometric reaction coordinates, such as the end-to-end distance, the radius of gyration, the solvent accessible surface area, the root-mean-square distance (RMSD), and the mean native hydrogen bond length, are compared. For this purpose, extensive molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for two peptides and a small protein in order to calculate and compare free energy profiles with the aid of the reaction coordinates mentioned. While none of the investigated geometrical reaction coordinates could be demonstrated to be an optimal reaction coordinate, the RMSD and the mean native hydrogen bond length appeared to perform more effectively than the other three reaction coordinates.},

  abstract = {Small-angle scattering techniques are indispensable tools for probing the structure of soft materials. However, traditional analytical models often face limitations in structural inversion for complex systems, primarily due to the absence of closed-form expressions of scattering functions. To address these challenges, we present a machine learning framework based on the Kolmogorov–Arnold Network (KAN) for directly extracting real-space structural information from scattering spectra in reciprocal space. This model-independent, data-driven approach provides a versatile solution for analyzing intricate configurations in soft matter. By applying the KAN to lyotropic lamellar phases and colloidal suspensions—two representative soft matter systems—we demonstrate its ability to accurately and efficiently resolve structural collectivity and complexity. Our findings highlight the transformative potential of machine learning in enhancing the quantitative analysis of soft materials, paving the way for robust structural inversion across diverse systems.},

  abstract = {Impurity motion in a many-body environment has been a central issue in the field of low-temperature physics for decades. In bosonic quantum fluids, the onset of a drag force experienced by point-like objects is due to collective environment excitations, driven by the exchange of linear momentum between the impurity and the many-body bath. In this work we consider a rotating impurity, with the aim of exploring how angular momentum is exchanged with the surrounding bosonic environment. In order to elucidate these issues, we employ a quasiparticle approach based on the angulon theory, which allows us to effectively deal with the non-trivial algebra of quantized angular momentum in the presence of a many-body environment. We uncover how impurity dressing by environmental excitations can establish an exchange channel, whose effectiveness crucially depends on the initial state of the impurity. Remarkably, we find that there is a critical value of initial angular momentum, above which this channel effectively freezes.},

  abstract = {We compare three model-free numerical methods for inverting structural data to obtain interaction potentials, namely, iterative Boltzmann inversion (IBI), test-particle insertion (TPI), and a machine-learning (ML) approach called ActiveNet. Three archetypal models of two-dimensional colloidal systems are used as test cases: Weeks–Chandler–Anderson short-ranged repulsion, the Lennard-Jones potential, and a repulsive shoulder interaction with two length scales. Additionally, data on an experimental suspension of colloidal spheres are acquired by optical microscopy and used to test the inversion methods. The methods have different merits. IBI is the only choice when the radial distribution function is known but particle coordinates are unavailable. TPI requires snapshots with particle positions and can extract both pair- and higher-body potentials without the need for simulation. The ML approach can only be used when particles can be tracked in time and it returns the force rather than the potential. However, it can unravel pair interactions from any one-body forces (such as drag or propulsion) and does not rely on equilibrium distributions for its derivation. Our results may serve as a guide when a numerical method is needed for application to experimental data and as a reference for further development of the methodology itself.},

  abstract = {FFLUX is a polarizable machine-learning force field that deploys pre-trained kernel-based models of quantum topological properties in molecular dynamics simulations. Despite a track record of successful applications, this unconventional force field still uses Lennard-Jones parameters to account for dispersion effects when performing in-bulk simulations. However, optimal Lennard-Jones parameters are system-dependent and not easy to calibrate. Fortunately, physics-informed dispersion energies can be obtained from the two-particle density matrix (2PDM) of any system using correlated wavefunctions. The only challenge is that the 2PDM is a humongous object whose calculation is very time-consuming and memory-greedy. In this proof-of-concept study, we utilize the Δ-learning method to address both problems using a small set of water trimers. More specifically, we obtain pure two-electron correlation energies with the aug-cc-pVDZ basis set at the cost of Müller-approximated 2PDM calculated at a very small basis set, 6-31+G(d). We also benchmark different Δ-learning tasks designed by changing the baseline and target method and/or the basis set. Our experiments suggest that two-electron correlation energies of weakly relaxed water trimers can be accurately predicted via Δ-learning with a maximum absolute error of 1.30 ± 0.32 kJ/mol traded against a colossal computational speed-up of roughly 40 times.},

Chem. Phys. 156 , 164107 (2022)]. We first provide a systematic derivation of various iterative solvers to find the unique LISA solution. In a subsequent systematic numerical study, we evaluate their performance on 48 organic and inorganic, neutral and charged molecules and also compare LISA to two other well-known ISA variants: the Gaussian iterative stockholder analysis and Minimum Basis Iterative Stockholder analysis (MBIS). The study reveals that LISA-family methods can offer a numerically more efficient approach with better accuracy compared to the two comparative methods. Moreover, the well-known issue with the MBIS method, where atomic charges obtained for negatively charged molecules are anomalously negative, is not observed in LISA-family methods. Despite the fact that LISA occasionally exhibits elevated entropy as a consequence of the absence of more diffuse basis functions, this issue can be readily mitigated by incorporating additional or integrating supplementary basis functions within the LISA framework. This research provides the foundation for future studies on the efficiency and chemical accuracy of molecular density partitioning schemes.},

  abstract = {The evolution of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations has been intimately linked to that of computing hardware. For decades following the creation of MD, simulations have improved with computing power along the three principal dimensions of accuracy, atom count (spatial scale), and duration (temporal scale). Since the mid-2000s, computer platforms have, however, failed to provide strong scaling for MD, as scale-out central processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU) platforms that provide substantial increases to spatial scale do not lead to proportional increases in temporal scale. Important scientific problems therefore remained inaccessible to direct simulation, prompting the development of increasingly sophisticated algorithms that present significant complexity, accuracy, and efficiency challenges. While bespoke MD-only hardware solutions have provided a path to longer timescales for specific physical systems, their impact on the broader community has been mitigated by their limited adaptability to new methods and potentials. In this work, we show that a novel computing architecture, the Cerebras wafer scale engine, completely alters the scaling path by delivering unprecedentedly high simulation rates up to 1.144 M steps/s for 200 000 atoms whose interactions are described by an embedded atom method potential. This enables direct simulations of the evolution of materials using general-purpose programmable hardware over millisecond timescales, dramatically increasing the space of direct MD simulations that can be carried out. In this paper, we provide an overview of advances in MD over the last 60 years and present our recent result in the context of historical MD performance trends.},

The interaction of these energetic species with the liquid phase can initiate chemical reaction pathways referred to as plasma-driven solution electrochemistry (PDSE). There are several processing opportunities and challenges presented by PDSE. These include the potential use of PDSE to activate chemical pathways that are difficult to activate with other approaches as well as the use of renewable electricity to generate plasmas that could make these liquid-phase chemical conversion processes more sustainable and environmentally friendly. In this review, we focus on PDSE as an approach for controlled and selective chemical conversion including the synthesis of nanoparticles and polymers with desired but currently uncontrollable or unattainable properties as the next step in the use of PDSE. The underpinning redox chemistry and transport processes of PDSE are reviewed as many PDSE-driven processes are transport-limited due to the many short-lived highly reactive species involved.},

In this study, we develop a model of human genome dynamics through cell cycles by extending the previously developed whole-genome model to cover the mitotic phase. With this extension, we focus on the role of mitotic and cell cycle memory in genome organization. The simulation progresses from mitosis to interphase and the subsequent mitosis, leading to successive cell cycles. During mitosis, our model describes microtubule dynamics, showing how forces orchestrate the assembly of chromosomes into a rosette ring structure at metaphase. The model explains how the positioning of chromosomes depends on their size in metaphase. The memory of the metaphase configuration persists through mitosis and into interphase in dimensions perpendicular to the cell division axis, effectively guiding the distribution of chromosome territories over multiple cell cycles. At the onset of each G1 phase, phase separation of active and inactive chromatin domains occurs, leading to A/B compartmentalization. Our cycling simulations show that the compartments are unaffected by structural memory from previous cycles and are consistently established in each cell cycle. The genome model developed in this study highlights the interplay between chromosome dynamics and structural memory across cell cycles, providing insights for the analyses of cellular processes.},

This work investigates the thermo-orientation and rotational diffusion of non-spherical particles, with special focus on shape asymmetry, through non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Our results indicate that the degree of thermo-orientation of asymmetric particles (cone-shaped) is positively correlated with both the aspect ratio ( R/H ) and the temperature gradient; however, the Soret coefficient exhibits a negative correlation with thermo-orientation. To explore the underlying mechanisms further, we analyzed the variation in the torque experienced by the particles. We propose that the thermo-orientation of particles originates from the combined effects of thermophoretic torque and random torque, which in turn lead to anomalous rotational diffusion behavior. Consequently, we investigated the rotational diffusion characteristics of the particles, observing that the probability density functions of angular displacement transition from Gaussian to thin-tailed distributions, with the degree of non-Gaussianity increasing as the R/H values rise. These results could provide a new perspective based on rotational diffusion dynamics for studying the thermo-orientation of asymmetric particles.},

Research on active particles with spatially varying activity has demonstrated that active particles tend to accumulate in low-activity regions and form a polarity layer at the interface, directed from the high-activity to the low-activity region. Here, we investigate the distribution and dynamics of individual or an ideal gas of inertial particles in a space with alternating active and passive regions. Our findings reveal that high inertia leads to a pronounced depletion layer in the passive region. At the interface between the active and passive regions, in addition to the usual polarity layer, an adjacent anti-polarity layer forms on the active-region side. In extreme situations (narrow region width and long persistence times), the interfacial polarity layer can even reverse orientation. Dynamically, we observe long-time peaks in the velocity autocorrelation function of particles within the active region. For particles with high inertia, the peak can even exceed 1. Correspondingly, the mean squared displacement of high-inertia particles in the active region exhibits an unusual superdiffusive behavior (∼ t 3 ). In addition, kinetic temperature and pressure differences arise between the active and passive regions. The effective temperature of particles with high inertia exhibits a gradual gradient across the active region. Our study provides new insights into the behavior of inertial active particles under spatially modulated activity and lays the groundwork for further exploration of their collective behaviors when interactions are included.},

The proposed CML consists of a minimal set of procedures (i.e., parameterized nonlinear maps), such as whipping, coalescence, and flocculation, acting on the appropriately coarse-grained field variables, surface energy, cohesive energy, and velocity (flow) of the emulsion defined on a two-dimensional square lattice. In the CML simulations, two well-known and different phase inversion processes are reproduced at high and low whipping temperatures. The overrun and viscosity changes simulated in these processes are at least qualitatively consistent with those observed in experiments. We characterize these processes exhibiting different texture patterns as the viscosity dominance at high whipping temperatures and as the overrun dominance at low whipping temperatures on the viscosity–overrun plane, which is one of the state diagrams.},

  abstract = {Electrostatics in the solution phase is governed by free electrical charges such as ions, as well as by bound charges that arise when a polarizable medium responds to an applied field. In a local medium, described by a constant dielectric permittivity, the sign of the far-field electrostatic potential distribution around an object is governed by its electrical charge. We demonstrate significant departures from this expectation in a nonlocal medium characterized by a wave vector-dependent dielectric function. Here, surface polarization due to the solvent, or indeed non-solvent dipoles, may wield significant influence at large distances. The polarization correlation length may not only significantly augment the effective screening length but we also show that the electrical contribution from polarization can compete with and even invert the sign of the electrical potential and the field arising from charge alone. These results hold ramifications for a range of apparently anomalous electrically governed observations, such as underscreening, electrophoretic mobilities of charge-neutral objects, and long-ranged attraction between like-charged entities in water and other solvents.},

  abstract = {Magnesium silicate (MS) cement, which uses magnesium silicate hydrate (M-S-H) as its primary binding phase, is a promising low-carbon alternative to Portland cement. However, the slow dissolution of MgO limits the release of Mg ions, which is critical for the formation of M-S-H. To address this issue, solubilizers that complex Mg 2+ and promote MgO dissolution have been proposed, provided that they do not significantly hinder M-S-H formation. This study systematically examined the effects of four anionic additives—acetate, citrate, orthophosphate, and carbonate—on M-S-H nucleation and early growth, developing a highly reproducible crystallization scenario. The observed reduction in supersaturation at the nucleation point for specific additive concentrations suggests that Mg-anion complexes may play an active role in M-S-H nucleation, potentially allowing M-S-H to form at lower supersaturation levels, which could be beneficial for MS cement applications. However, as shown here, additives such as citrate, while not inhibiting nucleation, can significantly slow the growth of M-S-H, potentially compromising the strength development of MS cement. Among the additives studied, moderate concentrations of phosphate and carbonate show the most promise, as they have minimal effects on the formation process while potentially reducing the supersaturation for M-S-H nucleation. Although further research is necessary to fully understand the effects of these anions, this study provides valuable insights into their impact on M-S-H nucleation and early growth.},

Two-dimensional nanochannels—in which a single molecular layer of electrolyte is confined between solid walls—constitute a unique platform to investigate fluid and ion transport in extreme confinement, highlighting unconventional transport properties. In this work, we study ionic association in 2D nanochannels, and its consequences on non-linear ionic transport, using both molecular dynamics simulations and analytical theory. We show that under sufficient confinement, ions assemble into pairs or larger clusters in a process analogous to a Kosterlitz–Thouless transition, here modified by the dielectric confinement. We further show that the breaking of pairs results in an electric-field dependent conduction, a mechanism usually known as the second Wien effect. However the 2D nature of the system results in non-universal, temperature-dependent, scaling of the conductivity with electric field, leading to ionic coulomb blockade in some regimes. A 2D generalization of the Onsager theory fully accounts for the non-linear transport. These results suggest ways to exploit electrostatic interactions between ions to build new nanofluidic devices.},

To achieve this, we utilize a numerically exact open quantum system approach—the hierarchical equations of motion in twin space, combined with a flexible tree tensor network state solver. Our findings reveal a stochastic resonance phenomenon in cavity-modified chemical reactivities: an optimal reaction rate enhancement occurs at an intermediate noise level. In other words, this enhancement diminishes if ambient noise, sensed by the cavity–molecule system through cavity leakage, is either too weak or excessively strong. In the collective coupling regime, when the cavity is weakly damped, rate enhancement strengthens as more molecules couple to the cavity. In contrast, under strong cavity damping, reaction rates decline as the number of molecules grows.},

  abstract = {The rapid translocation speed of peptides through graphene nanopores poses a challenge, hindering the accurate sensing of the biomarkers. Employing the functionalized graphene nanopores is at the forefront of reducing the translocation speed. The current work details the translocation of a negatively charged peptide endothelin-1 through a bare multilayer graphene nanopore, a hydrogen-functionalized graphene nanopore, and a hydroxyl-functionalized graphene nanopore by applying electric fields. The hydroxyl-functionalized graphene nanopore significantly reduces the peptide’s translocation speed. The time required for the peptide to translocate through the hydroxyl-functionalized graphene nanopore is 2.25 times longer than in the non-functionalized graphene nanopore and 1.25 times longer than in the hydrogen-functionalized graphene nanopore. We critically analyze the factors influencing the reduced translocation speed, including the interactions between the pore and the peptide, the conformational changes of the peptide within the pore, the solvent velocity inside the pore, and the solvent’s viscosity near the peptide. The altered solvent velocities within functionalized pores have a minimal role in the speed reduction of peptides. When a constant force is applied to the peptide without any electric field, the hydroxyl-functionalized graphene nanopore delivers the lowest diffusion rate. The persistence time, which serves as a measure of the solvent viscosity near the peptide, is the highest within the hydroxyl-functionalized pore. Finally, we conclude that the Coulombic interactions between the peptide and the pore play a major role in its speed reduction inside the hydroxyl-functionalized graphene nanopore.},

  abstract = {Despite water intrusion in microporous materials being extensively investigated, obtaining a detailed overview of the intrusion mechanism in materials with more complex morphology, topology, and physical–chemical characteristics, such as metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), is far from trivial. In this work, we present a qualitative study on the mechanism of water intrusion in a crystallite of hydrophobic Cu 2 (tebpz) (tebpz = 3,3′,5,5′-tetraethyl-4,4′-bipyrazolate) MOF. This MOF is characterized by a complex morphology; it consists of primary (main channels) and secondary (lateral apertures) porosities. This is similar to some zeolites, such as the so-called ITT-type zeolite framework, but it presents the additional characteristics of high flexibility of the material and non-uniform hydrophobicity. Interestingly, in Cu 2 (tebpz), water intrusion occurs first for some of the channels lying tangent to the surface of the MOF’s crystallite. This is due to hydrogen bonding bridging with bulk water across the (thin) lateral apertures of these channels. In macroscopic terms, this can be understood as a local reduction of hydrophobicity favoring intrusion. Temperature and pressure influence the average number of hydrogen bonds and the number of intruded water molecules, explaining the effect of these thermodynamic parameters on the intrusion/extrusion characteristics of this porous material. Molecular dynamics simulations allowed us to glimpse liquid intrusion in this complex hydrophobic material, highlighting how the classical models valid for mesoporous systems, namely, Young–Laplace’s law, are not quite appropriate to describe intrusion in such materials.},

  abstract = {We calculate pairing free energies for a series of model monovalent ion pairs with equal sizes spanning a large radius range in the aqueous solution. Thermodynamic analysis reveals that the ion pairing strength displays an initial decrease in a nearly linear fashion followed by a significant enhancement at a relatively slower rate as the ion size gradually increases, resulting in the weakest pairing preference for ions with intermediate size. The free energy decomposition illustrates that the ion pairing is jointly governed by a delicate balance of the favorable ion–ion interaction term and the repulsive solvent-induced contribution, with their compensation leading to a small pairing free energy. The dependence of this substantial compensation on the ion size actually dominates the ion pairing strength and the magnitude of the free energy, which accounts for the occurrence of the less association between the intermediate-size ions. Estimation of van der Waals and electrostatic free energies highlights the importance of attractive dispersion forces in determining the shape of the potential of mean force, specifically for large ions with less favorable interaction with water molecules than the water–water interactions. In addition, the effect of varying the cation size on the decreased pairing preference surpasses that of altering the anion size. Our study significantly enhances our understanding of the empirical rule of matching ion size for predicting ion pairing preferences in aqueous solutions.},

Interestingly, the near identical fragment translational energy distribution profiles of CH 3 radical release from acetylacetone and trifluoroacetylacetone, as well as CF 3 radical release from trifluoroacetylacetone and hexafluoroacetylacetone, suggest that the dynamics of formation of CH 3 /CF 3 radicals in acetylacetones appears to be independent of the nature of the substituent on the other end of the molecule. In the case of acetylacetones, the C–C bond cleavage is governed by the local intramolecular vibrational redistribution along the complex reaction coordinate, which appears to be statistical for CF 3 release and non-statistical for CH 3 release; however, it remains non-statistical over the entire molecular framework.},

  abstract = {Low-kinetic energy photoelectron detachment experiments have revealed the unexpected dependence of transition intensities on photon energy, which is hypothesized to result from time-dependent coupling between low-kinetic energy photoelectrons and the remnant molecule. This study explores how the kinetic energy and detachment axis of the photoelectron influence the interaction and modify the final remnant electronic structure. Using real-time simulations on several model systems (H 2 , NO, N 2 , and C2 hydrocarbons), this study demonstrates that electron–remnant interactions are strongly dependent on the detachment orientation, electron kinetic energy, and remnant electronic structure. The results reveal that higher kinetic energies lead to significant nonadiabatic transitions, while lower kinetic energies yield more adiabatic behavior. While generally lower kinetic energies show prolonged electron–remnant interactions, the extent of temporal and spatial interactions does not necessarily vary linearly with the kinetic energy, and the final remnant electronic structure is found to be very sensitive to the exact nature of the photoelectron–remnant interactions. In addition, the point charge model employed for the photoelectron provides a useful approach for the deconvolution of more complete simulations to provide deeper insights into the specific photoelectron–remnant interactions that determine the eventual remnant wavefunction. The findings underscore the importance of considering both temporal and spatial electron dynamics in understanding low-kinetic energy photodetachment processes and provide a foundation for a further exploration of electron–molecule interactions in the low-energy regime.},

The mixtures of multiple solvents are often used in electrolytes to achieve the desired properties, such as viscosity, dielectric constant, boiling point, and melting point. Conventionally, multi-component electrolyte properties are approximated with linear mixing, but in practice, significant deviations are observed. Excess quantities can provide insights into the molecular behavior of the mixture and could form the basis for designing high-performance electrolytes. Here, we investigate the excess density of commonly used Li-ion battery solvents, such as cyclic carbonates, linear carbonates, ethers, and nitriles with molecular dynamics simulations. We additionally investigate electrolytes consisting of these solvents and a salt. The results smoothly vary with mole percent and are fit to permutation-invariant Redlich–Kister polynomials. The mixtures of similar solvents, such as cyclic–cyclic carbonate mixtures, tend to have excess properties that are lower in magnitude compared to the mixtures of dissimilar substances, such as carbonate–nitrile mixtures. We perform experimental testing using our automated test stand, Clio, to provide validation to the observed simulation trends. We quantify the structure similarity using smooth overlap of atomic position fingerprints to create a descriptor for excess density, enabling the design of electrolyte properties. To a first approximation, this will allow us to estimate the deviation of a mixture from ideal behavior based solely upon the structural dissimilarity of the components.},

  abstract = {Resonant vibrational–electronic (vibronic) couplings in donor–acceptor systems may play a crucial role in driving non-adiabatic internal conversion reported in natural photosynthesis, organic photovoltaic polymers, and singlet exciton fission. Quantum beats arising from impulsive excitation are often employed as spectroscopic reporters of the specific vibrational modes driving this process. However, distinguishing these promoter modes from spectator modes, which do not participate in vibronic mixing and simply accompany ultrafast internal conversion, remains a challenge. This is so because vibrational quantum beats arising from uncoupled monomers can modulate pump–probe transients by themselves. In this paper, we show that vibronic mixing induces quantum beats whose amplitude is anisotropic with respect to the polarization of the light. We propose a readily implementable polarization-controlled two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy experiment to uniquely identify signatures of excited state vibronic resonance using ground state quantum beats by discriminating against vibrational motions (and corresponding quantum beats) that are simply spectators. Through analytical expressions and simulation of two-dimensional electronic spectra, we show that the resulting 2D spectra are expected to exhibit distinct spectral lineshapes with a strong temperature dependence that arises solely due to the excited state vibronic mixing. Our findings suggest an interesting experiment to decipher the presence of excited state vibronic resonances.},

The RKS method utilizes the one- and two-particle reduced density matrices to alleviate any numerical artifacts stemming from a finite basis (e.g., Gaussian- or Slater-type orbitals). The KZG approach relies solely on the density to find the XC potential by combining a systematically convergent finite-element basis with appropriate asymptotic correction on the target density. The RKS method, being designed for a finite basis, offers computational efficiency. The KZG method, using a complete basis, provides higher accuracy. In this work, we combine both methods to simultaneously afford accuracy and efficiency. In particular, we use the RKS solution as an initial guess for the KZG method to attain a significant 3–11× speedup. This work also presents a direct comparison of the XC potentials from the RKS and the KZG method and their relative accuracy on various weakly and strongly correlated molecules, using their ground state solutions from accurate configuration interaction calculations solved in a Slater orbital basis.},

Leveraging recent advances in the spectral analysis of the current time series associated with molecular trajectories, we introduce a new method to estimate the full (diagonal as well as off-diagonal) Onsager matrix of transport coefficients from a single statistical model. This approach, based on the knowledge of the statistical distribution of the Onsager-matrix samples in the frequency domain, unifies the evaluation of diagonal (conductivities and viscosities) and off-diagonal (e.g., thermoelectric) transport coefficients within a comprehensive framework, significantly improving the reliability of transport coefficient estimation for materials ranging from molten salts to solid-state electrolytes. We validate the accuracy of this method against existing approaches using benchmark data on molten cesium fluoride and liquid water and conclude our presentation with the computation of various transport coefficients of the Li 3 PS 4 solid-state electrolyte.},

  abstract = {Path-integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations are crucial for accurately capturing nuclear quantum effects in materials. However, their computational intensity often makes it challenging to address potential finite-size effects. Here, we present a specialized graphics processing units (GPUs) implementation of PIMD methods, including ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) and thermostatted ring-polymer molecular dynamics (TRPMD), into the open-source Graphics Processing Units Molecular Dynamics (GPUMD) package, combined with highly accurate and efficient machine-learned neuroevolution potential (NEP) models. This approach achieves almost the accuracy of first-principles calculations with the computational efficiency of empirical potentials, enabling large-scale atomistic simulations that incorporate nuclear quantum effects, effectively overcoming finite-size limitations at a relatively affordable computational cost. We validate and demonstrate the efficacy of the combined NEP-PIMD approach by examining various thermal properties of diverse materials, including lithium hydride (LiH), three porous metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), liquid water, and elemental aluminum. For LiH, our NEP-PIMD simulations successfully capture the isotope effect, reproducing the experimentally observed dependence of the lattice parameter on the reduced mass. For MOFs, our results reveal that achieving good agreement with experimental data requires consideration of both nuclear quantum effects and dispersive interactions. For water, our PIMD simulations capture the significant impact of nuclear quantum effects on its microscopic structure. For aluminum, the TRPMD method effectively captures thermal expansion and phonon properties, aligning well with quantum mechanical predictions. This efficient GPU-accelerated NEP-PIMD implementation in the GPUMD package provides an alternative, accessible, accurate, and scalable tool for exploring complex material properties influenced by nuclear quantum effects, with potential applications across a broad range of materials.},

The XF-based analytical solution is compared with adiabatic and perturbative ones, and it is usually found to be an order of magnitude more accurate than these for estimating the anharmonic and coupling correction part of the ground-state energy.

While highly intuitive, the physical details of such orbital entanglement effects on the excitation energies of chromophores have yet to be fully explored. Here, using two well-known biochromophores (oxyluciferin and p -hydroxybenzyledene imidazolinone) as examples, we show that the chromophore–solvent orbital entanglements can be elucidated using two quantum mechanical embedding schemes: density matrix embedding theory and absolutely localized molecular orbitals. However, there remains a great challenge to incorporate the orbital entanglement effect in combined quantum mechanical molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations, and we hope that our findings will stimulate the development of new methods in that direction.},

  abstract = {In this work, we examine how the structure of system–bath interactions can determine commonly encountered temporal decoherence patterns, such as Gaussian and exponential decay, in molecular and other qubits coupled to a thermal bosonic bath. The analysis, based on a pure dephasing picture that admits analytical treatment, shows that decoherence, in general, is neither purely Gaussian nor exponential but rather the exponential of oscillatory functions, with periods determined by the bath’s frequencies. For initially unentangled qubit-bath states, Gaussian decay is always present at early times. It becomes increasingly dominant with increasing temperature, qubit–bath interaction strength, and bath correlation time. Initial system–bath entanglement that arises due to displacement in the position of the bath states preserves the Gaussian decay. By contrast, strict exponential decay arises only in very specific models that we isolate. However, it becomes dominant for times longer than the bath correlation time or for early times when there is initial entanglement due to momentum displacement of the bath states. For molecular electronic decoherence, the long-time exponential regime plays a limited role as it emerges after most coherence is lost. Thus, the Gaussian decay provides a more suitable (albeit imperfect) model of such decoherence. Furthermore, we discuss the connection between electronic decoherence dynamics and electronic spectroscopic line shape theory, where Gaussian spectral peaks correspond to Gaussian coherence decay and Lorentzian peaks correspond to exponential coherence decay. We find that Gaussian spectral peaks, usually associated with inhomogeneous broadening, can emerge from the entangling unitary system–bath dynamics even when there is no inhomogeneity in the initial conditions.},

  abstract = {The estimation of electronic couplings between diabatic states is crucial for the comprehension of electron transfer phenomena between molecular systems. Therefore, the development of efficient approximations that enable a very fast, yet accurate, estimation of electronic couplings is an important research goal in the context of organic semiconductors. The most popular methods (diabatization schemes, projection approximations, or methods using fragment molecular orbitals) usually involve the use of electronic structure calculations and can be computationally prohibitive if a large number of electronic coupling estimations is required. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy (CubeMap) to evaluate electronic couplings between molecular pairs in an extremely efficient manner. CubeMap employs the well-established linear relationship between the electronic coupling and the overlap integral between the corresponding molecular orbitals localized on the interacting molecules. In particular, CubeMap is based on the efficient calculation of the overlap integral in real space using molecular orbital grids of moderate size. The CubeMap efficiency partly comes from the fact that only a single electronic structure calculation of an individual molecule (reference geometry) is enough for the subsequent evaluation of overlap integrals and electronic couplings in multiple dimer dispositions. We show that CubeMap is particularly appealing to rapidly estimate the electronic coupling distributions in molecular crystals due to thermal fluctuations (dynamic disorder), which is an important effect for the accurate description of charge transport in organic semiconductors. Compared with the methods usually employed to evaluate electronic couplings, the CubeMap approach drastically reduces the computational cost by several orders of magnitude.},

The cubically scaling methods realize a mean absolute error (MAE) below 0.2 eV and are feasible whenever conventional self-consistent-field calculations are performed. O 2 V 3 -scaling EP self-energies achieve an MAE slightly above 0.1 eV and are as feasible as conventional second-order perturbative calculations of total energies.

  abstract = {Molecular polaritons arise when the collective coupling between an ensemble of N molecules and an optical mode exceeds individual photon and molecular linewidths. The complexity of their description stems from their multiscale nature, where the local dynamics of each molecule can, in principle, be influenced by the collective behavior of the entire ensemble. To address this, we previously introduced a formalism called collective dynamics using truncated equations (CUT-E). CUT-E approaches the problem in two stages. First, it exploits permutational symmetries to obtain a substantial simplification of the problem. However, this is often insufficient for parameter regimes relevant to most experiments. Second, it takes the exact solution of the problem in the N → ∞ limit as a reference and derives systematic finite- N corrections. Here, we provide a novel derivation of CUT-E based on recently developed bosonization techniques. We lay down its connections with 1/ N expansions that are ubiquitous in other fields of physics and present previously unexplored key aspects of this formalism, including various types of approximations and extensions to high-excitation manifolds.},

By scanning the temperature–composition phase diagram of the mixture, we find a disconnect between the onset of glassiness and freezing. Surprisingly, however, the onset temperature closely tracks the melting line, along which the excess entropy is approximately constant. At fixed composition, all characteristic temperatures display nonetheless similar pressure dependencies, which are very well predicted by the isomorph theory. While our results rule out a general connection between thermodynamic metastability and glassiness, they call for a reassessment of the role of crystalline precursors in glass-forming liquids.},

  abstract = {In recent years, computational approaches which couple density functional theory (DFT)-based description of the electron–phonon and phonon–phonon scattering rates with the Boltzmann transport equation have been shown to obtain the electron and thermal transport characteristics of many 3D and 2D semiconductors in excellent agreement with experimental measurements. At the same time, progress in the DFT-based description of the electron–phonon scattering has also allowed to describe the non-equilibrium relaxation dynamics of hot or photo-excited electrons in several materials, in very good agreement with time-resolved spectroscopy experiments. In the latter case, as the time-resolved spectroscopy techniques provide the possibility to monitor transient material characteristics evolving on the femtosecond and attosecond time scales, the time evolution of photo-excited, nonthermal carrier distributions has to be described. Similarly, reliable theoretical approaches are needed to describe the transient transport properties of devices involving high energy carriers. In this review, we aim to discuss recent progress in coupling the ab initio description of materials, especially that of the electron–phonon scattering, with the time-dependent approaches describing the time evolution of the out-of-equilibrium carrier distributions, in the context of time-resolved spectroscopy experiments as well as in the context of transport simulations. We point out the computational limitations common to all numerical approaches, which describe time propagation of strongly out-of-equilibrium carrier distributions in 3D materials, and discuss the methods used to overcome them.},

  abstract = {Templated copolymerization, in which information stored in the sequence of a heteropolymer template is copied into another polymer product, is the mechanism behind all known methods of genetic information transfer. A key aspect of templated copolymerization is the eventual detachment of the product from the template. A second key feature of natural biochemical systems is that the template-binding free energies of both correctly matched and incorrect monomers are heterogeneous. Previous work has considered the thermodynamic consequences of detachment and the consequences of heterogeneity for polymerization speed and accuracy, but the interplay of both separation and heterogeneity remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate a minimal model of templated copying that simultaneously incorporates both detachment from behind the leading edge of the growing copy and heterogeneous interactions. We first extend existing coarse-graining methods for models of polymerization to allow for heterogeneous interactions. We then show that heterogeneous copying systems with explicit detachment do not exhibit the subdiffusive behavior observed in the absence of detachment when near equilibrium. Next, we show that heterogeneity in correct monomer interactions tends to result in slower, less accurate copying, while heterogeneity in incorrect monomer interactions tends to result in faster, more accurate copying, due to an increased roughness in the free energy landscape of either correct or incorrect monomer pairs. Finally, we show that heterogeneity can improve on known thermodynamic efficiencies of homogeneous copying, but these increased thermodynamic efficiencies do not always translate to increased efficiencies of information transfer.},

This work proposes an analytical model for committor analysis of the multi-state conformational dynamics of a DNA hairpin in a complex cellular environment, within the framework of the generalized Langevin equation using a general asymmetric bistable potential with a power-law frictional memory kernel. We obtained exact analytical expressions for the probability density function, first passage time distribution, and the committor. The results are compared with those obtained from steered molecular dynamics simulation of a three-state DNA hairpin, and earlier experimental data. We investigated the dependence of the committor and the corresponding committor-inverted profiles on the linker stiffness, barrier height, and degree of asymmetry in the bistable potential. This model successfully captures the fold–unfold dynamics, reproducing the multi-state free energy profile with asymmetric energy barriers.},

  abstract = {The effects of damping time of electronic-vibrational resonance modes on energy transfer in photosynthetic light-harvesting systems are examined. Using the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) method, we simulate the linear absorption and two-dimensional electronic spectra (2DES) for a dimer model based on bottleneck sites in the light-harvesting complex of photosystem II. A site-dependent spectral density is incorporated, with only the low-energy site being coupled to the resonance mode. Similar patterns are observed in linear absorption spectra and early time 2DES for various damping times, owing to the weak coupling strength. However, notable differences emerge in the dynamics of the high-energy diagonal and cross-peaks in the 2DES. It is found that the coupling of electronic-vibrational resonance modes accelerates the energy transfer process, with rates being increased as the damping time is extended, but the impact becomes negligible when the damping time exceeds a certain threshold. To evaluate the reliability of the perturbation method, the modified Redfield (MR) method is employed to simulate 2DES under the same conditions. The results from the MR method are aligned with those obtained from the HEOM method, but the MR method predicts faster dynamics.},

The emergence of orientationally ordered, collectively moving states in such systems has been demonstrated. We here analyze the excitability of such collectively moving elastic states. To this end, we determine corresponding fluctuation spectra. They indicate that collectively excitable modes exist in the migrating solid. Differences arise when compared to those of corresponding passive solids. We provide evidence that the modes of excitation associated with the intrinsic fluctuations are related to corresponding modes of entropy production. Overall, by our investigation, we hope to stimulate future experimental studies that focus on excitations in active solids.},

Sampling near the phase transition temperature in systems undergoing first-order phase transitions, such as the NI phase transition, is demanding due to the substantial energy gap between the two phases. To address this, gREM, specifically designed for first-order phase transitions, was utilized to enhance sampling near the NI phase transition temperature. Free-energy calculations based on the energy representation (ER) theory were employed to characterize the NI phase transition. ER evaluates the insertion free energy of the n CB molecule for both nematic and isotropic phases, revealing a change in the temperature dependence across the NI phase transition. Further decomposition into energetic and entropic terms quantitatively shows the balance between these contributions at the NI phase transition temperature.},

Recently, a newly suggested track formed by multiple nanopores has garnered attraction due to its chemical stability. The nanorobot can be powered by biased leg-nanopore interactions along the walking direction. Here, we propose utilizing a salt concentration gradient along the nanopore track to induce an interaction bias based on different local ion screening effects on the nanopore charges. The nanorobot walking behaviors under different salt concentration gradients are studied through a combination of computational simulations and theoretical analyses. We find that the walking properties (such as velocity and directionality) highly depend on the local interactions experienced by the lagging leg. Under strong leg-nanopore attraction, the lagging leg needs a drag force provided by the leading leg to leave from the nanopore, while under weak attraction, the lagging leg can leave the nanopore without the assistance of the leading leg. Therefore, different walking modes can be observed under various ion conditions, leading to the complicated walking dynamics of the nanorobot driven by the salt concentration gradients.},

Coacervation is crucial for many biological processes and novel synthetic materials, where the environment is often filled with other neutral molecules (crowders). Yet, the complex role of crowders in complex coacervation has not been studied systematically under controlled conditions. We performed coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of coacervation in the presence of polymeric crowders of varying concentrations and chain lengths. While short crowders do not have any significant effect on coacervation, larger crowders stabilize the coacervate against added salt, increasing its critical salt concentration. The change in critical salt concentration saturates for long crowders at a value determined by the crowder concentration. Rescaling all phase diagrams by their critical salt concentration leads to a collapse of the data, which demonstrates a universal phase behavior. Our simulation indicates that the inability of crowder chains to mix with the polyelectrolytes is the driving force behind crowding effects. These testable predictions provide a first step toward a comprehensive understanding of crowding effects in complex coacervation.},

  abstract = {Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations are employed to explore the conformational behavior of globally neutral polyampholytes under good solvent conditions. The interplay between non-Coulomb repulsions and sequence-dependent Coulomb attractions of monomers results in qualitatively different types of electrostatically driven chain contraction for diblock, random, and alternating statistics. At increasing the solution Bjerrum length l b , diblock and random polyampholytes exhibit a smooth coil-globule crossover, with the globule size continuously decreasing with l b according to the theoretical power laws. This confirms the scaling picture of the globule interior consisting of oppositely charged blobs attracting each other via long-range electrostatic forces and repelling via short-range two-body interactions. In contrast, alternating polyampholytes collapse completely analogously to neutral chains because Coulomb interactions in them are effectively dipole–dipole short-range. The transition region shrinks with increasing chain length, implying phase transition behavior in the limit of infinitely long chains. These collapse curves fall on the universal master curve, which is well-fitted by the theory of coil-globule transitions and demonstrates that Coulomb interactions in alternating polyampholytes renormalize (reduce) the dimensionless second virial coefficient by δ B ∝ − l b 2 ⁠ . This study highlights the profound impact of primary sequence on the conformational behavior of charge-balanced polyampholytes in good solvents, particularly the nature of the electrostatically driven coil-globule transition they undergo.},

  abstract = {Charge conductivity in conducting polymers is typically improved by increasing carrier density via chemical oxidation. However, the resulting electrostatic stabilization of the carriers by the dopant ions, combined with their nanostructural environment, are both known to crucially affect charge trapping. Although the effects of charge–ion electrostatic interactions on carrier trapping have been well-characterized using conventional infrared (IR) spectroscopy, the impacts of the polymer chain ordering and energetic environment are difficult to disentangle. In this study, we examine the limitations of conventional IR absorption spectroscopy and introduce a complementary spectroscopic approach capable of discerning polaron trapping more generally. To do so, we investigated films of poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) chemically doped using four different oxidants, of which each preferentially dopes the amorphous and crystalline (lamellar) phases to varying extents. Using this model system, we observed counterintuitive shifts in the polaron IR absorption band, indicating that IR spectroscopy is a clear reporter of trapping only when the carriers exclusively reside in the lamellar phase and in the absence of bipolarons or coupled polarons. Alternatively, we found that polaron excited state dynamics, probed using ultrafast near-infrared transient absorption spectroscopy, more clearly report on charge trapping. This study demonstrates near-infrared transient absorption spectroscopy as a complementary tool for probing charge trapping in conducting polymers when doping induces carriers in different nanostructural environments.},

The magnetic ordering and crystal structure were also analyzed using neutron powder diffraction and the produced samples showed a ferrimagnetic arrangement at ambient temperature. The crystal structure, magnetic parameters, and maximal energy product ( BH ) max of the synthesized materials were found to be considerably affected by cobalt substitution: post-substitution, coercivity increases, while saturation magnetization and retentivity decrease.

  abstract = {Amorphous oxide semiconductors have garnered significant attention in recent years for their potential in flat-panel displays and back-end-of-line-compatible monolithic 3D (M3D) integration applications. This study explores amorphous InSnZnO thin films deposited via plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) and the development of high-performance PEALD ITZO thin-film transistors (TFTs) with different active layer thicknesses, fabricated under a low thermal budget of 200 °C. By optimizing the deposition process of binary oxides InO x , SnO x , and ZnO x , a shared temperature window of 170–180 °C was identified for ITZO thin-film deposition. The deposited ITZO films, irrespective of thickness, exhibit an amorphous phase. Moreover, a reduction in ITZO film thickness from 24 to 4.8 nm leads to an increase in the optical bandgap from 3.35 to 3.65 eV. The channel thickness significantly impacts the threshold voltage and carrier density of ITZO TFTs. Optimized ITZO TFTs with a 16 nm channel thickness demonstrate excellent electrical performance, including a threshold voltage of −0.58 V, a field-effect mobility of 29 cm 2 /V s, an on/off ratio exceeding 10 8 , and a subthreshold swing of 74 mV/dec. Furthermore, the optimized ITZO TFT exhibits excellent stability under positive bias stress at 2 MV/cm, with a threshold voltage shift of 0.15 V after 3600 s. Consequently, ALD-based ITZO emerges as a promising channel material for future applications in transparent electronics and flat-panel displays.},

When deposited on the Bi(111) substrate held at 150 K, picene molecules form a bulk-like (21 1 ̄ monolayer with building blocks of picene trimers. High-resolution STM images reveal that each trimer consists of two tilted molecules and one side-on molecule. Further reducing the deposition temperature to 90 K leads to the formation of nanostripe arrays, in which the side-on molecules adopt the π–π stacking. STS measurements demonstrate that the crystalline (001) monolayer of picene exhibits a larger gap compared with picene crystals, which can be attributed to the decoupling of the upright standing molecules from the semimetallic Bi(111) substrate.},

Up to now, molecular calculations have been performed with real-valued orbitals. However, before extending the applicability of these methodologies to extended systems, where Bloch states are employed, the subtleties of working with complex-valued orbitals and the consequences of imposing time-reversal symmetry must be carefully addressed. In this work, we describe the theoretical and practical implications of adopting time-reversal symmetry in RDMFT and pCCD when allowing for complex-valued orbital coefficients. The theoretical considerations primarily affect the optimization algorithms, while the practical implications raise fundamental questions about the stability of solutions. In particular, we find that complex solutions lower the energy when non-dynamic electronic correlation effects are pronounced. We present numerical examples to illustrate and discuss these instabilities and possible problems introduced by N -representability violations.},

  abstract = {Singlet fission (SF) in molecular semiconductors is a photophysical process of spontaneous splitting of the excited singlet state into a pair of triplet excitons (TT-pair). This process is usually strongly influenced by spin-selective back geminate TT-annihilation (TTA). Spin selectivity manifests itself in magnetic field effects (MFEs) on both TTA and SF kinetics, the study of which allows us to reveal some specific features of this kinetics. In our work, we analyze the mechanism of MFE generation in TTA and SF processes in amorphous molecular semiconductors. In this mechanism, the MFEs are assumed to be determined by magnetic field dependent spin–lattice relaxation (SLR) in TT-pairs, generated by the zero-field splitting interaction (in T-excitons), fluctuating due to T-exciton hopping over arbitrarily oriented molecules in amorphous semiconductors. The SLR-transitions are described with a semiempirical model, which makes it possible to obtain the SF-kinetic functions in analytical form. The mechanism of SLR-assisted MFEs is found to be very efficient in TTA and SF processes. The obtained results are analyzed in detail and applied to interpret experimentally observed SF-kinetic dependences in various magnetic fields. In particular, it is shown that the proposed model of SLR-generated MFEs enables one to describe the effect of crossing of SF-kinetic functions, corresponding to different magnetic fields.},

Together with elucidating the temperature-dependent mechanisms of crystallization, face-specific growth rates were systematically estimated. While the prism surface generally exhibits faster growth rates than the basal surface, a temperature-dependent crossover in growth rates between the basal and prism surfaces is observed in TIP4P/Ice simulations, which correlates with crossovers in QLL thickness and properties and with the well-known column to platelets transition in ice-crystal habits at low vapor pressure. This observation helps decode the complex dependence between crystal morphology and temperature in ice crystals.},

Using dibutyl phosphate (DBP) as a representative for partially aqueous soluble surfactants, the specific ion effect (SIE) of the Hofmeister series cations Cs + , Na + , Li + , and Mg 2+ on the partition and interaction between surfactant molecules and water molecules in the air–aqueous interface are investigated using vibrational sum frequency generation spectroscopy and surface tension measurements. In the presence of 1 mM and 1M bulk aqueous phase ionic strength salt concentrations, fundamental qualitative relationships are observed for the salting out of DBP relative to bulk aqueous phase nitrate salt concentrations and the specific cations species. At 1 mM ionic strength, the interfacial charge and hence the interfacial potential modulates the electrostatic interactions; in particular, the counter cations partially screen the negatively charged interface induced by the DBP in a direct Hofmeister order. At 1M ionic strength, the electric field at the interface or interfacial potential is effectively neutralized, and the counter cations promote the partitioning of DBP to the interface depending on their specific interaction with the DBP head group and metal ion hydration properties. The present results lay a foundation to study SIEs of heavier metals on hydrophobic-aqueous DBP interfaces.},

Electrostatic interactions from the multipoles of Y6 stabilize the electron in the crystalline region.

  abstract = {Raman spectroscopy is an important tool for studying molecules, liquids and solids. While Raman spectra can be obtained theoretically from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, this requires the calculation of electronic polarizability along the simulation trajectory. First-principles calculations of electronic polarizability are computationally expensive, motivating the development of atomistic models for the evaluation of the changes in the electronic polarizability with the changes in the atomic coordinates of the system. The bond polarizability model (BPM) is one of the oldest and simplest such atomistic models but cannot reproduce the effects of angular vibrations, leading to inaccurate modeling of Raman spectra. Here, we demonstrate that the generalization of BPM through the inclusion of terms for atom pairs that are traditionally considered to be not involved in bonding dramatically improves the accuracy of polarizability modeling and Raman spectra calculations. The generalized BPM (GBPM) reproduces the ab initio polarizability and Raman spectra for a range of tested molecules (SO 2 , H 2 S, H 2 O, NH 3 , CH 4 , CH 3 OH, and CH 3 CH 2 OH) with high accuracy and also shows significantly improved agreement with ab initio results for the more complex ferroelectric BaTiO 3 systems. For liquid water, the anisotropic Raman spectrum derived from atomistic MD simulations using the GBPM evaluation of polarizability shows significantly improved agreement with the experimental spectrum compared to the spectrum derived using the BPM. Thus, the GBPM can be used for the modeling of Raman spectra using large-scale molecular dynamics and provides a good basis for the further development of atomistic polarizability models.},

  abstract = {Understanding charge photogeneration processes in polymer solar cells utilizing polymerized Y-molecule acceptors (PYMAs) is of great importance for design and optimization of high-performance solar cells. In this work, excited state dynamics in PYMAs (PYT, PY-DT) and corresponding solar cells were comparably studied with those of Y small molecules (Y5, Y6) by using the steady state and time-resolved spectroscopies as well as time-dependent density functional theory calculation. We find that PYMA (PYT, PY-DT) films exhibit smaller Stokes shifts than that of Y small molecules, indicating a more rigid backbone of PYMAs. Temperature-dependent steady-state PL measurement reveals that compared to small molecule films, the energy barrier from radiative to non-radiative states is smaller in PYMA films. In addition, transient absorption spectroscopy demonstrates that the exciton diffusion process in PYT and PY-DT are mainly intra-chain exciton diffusion mechanism with exciton diffusion coefficients of 1.7 × 10 −2 and 2.7 × 10 −2 cm 2 s −1 , respectively, in contrast with the inter-molecular exciton diffusion in Y5 and Y6 films. For the blend films, the phase sizes of acceptors in PM6:PYT and PM6:PY-DT are determined as 2.3 and 3.3 nm, respectively, smaller than that of Y6 (4.7 nm) in the PM6:Y6 film. In addition, unlike bimolecular recombination in classical system PM6:Y6, the PYMA-based all-polymer solar cells exhibit geminate type recombination in ultrafast timescale. We find that carrier lifetime plays a critical role in the performance of PYMA-based polymer solar cells. This work provides a comprehensive understanding of the photophysical properties of PYMAs, which is pivotal for designing highly efficient all-polymer solar cells.},

  abstract = {Large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations enabled by computationally efficient semiempirical potentials are an invaluable tool for materials modeling. In the case of metallic alloys, embedded atom method (EAM) and Finnis–Sinclair (FS) potentials are a reasonable choice based on their good balance of quality and computational cost. However, these semiempirical potentials are not suitable for simulating ionic systems, which prevents their use in studying many technologically relevant metal–oxide systems. The charge transfer ionic potential (CTIP), which can utilize EAM/FS potentials available in the literature together with a variable charge representation of electrostatic interactions, should be a reasonable choice for performing reliable and computationally efficient MD simulations of such systems. However, only a few such potentials are available in the literature, and their computational cost is much higher compared to EAM/FS potentials. In the present work, we have attempted to remedy these deficiencies by combining several modifications to the CTIP model proposed in the literature and efficiently implementing them into the widely used Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator MD code. Using these modifications, we have developed a new Ni–O CTIP parameterization, which has been tested in several different scenarios of interest. First, the early stages of Ni surface oxidation were simulated, demonstrating the nucleation and growth of a crystalline NiO film across the surface. Second, solidification and vitrification in the Ni–O system were investigated, demonstrating that the new CTIP parameterization provides reasonable agreement with the experimentally determined equilibrium phase diagram. Finally, we studied the interaction of dislocations in a Ni matrix with a NiO inclusion using a simulation cell with an unprecedented number of atoms for a variable charge MD simulation. Thus, the approach utilized in the present study is an efficient method to simulate large scale atomic mechanisms in metal–oxide systems.},

  abstract = {CoTe 2 and CoSe 2 alloys have garnered considerable attention in thermoelectric applications due to their high electrical conductivity, tunable electronic properties, and potential for high power factors. In this study, the phase formation behavior and thermoelectric transport properties of a CoTe 2 –CoSe 2 solid solution alloy were investigated by synthesizing a series of Co(Te 1− x Se x ) 2 compositions, where x = 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.0. For x = 0, 0.25, and 0.50, the orthorhombic phase of CoTe 2 was observed, while for x = 0.75, the orthorhombic phase of CoTe 2 and cubic phase of CoSe 2 coexisted. Up to x = 0.50, the power factor decreased slightly as the Hall mobility and the density-of-state effective mass decreased. The total thermal conductivity decreased as x increased to 0.50, owing to a decrease in the electronic and lattice thermal conductivity. Despite the decrease in total thermal conductivity, no significant increase in zT values was observed in the range of x = 0.25–0.50 due to a more pronounced decrease in the power factor. Nevertheless, cubic phase CoSe 2 exhibited higher power factors and thus higher zT of 0.13 at 700 K. Further analysis based on single Kane band model suggests that significant enhancement in the power factor and zT could be achieved by reducing the carrier concentration from ∼10 21 to ∼10 19 cm −3 for all compositions.},

  abstract = {Recently, spin asymmetry in O 2p related deep valence states was evidenced in SrTiO 3 (001) [Popescu et al. , Phys. Scr. 99 (10), 105925 (2024)]. In this work, we report the detection of a much higher (about four times) spin asymmetry in SrTiO 3 (011) by spin resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, with samples characterized also by core level x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and low energy electron diffraction. The explanation of a so important spin asymmetry is related to the partial neutralization of O 2 (4−) or SrTiO(4+) end layers. Missing electrons from O 2p states in the case of O 2 terminations enable robust atomic spins, according to Hund’s rule. The parallel analysis of core level shifts for surface atoms and the amplitude of spin asymmetry suggests that 50% of the oxygens from the surface SrO layer of SrTiO 3 (001) have a 2p 5 configuration with an unpaired electron (the rest are in a 2p 6 configuration), while in the case of O 2 terminated SrTiO 3 (011), about 50% of surface oxygens have a 2p 5 configuration and 50% of surface oxygens are neutral (2p 4 ), yielding a net charge per O 2 surface unit cell of (−1) instead of (−4). The magnetization is oriented along the rows formed by the (4 × 1) reconstruction in the 0 1 ̄ 1 in-plane direction.},

In this study, a series of ZnS/SnS 2 heterojunction photocatalysts were prepared by a morphology-controlled strategy, and the regulation of ZnS/SnS 2 heterostructure was realized for the photodegradation of methyl violet (MV) under visible light. The results show that as-prepared ZnS/SnS 2 consists of hybrid morphological microparticles and exhibits a nanoparticle/nanosheet interspersed structure. The multi-touch interface of the constructed heterostructures can significantly shorten the carrier transport path and greatly promote the charge separation and transfer under the action of the local electric field at the semiconductor/semiconductor interface. Exposed dual-crystal planes of SnS 2 coupled with ZnS enrich the active sites and enhance the performance of pure SnS 2 and ZnS material. The degradation rate of MV over the optimal heterojunction material (ZnS/SnS 2 -50) exceeds 91.4% within 90 min under visible light irradiation, which is about 62 times that of MV compared with pristine ZnS.},

  abstract = {The complex interaction between the intrinsic and extrinsic state variables of strongly correlated insulator thin films is drawing interest as it shows memristive behavior that may be applicable to neuromorphic computing. Cerium oxide is an interesting material as its band structure is modified due to the formation of oxygen vacancy defects. The polaron formation that results from the reduction of the Ce 4+ state to the Ce 3+ state through oxygen vacancies is crucial for the electron transport in cerium oxide and is strongly influenced by temperature. In this work, we examined the relationship between the change in band structure and the associated conductivity at lower temperatures when ceria is exposed to light. Following light excitation, the creation of oxygen vacancies results in electron localization in the Ce 4f state, followed by the electron transition from 4f 1 to 4f 0 , generating the PL spectra. With decreasing temperature, the lattice vibration decreases, and the splitting in the PL peak at a particular energy state validates the weaker electron–phonon interaction with an exciton trap. This reduces the carrier mobility of the film as observed from the resistance vs temperature curve of ceria under dark conditions. When excited by a particular energy of light, the electrons move more easily from the defect state to the conduction band, increasing conductivity at much lower temperatures than the conductivity under dark conditions.},

Through dynamic compression experiments on liquefied Ar, O 2 , CO, and N 2 , we aimed to understand shock-induced cooling and radiance changes at the sample/lithium fluoride (LiF) interface. The experiments were conducted using a setup involving a Doppler pin system and pyrometer to measure shock velocities, pressures, and temperatures across the interface between shocked liquids and LiF. Under the first-shock, molecular liquids experienced partial dissociation due to a rapid rise in pressure, density, and temperature within nanoseconds. Upon re-shocking at the sample/LiF interface, a radiance drop was observed for all liquids except Ar. Our data analysis suggests that the cooling effect is likely due to a chemical reaction occurring at the interface between reactive species, produced during the initial shock, and the layer of LiF at the surface under re-shock conditions. One probable interpretation is that this reaction formed a thin, partially transparent layer on the LiF, which absorbed a significant portion of the radiation emitted by the shocked fluid. Thus, the observed temperature drop in re-shocked liquid nitrogen is likely attributable to radiation reduction.},

  abstract = {Lithium metal is a promising high-capacity anode material for solid-state batteries, but it typically suffers from poor cyclability. Carbon scaffold hosts have the potential to improve this performance due to their high electronic conductivity and large surface area, which facilitates lithium-ion adsorption and desorption. Scaffold surface chemistry is known to significantly influence performance outcomes, but the details of these interactions are not fully understood. This study employs first-principles simulations to explore lithium transport and nucleation on graphene anodes with various surface chemistries. Using enhanced sampling techniques, ab initio molecular dynamics, and density functional theory calculations, we find that although surface chemistry has a minimal impact on lithium interfacial transport, it influences surface nucleation significantly. Both heteroatom dopants and intrinsic defects lower the nucleation barrier, creating a more favorable environment for lithium nucleation compared to pristine graphene. In addition, our results reveal a complex interplay between surface lithium concentration, lithium transport, and nucleation kinetics. These findings highlight the potential of surface modifications to precisely control nucleation processes on carbon-based anodes and provide design guidance for reducing dendrite formation and improving the cycle life of solid-state batteries.},

The 1D-VSFG spectra show a broad positive peak in the hydrogen-bonded region, which means that water molecules are oriented upward toward the lipid bilayer. Although DMPC is a zwitterionic lipid, the negatively charged phosphate group primarily influences the orientation of the water molecules. The absence of a dangling peak in the 1D- and 2D-VSFG spectra shows that the water molecules form hydrogen bonds with the lipid headgroup atoms. The spectral diffusion timescales obtained from the 2D-VSFG metrics of the slope of the nodal line clearly reveal a dynamical crossover and exhibit Arrhenius behavior with different activation energies before and after the melting of the lipid bilayer. Apart from 2D-VSFG, the frequency fluctuation time correlation function also exhibits a dynamical crossover upon melting of the lipid bilayer.},

The AA molecules at the interface are found to be oriented in a manner where the hydrophobic part (methyl chain) is oriented toward the vapor phase and the hydrophilic part is pointed toward the liquid phase. The total VSFG spectrum reveals that the intensity of the peak of dangling OH groups of water around 3750 cm −1 decreases when the concentration of AA increases, while the intensity of the peak around 3550 cm −1 due to OH groups having hydrogen bonds between water and AA molecules increases. Furthermore, the latter peak is redshifted as the AA concentration increases, which is due to the partial cancellation between the positive response of water OH modes and the negative response of the OH modes of AA molecules. It is also noted that the AA molecules make the interfacial water more structured by making hydrogen bonds with its otherwise dangling OH modes at the surface.},

For the case of ammonium nitrate (NH 4 NO 3 ), we report the presence of two successive sharp steps in the molar magnetic susceptibility along the a - and b -axes upon crossing its order–disorder phase transition (from phase IV to phase II). We suggest that the first step pertains to the NO 3 − planes shifting away from facing only along the b -axis and onto the a -axis by 45°. The second step is attributed to the disordering (ungearing) of the NH 4 + and NO 3 − . In contrast, only one step was observed in the magnetic susceptibility along the c -axis, and its large magnitude suggests that the NO 3 − remain weakly correlated even in phase I at 400 K. We also find evidence that the NH 4 + become magnetically ordered (geared) along the c -axis only until phase V. The approach employed in this work can be extended to experimentally study the lattice dynamics of other solids possessing planar ions such as amphidynamic crystals.},

The rounded dynamical transition around ϕ d , which signals a crossover to activated transport, is accompanied by a growing correlation length that is predicted to diverge at the thermodynamic glass transition density ( &gt; ϕ d ) ⁠ . Simulations and imaging experiments probed the single particle dynamics of mobile particles in response to pinning all the particles in a semi-infinite space or randomly pinning (RP) a fraction of particles in a liquid at equilibrium. The extracted dynamic length increases non-monotonically with a peak around ϕ d , which not only depends on the pinning method but is also different from ϕ d of the actual liquid. This finding is at variance with the results obtained using the small wavelength limit of a four-point structure factor for unpinned systems. To obtain a consistent picture of the growth of the dynamic length, one that is impervious to the use of RP, we introduce a multiparticle structure factor, S m p c ( q , t ) ⁠ , that probes collective dynamics. The collective dynamical length, calculated from the small wave vector limit of S m p c ( q , t ) ⁠ , increases monotonically as a function of the volume fraction in a glass-forming binary mixture of charged colloidal particles in both unpinned and pinned systems.

In this work, we investigate the microscopic dynamics of a CuZr glass former with oxygen content up to 2 at. % using molecular dynamics simulations based on specially developed neural network interatomic potentials. Our findings indicate a gradual increase in the glass transition temperature with oxygen addition, with an anomalous peak at 0.4 at. % O. We reveal an anti-correlation of kinetic fragility and dynamic heterogeneity behind this unusual rise, where the system exhibits reduced kinetic fragility alongside more significant dynamic heterogeneity. Using the continuous time random walk method, we show that at 0.4 at. % O, a highly mobile Cu atomic layer forms around O–Zr clusters, resulting in notable dynamic heterogeneity. This dynamic behavior is closely linked to the bonding pattern within the O–Zr network, particularly favoring the configuration with edge and surface sharing. In addition, such structures contribute to a more compact O–Zr network, leading to lower kinetic fragility. These findings provide detailed insights into the microscopic dynamics behind the effects of minor oxygen additions.},

Exploiting the scattering contrast between neutrons and x rays, difference functions are derived that eliminate contributions due to O–O pairs, revealing, for the first time, the nearest-neighbor B–B peak in the pair distribution function. This peak occurs at r BB = 2.430(1) Å in B 2 O 3 glass, consistent with a mean B–O–B bond angle β ≃ 124° and a large boroxol ring fraction.

  abstract = {In this contribution, we compute the 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation rate of liquid water at ambient conditions. We are using structural and dynamical information from Coupled Cluster Molecular Dynamics (CCMD) trajectories generated at CCSD(T) electronic structure accuracy while also considering nuclear quantum effects in addition to consulting information from x-ray and neutron scattering experiments. Our analysis is based on a recently presented computational framework for determining the frequency-dependent NMR dipole–dipole relaxation rate of spin 1/2 nuclei from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, which allows for an effective disentanglement of its structural and dynamical contributions and includes a correction for finite-size effects inherent to MD simulations with periodic boundary conditions. A close to perfect agreement with experimental relaxation data is achieved if structural and dynamical information from CCMD trajectories is considered, leading to a re-balancing of the rotational and translational dynamics, which can also be expressed by the product of the self-diffusion coefficient and the reorientational correlation time of the H–H vector D 0 × τ HH . The simulations show that this balance is significantly altered when nuclear quantum effects are taken into account.

  abstract = {Self-assembling amphiphilic cyanine dyes, such as C8S3, are promising candidates for energy storage and optoelectronic applications due to their efficient energy transport properties. C8S3 is known to self-assemble in water into double-walled J-aggregates. Thus far, the molecular self-assembly steps remain shrouded in mystery. Here, we employ a multiscale approach to unravel the first self-assembly step: dimerization. Our multiscale approach combines molecular dynamics simulations with quantum chemistry calculations to obtain a Frenkel exciton Hamiltonian, which we then use in spectral calculations to determine the absorption and two-dimensional electronic spectra of C8S3 monomer and dimer systems. We model these systems solvated in both water and methanol, validating our model with experiments in methanol solution. Our theoretical results predict a measurable anisotropy decay upon dimerization, which is experimentally confirmed. Our approach provides a tool for the experimental probing of dimerization. Moreover, molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the dimer conformation is characterized by the interaction between the hydrophobic aliphatic tails rather than the π – π stacking previously reported for other cyanine dyes. Our results pave the way for future research into the mechanism of molecular self-assembly in similar light-harvesting complexes, offering valuable insights for understanding and optimizing self-assembly processes for various (nano)technological applications.},

  abstract = {Due to their unique physiochemical properties that may be tailored for specific purposes, ionic liquids (ILs) have been investigated for various applications, including chemical separations, catalysis, energy storage, and space propulsion. The different cations and anions comprising ILs may be selected to optimize a range of desired properties, such as thermal stability, ionic conductivity, and volatility, leading to the designation of certain ILs as designer “green” solvents. The effect of counterions on the properties of ILs is of both fundamental scientific interest and technological importance. Herein, we report a systematic experimental and theoretical investigation of the size, charge, stability toward dissociation, and geometric/electronic structure of 1-ethyl-3-methyl imidazolium (EMIM)-based IL clusters containing two different atomic counterions (i.e., bromide [Br − ] and iodide [I − ]). This work extends our studies of EMIM + cations with atomic chloride (Cl − ) and molecular tetrafluoroborate (BF 4 − ) anions reported previously by Baxter et al. [Chem. Mater. 34 , 2612 (2022)] and Zhang et al. [J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 11 , 6844 (2020)], respectively. Distributions of anionic IL clusters were generated in the gas phase using electrospray ionization and characterized by high mass resolution mass spectrometry, energy-resolved collision-induced dissociation, and negative ion photoelectron spectroscopy experiments. The experimental results reveal anion-dependent trends in the size distribution, relative abundance, ionic charge state, stability toward dissociation, and electron binding energies of the IL clusters. Complementary global optimization theory provides molecular-level insights into the bonding and electronic structure of a selected subset of clusters, including their low energy structures and electrostatic potential maps, and how these fundamental characteristics are influenced by anion substitution. Collectively, our findings demonstrate how the fundamental properties of ILs, which determine their suitability for many applications, may be tuned by substituting counterions. These observations are critical in the sub-nanometer cluster size regime where phenomena do not scale predictably to the bulk phase, and each atom counts toward determining behavior.},

  abstract = {The photodissociation and photoionization of O 2 and the subsequent photodissociation of O 2 + in the wavelength region of 200 to 240 nm are reported using resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) and velocity map imaging detection. A series of two-photon allowed Rydberg states with principle quantum number n = 3–11 converging to the ground electronic state of O 2 + X 2 Π g are used as doorway states to reach the region of superexcited states of O 2 in the three-photon energy range of 15.8–18.6 eV. A detailed analysis of the kinetic energy release and anisotropy parameters of photofragments extracted from velocity map images reveals competition between neutral dissociation and autoionization and leads to the identification of different O + formation channels. Moreover, the measurement of anisotropy parameters for each channel gives additional information on the symmetry of electronic states involved in the absorption process. Formation followed by the dissociation of vibrationally excited O 2 + is the strongest channel over the full wavelength range studied. Ground and vibrationally excited O 2 + ( X 2 Π g , a 4 Π u , A 2 Π u ) are formed and dissociated to ionic products via one and two-photon processes. Neutral dissociation to form electronically excited atoms is important at the longer wavelengths studied and becomes noticeably less important at shorter wavelengths. These results agree with and expand on a previous study from our lab of O + formation at a single (2 + 1) REMPI wavelength, and the results obtained in this study are found to complement our study of the electronically analogous counterpart S 2 , where most of the S + ions arise from electronically excited S* atoms. The results of this study will also be of use in the pixel-to-velocity calibration of any velocity map imaging apparatus in the wide ultraviolet wavelength regions. Because O 2 is a common reactant or product in many molecular dynamics studies, knowledge of its ionization/dissociation pathways at commonly used wavelengths should also be useful in avoiding signal overlap problems.},

Our results reveal that the adsorption free energy of NH 3 on (Fe 2 O 3 ) n ( n = 1–4) decreases with increasing cluster size up to n = 3, followed by a slight increase at n = 4. The strongest NH 3 adsorption energy, 28.55 kcal/mol, was found for Fe 2 O 3 , where NH 3 interacts with a two-coordinated Fe site, forming an Fe–N bond with a length of 2.11 Å. A comparative analysis of NH 3 dehydrogenation and H 2 formation on various Fe(III) oxide sizes identifies the rate-determining steps for each reaction. We found that the rate-determining step for the full NH 3 dehydrogenation on (Fe 2 O 3 ) n ( n = 1–4) is size-dependent, with the NH* → N* + H* reaction acting as the limiting step for n = 1–3. In addition, our findings indicate that H 2 formation is favored following the partial decomposition of NH 3 on Fe(III) oxides.},

Here, we report an experimental measurement of the two-body Coulomb explosion of ( C O ) 2 2 + and ( C O ) 3 2 + ⁠ , produced in a 40 keV Ar 2+ double-electron capture collision with a CO dimer and trimer. Accurate reaction pathways are identified with the advanced ion–ion coincidence and momentum-imaging techniques. The measured kinetic energy release deviates from the calculated results based on the reciprocal of internuclear distance (i.e., Coulomb interaction only) and which, therefore, requires the inclusion of rotational energy of CO + initiated by molecular electric-dipole momentum. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the separation defining the rotational energy takes place within a few hundred fs after the onset of dissociation. This molecular-scale environmental effect significantly brings calculations and measurements of the kinetic energy release into agreement.},

These three Ln ’s were specifically targeted because they vary in their spin state and orbital angular momentum associated with the 4f N subshell occupancies. From the anion PE spectra of Ce 3 O − , Sm 3 O − , and Gd 3 O − measured with 2.330 and 3.495 eV photon energies, we determine the adiabatic electron affinities of the corresponding neutrals to be 0.83 ± 0.03, 1.11 ± 0.05, and 1.17 ± 0.05 eV, respectively. The lowest energy features in all three spectra can readily be reconciled with molecular structures in which the O-atom is central to all three Ln centers, with Ce 3 O − /Ce 3 O assuming pyramidal structures and Sm 3 O − /Sm 3 O and Gd 3 O − /Gd 3 O assuming planar structures. Computationally, the lowest-energy structure of neutral Ce 3 O is a kite-like structure, which is not consistent with the observed spectrum. The kite-like and pyramidal structures of Ce 3 O − are predicted to be nearly isoenergetic. Electronic states in which all three 4f N centers are ferromagnetically coupled are predicted to be energetically favored for all species, but spin-frustrated states in which one 4f N center is antiferromagnetically coupled to the remaining centers are computed to lie 0.05 eV higher in energy than the FM-coupled states for Ce 3 O − and Sm 3 O − . The PE spectrum of Sm 3 O − exhibits striking anomalies in the photoelectron angular dependence. This effect is attributed to strong photoelectron–valence electron interactions that drive nominally forbidden changes in the M f state of the remnant neutral.},

Transient 19 F photo-CIDNP NMR has so far not been used to determine the isotropic hyperfine coupling constants of 19 F nuclei. Here, we show that this method provides reliable results by studying three monofluorinated flavin mononucleotide (FMN) derivatives in conjunction with 6-fluoro-tryptophan. Combining this method with transient 1 H photo-CIDNP spectroscopy leads to a more accurate interpretation of the intermediate radical species forming a radical pair. The gathered information can be used to identify the most promising FMN derivative for usage as a probe for formation of radical pairs in proteins.},

  abstract = {The ability to prepare molecular ions in selected quantum states enables studies in areas such as chemistry, metrology, spectroscopy, quantum information, and precision measurements. Here, we demonstrate (2 + 1) resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) of oxygen, both in a molecular beam and in an ion trap. The two-photon transition in the REMPI spectrum is rotationally resolved, allowing ionization from a selected rovibrational state of O 2 . Fits to this spectrum determine spectroscopic parameters of the O 2 d 1 Π g state and resolve a discrepancy in the literature regarding its band origin. The trapped molecular ions are cooled by co-trapped atomic ions. Fluorescence mass spectrometry nondestructively demonstrates the presence of the photoionized O 2 + ⁠ . We discuss strategies for maximizing the fraction of ions produced in the ground rovibrational state. For (2 + 1) REMPI through the d 1 Π g state, we show that the Q(1) transition is preferred for neutral O 2 at rotational temperatures below 50 K, while the O(3) transition is more suitable at higher temperatures. The combination of state-selective loading and nondestructive detection of trapped molecular ions has applications in optical clocks, tests of fundamental physics, and control of chemical reactions.},

  abstract = {A rapid scan technique of the magnetic field has been developed to improve excitation efficiency in continuous wave (cw)-electron spin resonance. The resulting passage effects induce significant responses of magnetizations, most notably an inversion of longitudinal magnetization. The change in longitudinal magnetization can be observed in optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR), but the passage effect has not been investigated in cw-ODMR spectroscopy. In this study, we combine the ODMR technique with the rapid scan of the magnetic field to demonstrate the impact of fast passage effects on the field-swept cw-ODMR. An ensemble of negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV − ) centers in a diamond crystal is used as a model system. By selecting the fast passage adiabatic region among six distinct passage regions, efficient ODMR detection is achieved through the macroscopic control of longitudinal magnetization. Experimental results are explained by the numerical analyses of classical time-dependent Bloch equations and related rate equations under an optical cycle. This knowledge paves the way for the facilitation of versatile applications of ODMR for quantum sensors.},

While s-SNOM offers a high spatial resolution, its effectiveness is often hindered by low signal levels, particularly in weakly absorbing samples. To address these challenges, we utilize a data-driven “patch-based” machine learning reconstruction method, incorporating modern generative adversarial neural networks (CycleGANs) for denoising s-SNOM images. This method allows for flexible reconstruction of images of arbitrary sizes, a critical capability given the variable nature of scanned sample areas in point-scanning probe-based microscopies. The CycleGAN model is trained on unpaired sets of images captured at both rapid and extended acquisition times, thereby modeling instrument noise while preserving essential topographical and molecular information. The results show significant improvements in image quality, as indicated by higher structural similarity index and peak signal-to-noise ratio values, comparable to those obtained from images captured with four times the integration time. This method not only enhances image quality but also has the potential to reduce the overall data acquisition time, making high-resolution s-SNOM imaging more feasible for a wide range of biological and materials science applications.},

While experimental tools such as Hi-C have advanced our understanding of genome interactions, the biophysical principles underlying chromatin loop formation remain elusive. This review examines computational approaches to chromatin folding, focusing on polymer models that elucidate chromatin loop mechanics. We discuss three key models: (1) the multi-loop-subcompartment model, which investigates the structural effects of loops on chromatin conformation; (2) the strings and binders switch model, capturing thermodynamic chromatin aggregation; and (3) the loop extrusion model, revealing the role of structural maintenance of chromosome complexes. In addition, we explore advanced models that address chromatin clustering heterogeneity in biological processes and disease progression. The review concludes with an outlook on open questions and current trends in chromatin loop formation and genome interactions, emphasizing the physical and computational challenges in the field.},

Calculations on the GW 100 molecular test set lead, nevertheless, to a good agreement, at the 60 meV mean-absolute-error accuracy on the ionization potential, with respect to the conventional qs GW approach. We show further that constructing the density matrix from the full Green’s function as in the fully self-consistent sc GW scheme, and not from the occupied quasiparticle one-body orbitals, allows obtaining a scheme intermediate between the qs GW and sc GW approaches, closer to coupled-cluster reference values.},

This method allows for the calculation of transport coefficients, such as thermal conductivity and viscosity. The relation between the induced fluxes and the control parameters of RNEMD (such as the time interval between successive swap events) is not clear. Thus, trial-and-error is required to realize the desired fluxes in RNEMD simulations. In this study, we develop a theoretical framework using extreme value statistics to estimate the relation between the time interval and the resulting induced fluxes. Our RNEMD simulations, conducted with varying time intervals, confirm that the theoretical predictions are quantitatively consistent with the simulation results when the time interval exceeds the momentum relaxation time. Our RNEMD simulations also show that our theoretical predictions, which are valid for a large number of particles for swap candidates, work well even for a relatively small number of particles for swap candidates. These findings demonstrate that the induced fluxes can be reliably estimated, providing a valuable tool for selecting appropriate RNEMD parameters for simulations.},

  abstract = {The wetting properties of a liquid in contact with a solid are commonly described by Young’s equation, which defines the relationship between the angle made by a fluid droplet onto the solid surface and the interfacial properties of the different interfaces involved. When modeling such interfacial systems, several assumptions are usually made to determine this angle of contact, such as a completely rigid solid or the use of the tension at the interface instead of the surface free energy. In this work, we perform molecular dynamics simulations of a Lennard-Jones liquid in contact with a Lennard-Jones crystal and compare the contact angles measured from a droplet simulation with those calculated using Young’s equation based on surface free energy or surface stress. We analyze cases where the solid atoms are kept frozen in their positions and where they are allowed to relax and simulate surfaces with different wettability and degrees of softness. Our results show that using either surface free energy or surface stress in Young’s equation leads to similar contact angles but different interfacial properties. We find that the approximation of keeping the solid atoms frozen must be done carefully, especially if the liquid can efficiently pack at the interface. Finally, we show that to correctly reproduce the measured contact angles when the solid becomes soft, the quantity to be used in Young’s equation is the surface free energy only and that the error committed in using the surface stress becomes larger as the softness of the solid increases.},

The developed methodology is based on the use of Slater determinants composed of non-orthogonal Kohn–Sham-like orbitals for the evaluation of kinetic energy expectation values and the expansion of the inverse molecular-orbital overlap matrix into a Neumann series. By applying these techniques, we derived and implemented a series of orbital-dependent approximations for the non-additive kinetic energy, which are employed self-consistently. Our proof-of-principle computations demonstrated quantitatively correct results for potential energy curves and electron densities and hinted on the applicability of the introduced empirical parameters to different types of molecular systems and intermolecular interactions.

  abstract = {This study presents a numerical simulation approach to investigate singlet–triplet interconversion effects in organic materials with rigid molecular structures that facilitate the photogeneration of charge-separated (CS) states, such as zwitterions resulting from intramolecular electron transfer. Our approach enables the detailed modeling of electron and nuclear spin-dependent observables, including magnetic field-affected reaction yields (MARY) and chemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization (CIDNP). The equilibrium solution of the stochastic Liouville equation can be obtained with simple algebraic manipulation by noting the relationship between the Laplace transform of the density operator and the time-domain representation of the same operator. Experimental MARY and CIDNP data are modeled as functions of key external and internal system parameters, such as magnetic field strength, hyperfine interactions, and exchange couplings. This allows for exploring processes that are otherwise experimentally inaccessible, providing deeper insights into the spin dynamics of the photoinduced CS state. Understanding these interconversion processes is not only essential for the fundamental photochemistry studies but also for the rational design and development of novel organic materials for photovoltaics and photocatalysis. Our results demonstrate the significant impact of singlet–triplet interconversion on the overall efficiency of charge separation and recombination processes, highlighting the importance of spin dynamics in the design of next-generation organic photovoltaic materials.},

A comparison of the system with a 5% vacancy concentration with pure lattice data shows a decrease in frequency and a decrease in lifetime for all transverse spin wave excitations observed. In addition, the clearly defined transverse spin wave excitations are distorted with the introduction of vacancy defects, and we observe reduced excitation lifetimes due to increased magnon–magnon scattering. We observe further evidence of increased magnon–magnon scattering, as the peaks in the longitudinal spin wave spectrum become less distinct. Similar impacts are observed in the vibrational subsystem, with a decrease in characteristic phonon frequency and flattening of lattice excitation signals due to vacancy defects.},

  abstract = {We analyze multiplexed fluorescence in situ hybridization (m-FISH) data for human and mouse cell lines. The m-FISH technique uses fluorescently-labeled single-stranded probes which hybridize to specific chromosomal regions, thereby allowing the measurement of the spatial positions of up to ∼ 100 tagged sites for several thousands of interphase chromosomes. Our analysis focuses on a wide range of different cell lines and two distinct organisms and provides a unified picture of chromatin structure for scales ranging from 5 kb (kilobases) up to 2 Mb (megabases), thus covering a genomic region of almost three orders of magnitude. Confirming recent analysis [Remini et al. , Phys. Rev. E 109 , 024408 (2024)], we show that there are two characteristic arrangements of chromatin referred to as phase α (crumpled globule) and phase β (looped domain) and discuss the physical properties of these phases. We show that a simple heterogeneous random walk model captures the main behavior observed in experiments and brings considerable insights into chromosomal structure.},

  abstract = {Second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory is well-known as a computationally inexpensive approach to the electron correlation problem that is size-consistent with a size-consistent reference but fails to be regular. On the other hand, the less well-known many-body version of Brillouin–Wigner perturbation theory has the reverse properties: it is regular but fails to be size-consistent when used with the standard MP partitioning. Consequently, its widespread use remains limited. In this work, we analyze the ways in which it is possible to use alternative non-MP partitions of the Hamiltonian to yield variants of BW2 that are size-consistent as well as regular. We show that there is a vast space of such BW2 theories and also show that it is possible to define a repartitioned BW2 theory from the ground state density alone, which regenerates the exact correlation energy. We also provide a general recipe for deriving regular, size-consistent, and size-extensive partitions from physically meaningful components, and we apply the result to small model systems. The scope of these results appears to further set the stage for a revival of BW2 in quantum chemistry.},

The nodes in this cluster are programmed into a mid-ranged FPGA (Artix 7 XC7A200T), interconnected as a 3D torus by fast optical links. The implemented MD algorithm is highly parallelized and highly pipelined internally. The FPGA cluster is freely scalable in terms of size, i.e., a larger MD system requires more nodes, however, without compromising simulation speed. The performance in terms of energy stability and simulation speed is analyzed. At present, the focus lies on the fast networking, while only minimal MD functionality has been implemented so far, i.e., Lennard-Jones interactions and a thermostat, which were needed to demonstrate the feasibility of the FPGA cluster to run multi-microsecond simulations. To that end, the nucleation of a super-cooled Lennard-Jones liquid is investigated by unbiased MD simulations, which is a difficult MD problem since a high nucleation barrier has to be overcome. Finally, the pathways toward a full MD implementation are outlined. The current implementation will be made available as an open-source development project.},

Although these three defects all produce occupied electronic levels near the conduction band minimum, they impose quite different effects. Ov and Ce-int induce strong peaks in the low-energy region of the imaginary part of the microscopic dielectric function, indicating stronger electronic screening compared to the pristine CeO 2 . This causes pronounced narrowing of the bandgap, e.g., by 0.8 eV in G 0 W 0 and 1.6 eV in the eigenvalue self-consistent GW for Ov. Comparatively, Hy affects little electronic screening and bandgap at different levels of GW calculations. For the lowest several 4 f orbitals, the exchange part of the self-energy (|Σ x | &gt; 9 eV) in GW is much stronger than the correlation part (|Σ c | &lt; 5 eV) for Ov and Ce-int, while |Σ c | is much stronger than |Σ x | instead for the pristine CeO 2 and Hy. Quasiparticle weights in Ov and Ce-int decrease by a large quantity compared to the pristine CeO 2 . Consideration of Ov and Ce-int might to some extent relieve the discrepancy between the GW bandgap of the pristine CeO 2 and the experimental gap. Ov and Ce-int could reduce the excitonic binding energy several times and result in optical absorption, which corresponds to the experiments.},

  abstract = {We present an analytical description of the Alchemical Transfer Method (ATM) for molecular binding using the Potential Distribution Theory (PDT) formalism. ATM models the binding free energy by mapping the bound and unbound states of the complex by translating the ligand coordinates. PDT relates the free energy and the probability densities of the perturbation energy along the alchemical path to the probability density at the initial state, which is the unbound state of the complex in the case of a binding process. Hence, the ATM probability density of the transfer energy at the unbound state is first related by a convolution operation of the probability densities for coupling the ligand to the solvent and coupling it to the solvated receptor—for which analytical descriptions are available—with parameters obtained from maximum likelihood analysis of data from double-decoupling alchemical calculations. PDT is then used to extend this analytical description along the alchemical transfer pathway. We tested the theory on the alchemical binding of five guests to the tetramethyl octa-acid host from the SAMPL8 benchmark set. In each case, the probability densities of the perturbation energy for transfer along the alchemical transfer pathway obtained from numerical calculations match those predicted from the theory and double-decoupling simulations. The work provides a solid theoretical foundation for alchemical transfer, offers physical insights on the form of the probability densities observed in alchemical transfer calculations, and confirms the conceptual and numerical equivalence between the alchemical transfer and double-decoupling processes.},

  abstract = {Correlated orbital theory (COT) is an exact one-particle treatment that adds essential electron correlation into its molecular orbitals, potentially reducing correlated treatments of response properties to one-particle coupled-perturbed Hartree–Fock- or Kohn–Sham-like calculations. Such a computation is vastly simpler than the usual ab initio correlated approach that would add correlation typically with EOM-CC after a perturbed mean-field solution. The question then is, how well can this be accomplished via the Quantum Theory Project (QTP) exchange–correlation (XC) functionals that are meant to emulate the rigorous COT framework? This paper addresses this question for response properties by making comparisons between such orbital-specific calculations and those from well-correlated EOM-CC solutions for static polarizabilities, nuclear magnetic resonance coupling constants, and chemical shifts. The simple orbital-specific version provides an accurate realization of the correlated EOM-CC results, but now in a mode that facilitates an orbital-by-orbital interpretation. Here, we compare 33 XC functionals from the different Jacob’s ladder rungs always against the EOM-CCSD results. Thus, the smallest mean absolute deviation for the static polarizability comes from LC-QTP XC, 0.28 a.u. Regarding the total nuclear spin–spin coupling constants, QTP01 performs best, %Error = 10.63% (QTP02 and LC-QTP are second and third best). Finally, the XC that stood out in the chemical shift analysis was TPSS0, which presented the best result for the majority of the chemical shifts. However, considering the overall performances based on linear fitting of all isotope data points, five functionals are recommended for a chemical shift study: TPSS0, ω B97X, QTP00, QTP01, and QTP02, all presenting R 2 = 0.96.},

A nonlinear behavior of the transport current is exhibited due to the competition between the interdot coupling strength of the two QDs and the Kondo effect. With the increase in interdot coupling strength, the transport current first increases at low interdot couplings and then decreases with the strong interdot couplings. The reason is that the interdot coupling strength will result in a continuous evolution from the Kondo singlet state of individual QDs to the spin singlet state forming between the two QDs. Moreover, we define the physical quantity ∂G / ∂t as the differential function of differential conductance G with respect to interdot coupling strength t . The nonlinear transport behavior and the physical quantity ∂G / ∂t with differential conductance at different bias voltages can be used to detect the potential Kondo resonance in the nonequilibrium transport experiments.},

In this method, two independent forces are constructed and projected into the minimization subspace and the constraint subspace, respectively. One force is directed toward the minimum-energy point, while the other is directed toward the conical intersection seam. The root-mean-square deviation based bias potential is added to the potential energy surface to force the structure escape from the already explored regions. The additional constraint function is used to enable the structure reach different intersection seams. This method can be used for systematically and automatically searching MECIs or exploring conical intersection seams. Compared to the penalty function-based metadynamics method, this new method is more effective and stable in searching MECIs. Furthermore, this method can be combined with any kind of constraint, whether geometric or non-geometric, making it a generalized tool for the automated search of constrained minimum.},

  abstract = {The multilayer-multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH) method has garnered significant attention in the realm of theoretical chemistry owing to its powerful ability to perform numerically exact descriptions of multi-dimensional quantum dynamics and exhibit the remarkable performance in simulating the nonadiabatic dynamics of complex systems. Despite the availability of computational packages within the ML-MCTDH framework, executing these calculations seamlessly is not a straightforward task. Typically, substantial efforts are necessitated to configure the correct inputs for ML-MCTDH calculations, which require to correctly define several non-trivial parameters, to reasonably setup the optimal tree expansion of wavefunctions, and to properly select basis function numbers. To address these challenges, we have developed an auxiliary package named ML-MCTDH-Aid, which facilitates the setup of ML-MCTDH calculations using the Heidelberg MCTDH package in a user-friendly manner. This package is primarily tailored to handle the high-dimensional nonadiabatic dynamics governed by the Hamiltonian composed of several electronic states, several vibrational modes and their linear vibronic coupling terms. It automatically generates multiple essential input files, and all the calculations can be performed in an all-in-one black-box easy-to-use manner. To show the utility of the ML-MCTDH-Aid package, we provide a step-by-step tutorial that demonstrates running ML-MCTDH studies on three models. These examples illuminate how the utilization of the ML-MCTDH-Aid package significantly enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of ML-MCTDH calculations. This substantially boosts the accessibility of ML-MCTDH calculations in tackling the high-dimensional quantum dynamics of complex systems.},

  abstract = {Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a widely used precipitant to concentrate proteins. The effect of PEG is generally understood to be an entropic attraction between proteins due to the depletion effect of PEG around proteins. However, measurements by Bloustine et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 96 , 087803 (2006)] of the liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) temperature have shown that a lysozyme solution is stabilized and destabilized by the addition of low and high molecular-weight PEG, respectively. They also presented a theoretical model of the LLPS temperature as a virial expansion of the free energy and concluded that, in addition to the depletion effect, the attractive interaction between protein and PEG is necessary to explain the experiments. In the present study, theoretical calculations based on liquid-state density functional theory utilizing coarse-grained models are conducted to demonstrate that the protein–PEG effective attraction is responsible for the suppression and promotion of LLPS upon the addition of low- and high-weight PEG, respectively. In contrast, if the interactions between the protein and the PEG are solely due to the excluded volume effect, PEG of any molecular weight destabilizes the solution. These results suggest the necessity to reconsider the conventional understanding of the effects of polymer addition, which have been historically attributed to solely the depletion force.},

While the positions of particles form a fixed (“quenched”) locally-finite set (configuration) γ ⊂ R d ⁠ , the spins σ x and σ y interact via a pair potential whenever x − y &lt; ρ ⁠ , where ρ &gt; 0 is a fixed interaction radius. The number n x of particles interacting with a particle in position x is finite but unbounded in x . The growth of n x as | x | → ∞ creates a major technical problem for solving our SDE system. To overcome this problem, we use a finite volume approximation combined with a version of the Ovsjannikov method, and prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution in a scale of Banach spaces of weighted sequences. As an application example, we construct stochastic dynamics associated with Gibbs states of our particle system.},

We establish the completeness relations for squared solutions to the Lax spectral problem and determine the Poisson brackets between the scattering data. Action-angle variables, expressed through the scattering data, are constructed based on these Poisson brackets. It is noteworthy that the analyticity of scattering data differs from that of the AKNS-type spectral problem, necessitating adjustments to the integral paths when deriving the completeness relations. Interestingly, the conservation laws for the equation can be expressed in terms of either the spectral parameter or the potential functions, revealing the connection between the potential functions and the scattering data.},

After introducing the mathematical framework, we apply the framework to a couple of applications. The first application is related to a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian describing gain and loss phenomena, widely considered in the context of PT -quantum mechanics. The second application is related to a finite-dimensional version of the Swanson Hamiltonian, never considered before, and addresses the problem of deriving a milder version of the RDM when exceptional points form in the system.},

This method does not target dimensionality reduction: rather, this method helps shed light on the memory-dependence of 1-electron reduced density matrices in time-dependent configuration interaction (TDCI), a scheme to solve for the correlated dynamics of electrons in molecules. Though time-dependent density functional theory has established that the 1-electron reduced density possesses memory-dependence, the precise nature of this memory-dependence has not been understood. We derive a symmetry/constraint-preserving method to propagate reduced TDCI electron density matrices. In numerical tests on two model systems (H 2 and HeH + ), we show that with sufficiently large time-delay (or memory-dependence), our method propagates reduced TDCI density matrices with high quantitative accuracy. We study the dependence of our results on time step and basis set. To implement our method, we derive the 4-index tensor that relates reduced and full TDCI density matrices. Our derivation applies to any TDCI system, regardless of basis set, number of electrons, or choice of Slater determinants in the wave function.},

The latter problem can be viewed as optimizing positive curves on the boundary of AdS 3 space passing through n prescribed points. We observe that the answers to the two problems exhibit interesting symmetries: optimizing the Jordan curve in ∂ ∞ H 3 gives rise to a welding homeomorphism that is the boundary of a pleated plane in AdS 3 , whereas optimizing the positive curve in ∂ ∞ AdS 3 gives rise to a Jordan curve that is the boundary of a pleated plane in H 3 ⁠ .},

In uniform internally heated convection, the supply of heat equally leaves the domain entirely by conduction in the absence of a flow. When the heating, quantified by the Rayleigh number, R , becomes sufficiently large, turbulent convection ensues, reducing the heat leaving the domain through the bottom boundary. In the case of no-slip boundary conditions, with the background field method, we prove that F B ≳ R − 2 / 3 − R − 1 / 2 ⁡ log ( 1 − R − 2 / 3 ) ⁠ , up to a positive constant independent of the Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers. Whereas between stress-free boundaries we show that, F B ≳ R − 40 / 29 − R − 35 / 29 ⁡ log ( 1 − R − 40 / 29 ) ⁠ . We perform a numerical study of the system in two dimensions up to a Rayleigh number of 5 × 10 9 using the spectral solver Dedalus. The numerical investigations indicate that F B ∼ R − 0.092 and F B ∼ R − 0.12 for the two kinematic boundary conditions respectively.

These notions always have a graded character, since the multisymplectic forms are of a higher degree than two. Another line of work has been to extend the concept of Dirac structures to these new scenarios. In the present paper we review all these notions, relate them and propose and study a generalization that (under some mild regularity conditions) includes them and is of graded nature. We expect this generalization to allow us to advance in the study of classical field theories, their integrability, reduction, numerical approximations and even their quantization.},

  abstract     = {We apply the well known Kovacic algorithm to generate Liouvillian (i.e., closed-form) solutions to the ordinary differential equation that governs the radial part of the separable, coupled to scalar curvature, massive scalar wave equation on a D-dimensional de Sitter background spacetime. The radial equation is simply related to the famous hypergeometric equation, and our work is carried out in this general setting. We find several families of infinite sets of special parameter values for which Liouvillian solutions exist, and we demonstrate how to generate these solutions recursively. The solutions are related to hypergeometric polynomials and in some cases can be constructed explicitly. For some of the families, the Liouvillian solutions exactly satisfy the boundary conditions for quasinormal modes, a fundamental set of damped, outgoing wave-functions that depend only on the background spacetime and scalar field parameters. In these families we obtain agreement with published results on the scalar quasinormal modes of the pure de Sitter spacetime. For other families, we establish conjectures regarding the factorization of the parameter constraints required for existence of Liouvillian solutions. Our results are consistent with published results on the hypergeometric equation and the well known Pöschl–Teller equation. Our new contributions are to demonstrate how to generate the hypergeometric Liouvillian solutions recursively, to completely solve the quasinormal mode problem with Liouvillian solutions, and to analyze the Liouvillian parameter constraints for the hypergeometric equation, including the case of the physical de Sitter parameters. This work contributes new knowledge to the fields of special functions and general relativity.},

By our results and previous studies, all spatially homogeneous solutions whose spaces have zero-dimensional moduli spaces of left-invariant metrics are found.

And with the help of Hasse diagram visualizations, we study the ensuing higher spin spectrums to develop the corresponding metrics using two types of gauge transformations. For completeness, we examine the thermodynamics of the standard BTZ coupled to E 6 higher spin gravity fields by computing the partition function exploiting a one to one correspondence between the factors of the vacuum characters and the roots of the E 6 root system.},

This generalization leads us to a useful result for approaching the vertex-minor problem.

The quantum and classical systems share the entire eigenvalues and the eigenvectors are related one to one. When the birth rate B ( x ) and the death rate D ( x ) are chosen to be the coefficients of the difference equation governing the orthogonal polynomials of Askey scheme, the quantum system is exactly solvable. The eigenvectors are the orthogonal polynomials themselves and the eigenvalues are given analytically. Many examples are periodic since their eigenvalues are all integers, or all integers for integer parameters. The situation is very similar to the exactly solvable one dimensional quantum mechanical systems. These exactly solvable BD processes contain many adjustable free parameters which could be helpful for various simulation purposes.},

We establish the convergence rate for the solution of three-dimensional compressible Navier–Stokes–Korteweg system to the solution of three-dimensional Navier–Stokes system as the capillary coefficient tends to zero. Once the capillary coefficient tends to zero, this convergence rate will tend to zero. This explicit convergence rate result extracted in the vanishing capillary limit improves the important work of [Bian et al. SIAM J. Math. Anal. 46 (2), 1633 (2014)].},

It is easy to show that there exists a c ∗ &gt; 0 such that when the wave speed is large than or equals to c ∗ , the model admits an increasing traveling wave solution. By applying the approaches, such as the weighted energy method, the comparison principle and Fourier’s transform, we prove that all traveling wavefronts with speed c &gt; min{ c *, c ∗ }, ( c * &gt; 0), are globally stable with the exponential convergence rate t − 1 2 e − μ t for some constant μ &gt; 0.},

To shed light on this phenomenon, we focus on a special two-dimensional anisotropic magnetohydrodynamic equation near a background magnetic field with mixed dissipation. We study the stability problem and large time behavior of solutions. Precisely, we obtain the global stability of smooth solution for the two-dimensional nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic system in the sense of H 2 . In addition, we also establish the large time behavior with explicit decay rates to the linearized system.},

The main contribution of this paper is to demonstrate the existence of a countable collection of open balls ( B i ) i such that the restriction of u to B i ∩ Ω maintains a consistent sign. Furthermore, for any compact subset K of Σ, the set difference K \⋃ i B i is shown to have a Minkowski dimension strictly less than d − 1 − ϵ .
