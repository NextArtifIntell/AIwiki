  abstract     = {Magnesium-air batteries hold potential applications due to their high energy density and environmental friendliness. However, the formation of passivation films and the suboptimal standard electrode potential have been primary scientific challenges hindering the rapid advancement of magnesium-air batteries. This study develops Mg 2 Sn anode materials and conceptualizes a mechanism leveraging their superior thermoelectric properties to enhance the open-circuit voltage and inhibit the formation of passivation films. By employing a self-designed magnesium saturation temperature smelting method, high-performance n-type and p-type Mg 2 Sn thermoelectric materials are synthesized rapidly in the air. Notably, the n-type thermoelectric material exhibits a peak power factor of up to 4.83 mW m −1 K −2 and a thermoelectric figure of merit ( ZT ) exceeding 1. A unique Mg 2 Sn-air battery is engineered to utilize thermoelectric effects for modulating the built-in electric field. This design not only compensates for the open-circuit voltage but also harnesses the Seebeck electromotive force generated by Mg 2 Sn to suppress the formation of passivation films on the anode surface, giving the high thermoelectric performance Mg 2 Sn, which tends to deliquesce in air, a unique application prospect. It elucidates a pathway for utilizing thermoelectric effects to synergistically enhance the electrochemical performance of metal-air batteries.},

The microbubbles are directly generated by electrolysis of the hydrogel, and their displacement is detected using optical microscopy in the focal plane of a focused vortex beam. Microbubbles displaced off-axis can be pulled by a restoring radial force component that forms a stable two-dimensional trap. We also observe an off-axis tangential microbubble motion that is due to the transfer of the beam&#39;s angular momentum flux. A simple elastic model for the hydrogel deformation combined with radiation force calculations finally provides local values of the medium&#39;s shear modulus, which are found to be in good agreement with standard bulk measurements performed with a rheometer. Our results suggest that acoustical tweezers are relevant tools to characterize the local mechanical properties of complex soft materials, opening opportunities in the field of active rheology.},

  abstract     = {Delta-E effect sensors developed for detecting small amplitude and low-frequency magnetic fields have shown potential for miniaturization. However, a comprehensive signal-and-noise analysis of such miniaturized sensors is lacking. Here, we present an in-depth study of the key performance characteristics of sub-millimeter-sized delta-E effect sensors with a double-wing resonator geometry. Several resonance modes are evaluated for their sensitivity, noise, and limit of detection ( LoD ⁠ ) as functions of the excitation voltage amplitude and magnetic bias flux density. We identify and discuss the optimal conditions for sensor operation and compare the performance to that of the reported macroscopic devices. While all investigated resonance modes behave qualitatively similar, quantitative differences in signal and noise lead to an almost sevenfold difference in LoD s. The performance is limited by magnetic noise at large excitation amplitudes and, unlike reported macroscopic delta-E effect sensors, by noise from the excitation signal and charge amplifier at low excitation amplitudes. The best performance is achieved in the third resonance mode excited at 683 kHz with a LoD ≤ 7.4 ± 3 nT / H z between 10 and 1000 Hz and a minimum of 2.8 nT / H z at 195 Hz. This demonstrates an improvement over previously reported values for miniaturized delta-E effect sensors in this frequency range. Moreover, the sensors show a −3 dB bandwidth of ≈440 Hz, which is significantly wider compared to macroscopic delta-E effect sensors. Reducing electronic noise and employing advanced magnetic multilayers can further improve the LoD ⁠ , making these miniaturized sensors promising candidates for compact arrays.},

Different intensity waveforms are created by adjusting the motion profile of a resonant absorber (an ensemble of Mössbauer nuclei) and tuning the energy of the incident radiation. A crucial aspect of this method is the use of a low fundamental frequency of vibrations, which broadens the possibilities for γ -ray control. The results of numerical simulations are experimentally validated by generating single and double γ -pulses and inducing short-term absorption. For this, a resonant absorber containing 57 Fe nuclei was vibrated with different motion profiles composed of 12 harmonics with a fundamental frequency of 1 MHz. The proposed technique represents an advancement in the manipulation of γ -rays, and potentially x rays, paving the way for the performance of unique types of γ -ray or x-ray quantum experiments and the development of tools such as adjustable table-top γ -pulse sources or γ -ray or x-ray delays and gates.

Thus, in this work, we investigated the relationship between the absorption of multilayer graphene with different stacking orders from the transition dipole moment (TDM) and joint density of states (JDOS). It is found that the interlayer linkage of different stacking sequences leads to the varied chiral pseudospin doublets, which results in changes in TDM, consequently influencing the absorption spectra in the infrared and visible regions. While the enhanced absorption in the thicker multilayers from the ultraviolet to ionizing radiation region could be attributed to the increasement of JDOS. The comprehensive understanding of the absorption mechanism behind the multilayer graphene could provide another way of thinking about the optical absorption stacking modulation in atypical multilayer graphene.},

Rapid developments in nonlinear quantum frequency conversion techniques have enhanced the potential for constructing a trapped ion quantum network via optical fiber connections. The generation of long-distance entanglement has been demonstrated with ions such as Ca + and Ba + , which emit photons in visible or near-infrared range naturally. On the other hand, as the qubit-native photons reside in ultra-violet (UV) spectrum, the Yb + ion has not been considered as a strong competitor for telecommunication qubits despite extensive research on it. Here, we demonstrate an efficient difference-frequency conversion of UV photons, emitted from a trapped Yb + ion, into a visible range. We provide experimental evidence that confirms the converted photons are radiated from the Yb + ion.

We have conducted a detailed theoretical analysis of the piezoelectric properties of this piezoelectric device. By utilizing a coplanar electrode piezoelectric mode, pressure applied to one electrode generates a potential difference between the two electrodes. Notably, the piezoelectric performance of the device can be adjusted by modifying its structure. Numerical simulations and experimental results indicate that the piezoelectric performance reaches an optimal value when the distance between the electrodes is equal to one-half of the electrode length. Additionally, we have developed a method to enhance the piezoelectric voltage output capability of the device under low load resistance conditions. Specifically, by introducing charge carriers into the piezoelectric layer from the doped silicon substrate, the device&#39;s resistance is reduced due to the Schottky contact. The piezoelectric operating mode proposed in this paper facilitates energy harvesting and self-powered sensing, distinguishing it from the d 31 and d 33 operational modes associated with traditional sandwich device structures, thereby allowing for more versatile device configurations.},

Here, by introducing grain boundary trapping states into the AgSbTe 2 matrix, the thermally activated release of carriers at elevated temperatures enhances electrical conductivity, while the increased barrier potential induces an energy filtering effect that sustains a high Seebeck coefficient. This synergistic optimization of electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient significantly enhances the power factor. Additionally, numerous point defects and a higher density of grain boundaries further enhance phonon scattering, resulting in a 33% reduction in glass-like thermal conductivity compared to the pristine sample. With enhanced power factor and reduced lattice thermal conductivity, Fe-doped AgSbTe 2 achieves a remarkable peak zT of 1.8 at 623 K and an impressive zT avg of 1.4 over the temperature range of 323–623 K, showcasing its leading performance in the field.

The enhanced nonreciprocal thermal radiation is attributed to the field enhancement of epsilon-near-zero layer and nonreciprocal guided resonances excited in the WSM film. By studying the magnetic field distribution, the physical mechanism of multi-band nonreciprocal thermal radiation is revealed, which can be verified by the impedance matching theory. Furthermore, the dependence of the structure dimensions and the axial vector b of the Weyl semimetal on the performance of the nonreciprocal radiation is investigated in detail.

  abstract     = {Nanoscale Co/CoO/Co point contact devices are promising for spintronics, magnetic sensors, single-electron transistors, and memory devices. We fabricated Co/CoO/Co point contact devices and studied their random telegraph signal (RTS) characteristics at various temperatures. In the time domain, the current fluctuates asymmetrically with respect to zero bias, with RTS behavior emerging above a certain voltage threshold. In the frequency domain, the RTS power spectral density exhibits Lorentzian lines. As temperature increases from 50 to 300 K, two RTS behaviors are observed: at ≤100 K, the high current state dominates; at ≥200 K, the low current state prevails, with RTS absent at 150 K. Single exponential fitting shows that RTS state lifetimes decrease with temperature. The charge capture and release model explains the RTS origins and temperature-dependent behavior from an energy band perspective. This study provides insights into charge dynamics, single-electron transport, and the noise mechanisms affecting the reliability of nanoscale devices.},

  abstract     = {Tunnel field-effect transistor (TFET) is emerging as a promising alternative to overcome the thermionic limit of 60 mV/dec in subthreshold swing (SS) inherent to metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor through the band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) mechanism. TFET offers significant potential for applications in future industries, such as low-power sensors and wearable devices, where extreme energy efficiency is critical. Notably, due to the characteristic of the BTBT mechanism, TFET can maintain stable SS performance even at high temperature, enabling low-power operation under such condition. Although numerous theoretical predictions and simulations support this capability, experimental validation has not yet been demonstrated. As electric and autonomous vehicles advance, the demand for automotive semiconductors has increased, highlighting the importance of transistor technology that remains stable at high temperatures and consumes less power. Here, we report high temperature TFETs showing SS &lt; 60 mV/dec through vertical heterojunction of two-dimensional semiconductors. n-TFET and p-TFET were implemented via BP-MoS 2 and WSe 2 -ReS 2 heterojunction, respectively. Both TFETs reached SS min under 50 mV/dec at room temperature and maintained SS 1dec_avg under 60 mV/dec up to 400 K. These findings pave the way for low-power circuits capable of operation in harsh environments.},

Through the in situ ALD of 10–30 cycles Ga 2 O 3 dipole layer, a 1.09–1.59 V flatband voltage positive modulation range is obtained with a small 0.05–0.36 nm equivalent oxide thickness penalty, respectively. The modification of the band alignment is verified by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurement on the gate stacks before and after Ga 2 O 3 dipole layer insertion. The valence band offset between SiO 2 /HfO 2 has been suppressed by the insertion of Ga 2 O 3 , proving a p-type dipole nature of Ga 2 O 3 dipole layer. The first interface of SiO 2 /Ga 2 O 3 more dominantly decides the p-type nature, and the second Ga 2 O 3 /HfO 2 suppresses it.

  abstract     = {One-dimensional structures such as nanowires (NWs) show great promise in tailoring the rates of hot carrier thermalization in semiconductors with important implications for the design of efficient hot carrier absorbers. However, the fabrication of defect-free crystal structures and control of their intrinsic electronic properties can be challenging, raising concerns about the role of competing radiative and non-radiative recombination mechanisms that govern hot carrier effects. Here, we elucidate the impact of crystal purity and altered electronic properties on the hot carrier properties by comparing two classes of III–V semiconductor NW arrays with similar bandgap energies and geometries, yet different crystal quality: one composed of GaAsSb NWs, which host antisite point defects but are free of planar stacking defects, and the other InGaAs NWs with a very high density of stacking defects. Photoluminescence spectroscopy demonstrates distinct hot carrier effects in both NW arrays; however, the InGaAs NWs exhibit stronger hot carrier effects, as evidenced by increased carrier temperature under identical photo-absorptivity. This difference arises from higher rates of Auger recombination in the InGaAs NWs due to their increased n -type conductivity, as confirmed by excitation power-dependent measurements. Our findings suggest that while enhancing material properties is crucial for improving the performance of hot carrier absorbers, optimizing conditions to increase the rates of Auger recombination will further boost the efficiency of these devices.},

  abstract     = {Zero-dimensional/one-dimensional (0D/1D) heterojunctions have excellent potential in the field of optoelectronic devices due to the synergy effect of different dimensions. Most reported 0D/1D heterojunction photodetectors only focus on optimizing the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers at the interface. However, the carriers within the quantum dots (QDs) cannot be transferred to the electrodes, resulting in recombination of photogenerated carriers separated at the interface. Therefore, the response speed of most 0D/1D heterojunction photodetectors is still limited to the order of seconds (s) and milliseconds (ms). In our work, we demonstrate a nanosecond (ns) scale ZnO/CuO heterojunction photodetector with efficient photoelectric conversion by engineering the type-II 0D/1D heterojunction interface. Herein, the surface defect states of ZnO QDs are deliberately introduced as “electrons storage pool” to suppress carrier recombination and further promote separation, which has been confirmed by photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL). As a result, the photodetector exhibited excellent performance with ultrafast response speed of 20 ns, responsivity of 213 A/W, and detectivity of 2.95 × 10 11 Jones, respectively. This defect related interface engineering provides a feasible strategy for the development of high-performance 0D/1D heterojunction photodetectors.},

The channel lengths ( ⁠ L c ⁠ ) for investigated nanoscale spin-FETs are shorter than 6 nm. The spin transport properties of these nanoscale spin-FETs are subsequently studied by using the nonequilibrium Green&#39;s function method in combination with density functional theory. Due to the strong electronic coupling at the interfaces between electrodes and channel, p-type Ohmic contacts are obtained for spin down.

Very-low subthreshold swing (SS) values below 60 mV/dec are found for spin-FETs with L c ≥ 4.05 nm, and the lowest SS value is 39 mV/dec for the spin-FET with L c = 5.75 nm. At room temperature, the values of MR exceed 10 6 % ⁠ , and the corresponding SS values are below 92 mV/dec with a minimum SS of 82 mV/dec, still demonstrating high performance for designed nanoscale spin-FETs.

This technique utilizes a nano-transistor as a thermometer, placed in close proximity to the inversion layer under investigation, enabling measurements of the electron temperature for values above approximately 10 K. When applied to Joule-heating experiments, this method reveals a notable discrepancy between the measurement results and predictions made by the conventional theory based on the deformation-potential coupling with low-energy acoustic phonons. Specifically, the injected-power dependence of the electron temperature is much weaker than expected.

For LIM circuits, the complementary structure is desirable for low-power consumption. To date, there have been rare reports on the n-channel organic thin-film transistor nonvolatile memories (OTFT-NVMs), which is indispensable for building the complementary LIM circuits. In this Letter, we demonstrate a route to achieve the low-voltage operatable n-channel OTFT-NVMs, by blade-coating an ultrathin tetratetracontane buffer layer on the oxygen plasma treated ferroelectric terpolymer insulator with a low coercive field. The n-channel OTFT-NVMs exhibit good performances, with a high electron mobility over 0.1 cm 2 /V s, highly reliable endurance over 1000 cycles, and highly stable retention over 10 000 s. The mechanism for improving device performances is discussed. Moreover, the mechanism and the route for improving performances are also suitable for p-channel OTFT-NVMs. Furthermore, the LIM architecture-based complementary organic inverters are constructed by integrating the n-channel and p-channel OTFT-NVMs, which can well perform logic and memory operations at the low voltage of 10 V.

  abstract     = {Improving the energy storage density of dielectric capacitors, which are widely used in power electronic devices, is a continuous challenge. In this work, a site-selection multi-element co-doping strategy was used by doping Pr atoms at the A-site and then doping Mn atoms at the B-site in bismuth-based layered perovskite-like structure prototype ferroelectrics Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 due to its large polarization and high Curie temperature. On the one hand, the substitution of Bi 3+ with Pr 3+ at the A-site introduces significant cation disorder, which disrupts the long-range ferroelectric order, consequently leading to a reduction in remnant polarization. On the other hand, the substitution of Ti 4+ by Mn 4+ at the B-site results in delayed polarization saturation due to the different electronic configurations between d 3 Mn 4+ and d 0 Ti 4+ . In addition, the leakage current of the thin film exhibits a continuous decrease with doping concentration, which can be attributed to microstructural modifications including reduced grain size and the formation of amorphous regions, consequently leading to an enhanced breakdown field. Finally, a recoverable energy storage density of 42.1 J cm −3 and an efficiency of 69.9% were obtained for the BPT film, and a recoverable energy storage density of 81.8 J cm −3 and an efficiency of 73% were achieved in the BPTM film. The enhanced energy storage density can be attributed to the synergistic effect of co-doping of A- and B-sites on polarization and breakdown. Besides, the doped films have excellent frequency, temperature, and cycling stability. This work provides a guide to substantially enhance dielectric energy storage by a site-selection multi-element co-doping strategy.},

We compare the effects of bipolar and unipolar electric fields applied in the reverse poling direction, analyzing the changes in permittivity and piezoelectric resonance. Piezoresponse force microscopy is employed to characterize domain configurations in poled and electrically depoled samples. Our findings suggest that property degradation may arise from the nucleation and growth of domains oriented opposite to the initial arrangement.},

  abstract     = {Flexible magnetoelectric composite devices have exceptional features and potential in peculiar scenes. However, maintaining the magnetoelectric response under extreme bending conditions remains a challenge. Polyvinylidene fluoride-based polymers, possessing favorable piezoelectric properties and high flexibility, provide a viable solution for magnetoelectric composites. This work constructed multiferroic core-shell nanoparticle-embedded flexible membranes and achieved a retainable high magnetoelectric (ME) coupling coefficient in the curved composite materials. A maximum ME coefficient of 74 mV cm −1 Oe −1 was obtained, far higher than the 0–3 ME nanocomposites reported thus far. The ME coefficient can be maintained above 40 mV cm −1 Oe −1 when the bending angle is less than 90° and expresses high sensitivity within the H dc range of 100–2400 Oe. Based on crystal structure analysis and phase-field simulation, the synergy magnetoelectric effects accounting for the multiferroic core-shell nanoparticles, copolymer matrix, and magnetic cores contribute to the promoted ME coefficient in the flexible composites. This work provides a feasible pathway for next-generation flexible devices in the wearable and portable fields.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) materials offer vast potential for designing ferroelectrics with desired properties through simple layer stacking. Here, based on first principles, we demonstrate that the vdW layered crystals RuX 2 (X = Cl, Br, and I) are a class of 2D multiferroic sliding ferroelectrics. The stacking of two magnetic RuX 2 monolayers with the same orientation breaks the spatial inversion symmetry, resulting in a stable vertical polarization. In addition, the direction of polarization can be reversed through slight interlayer sliding, in which it only needs to overcome the small energy barrier of 7.16 meV. Among these layered crystals, the bilayer RuI 2 not only possesses a remarkable sliding ferroelectricity of 0.49 pC/m but also exhibits stable long-range magnetic order due to its large magnetic anisotropy energy. When the RuI 2 stack is increased to trilayers, the polarization significantly increases to 1.03 pC/m, which is much larger than that of its bilayer structure. Furthermore, the application of compressive strain results in a substantial increase in vertical polarization. This work provides an efficient method for designing 2D multiferroic sliding ferroelectric materials by stack engineering.},

However, no superconducting diodes reported in the literature have a forward current carrying capacity exceeding 1 A, and hence are not suitable for use in superconducting power applications. Here, we present a high- T c superconducting diode that leverages permanent magnets to induce an asymmetry in the critical current of a superconducting coated conductor upon current reversal. The magnets are arranged to replicate the self-field of the conductor at I c ⁠ , causing constructive or destructive interference with the transport current&#39;s self-field depending on the current direction. This interference generates asymmetric internal magnetic field distributions, leading to the directional suppression of the critical current density and a diode effect. We demonstrate Δ I c values &gt; 150 A and a half-wave transformer rectifier using a single high- T c flux diode submerged in liquid nitrogen, which rectifies 30 A into a 220 μ H superconducting magnet.},

  abstract     = {Spin transport across an interface in energy-efficient spintronic devices, especially for spin–orbit torque applications, has sparked interest in the spintronics community. Here, we employ a rare-earth metal spacer Dy to modify the interface of a Py-based heterostructure, with the aim of modulating the spin dynamics of the system and thereby controlling the spin–orbit torques. As the thickness of Dy increases, it is found that the saturation magnetization of Py/Dy decreases and eventually reaches a plateau, suggesting the induced magnetic moment of Dy that aligns opposite to the Fe and Ni moments. Such a self-assembled antiferromagnetic interface can be destroyed by the insertion of a Cu layer between Py and Dy. Utilizing this interface effect, an additional spin dissipation is observed by enhancement of spin dynamic damping, which has achieved a high spin mixing conductance at the interface of Py/Dy according to spin pumping theory. Utilizing the Py/Dy interface, an unconventional in-plane field-like torque spin–orbit torque (SOT) in a Py/Dy/Pt structure is achieved, while the field-like SOT efficiency experiences a notable enhancement in the Py/Dy/Pt system. By optimizing the interface between the Dy layer and Pt, it is possible to further enhance the performance and efficiency of the devices, thereby promoting the development of spintronic devices. This discovery has significant implications for the future design of low-power spintronic devices.},

At ambient pressure, MnF 2 in the rutile structure displays antiferromagnetic properties along with significant altermagnetic characteristics. Upon increasing pressure, MnF 2 undergoes sequential phase transitions from the rutile structure to the SrI 2 -type structure and further to the α-PbCl 2 -type structure. Under high pressure, all three structures of MnF 2 exhibit stable altermagnetism, with the maximum spin splitting of 307.5 meV at 3 GPa for the rutile structure, 133.6 meV at 12 GPa for the SrI 2 -type structure, and 58.4 meV at 20 GPa for the α-PbCl 2 -type structure. Additionally, our findings suggest that the magnitude of spin splitting can be effectively controlled by modulating the antiferromagnetic exchange interactions and the electron hopping parameters between sublattices.

  abstract     = {High-performance artificial synaptic devices that emulate the functions of biological synapses are crucial for advancing energy-efficient brain-inspired computing systems. Current studies predominantly focus on memristive devices, which achieve synaptic functions through nonvolatile electric current-assisted carrier modulation. However, these methods often suffer from excessive energy consumption. Here, a type of low-energy-consumption artificial synapse based on strain-mediated electric-field control of magnetic skyrmion&#39;s radius is demonstrated, where the energy consumption is 10 fJ per state and the non-volatility is achieved by local ferroelectric domain switching under bipolar electric fields. The proposed skyrmion-based synaptic device can replicate essential synaptic behaviors, including long-term potentiation (LTP), long-term depression (LTD), paired-pulse facilitation, paired-pulse depression, and spiking-time-dependent plasticity, aligning it closely with the biological synaptic system. The synaptic weight change and non-linearity of the artificial synapse are emulated by modulating the magnetic skyrmion&#39;s radius through precisely engineering the applied electric-field pulses. Simulation using the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database reveals that the pattern recognition rate decreases exponentially with increasing LTP/LTD non-linearity, quantifying the effect of the LTP/LTD non-linearity on the pattern recognition rate. This work underscores the potential of strain-mediated electric-field control of single skyrmion&#39;s radius as a groundbreaking approach for developing high density and low-energy consumption artificial synaptic devices.},

Using super-Nyquist sampling magneto-optical Kerr effect microscopy and micromagnetic simulations, we demonstrate that these resonators can induce a π phase shift in the transmitted spin wave. The phase shift is highly sensitive to the magnetization alignment within the resonator, allowing for on-demand control via magnetic switching.

Realization of such schemes necessitates the development of device analogs to biological neurons and synapses. Particularly, in spin-based artificial synapses, the spin–orbit torque (SOT) can be utilized for changing between multiple resistance states of the synapse. In this work, we demonstrate synaptic behavior, namely long-term potentiation and long-term depression in a ferrimagnet (GdFe) via SOT generated using a heavy metal (Pt). The dependence of the synapse-like output on the input parameters is extensively investigated. Synaptic arrays based on experimental results are simulated and used to perform the classification of a handwritten digit dataset. Correlating the classification accuracy with the experimentally observed synaptic behavior, the performance of the synapse is found to depend on the critical switching currents. Understanding the correlation between the input parameters and synaptic performance could accelerate the development of artificial spintronic synapses possessing high operation speed, nonvolatility and plasticity, thereby enabling efficient compute in-memory systems in the near future.},

Herein, we report the high-frequency magnetic properties of the modified Ba 5 Cu 2- x Ni x Ti 3 Fe 12 O 31 (Cu–Ni 18H) ferrites, achieving a relatively high permeability of 1.6 and a low magnetic loss of 0.05 at 6 GHz, which is much better than previous reports. Such excellent performance is attributed to the expanded mono-domain critical size and reduced damping of magnetic moment precession. Moreover, deploying Cu–Ni 18H ferrites as a substrate on a patch antenna working at 6 GHz can reduce the antenna dimensions to 35% of traditional commercial materials. The present work provides a proven and promising candidate material for 5G communications and expands the research landscape for the high-frequency magnetic properties of microwave ferrites.},

  abstract     = {Large interfacial perpendicular magnetocrystalline anisotropy (iPMA) and low Gilbert magnetic damping constant ( ⁠ α ⁠ ) in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) are desired to achieve higher storage density and lower standby power operations in magnetic random-access memory. This work theoretically investigates effects of nitrogen and fluoride anions (N-anion and F-anion) substitution on the MgO barrier interface of Fe/MgO/Fe MTJ for iPMA and α using first-principles calculations. We find that the N-anion substitution significantly enhances iPMA by four times and reduces α by 65% compared to the pristine Fe/MgO/Fe, indicating a guideline toward an MTJ with large iPMA and low α simultaneously. The mechanism is explained by a band realignment at the Fermi level ( E F ) where Fe d ±1 ( d xz ,d yz ) orbitals at the interface are pushed above and below E F but Fe d ±2 ( d xy , d x 2 −y 2 ) orbitals remain at E F by the N-anion substitution.},

  abstract     = {The optimization of physical parameters serves various purposes in device development, including in system identification and efficiency. Spin-torque oscillators have been experimentally and theoretically applied to neuromorphic computing, but their physical parameters are usually optimized via grid search procedures. In this paper, we propose a scheme to optimize the dynamics parameters of macrospin-type spin-torque oscillators using the gradient descent method with automatic differentiation. First, we numerically create dynamic data for teaching and tune the parameters to reproduce the dynamics. This approach can be applied to determine the correspondence between spin-torque oscillator simulations and experiments. Next, we solve an image recognition task with high accuracy by connecting a coupled system of spin-torque oscillators to the input and output layers and training all of them through gradient descent. Combining this approach with experimentation makes it possible to design an experimental setup and physical system to solve a task with high precision using a spin-torque oscillator.},

  abstract     = {This study systematically investigates the optimization mechanism of NaClO solution treatment on Mo substrates for enhancing the optoelectronic performance of CZTSSe thin film solar cells. Experimental results demonstrate that a 10 s NaClO soaking forms a “spike-like” texture on the Mo surface, increasing the average surface roughness difference from 34.52 to 77.75 nm. This significantly enhances light scattering, particularly for photons reaching the back Mo electrode, thereby extending the optical path and promoting photon reabsorption. Additionally, the roughened Mo surface improves the wettability of the precursor solution (contact angle decreases from 19.3° to 12.7°), facilitating the formation of larger CZTSSe grains. Electrical characterization reveals that the NaClO-treated Mo substrate significantly reduces the density of negative charge traps at CZTSSe grain boundaries (contact potential difference increases from −1.1 V to −263 mV), suppressing hole recombination and optimizing carrier collection efficiency. The spike-like structure of the Mo surface also shortens the transport path of hole carriers generated by short-wavelength light, further enhancing collection efficiency. Ultimately, the PCE of CZTSSe devices based on the Mo-10 substrate increases from 9.34% to 11.07%, attributed to the reduction in R s and J 0 . This study highlights the critical role of a back electrode interface microstructure design in synergistically optimizing light absorption and carrier transport.},

However, challenges remain in synthesizing high-quality crystals with low defect concentrations, high homogeneous thermal conductivity, and high yields using the conventional chemical vapor transport method. In this study, we report the synthesis of high-yield c -BAs single crystals using the Bridgman method. The crystals exhibit high uniformity, reduced defect densities, and lower carrier concentrations as confirmed through x-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, temperature-dependent photoluminescence, and electrical transport measurements.

  abstract     = {In this study, we report on the intentional nitrogen doping of plasma-assisted MBE (PAMBE)-grown (010) β -Ga 2 O 3 films by generating the growth plasma with an O 2 and N 2 gas mixture. A nitrogen doping range of 1.3 × 10 18 to 4.5 × 10 19 cm −3 was achieved. The nitrogen doping profiles have top-hat shapes with sharp turn-on and turn-off. Nitrogen doping was found to have a negligible impact on surface morphology. Nitrogen incorporation was unaffected by gallium flux and growth temperatures over a large growth window. An incorporation dependence on plasma power and total gas flow rate was observed. This was attributed to the N 2 triple bond strength compared to the O 2 double bond strength, which makes N 2 harder to crack in the plasma source. Increasing the plasma power from 140 to 230 W increased nitrogen incorporation by 1.6×, while increasing the total gas flow rate from 0.8 to 2.0 sccm decreased incorporation by 3.2×. The compensation effect of nitrogen was verified by characterizing effective carrier concentration in conducting tin and nitrogen co-doped films. A 2.1 V built-in voltage was extracted from a nitrogen-doped, n − junction device using CV measurements. The device was found to exhibit rectifying behavior with a 100 A/cm 2 current density at 2.9 V. The junction demonstrated here can play a key role in field management and electrostatic engineering for β -Ga 2 O 3 -based power devices. Overall, the controllability of PAMBE nitrogen doping and the properties of nitrogen-doped films suggest PAMBE-grown, nitrogen-doped layers have promising power device applications.},

  abstract     = {Electron paramagnetic resonance of Cr 3+ ions in β -Ga 2 O 3 is investigated using terahertz spectroscopic ellipsometry under magnetic field sweeping, a technique that enables the polarization resolving capabilities of ellipsometry for magnetic resonance measurements. We employed a single-crystal chromium-doped β -Ga 2 O 3 sample, grown by the Czochralski method, and performed ellipsometry measurements at magnetic field strengths ranging from 2 to 8 T, at frequencies from 82 to 125 and 190 to 230 GHz, and at a temperature of 15 K. Analysis of the frequency-field diagrams derived from all Mueller matrix elements allowed us to differentiate between the effects of electron spin Zeeman splitting and zero-field splitting and to accurately determine the anisotropic Zeeman splitting g -tensor and the zero-field splitting parameters. Our results confirm that Cr 3+ ions predominantly substitute into octahedral gallium sites. Line shape analysis of Mueller matrix element spectra using the Bloch–Brillouin model provides the spin volume concentration of Cr 3+ sites, showing very good agreement with results from chemical analysis by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy and suggesting minimal occupation of sites with inactive electron paramagnetic resonance. This study enhances our understanding of the magnetic and electronic properties of chromium-doped β -Ga 2 O 3 and demonstrates the effectiveness of high-frequency/high-field electron paramagnetic resonance generalized spectroscopic ellipsometry for characterizing defects in ultrawide-bandgap semiconductors.},

Typically, time constants are measured by expensive, ultra-fast instruments with high temporal resolution. Instead, here, we demonstrate an alternate, inexpensive, cyclostationary measurement technique to characterize self-heating (and cooling) with sub-microsecond resolution.

However, a bottleneck also existed in LDs with extremely steep interfaces, where the diode characteristics could not be obtained due to the device&#39;s high resistance. This study highlights the trade-off between the steepness of the interfaces in the AlGaN heterostructure and diode performance, indicating the need for further optimization to achieve high-performance UV-B LDs.

The inclusion-induced internal stress decreased exponentially along the radial direction. However, the internal stress, though reduced to a small magnitude, was unexpectedly maintained and propagated over long distances. A stress localization phenomenon, which was out of the prediction of classic elasticity theory, was also observed. The inclination of threading dislocations was found to be substantially influenced by the unreported distribution of internal stress. Four characteristic dislocation inclination patterns were identified: the two-short-tooth pattern, two-long-tooth pattern, gear pattern, and sun-like pattern. The dependence of internal stress on the dislocation inclination pattern was revealed. Based on this dependence, a method to predict the stress field in crystal based on dislocation pattern without corrosion was proposed.},

However, current assessments of MNGPNs thermal management performance are primarily conducted under laboratory static conditions, which do not fully represent the complex overload environments encountered in practical applications. In this study, we conducted strain freezing experiments using a split Hopkinson pressure bar and performed recovery analysis to investigate the influence of dynamic loading on thermal behavior through postmortem microstructural characterizations. Our findings reveal significant thermodynamic coupling effects in the in-plane direction, while coupling effects in the out-of-plane direction were less apparent. Specifically, the increase in internal thermal resistance under impact loading, due to the cracking, shedding, and directional changes in the graphene structure, diminishes the heat transfer capacity of MNGPNs in the in-plane direction. Alternations in interfacial thermal resistance caused by the layer compression and shedding affect the out-of-plane heat transfer capacity. Furthermore, the thermal behavior of MNGPNs was validated through heat dissipation experiments.

  abstract     = {Plastic crystals have large entropy change during first-order phase transitions due to strong molecular orientation disorder and volume changes. This feature has revived interest in plastic crystals, as they have great potential in solid-state refrigeration applications induced by external pressure. However, the reversible barocaloric effect in most plastic crystals does not compare favorably with their isothermal entropy change. Here, we demonstrate that controlling the particle size of the plastic crystal KPF 6 can help achieve a compromise between the phase transition resistance at grain boundaries and the phase transition correlation within grains and induce a giant reversible barocaloric effect at low pressure. In particular, the 75–150 μ m plastic crystal KPF 6 displays the lowest thermal hysteresis, with a giant reversible barocaloric entropy change of 50.0 J · kg −1 · K −1 under a pressure change of 40 MPa. The reversible barocaloric effect can be more than doubled by simply optimizing the microstructures of the plastic crystal KPF 6 . Our work provides an effective way to enhance the reversible barocaloric effect in plastic crystal materials. We also give insight into the physical mechanism that enhances the reversible barocaloric effect through transmission electron microscopy analysis.},

  abstract     = {Chalcogenide perovskites with distorted structures, such as BaZrS 3 and SrZrS 3 , are promising photovoltaic materials due to their high stability, strong absorption, and excellent electrical transport properties. Researchers have explored BaZr 1- x Ti x S 3 and BaZrS 3- x Se x alloys to reduce their band gaps, allowing them to absorb lower-energy photons. However, the hexagonal structures of BaTiS 3 and BaZrSe 3 , along with the incompatibility of Ti or Se atoms in BaZrS 3 , lead to phase separation in these alloys. In this work, using EuZrS 3 and Sr 0.7 Eu 0.3 ZrS 3 alloys as examples, we demonstrate that the band structure of chalcogenide perovskites can be tuned by using Eu as the A-site cation. In EuZrS 3 , the Eu 4f orbitals contribute to the valence band maximum, thereby raising the valence band and resulting in a narrow bandgap of 0.54 eV. Furthermore, due to the structural and atomic compatibility of Eu with SrZrS 3 , the Sr 1- x Eu x ZrS 3 alloy is designed to fine-tune the band structures of both SrZrS 3 and EuZrS 3 . EuZrS 3 also exhibits typical semiconducting characteristics, making it promising for potential optoelectronic devices.},

The clean tips with a radius of curvature less than 100 nm were reproducibly obtained by applying the sinusoidal voltage in the frequency ( ⁠ f 0 ⁠ ) of 900 Hz ≤ f 0 ≤ 1500 Hz with amplitude modulation by the sinusoidal wave in the modulation frequency ( ⁠ f s ⁠ ) of f s = 0.1 f 0 in CaCl 2 /H 2 O/acetone solution. The analyses by scanning electron microscopy with an energy-dispersive x-ray analyzer and atom probe tomography showed that a uniform Pt/Ir alloy was exposed on the tip surface as a clean surface without O or Cl contamination. The scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) imaging using the fabricated tip showed that it is more suitable for investigating rough surfaces than conventional as-cut tips and applicable for atomic-resolution imaging. Furthermore, we applied the fabricated tip to qPlus atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis in liquid and showed that it has atomic resolution in both the horizontal and vertical directions. Therefore, it is concluded that the amplitude-modulated AC etching method reproducibly provides sharp STM/AFM tips capable of both atomic resolution and large-area analyses without complex etching setups.},

However, the strong coupling of BICs with quantum emitters in single-particle systems has not been reported. In this paper, we propose a dielectric nanodisk integrated with a monolayer of transition metal dichalcogenides. A supercavity mode known as Friedrich–Wintgen BIC is launched in the nanodisk to enable strong coupling of BIC with WS 2 excitons. We demonstrate that the reduction in coupling strength as the quasi-BIC quality factor increases is due to a decrease in the number of excitons participating in the coupling. Additionally, the coupling strength can be manipulated by adjusting the shape and aspect ratio of the nanoresonators, enabling a transition from strong to weak coupling regimes. Near-field analysis shows that the manipulation of the BIC–exciton interaction arises from the overlap of the BIC mode&#39;s near-field with the excitons. Our findings offer a promising strategy for manipulating light–matter interactions and enhance the potential applications of BIC resonances in photonics.},

This reconfigurability is achieved through engineering angular dispersion at electric and magnetic Mie-type resonances. The customized metasurface exhibits an angle-dependent transmittance profile in the amorphous state of Sb 2 S 3 meta-atoms for efficient isotropic edge detection, and an angle-independent profile in the crystalline state for uniform bright-field imaging.

The excitation of Mie modes of different orders in nanowires causes TMOKE enhancement. The in-plane magnetic dipole mode leads to the largest TMOKE enhancement compared to other Mie modes. Changing the width of silicon nanowires entails a modification of that mode, thereby ensuring tailoring of the TMOKE within the range of 2.2%–3.8%. This tunability is associated with the modification of the near-field localized at the Si/Ni interface and the far-field response of the excited magnetic dipole mode. Adjusting these two quantities allows one to achieve the highest values of the TMOKE caused by individual Mie modes in silicon nanowires.},

Solutions are thus not necessarily bound to wave functions physically realizable by the optical system. A method is presented to characterize reconstructed probes by conventional lens aberrations. The fitted aberrations are then used to investigate the quality of the retrieved probes, and their consistency is examined in a systematic study using a 4D-STEM focal series recorded for a thin SnS 2 2D flake. Additionally, the influences of partial coherence and limited electron dose on the retrieved probes are analyzed, and the usefulness of the retrieved probes for different ptychographic methods, such as single sideband, Wigner distribution deconvolution ptychography, and gradient descent-based schemes, is elucidated.

Conventional methods for achieving this property often rely on additional organic coatings to lower the surface energy; however, they are very prone to chemical decomposition and even flaking during practical usages. Here, we demonstrated that the laser-induced phase transition in hierarchical structures of metal surface can act as an effective approach to directly produce the superhydrophobic effect without any organic decorations. Through gradual increasing numbers of the femtosecond laser processing, we transfer the surface structures from the initial polycrystalline material into the super-nanometer-sized dual-phase and three-phase material that consists of nano and para-crystallinity embedded in amorphous substance, both of which contribute to lowering the surface energy. Meanwhile, the geometrical profiles of the surface structures become richer and more complicated for improving the stability of air pockets. Remarkably, it is found that both the mechanical and chemical durability of such superhydrophobic surfaces are enhanced significantly for the three-phase based material. This study describes the great value of the metal phase transition in achieving the inherent superhydrophobic properties, which provides a different route to develop high-performance coating-free superhydrophobic surfaces.},

Within this bandgap, where the QDs preferably emitted right-handed circularly polarized light, we observed a distinct cavity mode peak characterized by left-handed circular polarization (CP). This observation indicates that the chiral PhC modifies the optical density of states for left-handed circular polarization to be suppressed in the polarization bandgap and be largely enhanced at the cavity mode. The results obtained may not only provide photonic devices such as compact circularly polarized light sources but also promote strong coupling between circularly polarized photons and excitons in solid states or molecules, paving the way for advancements in polaritonics, spintronics, and quantum information technology.},

The maximum responsivity of 4.7 mA/W (−1.8 mA/W) under the UV (IR) illumination and fast response time (19.6/36.8 μ s) are achieved. Dual-band optoelectronic logic operations, including OR, AND, NOR, NOT, and NAND, are realized with a single photodetector by precisely regulating the UV and IR illumination. This work paves an approach for the development of visible-blind bipolar photodetection and all-in-one optoelectronic logic gates.},

  abstract     = {The ideal combination of high sensitivity and fast response speed is crucial for advanced photodetectors. Herein, we present a normally-off, visible-blind ultraviolet (UV) AlGaN/GaN phototransistor featuring a fluorine-ion-implanted trench gate structure. This design effectively disrupts the conductive channel of the AlGaN/GaN heterostructure, drastically reducing the dark current to the magnitude of 0.1 pA. The trench structure enhances the localized electric field in the confined gate region, significantly improving UV detection sensitivity. Additionally, the finite electric field enhancement induced from fluorine ions (F − ions) accelerates the establishment of photogenerated electron channels. Consequently, the phototransistor exhibits ultrafast response speed, with rise and decay times of 1.5 and 6.7 μ s, respectively, along with an exceptional specific detectivity of 3.45 × 10 16 cm·Hz 1/2 W −1 . The detection of weak UV light reaches as low as 76.0 nW/cm 2 . This remarkable detection capability allows the device to perform high-fidelity single-pixel imaging and facilitates real-time UV communication. The proposed AlGaN/GaN phototransistor, characterized by a straightforward fabrication process and excellent photoresponse performance, presents enticing prospects for multiple performance compatible optoelectronic devices.},

In addition, light beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) allow studies of light–matter interactions mediated by OAM couplings. In this work, we present an alternative approach to generating high-order harmonic vortices using elegant Laguerre–Gaussian (eLG) beams. We examine the spatiotemporal characteristics of these harmonic vortices in the far-field regime and demonstrate how the low divergence of eLG beams makes them suitable for producing extreme ultraviolet (XUV) twisted attosecond pulses. Additionally, by solving the far-field Fraunhofer integral, we analyze the influence of azimuthal and radial indices on the spatial profile of vortex beams, thereby exploring the impact of larger topological charges. This study extends the concept of harmonic vortices generated by Laguerre–Gaussian beams to applications beyond the paraxial approximation.},

The array is grown in the pores of an anodic aluminum oxide membrane by the solid-state dewetting process. Control over the nanoparticle size and spacing between particles was achieved by sequential metal deposition and annealing processes, yielding nanoparticles with diameters ( D ) ranging from 50 to 70 nm and corresponding interparticle distances ranging from 12 to 30 nm. The advantage of this technique is that the nanoparticle size, spherical shape, and hexagonal close-packed ordering of the array can be precisely controlled, allowing for fine tuning of the plasmonic absorption properties. The important parameters that determine the size, shape, and distribution of nanoparticles in the array are the template morphology (dimple geometry) and the thickness of the evaporated metal layer. Above a certain critical film thickness, the nanoparticles coalesce to form nano-islands. The significance of this work is that it provides a reliable technique to assemble metal nanoparticles into high density arrays, with good control over particle shape and distribution. Such arrays can be used to generate highly concentrated electromagnetic fields for plasmonic sensor applications.},

This work aims to investigate the effect of substituting Fe on the thermoelectric properties of the CTS system. It is found that the electrical conductivity enhanced after Fe substitution due to the simultaneous enhancement of carrier concentration, as well as a reduced bandgap from 0.88 to 0.5 eV. The high power factor of ∼514 μ W/mK 2 was obtained for the Cu 2 Sn 0.7 Fe 0.3 S 3 sample. The Fe substitution generated different types of phonon scatterings, such as mass fluctuation scattering arising from the difference in atomic mass of Sn and Fe and strain field scattering as a result of size and interatomic coupling force difference between Sn and Fe. Accordingly, the Fe-substituted CTS samples obtained the thermal conductivity of 0.45 W/mK at 753 K. In addition, the density functional theory calculations reveal that the substitution of Fe in Cu 2 SnS 3 significantly alters the electronic structure and reduces the bandgap, resulting in enhanced electrical conductivity and power factor, thereby a high zT of ∼0.5 is obtained in Cu 2 Sn 0.7 Fe 0.3 S 3 .},

This transition in temperature corresponds to the cathode&#39;s transition from the so-called spot mode to the plume mode. The electron Mach number is found to be between 0.2 and 0.8 for all flow rates. The scaling of the Mach number with the ratio of electron temperature to ion temperature is examined, which reveals a non-monotonic relationship that can be approximately described by the assumption of marginally stable wave growth. The possibility of leveraging this assumption as a zero-equation closure for the electron fluid equations is discussed in the context of past experiments.},

Traditional methods like optical tweezers and dielectrophoresis often require complex setups, making them less suitable for scalable laboratory-on-a-chip (LOC) systems. While strain-mediated magnetoelectric (ME) micro-motors offer a promising alternative, they are limited by a 45° rotation when using planar electrode systems, the complexity of multi-electrode systems for rotations beyond 45°, and the lower thermal stability of symmetrical ferromagnetic (FM) rings or disks. This work introduces a ME-based LOC device that incorporates strain-mediated micro-magnetic motors, utilizing shape-anisotropic FM elliptical rings on a ferroelectric substrate to achieve MB rotations up to 90° experimentally with a simple planar electrode system. The inherent high thermal stability of elliptical FM rings enables this rotation without the need for multi-electrode designs. Micromagnetic simulations are employed to identify the optimal elliptical ring structures that generate the localized stray magnetic fields necessary for trapping and rotating MBs. Effective single MB trapping with optimized MB concentrations and flow rates is demonstrated with 40 % capture probability. Under an applied electric field of 0.8 MV/m, a 90 o rotation is achieved for a 1.5 μ m wide elliptical ring, closely aligning with micromagnetic modeling results. The ability to achieve 90° MB rotation without complicated experimental setup opens possibilities for critical biotechnology applications, such as photothermal and hyperthermia therapy, where the thermally stable, highly shape-anisotropic FMs in ME-based LOC devices could be transformative.},

  abstract     = {Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in phosphorus-doped diamond have potential applications in quantum technologies because their electron spin has the longest spin coherence time among those in solid systems at room temperature (RT) and because their negative charge state is more stable than that in undoped diamond. However, the conventional phosphorus source, phosphine, is toxic and explosive; a safer precursor is therefore preferred. We consequently attempted to synthesize phosphorus-doped diamonds using tert -butylphosphine (TBP), which has lower toxicity and explosivity than phosphine. However, controlling phosphorus incorporation during doping with TBP is difficult because it condenses easily and remains in the synthesis reactor due to its low boiling point. Here, we report controlling the incorporation of impurities by optimizing the synthesis conditions, such as the synthesis pressure. Comparing diamonds synthesized at 15 and 50 kPa reveals that the phosphorus concentration was reduced by 93% and the nitrogen concentration by 72% in the diamond synthesized at 50 kPa. For diamonds prepared under optimized conditions in our synthesis reactor, a long spin coherence time ( T 2 = 2.23 ms) for NV centers with almost perfect selective alignment of the NV axes was achieved. The T 2 was comparable to the longest reported length for NV centers in a sample synthesized with phosphine, indicating that TBP is a promising phosphorus source for obtaining NV centers with excellent properties. We also achieved high electron mobility [580 cm 2 /(V s) at RT] in diamonds synthesized with TBP; this value is comparable to that for diamonds synthesized with phosphine.},

Using experimental data and simulations, we show that the ICTA has near-quantum-limited noise as long as low-frequency voltage noise, expressed as broadening of the Josephson frequency line, is narrower than the amplification bandwidth. We observe a gain of 20 dB across a 11 MHz bandwidth with noise below 1.7 times the quantum limit when the full width at half maximum of the Josephson frequency linewidth is 5.6 MHz.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic heating by alternating magnetic field (AMF) is a fascinating solution to break the bottleneck in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst improvement. However, practical applications of AMF in electrochemistry are always impeded by the inherent characteristics of the catalyst (i.e., non-magnetic nature and oxidizable feature). Here, a self-heating working electrode substrate of C/Fe 3 O 4 /C is proposed to be fabricated, on which non-magnetic Ru nanoparticles confined within the amorphous carbon matrix are deposited as the catalytic layer. Under AMF, magnetic Fe 3 O 4 particle can be stimulated and generate the magnetic heating associated with Néel relaxation, which improves the OER efficiency of Ru nanoparticles with the overpotential at 10 mA cm −2 reduced by 72 mV. Together with the high stability rendered by confined structure, the exploitation of AMF on non-magnetic catalyst is confirmed, and the developed strategy offers a general pathway to advance OER catalyst performance in the future.},

  abstract     = {Harvesting wideband and random vibration energy in the vehicle environment is a promising route to power mobile electronic devices. Conventional energy harvesters cannot realize steady-state output, making the energy management circuit design difficult. This work presents an electromagnetic harvester with a counterweight unit, a gearbox, and a generator, which can be adapted to wideband automatic energy storage and quantized output release. The counterweight unit with the low-frequency response can effectively sense the weak vibration. The coil spring in the energy storage gear train is in particular used to store low-frequency random vibration energy in the environment and release the energy stored by the coil spring by switching the gear train. Finally, the coil spring drives the generating gear train to realize the steady-state output of mechanical energy to electrical energy. At a frequency of 2.5 Hz and an acceleration of 0.4 g, the average output power of the automatic energy storage and steady-state output release energy harvester (ASSR) by using a coil spring to first store energy and then quantize the output is 114.5 times higher than that of the method of continuous generating without using a coil spring. The ASSR&#39;s energy output can charge the lithium battery (3.7 V, 40 mAh) from 2.6 to 3.716 V during a 60 km ride at an average speed of 12.7 km/h while powering the mobile phones and Bluetooth devices continuously through the energy management circuit.

Also, the power generation characteristics were readily adjusted by the flow channel forming the Venturi effect without modifying the PWVEH structure. So, the VE-PWVEH could possess both great power-generating capability at low wind speed and strong robustness at high wind speed. The results demonstrated that both the output voltage and cut-in wind speed were affected by the attack angle of two rectangular plates used for stimulating the constricted channel. There was an optimal attack angle of 60° where a maximum peak voltage of the VE-PWVEH was increased by 621% and the cut-in wind speed was reduced by 171% compared with the harvester without the Venturi effect. Besides, it demonstrated the VE-PWVEH could achieve an output power of 0.863 mW and illuminate about 120 blue LEDs in series. The introduction of the Venturi effect provides a simple and viable method of flow field disturbance to tune the performance of PWVEHs.},

However, the output voltage of the present TMDC-based WTEGs remains at a relatively low level. In this study, we precisely modulate the electronic structure of titanium disulfide (TiS 2 ) nanosheets in a restacked film by surface modification, leading to the decoupling phenomenon of a simultaneous rise in the electrical conductivity and the Seebeck coefficient. This method enhances the thermoelectric power factor by approximately 14 times compared to pre-modified samples. We fabricated a flexible self-reassembly WTEG using 1T-phase molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) nanosheets as p -type material and modified TiS 2 nanosheets as an n -type material.

To understand the process of flagellar bundling, especially propulsion force generation, we develop a multi-functional macroscopic experimental system and employ advanced numerical simulations for verification. Flagellar arrangements and phase differences between helices are investigated, revealing the variation in propulsion contributions from individual helices. Numerically, we build a time-dependent model to match the bundling process and study the influence of hydrodynamic interactions. Surprisingly, it is found that the total propulsion generated by a bundle of two filaments is constant at various phase differences between the helices. However, the difference between the propulsion from each helix is significantly affected by a phase difference, and only one of the helices is responsible for the total propulsion when the phase difference is equal to π ⁠ . Building on our experimental and computational results, we develop a theoretical model considering the propulsion contribution of each filament to better understand microbial locomotion mechanisms, especially the wobbling behavior of the cell. Our work also sheds light on the design and control of artificial microswimmers.},

In the traditional dual-channel SPR sensor structure, it is necessary to coat different metal films on two channels to obtain two independent SPR signals in one probe. In this work, the dopamine hydrochloride was used to separate two resonance peaks. Sensing channel 1 is used as an immunosensing road by using the LSPR effect, coating its surface with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)/IRMOF-3/thiomalic acid and adsorbing rabies virus antigens to enhance the loading of biomolecules on the surface of the sensor and the immune response. The sensing channel 2 adopts a silver film to excite the SPR effect, then the position of the SPR resonance peak is shifted back by dopamine hydrochloride, and, finally, a layer of polydimethylsiloxane is coated as a temperature sensing channel. The results show that the sensitivity of the sensor is 0.504 nm/°C in the temperature range of 30–35 °C, and it has good temperature stability. The high sensitivity detection of rabies virus was achieved in the range of 0.1–10 3 pg/ml. The sensitivity and detection limit are 3.065 nm/(log(pg/ml)) and 0.234 pg/ml, respectively. It performed well in the clinical sample detection. The sensor has a good prospect in the clinical detection of rabies virus.},

The results showed that devices utilizing hybrid-contact architectures exhibit higher output currents and are much less sensitive to variations in barrier height compared to single-contact devices, implying that these devices can more easily achieve consistent electrical properties. Experimentally, hybrid-contact IGZO SBTFTs were fabricated using chemically stable cobalt (Co) as the source/drain electrodes. The devices, utilizing an optimized two-step annealing process, exhibited ultra-small hysteresis and excellent electrical stability under both negative bias illumination temperature stress and positive bias temperature stress.

The effect was observed over a broad temperature range with local piezoresponse spectroscopy in unpoled samples, while no negative piezoresponse was observed when the material was pre-poled. These measurements suggest that the effect, which is promising for power-generation applications, originates from non-ergodic behavior. Complementary macroscale impedance and dielectric constant measurements as a function of temperature and frequency supported the mesoscopic findings.

The phase transition processes in these ceramics differ significantly between static and dynamic compression, presenting a long-standing controversy in the field. This study investigates the phase transition of PZT95/5 under dynamic shock compression using a shock response model. The findings indicate that the dynamic phase transition begins at lower pressures and completes at higher pressures compared to hydrostatic conditions, resulting in a broader pressure range for the phase transition. Theoretical modeling, grounded in ferroelectric and piezoelectric effects, combined with one-dimensional uniaxial stress density functional theory calculations across various orientations and three-dimensional Python visualizations, clarifies the physical mechanisms driving the progressive phase transition of ceramics under dynamic conditions. Additionally, the dynamic phase transition ratio of the ferroelectric material is quantified. Under hydrostatic pressures, the phase transition is independent of grain orientation, resulting in consistent transition pressures across all directions. In contrast, under anisotropic stress, grains with different orientations exhibit varying sensitivity to pressures, leading to distinct transition pressures in each direction. These insights advance the understanding of the phase transition mechanisms governing ferroelectric ceramics under both static and dynamic pressures.},

  abstract     = {Scaling silicon-based transistors to sub-ten-nanometer technology nodes presents significant challenges due to the difficult in achieving both atomic-scale thickness and excellent tunneling performance simultaneously. In this work, we employed first-principles calculations to investigate the dielectric properties of two recently reported van der Waals layered materials, Bi 2 SeO 5 and Bi 2 TeO 5 . Our results reveal that Bi 2 SeO 5 and Bi 2 TeO 5 monolayers exhibit out-of-plane dielectric constant of 15.2 and 7.6, respectively, with in-plane dielectric constant reaching as high as 39.0 and 26.0. To evaluate their potential as gate dielectrics, we calculated the band offsets and equivalent oxide thicknesses (EOTs) of Bi 2 SeO 5 and Bi 2 TeO 5 monolayers. The results show that both materials exhibit favorable band offsets relative to silicon and transition-metal dichalcogenide channel materials, along with low EOT. Finally, we estimated the dielectric leakage current density utilizing Bi 2 SeO 5 and Bi 2 TeO 5 based on a p-doped silicon-channel transistor, predicting a low leakage current (&lt;10 −8 A cm −2 ). Our study provides theoretical insights into the potential application of bismuth selenite and bismuth tellurite monolayers as gate dielectrics in two-dimensional electronics.},

  abstract     = {Topological half-metallic ferromagnets, featured by topologically nontrivial states and fully spin-polarized electronic carriers at the Fermi level, are fertile playgrounds for exploring topo-spintronic applications. However, such exotic compounds are still limited. Here, we systematically study a self-intercalated van der Waals magnet Cr 3 Si 2 Te 6 by combining first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo simulations. We demonstrate that Cr 3 Si 2 Te 6 is thermodynamically stable and a half-metallic ferromagnet with a Curie temperature up to 485 K, much above room temperature. Excitingly, we find that topological nodal lines and Weyl nodes coexist in the Cr 3 Si 2 Te 6 bulk. Correspondingly, the Cr 3 Si 2 Te 6 bulk exhibits a large anomalous Hall conductivity of 160 and 427 Ω − 1 c m − 1 when its magnetization is along its magnetic easy and hard axes, respectively. Moreover, its anomalous Hall conductivity can be increased to 374 (882) Ω − 1 c m − 1 by doping electrons (holes). Finally, we disclose that the 7-layer Cr 3 Si 2 Te 6 thin film possesses half-metallic ferromagnetism with a high T C of 425 K, strong out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy energy, and large anomalous Hall conductivity. Our findings suggest that Cr 3 Si 2 Te 6 is a room-temperature topological half-metallic ferromagnet, which could have promising prospects for practical applications in next-generation topo-spintronic and nanoscale electronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Contrary to the conventional spin current with the in-plane spin polarization, spin current with the out-of-plane spin polarization can achieve efficient all electrical control of perpendicular magnetization by spin–orbit torques (SOTs) without an external magnetic field. This feature is essential for high-density magnetic memory and logic devices. While such spin current with the out-of-plane spin polarization has been demonstrated in a limited number of high-quality low crystal or magnetic symmetry systems, its generation in conventional heavy metal is challenging but crucial for field-free spintronic devices. Here, we show that overcoming this challenge is possible by fabricating a crystalline phase gradient in heavy metal tantalum, where the out-of-plane spin polarization was induced and triggers an out-of-plane SOT providing the field-free switching for perpendicularly magnetized ferromagnet in Pt/Co/Ta (crystalline phase gradient) heterojunction. Meanwhile, the critical switching current density is lower than that of the Pt/Co/Ta (non-crystalline phase gradient) control case, and the polarity of field-free switching is determined by the sign of the crystalline phase gradient. Our work demonstrates that the crystalline phase gradient is a promising platform to generate the spin current with the out-of-plane spin polarization and achieve efficient field-free magnetization switching based on heavy metal tantalum, thus opening an avenue toward energy-efficient spintronic devices.},

Their inherent topological stability, nanoscale size, and efficient manipulation via spin currents make them promising candidates for high-density data storage and advanced computing paradigms. We micromagnetically investigate the nucleation dynamics of magnetic skyrmion pairs excited underneath two 30 nm nanocontacts with varying separations on top of an extended Co/Pt bilayer thin film. At close separation of 100 nm, the magnetization configurations strongly interact, giving rise to the formation of stable merged skyrmion states. As the separation increases beyond 200 nm, topologically distinct metastable configurations emerge, including the coexistence of tunable skyrmion–antiskyrmion pairs through Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction strengths and current pulse amplitudes. These metastable states eventually relax into two stable skyrmions that can be independently toggled ON and OFF using a weak in-plane magnetic field, enabling complex logic operations and more flexible circuit designs. Beyond the fundamental interest in skyrmion interaction dynamics, the independent control of skyrmion–antiskyrmion states holds promise for next-generation spintronic devices, with potential applications in memory, logic, and computing.},

However, there are a few reports on the direct measurement of variation in the metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) interface band structure during operation, and further investigation is required. This paper focuses on elucidating the changes in the band structure at buried interfaces under applied bias using a nondestructive approach. We conducted measurements using bias-applied laboratory hard x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Lab. HAXPES) with liquid gallium (Ga) x-ray source on MOS structures, which are widely recognized as fundamental and commonly used devices. We utilize HAXPES with Ga x-ray, providing high-energy/intensity x-rays, to achieve sufficient detection depth and enable observation of the deeper regions of the silicon substrate buried under gold and silicon dioxide layers. As a result, this approach allowed us to observe bias-dependent peak shifts resulting from changes in the band structure in detail. We observe HAXPES peak shift caused by the different substrate concentrations.

  abstract     = {Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy are employed to study near-band edge excitonic emission lines in an aluminum nitride (AlN) film over a range of temperatures. The thermal quenching of the neutral silicon-bound exciton (Si 0 X) emission peak in AlN is observed, which is caused by the thermally activated processes from Si 0 X to two types of free exciton (Γ 1 and Γ 5 ), along with a two-electron satellite (TES) transition as a competing pathway. Among these, the activation process to the higher-energy Γ 1 free exciton state is predominant, which may be related to the symmetry of the exciton states. The non-monotonic temperature dependence of the TES emission intensity is observed, which originates from the predominance of the thermally activated TES transition rate at low temperatures, as opposed to the delocalization tendency of Si 0 X. Due to the rapid reduction in the nonradiative recombination lifetime, the PL lifetime of the Si 0 X emission peak decreases from 160 ps at 4.5 K to 15 ps at 80 K. Meantime, the radiative recombination lifetime increases with temperature, which further accelerates the thermal quenching of the Si 0 X emission peak to some extent.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides and their alloys provide a unique platform for exploring interlayer charge transfer in van der Waals heterostructures. These structures are crucial for advancing the next-generation electronic, optoelectronic, and quantum devices. In this study, interlayer charge transfer in heterostructures composed of MoSe 2 , MoS 2 , and their alloy, MoSSe, is investigated using transient absorption, Raman, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The experimental results reveal that electron transfer in the alloy heterostructures, MoSSe/MoS 2 and MoSe 2 /MoSSe, is faster than in the pure MoSe 2 /MoS 2 heterostructure, despite the smaller conduction band offsets of the alloy systems. Raman spectroscopy confirms that alloy layers support phonon modes matching those of the pure layers, aligning with theoretical models of phonon-assisted interlayer charge transfer. Additionally, efficient hole transfer is observed in both alloy heterostructures. The findings suggest transition metal dichalcogenides alloys can be used for engineering heterostructures with desired charge transfer properties. By leveraging compositionally tunable band gaps and optical properties, alloy-based heterostructures offer opportunities for designing tailored materials suitable for diverse applications such as photodetectors, light-emitting devices, and flexible electronics. Moreover, the ultrafast charge transfer observed in these systems provides insights into the fundamental mechanisms governing interlayer interactions in 2D materials.},

It is widely accepted that enhanced NTE can be achieved in PbTiO 3 -based ferroelectrics by improving the tetragonality of PbTiO 3 ( c / a = 1.064) through chemical substitutions. Nevertheless, most substituted PbTiO 3 -based ferroelectrics exhibit reduced tetragonality and weakened NTE, while enhanced NTE has only been achieved in those materials with enhanced tetragonality so far.

A fully connected neural network is developed to predict transmission mapping, transmission spectra, multipole scattering, and TD components. Comparison with numerical simulations shows that the neural network predicts TD resonance efficiently and accurately. Experimental validation through fabricated samples further confirms the strong TD response.

Here, a dual-metal hybrid metasurface is demonstrated for polarization-selective perfect absorption and reflection with liquid tuning capabilities in the infrared band. Based on the metal–insulator–metal architecture, the metasurface composed of Al/Ti nanostrips enables an intense absorption resonance at x -polarization and reflects light as a mirror at y -polarization, thus acting as a high-performance linear polarizer. The absorption peak wavelength can be continuously tailored from 1200 to 1850 nm with an average absorption &gt; 99% by scaling the unit-cell period of metasurfaces. Furthermore, the perfect absorption wavelength of the metasurface exhibits a large range switch (&gt;750 nm) through immersion tuning, and its absorption remains above 99.5%. The proposed dual-metal hybrid metasurface for liquid-tunable absorption can promote practical technologies of dynamic polarizers, photodetectors, and optical imaging.},

However, previous explorations toward higher-order TBICs have been limited to the Hermitian assumption, omitting the nonconservative characteristics present in many artificial materials. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an acoustic lattice model supporting higher-order TBICs that solely rely on non-Hermiticity, in which the non-Hermiticity is implemented by strategically applying additional loss to specific sites in the lattice. Importantly, these in-band corner states are protected by chiral symmetry and can be spectrally switched by introducing perturbations to the corner sites or couplings. Our findings highlight the distinctive role of non-Hermiticity in constructing higher-order TBICs, which may inspire sophisticated and externally tunable approaches for designing high- Q devices in wave-based technologies.},

A resistance enhancement of ∼8% at room temperature was achieved at an electric field of −1 kV/cm, which indicates that such 2DEG is rather sensitive to the strain in the TiO 2 layer.

We experimentally test a range of geometries, comparing shear adhesion strength to understand structure–function relationships in our chosen parameter space. Our findings indicate that introducing cuts to form serpentine paths in a disk results in longer effective lengths and enhanced compliance, thus requiring less energy to deform into a rough surface. Leveraging this insight and associated scaling analysis, we conclude that serpentine-like features arranged in a radially symmetric wedge configuration achieve high levels of adhesion, even on rough surfaces, enabling robust adhesion relative to featureless electroadhesive disks.},

  abstract     = {Two monolithic edge-emitting passively mode-locked InAs/InGaAs semiconductor quantum dot lasers generating ps optical pulses at repetition rates of 10 GHz and optical frequency combs centered at 1260 nm are mutually coupled in an all-optical passive synchronization experiment. The two lasers, with different free-running repetition rates, are coupled through a long delay fiber path, they synchronize, and generate optical pulse trains with identical repetition rates in a wide range of experimental conditions (optical frequency, optical delay, and coupling strength). The common repetition rate can be easily fine-tuned with the control of the external coupling path length. In synchronized state, both lasers operate with significantly reduced timing jitter with respect to their free-running values. Finally, under specific conditions, the repetition rate locking is accompanied by partial mutual coherence between the lasers, as indicated by the formation of interferometric fringes.},

However, these plasmas can be subject to the formation of plasma non-uniformities propagating in the E × B direction. These rotating plasma structures (or “spokes”) enhance the transport of charged species across the magnetic field, which can harm the gentle processing capability of the plasma. In this work, we investigate the role of electrostatically active boundaries on the spoke formation by incorporating a variable bias conducting boundary (known as an anticathode) placed on the axially opposite side of the cathode. Our findings indicate azimuthal mode suppression occurs when the anticathode is electron collecting. Furthermore, we show selective azimuthal mode suppression by biasing the anticathode to an intermediate potential between the cathode and anode potentials. These findings suggest a link between the axial electron confinement in the e-beam generated plasma and azimuthally propagating plasma structure formation.},

However, leveraging defects to tune the intrinsic electronic structure of REO to enhance electrochemical performance, as well as understanding the underlying physical mechanisms at the atomic level, remained an open challenge. Density functional theory plus U calculations revealed that doping and oxygen vacancies not only regulated Li-ion insertion stability but also reduced the migration energy barriers in CeO 2 . Doping also decreased the volume change rate of CeO 2 during Li-ion insertion. Oxygen vacancies lowered the Li-ion migration energy barrier in CeO 2 from 1.516 to 0.903 eV. In comparison, Li-ion migration energy barriers in the La 2 O 3 series structures were significantly lower than those in CeO 2 . Experimental results confirmed that the Li-ion diffusion coefficient of La 2 O 3 was markedly higher than that of CeO 2 . Upon Li-ion insertion, the bandgap of CeO 2 decreased from 2.18 to 1.60 eV, and density of states analysis revealed the profound impact of lithiation on the electronic structure.

However, the undesired growth of zinc dendrites and the prevalence of side reactions pose significant challenges that limit the practical application of ZIBs. The sophisticated structural design and crystal orientation of the Zn anode can effectively suppress the occurrence of zinc dendrites and side reactions. Herein, a highly oriented Zn (002) lattice plane on 3D conductive frameworks [Zn/TiN nanotubes (NTs)] is designed to address uncontrolled dendrite growth, water-induced side reactions, and suboptimal Zn metal utilization in ZIBs. By leveraging an abundance of active sites for Zn 2+ adsorption, minimal charge transfer resistance, and the controlled growth of Zn crystal facets, the reversibility and stability of ZIBs can be significantly enhanced during the Zn plating/stripping process. Remarkably, fiber-ZIBs based on Zn/TiN NTs exhibit a large specific capacity, long-term cycling durability, and excellent mechanical properties. This work proposes an approach to achieve highly reversible zinc anodes from the perspective of nanostructure and crystal orientation.},

However, the evolution of point defects during gamma ( γ )-irradiation is still poorly understood. In this paper, we report the evolution of point defects in Bi 2 Te 3 materials subjected to varying doses of γ -irradiation and their impact on TE performance. Precisely, Bi 0.5 Sb 1.5 Te 3 and Bi 2 Te 2.7 Se 0.3 materials, along with TE modules, were fabricated and subsequently subjected to γ -irradiation. The segregation of Te elements in Bi 2 Te 3 was observed under low irradiation dose, attributing to the formation of interstitial atom–vacancy pair of Te induced by γ -irradiation. In addition, the formation of point defects has a positive relation with the irradiation dose. The positron annihilation (PA) measurements revealed that the number of vacancies in Bi 2 Te 3 diminished with increasing irradiation dose. The accompanying changes in carrier concentration ( n H ) and mobility ( μ H ) suggest that γ -ray drives Bi atoms to occupy Te vacancies, forming antisite defects. The TE performance of Bi 2 Te 3 was subsequently evaluated, and the findings revealed a strong correlation with the evolution of point defects. This study provides insights into the damage mechanisms and property alterations of Bi 2 Te 3 materials under γ -irradiation.},

For practical applications, the major challenge for SWCNTs is improving the thermoelectric performance and thermal durability of n -type SWCNT films. Here, SWCNT inks were prepared using a dopant, which is a cationic surfactant of dimethyldioctadecylammonium chloride (DODMAC), by changing the mass ratio of DODMAC/SWCNT. The SWCNT films were fabricated by vacuum filtering, followed by heat treatment at 423 K. The in-plane thermoelectric properties were measured at 300 K, and the Seebeck coefficient changed from positive to negative values when the DODMAC/SWCNT was 10 −2 . The highest dimensionless figure-of-merit, ZT , of 1.0 × 10 −2 was exhibited at a DODMAC/SWCNT of 80, which was close to saturation concentration. This ZT was achieved mainly because the thermal conductivity decreased significantly to 0.16 W/(m · K), and it is currently one of the highest values among those of n -type SWCNT films with various dopants. To demonstrate power generation, we fabricated a SWCNT-TEG consisting of n -type SWCNT films with the highest ZT . The SWCNT-TEG exhibited an output voltage of 24 mV and a maximum power of 0.9 μ W at a temperature difference of 80 K. Furthermore, to investigate the thermal durability of n -type SWCNT films, thermal cycling tests were performed at temperatures ranging from 300 to 423 K. The SWCNT film with a DODMAC/SWCNT of 80 exhibited the highest durability. These findings will contribute to the widespread use of SWCNT-TEGs as power sources for IoT sensors.},

The composite array consists of a reflection phase gradient metasurface array and a horizontal omnidirectional antenna, with a central operating frequency of 5.8 GHz. The reflection phase gradient metasurface array elements are insensitive to the polarization of the incident wave and are arranged radially around the array center. This configuration creates a radial reflection phase gradient that efficiently converts incident plane waves of different polarizations into surface waves converging toward the center. The surface wave energy is then extracted by the horizontal omnidirectional antenna and converted into direct current (DC) by a rectifier. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the composite array maintains effective surface wave excitation and propagation toward the center for both circularly polarized and various horizontally polarized plane waves, achieving a plane wave-to-surface wave conversion efficiency of 74.89%. Experimental validation shows that the proposed array achieves a maximum energy collection efficiency of 62.23% and an RF-DC conversion efficiency of 39.96% over a broad frequency range of 5.6–6.0 GHz. This study achieves polarization insensitivity while simultaneously enhancing the operational efficiency of microwave energy receivers.

The ON-OFF effect of the modulator is achieved through the cascade&#39;s electrical length reconstruction, and the reflections are effectively suppressed from the ON state to the OFF state. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed modulator achieves a broadband low-reflection effect in the 170–260 GHz band, with a Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR) of less than 1.5 over a bandwidth of 60 GHz and an optimal VSWR of 1.1. It has the potential to support high-speed response as well as the large-capacity, high-rate data transmission. Accordingly, the proposed modulator offers a promising solution for the design of high-performance terahertz modulators and multi-channel integrated terahertz communication systems.},

  abstract     = {To meet the demands for more advanced computer chips, creating devices with advanced 3D architectures is becoming commonplace in the semiconductor industry. To ensure alignment between the different layers, the bottom-up technique of area-selective deposition (ASD) is promising. However, ASD may not always be feasible depending on the various surface chemistries present during manufacturing of complex semiconductor devices. Topographically selective deposition (TSD) is emerging as an alternative, focusing on differences in surface orientation rather than chemical properties. This work demonstrates a TSD supercycle approach in which atomic layer deposition (ALD) is directed to proceed exclusively within a 3D trench structure, by covering the top of the trench with an amorphous carbon (aC) inhibition layer. The aC layer is applied selectively on the top surface of the trench by exploiting the ion-radical synergy required for its deposition. Since the aC layer lacks adsorption sites for ALD precursors, growth of the target material is inhibited on the top surface of the trench, whereas it occurs selectively within the trench. After several ALD cycles of selective deposition of the target material, the aC layer is removed and reapplied in a supercycle recipe until sufficient material has been deposited in the trench. The selective deposition of an aC inhibition layer on the top surface of the trench, as well as the selective deposition of 3.0 ± 0.1 nm of TiO 2 in a trench is demonstrated on a 3D nanostructure.},

Furthermore, the validity of our results was additionally confirmed by measuring the breakdown voltage and applying positive-bias stress to the fabricated devices exposed to radiation for accelerated tests.},

With a combination of in situ GaON and large bandgap Al 2 O 3 on top of the recessed gate region, normally-off HEMT was achieved with high On/Off current (I ON /I OFF ) ratio of 10 9 , low V TH hysteresis less than 60 mV, and low-interface trap density (D it ) in the range of 4 × 10 11 –2 × 10 12 cm −2 ·eV −1 . Thanks to the sharp GaN/oxide interface with narrow distribution of lattice constant, uniform strain distribution and significantly reduced trap density were obtained. More importantly, our proposed bi-layer gate dielectric is perfectly compatible with the conventionally utilized gate recessing technique compared to the conventionally utilized in situ SiN x , demonstrating itself as a promising candidate in GaN power devices.},

  abstract     = {Si-based spin qubits are promising due to their long decoherence time and the compatibility with state-of-the-art semiconductor technology and have been demonstrated using quantum dots (QDs) to host single electrons for spin manipulation. In this work, we simulate the electrostatics and quantum transport properties of quantum dots on a Si metal–oxide–semiconductor platform and a Si/SiGe heterostructure. We investigate the effects of gate configurations and the SiGe spacer thickness on device characteristics, such as gate capacitances, Coulomb blockade, and charge stability. For a single quantum dot, placing its barrier gates (BGs) under the plunger gate improves the charge stability, while swapping the positions of those gates reduces the effects of the barrier gate biases on the charge stability. A thicker SiGe spacer further suppresses the effects of the barrier gate biases on the charge stability for quantum dots on the Si/SiGe heterostructure but leads to stronger crosstalk between neighboring quantum dots. Wider barrier gates can help to mitigate the crosstalk effects for multiple quantum dots. These findings provide key insights into the optimization of the gate configurations and material selection to improve the charge stability and minimize the crosstalk by different gates for future development of scalable Si-based quantum dots.},

  abstract     = {Rare earth (RE) ions are important dopants to modulate semiconductor properties because of their abundant energy levels. Herein, a simple Er–Yb co-doping strategy was developed to enhance the near-infrared optoelectronic properties of SnS 2 nanosheets. The constructed device based on Er–Yb co-doping SnS 2 has a detectivity of ∼4.97 × 10 8 Jones at 980 nm. The enhanced photoresponse of the doped system at 980 nm could be attributed to the upconversion behavior of the Er–Yb ion pairs. The Yb 3+ ions as sensitizers significantly enhance the upconversion emission and near-infrared photoresponse properties of the material. The energy transfer from Yb 3+ to Er 3+ ions can occur between different layers of co-doping nanosheets by investigating the properties of the constructed SnS 2 :Er/SnS 2 :Yb homojunction nanosheets. Density functional theory calculations reveal that Er or Yb doping introduces slight structural and charge distribution changes owing to the similarity in the metal–atom coordination structure between SnS 2 and RE sulfide. Our study demonstrates that RE doping is an effective way to improve the near-infrared photoresponse of 2D materials and clarifies the relationship between luminescence and photoelectric properties.},

To enhance the optoelectronic properties of Ga 2 O 3 films, a controllable doping strategy is proposed in this work. Using a sol-gel method, Ga 2 O 3 films doped with magnesium (Mg) are prepared, with the Mg concentration adjustable through the precursor solution. The results indicate that the bandgap of Ga 2 O 3 increases with higher doping levels, while the electrical conductivity decreases proportionally. To evaluate their optoelectronic characteristics, a series of photodetectors with Mg-doped Ga 2 O 3 active layers are fabricated. Under a 254 nm incident light, the device with an optimal doping concentration of 4.2% demonstrates the best performance, achieving the highest responsivity ( R ) of 1.97 A/W and a photo-dark current ratio of 2.6 × 10 3 . Furthermore, density functional theory calculations are employed to provide a detailed analysis of the fundamental mechanisms behind the enhanced optoelectronic properties.

Using Hall and photo-Hall measurements, we identify macroscopic separation of negative and positive carriers as the most likely origin for delayed photoconductivity decay, with a strong electron localization expected at grain boundaries or cracks within the polycrystalline films. Additionally, measurements on perovskite films with varying morphology and SnF 2 additive content reveal that large apparent grain size (&gt;5 μ m ⁠ ) and effective passivation of recombination centers combine to provide a path for achieving PPC extending over 100 h at room temperature.},

However, In 2 O 3 nanofiber FETs typically exhibit deteriorated electrical performance and bias stability due to the disordered arrangement of nanofibers and a high concentration of oxygen vacancy defects. In this study, In 2 O 3 nanofibers were prepared by electrospinning, and the effects of nanofiber orientation and Y 2 O 3 passivation on FET electrical performance were systematically investigated. The results indicate that after Y 2 O 3 passivation, the aligned In 2 O 3 nanofiber FETs exhibit enhanced electrical performance and superior positive bias stress and negative bias illumination stress stability. The Y 2 O 3 passivation layer effectively prevents the penetration of external O 2 and H 2 O molecules, while the diffusion of Y 3+ into the back channel reduces oxygen vacancies, thereby improving device stability. When Al 2 O 3 was employed as the dielectric layer, the electrical performance of aligned In 2 O 3 nanofiber FET with Y 2 O 3 passivation was further optimized, achieving a mobility of 18.2 cm 2 /V s and a subthreshold swing of 85 mV/dec. Meanwhile, the FET exhibits excellent environmental stability after 60 days of atmospheric exposure.

Herein, the heterostructures composed of bismuth sodium titanate (BNT) ferroelectrics and silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) are constructed to promote the photocatalytic CO 2 performance. The large spontaneous polarization of BNT optimizes the transfer dynamics of photoinduced electrons and holes and causes energy band bending with strong intrinsic electric field. With the aid of Ag NPs, the BNT@ x Ag heterojunctions exhibit intensified light absorption due to the phenomenon of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), which extends the visible light absorption spectrum and strengthens charge transfer. The modified catalysts demonstrate improved charge separation capacity and notably prolonged electron lifetime up to 40.95 ns. The synergistic effect of LSPR and intrinsic polarization significantly boosts the photocatalytic efficiency together with ultrahigh CO product selectivity, which is outstanding among the ferroelectric and other representative photocatalysts.

We demonstrate that thinner films exhibit a greater fraction of the non-polar tetragonal phase (t-phase), with increased V O concentration at the interface, affecting the device performance. Electrical measurements reveal contrasting wake-up and fatigue behavior between the two thicknesses, with thinner films showing decreased remanent polarization (2P R ) due to t-phase dominance and V O redistribution during field cycling.

  abstract     = {Orbitronics has been extensively explored theoretically and experimentally in orbital-charge conversion. The spin-charge conversion efficiency induced by the orbital Hall effect can be much larger than that of the spin Hall effect. However, orbitronics focuses primarily on light metal elements and their oxides, while exploring heavy metal elements and oxides is rare. In this Letter, we report significant enhancements in the ultrafast spin (orbit)-charge conversion for the CoFeB/Pt/SrIrO 3 (SIO) trilayer using the terahertz emission spectroscopy, where the maximum enhancement calculated by the normalized terahertz emission amplitude is about three times that for the CoFeB/Pt bilayer. In addition, we observe a ∼2 orders of magnitude enhancement in the THz emission due to significant orbital transport in Pt-insertion heavy metal layer in the CoFeB/Pt/SIO heterostructure as compared to the CoFeB/SIO bilayer. Our findings not only demonstrate that the transition metals and their oxides exhibit strong inverse orbital Hall effect but also show that multilayer structures allow enhancing the spin-to-charge current conversion efficiency for THz applications, providing a direction to tailor THz emitters.},

  abstract     = {Charge–spin interconversion is a key issue in spintronics. It gives rise to a series of new phenomena, such as spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR). In the present work, we report the peculiar SMR behaviors in heterostructures composed of polycrystalline WTe 2 nanoplate and Ni 80 Fe 20 (Py) film. We observe a negative SMR, which is contrary to the positive SMR usually measured in heavy metal/ferromagnet bilayers. We further observe a transition from negative to positive SMR with increasing thickness of the WTe 2 layer, as well as SMR sign reversal with increasing temperature in heterostructures with thicker WTe 2 . The peculiar SMR behaviors in polycrystalline WTe 2 /Py heterostructures are attributed to the interface-induced spin current and its competition with the spin Hall-induced spin current. The findings in this work offer a fundamental input for the future exploitation of heterostructures based on two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides.},

The magnetic moment of the polymer microvolcanoes varied with the change of the magnetic field bias direction inside the YIG films, which was shown by 2D mapping of the outer surface of the films. The good correlation of micromagnetic modeling and experimental data of spin wave propagation in the multistructure as a function of the applied magnetic field was clarified by the convergence parameters of the obtained polymer 3D magnetic microvolcanoes fields and the standard theory of spin wave propagation.

  abstract     = {The construction of irradiation-tolerant anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) sensors is crucial for weak-field detection in scenarios of aerospace and radiotherapy. Presently, the utilization of the NiFe/oxide composite structure was considered to be an effective scheme to optimize the spin-dependent transport property; however, it exhibited poor anti-irradiation ability due to the crystal instability of oxide. Here, a strategy was proposed to break through the limitation based on the electronic reconstruction and structural stabilization. By introducing an oxygen-affinitive Hf intercalation into the Ta/MgO/NiFe/MgO/Ta multilayer, the electron coordination was modified to tune the 3d orbital occupancy of Fe, apparently boosting the s-d electron scattering and spin-related transport property. Meanwhile, the irradiation stability of electronic and crystal structures was effectively improved due to the emergence of the Hf–O–Mg bond with high dissociation energy. Therefore, we constructed a highly reliable AMR sensor with both the ultrahigh sensitivity of 3.1 mV/V/Oe and excellent irradiation-tolerant ability capable of resisting the γ-ray irradiation of 1000 Gy. These results not only build an important basis for the sensor application in the irradiation environment but also provide a possible idea for the anti-irradiation design in spintronic devices.},

The Gaussian-distributed plane wave heats the medium adjacent to the Fresnel reflection surface. Meanwhile, a continuous probe light traverses the heating field, and the periodic temperature change then modulates the phase of the probe light. A multi-beam interferometer formed by aligning the Fresnel reflection surface to a gold-coated high-reflection surface possesses high resolution and sensitivity, significantly enhancing the detection performance. A well-established theoretical model of instantaneous PT transduction and optical phase modulation is employed to obtain the optimized interferometric configuration. To validate the effective interferometric phase transformation within the cavity, a comparison is made between the simple silicon cavity and the gold-coated cavity. The limitation of detection of such extrinsic fiber-tip PT sensors indicates one magnitude lower as compared to the conventional PT interferometric gas sensor with such robust and compact sensing designs.

It is clearly shown that the capacitance signal associated with the electron emission from a trap level previously identified in the literature as E14 and characterized by an activation energy of 0.18 eV is found to be a superposition of electron emissions from two closely spaced energy levels. Furthermore, we noted that the corresponding L-DLTS signal splits into two well separated components with activation energies of 196 and 209 meV, and the splitting occurs as the electric field in the space charge region of a Schottky diode exceeds 2 × 10 7 V/m (0.2 MV/cm). Additionally, a strong dependency of DLTS and L-DLTS signals on the electric field strength and resulting enhancement of the electron emission from these two trap states agree well with the 1D Poole–Frenkel (PF) model, suggesting donor-like behavior of both states. Finally, we found that the barrier height for thermal emission of the electrons is significantly reduced in our samples by 121 meV due to the PF effect for experimental conditions corresponding to an electric field of 3.5 × 10 7 V/m (0.35 MV/cm).},

With the assistance of S-parameter characterization combined with secondary ion mass spectroscopy analyses, the incorporated oxygen impurity has been identified to be the main source bringing about the severe RF loss of N-polar GaN. The compensation of Fe-doping enables an effective reduction in RF loss. Moreover, the unintentionally doped (UID) GaN layer grown on top of the Fe-doped GaN buffer requires a careful design due to the distinct memory effect of Fe-doping in N-polar GaN. With an optimization of its thickness, a very low RF loss of 0.36 dB/mm at 94 GHz has been attained. Furthermore, by fitting the Fe concentration profile of UID-GaN according to the mass balance rate equation, it is found that the desorption of Fe on the N-polar GaN surface is significant. A bond-based model is introduced to elucidate the difference of the Fe memory effect between Ga-polar and N-polar GaN.},

Among various innovative materials, two-dimensional (2D) materials have garnered attention as frontrunners for next-generation device fabrication. In this work, we report the fabrication and comprehensive characterization of a memristor based on 2D PtTe 2 . The device demonstrates exceptional performance metrics, including a high OFF/ON ratio, low switching voltage, and long data retention time. Leveraging density functional theory calculations, we unravel the underlying conduction mechanism, revealing the pivotal role of Ag conductive filaments in resistive switching behavior. Furthermore, the neuromorphic capabilities of the PtTe 2 memristor were evaluated through its emulation of key brain-inspired synaptic functionalities, such as long-term depression/enhancement, paired-pulse facilitation, and spike-timing-dependent plasticity. By modulating its electrical conductance, we implemented a convolutional neural network for MNIST handwritten digit recognition, achieving a remarkable accuracy of 97.49%. To further illustrate its adaptive learning capabilities, we demonstrated a Pavlov&#39;s dog experiment using the device. This study establishes 2D PtTe 2 as a promising material for neuromorphic applications and represents a critical step forward in bridging the gap between advanced materials and next-generation computing architectures.

Our results indicate that an optical transition involving O N − (a DX center) gives rise to an absorption band peaked at 2.22 eV, suggesting it is a source of the absorption band with an onset at ∼ 2 eV observed in oxygen-containing samples. We also propose that neutral O N – DX complexes can form, which would give rise to absorption peaking at 3.06 eV. In addition, we find that oxygen, in spite of its DX character, may behave as an “optically shallow donor” and be involved in optical transitions from deep defect states to the conduction band.

The emission centers are generally attributed to either intrinsic or extrinsic point defects embedded into hBN. Nevertheless, the microscopic structure of most of these defect emitters is uncertain. Here, through density-functional theory calculations, we studied the native antisite defects in hBN. We find that the neutral boron antisite might be a nonmagnetic single photon source with zero-phonon-line (ZPL) at 1.58 eV and such a line shape is often observed in experiments. Furthermore, the positively charged nitrogen antisite might be associated with a dim color center recently observed as a blue emitter with ZPL at 2.63 eV. These simple single substitution defects indicate the existence of out-of-plane phonon mode, which significantly affects the optical properties. Our results could provide useful information for the identification of quantum emitters in hBN.},

  abstract     = {The van der Waals crystal NbOX 2 (X = Cl, Br, I) has recently attracted much attention due to its remarkable in-plane anisotropy and substantial second-order nonlinear optical response. Moreover, the importance of modulating its physical properties through strain has become increasingly prominent. Herein, we investigate the anisotropic phonon response of NbOX 2 along various crystallographic directions under uniaxial tensile strain by Raman spectroscopy. The results show that opposing frequency shifts manifest in the Raman modes when uniaxial tensile strain is applied either parallel or perpendicular to the polar axis, and the highest frequency peak, P5, shows significant blue or red shifts. Density functional theory calculation results are consistent with the observed Raman shifts under strain. The change in Nb–O bond length is the main reason for the significant blue shift of P5. The anisotropic and pronounced frequency shifts of NbOX 2 under strain can serve as sensitive indicators for strain modulation, offering insights for potential applications such as flexible optoelectronic devices and strain sensors.},

It is revealed that all the alkalis (Na, K, Rb) prefer to accumulate in the surface region of the absorber with occupying Cu sites. A hole barrier can be introduced in the absorber surface region, and the electron barrier at CdS/CuInSe 2 interface is nearly changed after alkali incorporation. Distinct effects of Na and heavier alkalis (K and Rb) are explored. Post-deposition treatment (PDT) with Na leads to form Na x Cu 1−x InSe 2 in the near-surface region. While monoclinic KInSe 2 (or RbInSe 2 ) secondary phase tends to form at the surface during K (or Rb) PDT. The hole barrier introduced by Na PDT can be much lower than that in the case of heavy alkali PDT due to the limited Na solubility in Na x Cu 1−x InSe 2 . The improved V O C in CIGS solar cells by heavy alkali PDT is mainly attributed to the absence of interfacial states and the elimination of isolated In Cu and V Cu defects in the surface region.},

P-type Schottky contacts are obtained in all 1T/H-XA 2 contacts to Cs 3 Bi 2 I 9 , and the contacts can be engineered from Schottky to Ohmic contacts via external electric fields.

Finally, Curie temperature ( ⁠ T c ⁠ ) of magnetic systems were calculated using the Monte Carlo method, and the T c of 1H-VS 2 /Cs 3 Bi 2 I 9 significantly enhances largely to surpass room temperature, thereby expanding the application field of spintronic devices.

The monolayered SMoSiN 2 possesses excellent stability and direct bandgap at the K / K ′ valley, making it a promising candidate for valleytronic semiconductor. The ferromagnet CrCl 3 substrate induces a sizable valley splitting via proximity coupling. The valley-contrasting property of the top-stacking is significantly tunable by both in-plane sliding and vertical strain engineering, leading to extraordinary tunability of valley splitting in the range 1.6–9.4 meV. In contrast, the valley-contrasting property of the bottom-stacking is comparably robust due to the screen effect originating from the outmost N sublayer to reduce the proximity interaction. Our investigation reveals that the stacking order is a degree of freedom to manipulate the valley-related properties of various vdW heterostructures, facilitating the achievement of versatile valley-contrasting properties.},

The effects of the counter-electrode&#39;s curvature on the apex field enhancement factor ( ⁠ γ Ca ⁠ ) of the emitter are still not understood. In this Letter, we theoretically explore how the apex field enhancement factor of an emitter, represented by a hemisphere on a cylindrical post (HCP) with apex radius r a = 50 nm, is influenced by the curvature of a sphere-shaped counter-electrode. Importantly, our results show that for HCPs with sharpness aspect ratios typically between 10 2 and 10 3 ⁠ , there is a universal scaling such that γ Ca = γ Pa Ψ ( R / d gap ) ⁠ , where γ Pa represents the apex field enhancement factor for the emitter assuming a planar counter-electrode, and Ψ ( R / d gap ) is a universal scaling function such that Ψ ∼ 1 for R / d gap ≫ 1 and Ψ ∼ ( R / d gap ) α ⁠ , with α close to unity, for R / d gap ≪ 1 ⁠ . These findings help partially explain discrepancies observed in orthodox field electron emission experiments, where it was reported that the effective γ Ca values extracted from the current–voltage characteristics of single-tip carbon nanotubes typically underestimate the theoretical γ Pa values when R ∼ d gap ≫ r a ⁠ , a trend that is predicted by our results.},

  abstract     = {At micro- and nanoscales, momentum transfer between surfaces is influenced by various physical mechanisms, including quantum fluctuations, electromagnetic interactions, electric charges, and the dynamics of (rarefied) gases. Under non-isothermal conditions, rarefied gases give rise to thermal Knudsen forces whose magnitudes strongly depend on the gas species and surface characteristics. Knudsen forces are particularly relevant in nanotechnology, optical manipulation, and aerospace systems, where gas rarefaction occurs due to highly confined geometries, sub-micrometer length scales, and reduced particle densities. Despite their significance, predictive modeling of Knudsen forces is limited by a lack of comprehensive experimental data across diverse materials and surface morphologies. In this work, we present a highly sensitive and adaptable measurement platform capable of directly quantifying Knudsen forces using a suspended, interchangeable micro-cantilever within controlled rarefied helium and nitrogen environments. The system integrates optical fiber interferometry to precisely capture out-of-plane displacements at sub-micrometer resolution, driven by Knudsen forces. From the empirical data, we derive a robust correlation linking the magnitudes of Knudsen forces to energy accommodation coefficients, offering deeper insights into the underlying gas–surface interaction mechanisms.},

This “asymmetric” waveguide design is potentially advantageous, since it improves the active-core optical confinement factor, as well as the overall thermal conductance, especially for epitaxial-side-down mounted devices. When operated in pulsed mode, the broad-area ICL featured a characteristic temperature of 57 K and a threshold current density as low as 95 A/cm 2 at 25 °C, which is the lowest ever reported for an ICL operating at a similar temperature.

Numerous studies have focused on 2D/2D heterostructures, but research on 1D/2D heterostructures is comparatively limited, and the interface electron transfer mechanism needs to be further explored. In this study, we leverage the inherent band structure alignment characteristics of 1D Bi 1.3 In 0.7 Se 3 and 2D WSe 2 to create Bi 1.3 In 0.7 Se 3 /WSe 2 heterostructure with Type-I band alignment.

The Bi 1.3 In 0.7 Se 3 nanowire enhances the PL intensity and red-shifts the PL peaks of WSe 2 . This strong local electric field at the heterojunction interface improves the photoresponse performance of the Bi 1.3 In 0.7 Se 3 /WSe 2 heterostructures devices. They achieve excellent photoresponce properties in a wide spectral range from solar-blind ultraviolet C (254 nm) to near-infrared (980 nm) region, with a large responsivity of 98 A/W, a high detectivity of 1.16 × 10 13 Jones, and a fast photoresponse time of 500 μ s ⁠ . In addition, the optoelectronic performance of the device is controlled by modulating the Fermi level of the heterostructure by the applied gate electric field. Our work paves the way for the development of 1D/2D heterostructures for multifunctional optoelectronic applications.},

  abstract     = {Acoustic holography is a promising technique for contactless manipulation, remote sensing, and energy harvesting. It involves retrieving holograms used to modulate acoustic sources for reconstructing target acoustic fields. The performance of reconstruction is primarily determined by two key criteria, including the spatial bandwidth product, which measures the pixel number representing information capacity, and the resolution, which quantifies the pixel size supporting detail gain. However, existing techniques face limitations in reconstructing high-fidelity, dynamic, and real-time acoustic fields with enhanced spatial bandwidth product and resolution across the entire aperture size. These challenges stem from the reliance on physically constrained holograms with static nature or relatively low spatial bandwidth product and resolution. Here, we introduce super-resolution acoustic holography, wherein the spatial bandwidth and resolution of the reconstructed target acoustic fields surpass those of the retrieved source holograms, especially within the same aperture size. We further develop a deep learning strategy that combines a classical neural network architecture with a linear accumulation based physical model, allowing for the customization of reconstructed acoustic planes with higher resolution while maintaining the same lateral coverages. Extensive algorithmic validations, numerical simulations, and practical experiments demonstrate the capability of our method to achieve high-fidelity, dynamic, real-time super-resolution acoustic holography, rendering its potential to advance practical applications in holographic acoustics.},

The Au NPs were facilely obtained by thermally annealing a thin Au film grown on a Si substrate, which did not influence the subsequent growth of ZnO thin films. Electric measurements verified typical RS behaviors in the Au/ZnO/Si devices, which are related to the recovery and rupture of conductive filaments due to electric field-driven oxygen vacancy migration. Notably, COMSOL-based electrostatic field simulations on Au/ZnO/Au structures have shown that an enhanced local electric field with 4.5 times enhancement was produced at the tip of Au NPs, which facilitated the oxygen vacancies migration around the tip of Au NPs. Accordingly, controlled formation and rupture of conductive filaments are proposed in the Au/ZnO/Au NPs/Si devices, which greatly improved the RS window, stability, and endurance. The results shown in this work may pave the way for the fabrication of high-performance oxide-based RS devices in the future.},

We investigate how the parameters used to burn the spectral hole impact its shape, and how these factors determine the minimum achievable linewidth. In addition to the stability of the hole&#39;s center frequency, the linewidth and contrast play a crucial role in frequency locking. At sub-kelvin temperatures, the temperature-dependent T 7 broadening from two-phonon Raman scattering is expected to be negligible, and the spectral hole&#39;s linewidth should therefore remain constant in this interval. We observe however a linear broadening with increasing temperature, highlighting the need for further investigation into the mechanisms governing the linewidth at ultra-low temperatures.},

Electrochemical measurements suggest that OER performance of CoSe 2 nanosheets is improved under a 200 mT magnetic field, with the overpotential at 10 mA cm −2 reduced by 81 mV. Moreover, magnetic force microscopy observations on CoSe 2 nanosheets reveal that spin disorder in the magnetic domain wall region transforms to spin order under the 200 mT magnetic field, resulting in improved OER performance. Although the magnetic field has a negligible effect on the OER performance of single-domain CoSe 2 nanosheets, these findings reveal the decisive role of magnetic domain walls in enhancing OER performance under an applied magnetic field, pointing to the potential for industrial applications of magnetic field-assisted catalysis.},

  abstract     = {Pressure-induced evolution of the bandgap, structural phase transitions, and changes in exciton effects can significantly modulate the luminescent properties of lead halide perovskites (LHPs) quantum dots (QDs). Previous studies have indicated that CH 3 NH 3 PbBr 3 (MAPbBr 3 ) QDs, as a typical low-dimensional LHP material, and their photoluminescence (PL) at ambient conditions are mainly attributed to the radiative recombination of the initially generated excitons upon light absorption and the excitons involving surface states, while the existence of biexciton radiative recombination remains unclear. In this work, we confirm the existence of biexciton radiative recombination in MAPbBr 3 QDs at ambient conditions through experimental measurements of excitation-intensity-dependent PL and time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra at ambient conditions as well as temperature-dependent PL spectra (80–260 K) at ambient pressure. We also establish that the PL of MAPbBr 3 QDs primarily originates from the combined effects of three excitons radiative recombination physical processes: biexcitons, initially generated excitons upon light absorption, and excitons involving surface states. Furthermore, through in situ high-pressure PL, absorption, and TRPL spectroscopy measurements, we reveal that the recombination lifetimes and the relative contributions of these three excitons in MAPbBr 3 QDs are all subject to alteration in response to the pressure-induced bandgap evolution and the structural phase transitions, thereby modulating their PL emission characteristics.},

However, concerns about electrochemical degradation under high-energy radiation hinder their widespread use in space. To this end, a NASICON-type Li 1.3 Al 0.3 Ti 1.7 (PO 4 ) 3 (LATP) electrolyte with high ionic conductivity at room temperature was selected, and the effects of high-dose electron irradiation on the microstructure as well as electrochemical and mechanical properties of electrolyte were investigated by using neutron powder diffraction (NPD), NPD stress analysis, micro-computed tomography, nanoindentation, and XRD residual stress test. It was confirmed that LATP SSEs held good resistance to irradiation at absorbed doses of 1 and 2 MGy with negligibly performance degradation, while irradiation at high doses induced a rapid decrease in the Young modulus and hardness of SSEs and introduced a tensile stress of 65.79 MPa at up to 10 MGy absorbed dose, which increased the cracking tendency and the risk of lithium dendrite growth in the solid-state electrolyte. NPD revealed that the reduction of lithium vacancies at the M1 site of the irradiated SSEs was the critical factor for the ion transport performance degradation. This is evidenced by a significant increase in impedance, up to 453 Ω, and an increase in the activation energy for ion transport to 0.501 eV.},

  abstract     = {GeSe has recently gained attention for its structural similarity to SnSe, an excellent thermoelectric material. However, for the orthorhombic GeSe, the maximum zT is limited to ∼0.2 at 700 K. A significant improvement in the thermoelectric performance is observed when GeSe is stabilized in a rhombohedral or cubic structure; thus, the crystal structure plays an important role in GeSe for improved zT. In this study, we investigated the structural transitions and thermoelectric properties of Te-substituted GeSe. Increasing Te substitution in GeSe 1-x Te x (x = 0.00–0.50) induces a transition from orthorhombic to rhombohedral crystal structure at ambient conditions with the maximum zT ∼ 0.58 observed in rhombohedral GeSe 0.6 Te 0.4 at 573 K. The improved thermoelectric performance in the rhombohedral phase is due to a concurrent increase in the power factor and a decrease in lattice thermal conductivity. The phonon dispersion calculation tells that the high-frequency optical phonon modes significantly increase the phonon–phonon scattering for the rhombohedral phase, enhancing the lattice anharmonicity and reducing the lattice thermal conductivity. This behavior aligns with the presence of metavalent bonding in rhombohedral GeSe. Additionally, peak broadening observed in the Raman spectra of the rhombohedral phase indicates pronounced lattice anharmonicity and phonon modes softening due to the metavalent bond character.},

First, a low-magnification telecentric lens is used for sparse axial sampling within a large depth-of-field range to obtain a coarse estimate of vascular depth. Then, based on the frequency-depth characteristics of dynamic blood flow signals, a TFDA-based focusing evaluation function is established in combination with Lambert–Beer&#39;s law, achieving a mean absolute percentage error of 2.06%. Finally, validation on a 3-day-old chicken embryo demonstrated a lateral spatial resolution of 2.95 μ m and imaging time of 11.5 s for a 4.95 × 4.95 × 0.7 mm 3 sample. Our method provides effective blood flow depth localization by assessing focal modulation intensity relative to focal plane and blood flow position, offering promising support for vascular disease research.},

While synergy among them has never been achieved. Herein, we reported an effective strategy to boost the triboelectric charge transfer efficiency by synergizing the strong ferroelectric polarization and high permittivity of embedded lead zirconate titanate fillers. The influence of interfacial polarization intensity and the dielectric permittivity, as well as corona poling, on the triboelectrification of composite film was systematically investigated. Notably, the switching of interfacial polarization direction renders an increase (207%) or a decrease (71%) in the triboelectric output in comparison with the non-poled counterpart. Theoretical modeling was established by combining Kelvin probe force microscopy characterization with the electron cloud overlap energy band derivation. This work not only offers unprecedented insight into the fundamental mechanism of triboelectrification but also opens up a possibility in the development of next-generation wearable electronics.},

To maximize the output power of such transducers, operation at their mechanical resonance frequency is imperative. However, a reduction in size along the direction of oscillation is intrinsically accompanied by an increase in resonance frequency. Here, we report on a computational shape optimization strategy to minimize the resonance frequency in magnetoelectric transducers by ≈38% within a set of given optimization constraints. We show that our algorithm can be used to guide the design of magnetoelectric transducers optimized to operate at different resonance frequencies and allows for consistent frequency spacing between transducers, thus enabling separately addressable devices and clustered operation. Finally, we propose four needle-shaped devices that could be used as bioimplants that impose minimal tissue damage upon direct insertion into tissue. The increase in resonance frequency associated with the needle shape is overcompensated by a frequency minimization step. Our work paves the way for computationally guided resonance frequency tuning in the field of magnetoelectric transducers.},

  abstract     = {This study presents the use of micro-ring resonator (MRR) devices to extract and enhance nonlinear signals. MRRs “trap” incoming light and, therefore, have been shown to achieve extremely high local intensities of light. Thus, they can be used to facilitate highly nonlinear optical signals that are usually weak in intensity and require high excitation power. By embedding materials that host nonlinear optical processes inside the MRR, we expect to observe an enhancement in the strength of the nonlinear optical signals. This concept is demonstrated here by extracting the Raman signature of graphene that is placed inside a MRR device. A highly doped silica MRR featuring an optical bus waveguide coupled to a ring tuned to near-infrared wavelengths is used. Raman signal with an excitation wavelength of 522 nm via third-harmonic generation inside the MRR is observed. The higher-order Raman signal of the embedded graphene is also observed at the 1597.6 nm excitation wavelength. This work demonstrates the feasibility of the MRR as a nonlinear signal enhancer using high-Q MRR device setups.},

  abstract     = {In this study, a P3HT-based multi-gate frequency-dependent synaptic transistor is fabricated, which demonstrates significant advantages in mimicking the transmission characteristics of biological synaptic activities. The proposed device simulates outputs related to frequency and gate voltage modulation. This device can respond differently to inputs ranging from 0.75 to 11.11 Hz, and at the same input frequency, it exhibits different responses by varying the control gate voltage from 0 to −0.8 V. This innovative design can dynamically adjust the cutoff frequency, enhancing edge feature processing in images, thereby significantly improving the recognition accuracy of information in blurry images that can be difficult for humans to distinguish. Our results provide a hardware edge-computing image processing method, overcoming the limitations of traditional single-gate transistors that typically have fixed parameters. The recognition accuracy of information in blurry images preprocessed by this device improved significantly from 80% to 100%. Combined with the multi-gate design, this synaptic device excels not only in edge enhancement and image processing but also offers robust hardware support for future neuromorphic electronics.},

Recently, 2D anisotropic/isotropic heterostructures have shown promise in breaking isotropic symmetry and inducing anisotropic responses through precise control of interfacial structures, such as moiré patterns. However, detailed experimental investigations into the correlation between anisotropic behaviors and anisotropic moiré patterns remain scarce. Here, we report optical anisotropy in WS 2 by stacking a WS 2 /ReS 2 heterostructure. Through measurements of polarized photoluminescence spectra, we observe that the intralayer excitons (both localized-state exciton LX and neutral exciton X A ) of WS 2 in the heterostructure exhibit pronounced anisotropy, which remains robust at both room temperature and a low temperature of ∼10 K. Furthermore, the angles between the linear polarization directions and the orientation of the corresponding one-dimensional moiré patterns remain approximately constant values (∼60° for LX and ∼45° for X A ), demonstrating a clear correlation between anisotropic exciton emission and the anisotropic moiré patterns. Our work offers valuable insights into achieving artificial optical anisotropy using anisotropic/isotropic heterostructures, paving the way for enhanced performance in anisotropic sensing devices.},

In our work, we propose a stable monolayer Janus Nb 2 SeTeO with altermagnetic ground state and spin-valley locking (SVL) effect. The monolayer Janus Nb 2 SeTeO exhibits a multipiezo effect with a large out-of-plane piezoelectricity and piezovalley effect with large valley polarization. The piezovalley effect is induced by uniaxial strain effect in different directions, which contributes the anomalous valley Hall effect (AVHE) observed in AM systems. Moreover, compressive uniaxial strain could induce quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) in the AM system, where the dissipationless topological edge states&#39; chirality could be manipulated by the direction of uniaxial strain. These manifest topological phase transitions could be realized via piezovalley effect in the AM system. Furthermore, the AM quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE) could be induced by biaxial strain effect, which contributes quantized spin Hall conductance. Our work reveals that strain-engineering technique could serve as an important method to tune dissipationless edge states in monolayer Janus Nb 2 SeTeO. By designing the SVL effect, topological physics could be emerged in AM systems such as AVHE, QAHE, and QSHE.},

  abstract     = {Graphene exhibits a pronounced photo-thermoelectric effect (PTE) in its in-plane carrier transport and has attracted attention toward various optoelectronic applications. In this study, we demonstrate an out-of-plane PTE by utilizing electron tunneling across a barrier, namely, the tunneling photo-thermoelectric effect (TPTE). This was achieved in a monolayer graphene (MLG)/bilayer hexagonal boron nitride ( h -BN)/bilayer graphene (BLG) asymmetric tunnel junction. MLG and BLG exhibit different cyclotron resonance (CR) optical absorption energies when their energies are Landau quantized under an out-of-plane magnetic field. We tuned the magnetic field under mid-infrared irradiation to bring MLG into CR conditions, whereas BLG was not in CR. The CR absorption in the MLG generates an electron temperature difference between the MLG and BLG and induces an out-of-plane TPTE voltage across the h -BN tunnel barrier. The TPTE exhibited a unique dependence on the Fermi energy of the MLG, which differed from that of the in-plane PTE of the MLG. The TPTE signal was large when the Fermi energy of the MLG was tuned near the transition between the quantum Hall state (QHS) and non-QHS. The TPTE allows one to measure the PTE on vertically stacked tunnel junctions, thus providing another degree of freedom for probing the electronic and optoelectronic properties of two-dimensional material heterostructures.},

Phase-field simulations, incorporating electrical, thermal, and mechanical breakdown mechanisms, investigate the influence of nanofiller volume fraction, size, and dielectric constant on the dielectric response and breakdown behaviors under high temperature and electric fields.

Nevertheless, due to varying physical mechanisms, achieving and fine-tuning multiple such phenomena within a single S-N system continues to be a challenge. In this work, we employ NbSe 2 and WTe 2 to fabricate an S-N-S heterostructure. Below the superconducting transition temperature of NbSe 2 , two distinct resistance-temperature behaviors are observed: a continuous decrease in junction resistance with temperature decrease, indicative of the superconducting proximity effect and consistent with the BCS model, and an increase in resistance attributed to competition between Andreev reflection (AR) and normal reflection at a low-transparency interface, which can be suppressed by applying a small bias current or a magnetic field. Our results indicate the signature of the coexistence of proximity-induced superconductivity with AR in the measured S-N-S heterojunction, demonstrating the tunability of charge carrier transport behavior at the interface. This finding enhances our understanding of such systems and holds potential for the development of superconducting electronics, quantum computing, and energy harvesting technologies.},

Strong, circularly polarized luminescence reflecting the spin-polarized electron states generated by a GaNAs spin filter is needed to realize practical opto-spintronics applications. This study examined the impacts of the GaNAs thickness on the room-temperature spin-polarized luminescence properties of tunnel-coupled InAs quantum dots (QDs) through polarization- and time-resolved photoluminescence in combination with a rate equation analysis. Reducing the GaNAs thickness from 20 to 5 nm increased the QD luminescence intensity by over an order of magnitude at low excitation powers. This increased luminescence was attributed to decreased electron capture in the deep-level defect states of GaNAs, which resulted from fewer defects in thinner GaNAs layers. Furthermore, the reduction in GaNAs thickness decreased the excitation power needed to maximize electron spin polarization of QDs while maintaining a near-maximum value. This efficient spin-amplified luminescence of QDs was achieved through spin-selective capture of QD electrons by defect states under low excitation spin densities. These results demonstrate that using a thin GaNAs spin filter can result in strong QD luminescence and high circular polarization at room temperature and low excitation spin densities. The findings give valuable implications for the development of spin-functional optical devices utilizing a GaNAs spin filter.},

However, as a potential spintronic material, its spin related properties have not been fully understood yet. We investigate the efficiency of spin current detection in GeSn by using the technique of ferromagnetic resonance drive spin pumping. Some fundamental spintronic parameters can be extracted from our experimental results to measure the change of spin injection/conversion efficiency. A Co layer is deposited on the top GeSn thin films to serve as the spin current generator. Here, the effective spin mixing conductance ( ⁠ g eff ↑ ↓ ⁠ ) and the product of spin diffusion length and spin Hall angle [ λ s θ ISHE (%)] represent the spin injection efficiency and the spin-charge conversion efficiency, respectively. g eff ↑ ↓ and λ s θ ISHE (%) are 9.3 × 10 19 m −2 and 1.39 nm for p -type GeSn; and 7.4 × 10 19 m −2 and 2.09 nm for n -type GeSn. The high-efficient spin injection in both p- type and n- type Co/GeSn systems is attributed to a low barrier height at the Co/GeSn interface because the spin current at the interface is proportional to the square root of barrier height. Our experimental results show that GeSn is effective as a spin current sink.},

The results show that the film levitates at the height of the original standing wave node and at discrete horizontal positions approximately every transducer interval. The levitated film vibrates at the same frequency as the ultrasonic transducer and cannot be regarded as rigid against ultrasonic waves. Different film materials and thicknesses were examined, including metal foils and wood papers. In this study, the maximum surface density of the films that levitated was 3.5 × 10 − 2 mg/mm 2 .

To date, the role of such effects in the accuracy and limitations of the measurement has not been addressed. Here, we present an advanced thermal model to capture the role of material properties, laser power, and film thickness in the thermal size effects, based on the three-dimensional (3D) gray phonon Boltzmann transport equation. Recalling that laser-induced thermal size effects can lead to unexpectedly high local temperatures, even damaging the measured materials, our advanced 3D model gains particular importance for the accurate measurements of directional thermal conductivities in submicrometer structures using future high-resolution optical pump–probe techniques.},

  abstract     = {The phase change of a liquid into vapor results in a sharp volume expansion, generating a powerful driving force, which is fundamental for the operation of pulsating heat pipes (PHPs). However, the performance of PHPs is hindered by instability arising from the lack of directional control over the expansion process. In this work, we propose a PHP incorporating thermal-to-mechanical energy conversion (TMC) microstructures, which direct the TMC by controlling the expansion in desired directions, thereby more efficiently utilizing the driving force. Two designs for enhancement of TMC, i.e., one featuring a vapor actuator microstructure (VA-PHP) and another with diameter-variant channels (DVC-PHP), were fabricated and experimentally investigated under low inclination angles and horizontal orientations (0°, 1°, 5°, and 9°). The experimental results indicated that the incorporation of the TMC microstructures into the PHPs facilitated more efficient startup, enhanced unidirectional circulation, and reduced the dependence on the inclination angle. Notably, while the conventional PHP failed to operate at small inclination angles, the VA-PHP achieved stable operation at 1°, and the DVC-PHP further maintained stable operation even at 0°. The robust performance of the proposed PHPs at low inclination angles demonstrates the potential of TMC microstructures to overcome orientation-dependent limitations, thereby delivering a practical solution for improving the effectiveness of PHPs.},

It is, therefore, in hot pursuit of seeking solid-state electrolyte materials with high energy density and flexible operation conditions. Here, we verified a class of two-dimensional superionic conduction in A(BC) 2 , in which A are alkaline earth metals such as Be, Mg, and Ca, and boron–carbon (BC) form graphene-like layers. Our first-principles molecular dynamics simulation, boosted by high-accuracy machine-leaning potentials, shows that alkaline metal becomes super-ions under high-temperature conditions, moving freely between BC layers. Differences in superionic conduit lead to the diffusion in Be(BC) 2 driven by the vacancy mechanism. In contrast, the diffusion in Mg(BC) 2 and Ca(BC) 2 is jointly driven by both the vacancy and cooperative mechanisms. We demonstrate that the superionic transition temperature is controlled by the deficiency of mobile super-ions, tuning from 1300 to 1600 K, with up to 2.5% cation defects. With superior thermal stability, these two-dimensional compounds are promising electrolyte materials with ultrahigh heat resistivity capable of operating under high-temperature environments such as deep drills and aerospace devices.},

  abstract     = {Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) is sustainable and environmentally friendly. Titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) is commonly chosen as a photocatalyst of PHE due to its non-toxicity, robust stability, and superior photocatalytic activity. However, the efficacy of TiO 2 is restricted by rapid electron–hole pair recombination, limited electron mobility, and sluggish surface reactions. To address these issues, we have synthesized a Ni–P alloy onto the surface of TiO 2 (Ni–P/TiO 2 ) using a safe and efficient photo-deposition method, thereby constructing a Schottky heterojunction photocatalyst. The construction of the heterojunction significantly reduces the recombination rates of photoinduced electron–hole pairs and enhances the charge transfer rates within the photocatalyst. Additionally, the incorporation of the Ni–P alloy increases the density of oxygen vacancies, providing abundant active sites for the reduction reaction. The metallic properties of the Ni–P alloy improve the overall light absorption capacity. As a result, Ni–P/TiO 2 exhibits exceptional photocatalytic hydrogen production capability. When the mass ratio of the Ni–P alloy to TiO 2 is 12 wt. %, the hydrogen evolution rate reaches its maximum value at 1654.2 μ mol g −1 h −1 . Furthermore, density functional theory calculations substantiate that the formation of an internal electric field between the Ni–P alloy and TiO 2 facilitates electron migration and carrier separation. This investigation provides a promising strategy for constructing TiO 2 -based Schottky heterojunctions to improve the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance.},

The ELO technology reduced the damage of AlN thin films and Si wafer during the ELO process due to the selective etching of AlN and BaF 2 .

Subsequent post-annealing of the as-grown VO x thin films at 500 °C in atmospheres of air, 1 Pa O 2 , and vacuum (10 −4 Pa) could, respectively, result in the crystallization of V 2 O 5 , VO 2 , and V 2 O 3 phases, as verified by x-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) reveals that the valence states of vanadium in the annealed thin films exhibit dramatic changes with the variation of annealing atmosphere toward the targeted phases. The VO 2 thin film exhibits a sharp metal–insulator transition (MIT) near 340 K with a resistivity change exceeding three orders of magnitude. The V 2 O 3 thin film features a characteristic MIT with obvious thermal hysteresis between the cooling and warming processes, whereas the V 2 O 5 thin film is highly insulating. The spectral weight near the Fermi level revealed by the XPS in the valence band region coincides with the changes of VO x phases and consequent transport properties due to post-annealing. Our results demonstrate that the combination of ALD and post-annealing provides a facile method for the synthesis of multivalent VO x thin films for practical applications.},

  abstract     = {The quantum Hall effect arises when electrons in a two-dimensional plane are subjected to a magnetic field, causing them to undergo cyclotron motion and form discrete energy levels, known as Landau levels. These levels play a critical role in condensed matter physics. However, practical limitations of applying a magnetic field have led to the introduction of pseudomagnetic fields, which can similarly induce Landau levels. Such pseudomagnetic fields are typically generated through synthetic strain, achieved by deforming geometric patterns, and have been applied to systems like graphene, photons, and phonon crystals. Building on previous research in electronics and optics, we present a plasmonic metasurface that induces Landau levels via synthetic strain in the microwave frequency range. This strain is realized by printing metal structures of specific shapes on a dielectric substrate using printed circuit board technology. The fundamental unit of the plasmonic metasurface is a C 6 symmetric structure composed of six localized surface plasmon patches. By applying a displacement function along the transmission direction, we discretize the dispersion curve, leading to band degeneration and the emergence of edge states. The distribution of these edge states is influenced by the strength of the pseudomagnetic field, which is controlled by the magnitude of the displacement function. We validate our design through fabricated models and demonstrate the existence of edge states using near-field scanning experiments. Our work, which combines synthetic magnetic fields and plasmonic metasurface, provides valuable insights for the development and application of integrated photonic devices.},

  abstract     = {Crude oil spill accidents cause extreme environmental damage, with huge economic costs that include the loss of oil resources. Despite the advances in conventional oil spill cleanup technology, such as dispersants, absorbents, and skimmers, there is still a need for more efficient solutions. In this study, we introduce a Joule-heated stearic acid/carbon nanotube-wrapped polyurethane sponge (SCPU) for rapid and all-weather recovery of leaked crude oil. SCPU is both hydrophobic and oleophilic and is electrically conductive. When 6 V were applied across the SCPU, the surface temperature increased to 146 °C within 70 s, which reduced the viscosity of crude oil and shortened the recovery time by over 99%. In addition, the Joule-heated SCPU can continuously recover crude oil floating on the water surface when connected to a peristaltic pump. This Joule-heated SCPU has a high crude oil adsorption capacity, a scalable preparation method, and is mechanically stable, and thus is expected to provide an efficient and practical solution for responding to crude oil spill accidents.},

The In 2 O 3 /MoS 2 nanoflower is composed of extremely thin MoS 2 nanosheets, among which In 2 O 3 nanoparticles are uniformly attached to the MoS 2 nanosheets. Numerous p–n heterojunctions and oxygen vacancies are present on the surfaces of the In 2 O 3 /MoS 2 nanoflowers. The In 2 O 3 /MoS 2 composites exhibited high sensitivity and selectivity, along with rapid response and recovery to methanol vapor at 240 °C. The In 2 O 3 /MoS 2 nanoflower sensors exhibit rapid response and recovery rates toward methanol, particularly notable with a recovery time of only 15 s for 100 ppm methanol. The In 2 O 3 /MoS 2 sensors also demonstrate excellent stability and reproducibility, with a remarkable selectivity toward methanol.

Atomic resolution aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy is employed to examine the structural and microstructural changes induced by the annealing process. The results show that the thermal annealing process leads to the formation of Ge nanocrystals, which subsequently disappear, leaving nano-voids inside the Ge-doped Ga 2 O 3 matrix. In addition, the microstructure displays distinct crystallographic relationships in annealed β-Ga 2 O 3 forming layers with well-defined interfaces.

Bi 2 O 2 Se, with its narrow bandgap of 0.8 eV, has emerged as a promising candidate for NIR detection. However, it exhibits a slower response in this spectral region. An asymmetric electrode structure can effectively separate photogenerated electron–hole pairs by introducing an internal electric field, thereby facilitating faster carrier transport and significantly reducing the response time. In this study, we utilized PdSe 2 , a semi-metal, as an electrode to construct an asymmetric electrode structure in conjunction with Ti–Au electrode, aiming to enhance the performance of Bi 2 O 2 Se NIR photodetectors. The response time of the PdSe 2 /Bi 2 O 2 Se/Ti–Au photodetector was 21 and 16 μ s under 1064 and 1550 nm light sources, respectively, with a responsivity of 121 mA/W at 1064 nm.

  abstract     = {Mode-locked lasers with narrow spectral bandwidths and high power spectral density are valuable for various applications that require selective and efficient light–matter interactions. However, mode-locked lasers in the mid-infrared (MIR) region so far face significant challenges in both narrowing the spectral width and expanding the tunable range. In this work, we demonstrate a Fourier transform-limited pulsed laser with ultra-narrow bandwidth by utilizing the frequency-modulated (FM) mode-locking technique in a Cr:ZnS laser. The proposed laser achieves a spectral width of ∼2 GHz (∼40 pm) and a pulse duration of ∼200 ps within a wide tunable range from 1966 to 2572 nm. By incorporating an etalon into the cavity, the spectral width is further narrowed to ∼500 MHz (∼8 pm), and the pulse duration is extended to ∼1 ns. We also find unique detuning characteristics of the FM mode-locked laser in that the narrowband mode-locked state is maintained over a large detuning frequency of ∼20 kHz, while its operating wavelength varies linearly with detuning. This property indicates a significantly better resistance to cavity length fluctuations compared to other active mode-locking schemes as well as a promising way to achieve precise wavelength fine-tuning through electronic control. The demonstrated laser, featuring an ultra-narrow spectral width at a desired mid-infrared wavelength, offers a powerful tool for high-resolution and high-sensitivity spectroscopy and coherent control of molecular vibrations.},

However, certain applications like THz endoscopes, strong-field THz near-field nonlinear optics, and THz high-power devices require a deep understanding of strong-field THz–matter interaction mechanisms. Therefore, improving the manipulation of strong-field THz coupling and propagation characteristics, particularly through the use of metal wire waveguides, is crucial. To this end, we systematically investigate the coupling and propagation characteristics of strong-field THz waves on the surface of tungsten wires and implement two effective coupling methods: two-wire coupling and crossover coupling. This allows for a propagation distance of up to 100 mm along the tungsten surface as THz surface waves. This effective control of strong-field THz waves using metal wires enables the guidance of THz waves from free space into transmission lines and waveguides, which holds significant value for various specific applications.},

Despite their promising applications in optical document security, they have been the subject of only a handful of research efforts, underscoring the need for further exploration in this area. Here, we propose a hybrid metasurface that achieves this functionality and thoroughly characterize its performance using simulations. In our device, nanohole arrays in an aluminum film function as plasmonic color filters for blue, green, and red channels with low crosstalk. Amorphous titanium dioxide (aTiO 2 ) nanopillars comprise the hologram metasurface, which modulates the outgoing light&#39;s phase to produce a holographic image. Due to the subwavelength dimensions of the unit cell of the color filter (e.g., 415 nm for red, 315 nm for green, and 255 nm for blue wavelengths) and metasurface hologram (e.g., 430 nm for red, 360 nm for green, and 305 nm for blue wavelengths), the color print and holographic images can have very high resolution. Simulations reveal that the metasurface can be perceived as a tricolor image under incoherent white light, whereas under illumination from red, green, and blue lasers, three distinct holographic images can be observed.},

High- Q Si photonic nanocavities with asymmetric claddings offer mechanical stability, high functionalities from heterogeneous materials, and vertical integration of optoelectronic devices. However, achieving a high Q factor in an asymmetric structure remains challenging because of the TE–TM coupling loss in the Si slab. To suppress the TE–TM coupling, we designed a high- Q two-dimensional (2D) Si photonic crystal slot cavity by significantly reducing the electric field components in the slab, leveraging a large dielectric discontinuity between Si and the low-index slot. We fabricated 2D Si photonic crystal slot nanocavities with asymmetric claddings consisting of a lower cladding of thermal oxide ( n lc = n BOX = 1.45) and an upper cladding of infiltrated spin-on glass ( n uc = n SOG = 1.3). The Q factor of this slot cavity is as high as 6.32 × 10 5 , which is the highest Q value ever recorded among nanocavities with asymmetric claddings. Our results are useful for heterogeneous integration of Si photonic crystal nanocavities with various functionalities such as active and nonlinear optical materials, which are unattainable in conventional Si photonics.},
