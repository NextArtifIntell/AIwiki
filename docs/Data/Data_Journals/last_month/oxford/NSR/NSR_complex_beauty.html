However, their practical use is still hampered by a slow recovery process (generally &gt;30 min) during cooling, attributed to sluggish mass diffusion and delayed phase dissolution. Herein, we present a high-entropy phase separation design to significantly accelerate the recovery dynamics of these materials. We demonstrate this concept using a thermal-stiffening poly(calcium acrylate)-based copolymer hydrogel by incorporating hydrophilic units. Mechanistically, the hydrophilic units disrupt the dense packing of thermal-stiffening clusters, creating a high-entropy topological structure with a low energy barrier for rapid mass diffusion. This approach retains the impressive thermal-stiffening response with a 760-fold increase in storage modulus, while dramatically reducing the characteristic recovery time to merely 28 s. We anticipate this high-entropy strategy to be broadly applicable in designing modulus-adaptive materials with fast switching dynamics.},

  abstract     = {National greenhouse gas (GHG) budget, including CO 2 , CH 4 and N 2 O has increasingly become a topic of concern in international climate governance. China is paying increasing attention to reducing GHG emissions and increasing land sinks to effectively mitigate climate change. Accurate estimates of GHG fluxes are crucial for monitoring progress toward mitigating GHG emissions in China. This study used comprehensive methods, including emission factor methods, process-based models, atmospheric inversions, and data-driven models, to estimate the long-term trends of GHG sources and sinks from all anthropogenic and natural sectors in China&#39;s mainland during 2000–2023, and produced an up-to-date China GHG Budget dataset (CNGHG). The total gross emissions of the three GHGs show a 3-fold increase from 5.0 (95% CI: 4.9–5.1) Gt CO 2 -eq yr −1 (in 2000) to 14.3 (95% CI: 13.8–14.8) Gt CO 2 -eq yr −1 (in 2023). CO 2 emissions represented 81.8% of the GHG emissions in 2023, while 12.7% and 5.5% were for CH 4 and N 2 O, respectively. As the largest CO 2 source, the energy sector contributed 87.4% CO 2 emissions. In contrast, the agriculture, forestry and other land use sector was the largest sector of CH 4 and N 2 O, representing 50.1% and 66.3% emissions, respectively. Moreover, China&#39;s terrestrial ecosystems serve as a net CO 2 sink (1.0 Gt CO 2 yr −1 , 95% CI: 0.2–1.9 Gt CO 2 yr −1 ) during 2012 to 2021, equivalent to an average of 14.3% of fossil CO 2 emissions. Our GHG emission estimates showed a general consistency with national GHG inventories, with gridded and sector-specific estimates of GHG fluxes over China, providing the basis for curtailing GHG emissions for each region and sector.},

  abstract     = {The van der Waals (vdW) confined space provides a distinct environment from free space, enabling the production of two-dimensional Janus materials, like highly asymmetric hydrogenated graphene (AH-Gr). Here, we develop a vdW confined space assisted hydrogenation method to produce AH-Gr. The confined space between graphene and the substrate aggregates hydrogen radicals, making the bottom-side of graphene more prone to hydrogenation. The dense and homogeneous confined spaces between adjacent vdW crystals promote rapid and uniform distribution of carbon-hydrogen (C−H) bonds. The hydrogen-to-carbon atomic (H/C) ratios can be quantitatively controlled by adjusting the permeated proton dose. All AH-Gr, regardless of H/C ratios, remain vacancy-free. The spatial distributions of C−H bonds significantly influence the electrical and magnetic properties of AH-Gr. Asymmetric hydrogenation transforms graphene from a semi-metal to a semiconductor, suppresses the quantum Hall effect, and reduces the phase coherence length. This study provides new insights into the preparation and characteristics of hydrogenated graphene, broadening the applications of vdW confined space.},

The weakly solvated electrolytes show weak ion–dipole interaction and promote rapid desolvation but are faced with sluggish ion-transport kinetics, thus inducing high overpotential and Li-dendrite formation. Herein, by applying methyl propionate as a weakly coordinated cosolvent, a loose solvation shell that is regulated by anion–solvent interaction enables weakened Li + –anion interaction while maintaining adequate anion participation, featuring a facilitated bulk ion-transport route via anion dissociation, originally achieving a high ionic conductivity of 17.74 mS cm −1 in weakly solvated electrolytes at 25°C. Consequently, this advanced electrolyte design markedly mitigates concentration polarization and regulates uniform Li deposition, and thus the hybrid anode achieves 99.8% average coulombic efficiency within 1500 cycles at 4C and improved cycling stability at a low N/P ratio of 0.5, making a breakthrough in alkali-metal-ion batteries.},

Beyond classical homogenization-based numerical methods, this paper presents an efficient and accurate mapping between the geometry and properties of a class of unit cells described by moving morphable components, achieved via a graph convolutional neural network. This leads to a structural genome database (SGD) approach for the intelligent design of mechanical metamaterials. Using the SGD approach, metamaterials exhibiting the Hashin–Shtrikman upper bound of bulk modulus, auxetic behavior and the unimodal property have been created, with design efficiency improved by 3–4 orders of magnitude. Additionally, transfer learning and a small amount of training data allow the SGD to predict non-local behaviors beyond a unit cell, such as optimized unit cells with critical buckling strength enhanced by nearly 200% and a bandgap metamaterial with a relative bandgap width of 51%. Experimentally validated optimized metamaterials demonstrate auxetic behavior and superior buckling resistance. The proposed SGD approach holds promise for the advanced design of multi-scale and multi-physics systems.},

However, concerns have arisen from the residual presence of liquid metal, raising long-term biological risks. Herein, we propose a containment method that involves the rolling of magnetic liquid-metal droplets in lyophilized powders, resulting in the formation of intact hydrogel coatings upon hydration. These hydrogel coatings adhere to the liquid-metal surface, forming a cohesive network through hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid groups and siloxane linkages from silanol groups. This synergy of physical and chemical interactions enables hydrogel coatings with exceptional stretchability, fracture energy and interfacial bonding to liquid metals. Consequently, the hydrogel-coated containment capsule of magnetic liquid metal exhibits remarkable resilience to cyclic compression, enduring strains of ≤85%, while also withstanding impacts from heights of &gt;14 m. Moreover, the containment capsules demonstrate large deformation capabilities, dexterous locomotion and wireless heating under the control of static and alternating magnetic fields. They showcase the capability for remote thermal ablation operations on ex vivo porcine stomachs and in vivo rabbit models.},

Over the study period, the average total agricultural non-CO 2 GHG emissions amounted to 722.5 ± 102.3 Tg CO 2 -eq yr −1 , with livestock CH 4 , cropland CH 4 , cropland N 2 O and livestock N 2 O contributing 41% (297.4 ± 64.3 Tg CO 2 -eq yr −1 ), 31% (225.0 ± 69.6 Tg CO 2 -eq yr −1 ), 18% (130.6 ± 9.4 Tg CO 2 -eq yr −1 ) and 10% (69.4 ± 20.2 Tg CO 2 -eq yr −1 ), respectively. Approximately 70% of these emissions were concentrated in the eastern region beyond the Hu Line, with emission hotspots identified in South-central China, East China, and the Sichuan Basin. Our analysis revealed three distinct temporal stages of total emissions during the study period: rapid growth (1980–late 1990s), slow growth (late 1990s–middle 2010s), and a stabilization stage (since the middle 2010s). These stages reflect the evolving trajectory of agriculture in China, from the expansion of agricultural yields, to the transformation of agricultural practices, and ultimately the pursuit of sustainable development. However, the temporal trajectory of emissions varied significantly across different regions, highlighting divergent levels of agricultural development. This study presents a comprehensive, gridded, and consistent estimate of agricultural non-CO 2 GHG emissions in China, offering valuable insights for policymakers to develop tailored strategies that adapt to local conditions, enabling effective emission reduction measures.},

  abstract     = {Developing gas sensors that can simultaneously achieve high sensitivity and selectivity for the detection of a single-type gas remains a significant challenge. Herein we demonstrate cobalt (Co) single atoms with an unconventional dynamically changing coordination structure that could be used as NH 3 -sensing material with superior sensitivity and selectivity. According to the steric effect of 2-methylimidazole (2MI) molecules and carbonyl groups on graphene, the Co single atom is evolved into a bidentate coordinated structure (Co-2MI-G). In-situ characterization and theoretical simulation reveal that the sensing mechanism of Co-2MI-G is the specific chemical adsorption between unsaturated coordinated Co single atoms and NH 3 molecules, causing a reversible switching of coordination number from 2 to 4, a valence state transfer from Co 2+ to Co 3+ of Co single atoms, and a band-gap width from 0.14 eV to 0.50 eV. Consequently, the Co-2MI-G-based gas sensor presents a sensing response of 67.598% for 1 ppm NH 3 and a limit of detection of 2.67 ppb, at least 1.8 times higher than that of state-of-the-art NH 3 sensors, together with robust stability and reproducibility. This work provides an innovative perspective on utilizing single atoms for ultra-selective gas sensing by coordination regulation.},
