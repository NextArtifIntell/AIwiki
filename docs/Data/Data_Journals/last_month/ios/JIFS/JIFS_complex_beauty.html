  abstract     = {Cognitive radio network is prone to many malicious attacks during the process of cooperative spectrum sensing. To overcome this limitation and to efficiently use the spectrum, we incorporate block chain technology in the Fusion center in order to eliminate the malicious users and to maintain only authorized sensing results in the ledger. Fusion center takes the responsibility of smart contract ownership and organizes spectrum sensing effectively. Any malicious attack found during sensing is identified using our proposed algorithm (DETMAL-Detection of malicious users algorithm). This paper proposes a noval algorithm ’DETMAL algorithm’, which is designed in such a way that it can handle both reliant strike and self reliant strike made by the attackers. Detected attackers who are sending falsified reports are removed from the honest local decisions to make an authorised global decision. Legitimate secondary users who are the participants of the smart contract are rewarded with incentives of ethers. DETMAL algorithm shows 12% increased detection probability at 0.1 false alarm probability than the existing algorithm. Results and simulations show that our proposed model outsmarts other existing models in terms of detection probability and accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Although traditional research methods for intrusion detection can effectively prevent and mitigate issues such as data leaks to avoid severe consequences, existing intrusion detection technologies encounter limitations, including low classification accuracy and high false positive rates, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional, complex network anomaly traffic data. Additionally, the common problem of class imbalance in intrusion detection datasets exacerbates these challenges. This paper introduces a novel approach to network intrusion detection classification, termed SGAN-RL, which integrates ResNet and LSTM models based on the semi-supervised generative adversarial network (SGAN) framework. This method utilizes SGAN to generate synthetic data resembling real intrusion detection data and continually trains the discriminator to produce high-quality data, thereby enhancing data distribution balance and quality. Moreover, a fusion intrusion detection classification model is presented, leveraging the strengths of ResNet and LSTM architectures to capture spatial and temporal features, respectively. This synergistic fusion enhances the model’s capacity for comprehensive data representation, resulting in improved performance in intrusion detection data classification tasks. Experiments conducted on intrusion detection datasets NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CIC-IDS2017 demonstrate that the proposed model enhances accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, respectively, showcasing its robust performance and reliability in network intrusion detection classification.},

  abstract     = {The star coloring problem is a specialized form of vertex coloring that arises in certain computational contexts, such as when computing Hessians using automatic differentiation or finite differencing. This problem is particularly relevant when exploiting both sparsity and symmetry in the computation. Automatic differentiation is a technique used to compute derivatives numerically, and finite differencing is another approach for approximating derivatives. In these computations, sparsity (a small number of non-zero elements in a matrix) and symmetry (certain patterns in the structure of the matrix) are often exploited to optimize efficiency. A proper vertex coloring of the graph G is considered as star coloring if it uses at least three different colors for every path of length three. The star chromatic number of a graph G , denoted as χ s ( G ), is the minimum number of colors needed to accomplish the star coloring of the given graph G . This paper focuses on determining χ s ( G ) for graphs belonging to the family of snarks and their variants.},

This research work introduces a novel Hybrid Attention Residual Deep Convolution Learning (HARDCL) Model designed to enhance the accuracy of skin lesion classification, which is often challenging due to the subtle characteristics of lesions. The HARDCL Network employs an innovative hybrid attention mechanism within a residual learning framework, effectively distinguishing between benign and melanoma skin lesions with a high degree of precision. The encoder-decoder network segments the lesion from dermoscopic images, followed by feature extraction and classification, achieving a maximum accuracy of 97.11%, precision of 98.10%, recall of 98.81%, and an F1-score of 98.45%. This performance surpasses conventional deep learning algorithms such as AlexNet, InceptionV3, and ResNet18, demonstrating the effectiveness of the attention-based features in identifying critical lesion characteristics. However, despite its strengths, the HARDCL Network’s computational intensity and the need for a substantial dataset for optimal training highlight areas for further refinement. The proposed network advances the field of skin cancer diagnostics, offering a robust tool for medical professionals and setting a foundation for future enhancements in automated biomedical image analysis techniques.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of the society, decision-making methods with single attribute are becoming increasingly difficult to satisfy the needs of practical problems. And in real life, it is usually only possible to obtain the range of attribute values because of the measurement error or the complexity and uncertainty of objective things, that is, the interval number values of decision information are easily obtainable. Interval number multi-attribute decision-making problems have gradually become a research hotspot for scholars. However, most current studies have not discussed the distribution on interval numbers, resulting in partial loss of decision information. Therefore, this paper considers the case of normal distribution interval numbers (NDINs) and proposes a multi-attribute decision-making method based on symmetric relative entropy with completely unknown attribute weights. Firstly, based on the idea of maximal deviation, a model for determining attribute weights is established by the symmetric relative entropy of NDINs. Secondly, the possibility degree formula for comparison between two NDINs is used to determine the positive ideal solution (PIS) and negative ideal solution (NIS) under each attribute. Thirdly, the total closeness degree between each scheme and the ideal point is calculated using the TOPSIS method and symmetric relative entropy. Then, the ranking of schemes is obtained based on the total closeness degree. Finally, a numerical example is offered to prove the feasibility and validity of the proposed method.},

This method employs fuzzy logic for nonlinear pixel mapping and adaptively identifies the bounds of Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Sets through fuzzy convolution operations. By incorporating multivariate Type-1 membership functions into conventional convolutional kernels, we have engineered fuzzy convolutional kernels. These kernels, along with fuzzy rule libraries, activate features derived from fuzzy convolutions, facilitating the iterative refinement of the model’s fuzzy sets. This hierarchical process culminates in the development of the IT2FCNN model. When applied to the Wuhan dense labeling dataset (WHDLD), our proposed method outperformed the latest Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Neural Network by 5.27% in accuracy across nine land cover categories. Furthermore, it demonstrated a 17.52% increase in accuracy on the UC Merced Land Use Dataset (UCM Dataset), particularly in dense residential areas, and an 18.3% improvement in sparse residential areas across eleven land cover categories. These results highlight the approach’s effectiveness in mitigating the impact of regional noise on land cover classification, showcasing its strong generalization capability and superior classification accuracy.},

However, current representation-based text matching models often lack the ability to handle sentence pairs and typically only perform feature interactions at the network’s top layer, which can lead to a loss of semantic focus. The interactive text matching model has significant shortcomings in extracting differential information between sentences and may ignore global information. To address these issues, this article proposes a model structure that combines a dual-tower architecture with an interactive component, which compensates for their respective weaknesses in extracting sentence semantic information. Simultaneously, a method for integrating semantic information is proposed, enabling the model to capture both the interactive information between sentence pairs and the differential information between sentences, thereby addressing the issues with the aforementioned approaches. In the process of network training, a combination of cross-entropy and cosine similarity is used to calculate the model loss. The model is optimized to a stable state. Experiments on the commonly used datasets of QQP and MRPC validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, and its performance is stably improved.},

In response to these complexities, this study delves into the realm of dual probabilistic linguistic 2-tuple sets, an extension of dual-hesitant fuzzy sets known for their effectiveness in handling perplexing data. Dual probabilistic linguistic 2-tuple sets introduces a nuanced approach, considering multiple linguistic memberships, non-membership degrees, and their associated probabilistic and deviation information. We have devised diverse mechanisms aimed at augmenting the comprehension and utilization of dual probabilistic linguistic 2-tuple sets. These mechanisms encompass transformation functions, scoring methodologies and accuracy metrics. In this study, we introduce two aggregation operators for dual probabilistic linguistic 2-tuple sets based on prioritized averaging and Maclaurin symmetric mean principles. These operators serve as the cornerstone for a pioneering hybrid approach meticulously crafted for multiple criteria decision making within the framework of dual probabilistic linguistic 2-tuple sets. To demonstrate the practicality and efficacy of our approach, we present a real-world case study. The subsequent analytical comparison and discussion underscore the effectiveness of our methodology. The outcomes of this study not only showcase the excellent performance of our proposed method but also offer valuable practical implications for decision-makers navigating complex and diverse decision environments.

  abstract     = {Image classification using polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (Pol-SAR) is becoming more important in image processing for remote sensing applications. However, in the existing techniques, during the feature extraction process, there exist some limitations including laborious endeavour for Pol-SAR image classification, identifying intrinsic features for target recognition is difficult in feature selection, and pixel-level Pol-SAR image classification is difficult for obtaining more precise and coherent interpretation consequences. Hence to overcome these issues, a novel Multifarious Stratification Stratagem in machine learning is proposed to achieve pixel-level Pol-SAR classification. In this proposed model, a novel Scrumptious Integrant Wrenching method is used for efficient feature extraction. It is compatible with the orientation-sensitive of the Pol-SAR image which increases the variety of intra-layer features. To remove the difficulty in feature selection, a novel Episodicical Proximity Selection method is proposed in which a Split-level parallel feature selection strategy is used to select the best qualities from the extracted features. To tackle the difficulty in classification, an Elastic Net Classifier (ENC) is used that find the coefficient vector for the linear combination of the training sets. This efficiently classified the best features in the Pol-SAR images and improved the proposed system’s accuracy. As a result, the performance measures of the proposed system demonstrate that the accuracy is increased by 99.69%, precision is increased by 98.99%, recall is increased by 98.99%, sensitivity is increased by 98.99%, and F1-score is increased by 98.99% as a response.},

  abstract     = {Due to the relatively high cost of labeling data, only a fraction of the available data is typically labeled in machine learning. Some existing research handled attribute selection for partially labeled data by using the importance of an attribute subset or uncertainty measure (UM). Nevertheless, it overlooked the missing rate of labels or the choice of the UM with optimal performance. This study uses discernibility relation and the missing rate of labels to UM for partially labeled data and applies it to attribute selection. To begin with, a decision information system for partially labeled data (pl-DIS) can be used to induce two equivalent decision information systems (DISs): a DIS is constructed for labeled data (l-DIS), and separately, another DIS is constructed for unlabeled data (ul-DIS). Subsequently, a discernibility relation and the percentage of missing labels are introduced. Afterwards, four importance of attribute subset are identified by taking into account the discernibility relation and the missing rate of labels. The sum of their importance, which is determined by the label missing rates of two DISs, is calculated by weighting each of them and adding them together. These four importance may be seen as four UMs. In addition, numerical simulations and statistical analyses are carried out to showcase the effectiveness of four UMs. In the end, as its application for UM, the UM with optimal performance is used to attribute selection for partially labeled data and the corresponding algorithm is proposed. The experimental outcomes demonstrate the excellence of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {The performance of real estate investment projects (REIPs) depends on profitability. However, the literature lacks a mathematical model of project-based profitability that can be utilized for estimating and assessing profitability in REIPs. This paper proposes a fuzzy logic model to quantify the relationships between the level of profitability performance of REIPs and significant factors affecting profitability. The proposed model is developed using project-based profitability data collected from 134 REIP professionals and comprises 61 factors categorized into 13 groups. The model was validated through case studies via the deployment of the model in two real estate projects. The first case study highlighted F2.5 financial management, F5.2 market research, and F7.2 exchange rate as the most critical factors, while the second case study emphasized F1.3 cost of reworks, F5.3 sales and marketing strategy, and F13.3 cost management as the most critical factors for the overall profitability performance. This study provides two significant contributions. Firstly, it presents a factor list and a model that professionals can utilize to effectively estimate and assess the profitability of REIPs. Secondly, it demonstrates the effectiveness of fuzzy logic in modeling the relationship between profitability and its factors, thereby suggesting its potential for future research on profitability modeling.},

  abstract     = {Demand prediction for shared bicycles based on historical trip data helps bicycle management organizations plan the scheduling of bicycles. However, the current prediction methods have the following problems: (1) the bicycle trip station data hides the temporal and spatial information, which is crucial for demand prediction, and the traditional methods cannot effectively use that information. (2) each bicycle organization manages its region, and local region data cannot accurately predict the demand of the whole region. Due to the privacy trip data, organizations cannot share raw data directly, which makes it a challenge to achieve federated multi-participant analyses. To address these issues, we propose a federated learning framework for demand prediction of shared bicycles (FedCGAT). Firstly, we propose a spatio-temporal graph neural network based on an attention mechanism for feature modeling of data. Meanwhile, we propose a graph data augmentation method to eliminate noisy data and capture spatial correlations. Then, we construct an auxiliary task based on contrastive learning to assist model training, which can learn the data features fully. Finally, we conducted experiments on two real-world bicycle datasets. The experiments demonstrate that FedCCAT achieves high prediction accuracy while preserving data privacy. Compared to the best-performing baseline model on both datasets, our model achieves reductions in MAPE values of 1.67% and 1.94%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Health assessment is one of the important theoretical bases for deciding whether the diversion tunnel can operate safely and stably. A project of the TBM diversion tunnel is taken as the research object to ensure the normal operation of the diversion tunnel. Based on measured data and considering multiple safety aspects such as structural response, durability, and external factors of the diversion tunnel, a TBM diversion tunnel structural health evaluation index system is established. A new method for the TBM diversion tunnel structural health comprehensive evaluation based on Analytic Hierarchy Process-Matter Element Extension-Variable Weight Theory (AMV) is proposed to explore the impact of AMV fluctuation with the measured results of the indicators on the weight, closeness, and health grade of each evaluation index. The high sensitivity and high-risk evaluation indicators for the structural health of the diversion tunnels are identified. It is found that the variable weight varies with the changes in various indicator values, which can accurately evaluate the health status of tunnels in real-time. The characteristic values of the tunnel grade calculated by the AHP and the AMV are 1.589 and 1.695, respectively. The results of the corresponding interval diversion tunnel are the basic safety state of grade B. Except for the two evaluation indicators of concrete strength and slurry properties, the variable weight values and grade characteristic values of other evaluation indicators increase with the increase of indicator values. The four indicators of segment settlement, segment opening, segment misalignment, and segment cracks are more sensitive to the health of the TBM diversion tunnel. This AMV can accurately evaluate the health status of the diversion tunnel structure. The research results can provide references for later maintenance work and similar projects.},

Then, by taking the flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSP) as an example and considering decoding times, study how the parameters of HSLSs affect their performance, where the performance is evaluated by the difference rate based on the decoding times. The simulation results mainly show that (I) as the harmony memory size (HMS) gradually increases, the performance of HSLSs first increases rapidly and then tends to remain unchanged, and HMS is not the larger the better; (II) as harmony memory considering rate increases, the performance continues to improve, while the performance of pitch adjusting rate on HSLSs goes to the opposite; Finally, more benchmark instances are also used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. The results of this paper have a certain guiding significance on how to choose LS and other parameters to improve HS for solving FJSP.},

One of these generalizations is the neighborhood system. The concept of the neighborhood system is a mathematical tool for handling inconsistent and limited knowledge. It can be applied to find the approximations to resolve the vagueness of data collection. This paper aims to examine j -neighborhoods in the context of a binary fuzzy relation and to introduce the concept of j -fuzzy neighborhoods. j -fuzzy approximations are proposed and studied using these neighborhoods. Further, an example related to heart disease is discussed to demonstrate the significance of the proposed work and the result is compared with existing ones. A medical application is described using j -fuzzy neighborhoods to categorise patients based on their COVID-19 infection.},

  abstract     = {Chaos maps and chaotic systems have made significant strides in the field of cryptography over recent decades. This is primarily because both cryptographic algorithms and chaotic maps share a wide range of common characteristics that render them effective and valuable for communication, stability, and security purposes. Consequently, image encryption based on chaos systems is regarded as one of the most effective methods for safeguarding digital images from attackers. In light of this, a new encryption scheme is proposed to protect digital images, utilizing a fusion of piecewise linear and coupled logistic-chaotic maps to enhance sensitivity to encryption. To further bolster the security of the encryption algorithm, the proposed system preprocesses high-quality pseudo-random sequences into integers ranging from 0 to 255. The cipher structure is designed based on permutation-diffusion processes, where permutation is controlled by four pixels, while diffusion is controlled by rows and columns. An extensive analysis of experimental results, including various types of security analyses, has been conducted. The security analyses have demonstrated that the proposed approach exhibits excellent performance, with high scores for NPCR = 99.61%, UACI = 33.48%, entropy of the cipher image (7.9999 ≅ 8), and correlation coefficient (–0.0009 ≅ 0). In addition to the security and performance analyses, the findings indicate that the proposed algorithm is efficient, secure, fast, and resistant to attacks. Moreover, the algorithm is versatile and can be applied to encrypt images of any size.},

Secondly, a reward-punishment mechanism is proposed to update the pheromone, and we also limit the maximum and minimum bounds of pheromone concentration. These two measures can accelerate the algorithm’s convergence speed and prevent the algorithm from falling into the local optimum. By introducing a dynamic penalty factor, we reduce the pheromone concentration on the deadlock position. Finally, the algorithm introduces a crucial node screening strategy to delete the redundant nodes on the global path and use the improved DWA for local path planning between every two adjacent critical nodes of the global path.

The algorithm encrypts hierarchically based on data sensitivity, the ciphertext is stored in the interplanetary file system (IPFS), and the encrypted address and key are stored in the side chain, which is convenient for indexing in the main chain. The vectorized access policy implements policy hiding, combines on-chain and off-chain, saves blockchain space, achieves hierarchical access control, and improves security and efficiency. Simulation experiments show that the main sidechain model proposed in this paper has better performance in terms of transaction delay and throughput.

  abstract     = {The paper aims to present a hybrid model for measuring the performance of business processes in complex organizations based on the subjective decision-making of expert teams. The subject of the research is finding ways to measure, analyze and improve the key performance indicators (KPIs) process. Obtaining the values of KPIs, which reflect the real state of the process, creates a basis for their ranking, i.e. insight into KPIs that are extremely important for the process as well as KPIs that are of lesser importance, but as such are not excluded from consideration because they are necessary for the beginning, realization and completion of the process. The model was compiled through five phases and was tested through a case study in a real business organization, which deals with the maintenance of complex combat systems. The obtained results helped the management to take certain measures in order to improve the performance of the maintenance process. In the model, it is proposed to form two expert teams, which make assessments based on experience and express them in linguistic terms according to a predefined scale. Modeling of linguistic expressions is realized using intuitive fuzzy sets of a higher order, more precisely Fermatean fuzzy sets (FFS). Selecting KPIs, decomposing the process into sub-processes and assessing the relative importance of sub-processes is carried out by one team of experts, while another team carries out the assessment of KPIs at the level of each sub-process. Determining the relative importance of sub-processes is realized using the Delphi method extended to FFS while reaching a consensus. The measurement of process performance, i.e. the value of KPIs, is realized using Multi-Criteria Group Decision-Making (MCGDM), such as the ELECTRE method extended with FFS. The sensitivity analysis of the developed model is realized by uncertainty modeling with q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets.},

  abstract     = {This paper makes a significant contribution to the field of conflict analysis by introducing a novel Interval-Valued Intuitionistic Fuzzy Three-Way Conflict Analysis (IVIFTWCA) method, which is anchored in cumulative prospect theory. The method’s key innovation lies in its use of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers to represent an agent’s stance, addressing the psychological dimensions and risk tendencies of decision-makers that have been largely overlooked in previous studies. The IVIFTWCA method categorizes conflict situations into affirmative, impartial, and adverse coalitions, leveraging the evaluation of the closeness function and predefined thresholds. It incorporates a reference point, value functions and cumulative weight functions to assess risk preferences, leading to the formulation of precise decision rules and thresholds. The method’s efficacy and applicability are demonstrated through detailed examples and comparative analysis, and its exceptional performance is confirmed through a series of experiments, offering a robust framework for real-world decision-making in conflict situations.},

  abstract     = {A problem with the neutrosophic sets, as other fuzzy set extensions, is that they require decimal numbers for truthiness, falsity, and indecision degrees of an element from experts, which cannot be easily assigned. This will be more difficult when three or more digits’ membership degrees are required to assign. Instead, proportion-based relations between the elements of a neutrosophic set can make easier to determine the truthiness, falsity, and indecision degrees. We introduce proportional neutrosophic sets in this study, together with associated aggregation operators and arithmetic operations. The proportional judgments between truthiness, falsity, and indeterminacy are enough for proportional neutrosophic sets. With these data more accurately reflecting the opinions of experts, proportional neutrosophic sets facilitate the use of neutrosophic sets. The provided models also incorporate the ambiguous concept of proportionality. According to the application and comparative analyses, proportional neutrosophic sets yield reliable results and are readily applicable to any kind of issue. Multi-criteria decision methodology using proportional neutrosophic sets based analytic hierarchy process and TOPSIS methods has been developed and used in a personnel selection problem. Additionally, we compare the proposed methodology with its classical version. Proportional neutrosophic sets are very successful in determining the degrees and ease neutrosophic multi-criteria decision making process.},

However, existing multi-view clustering algorithms have shortcomings in view information extraction, weight parameter selection, and noisy data processing. To overcome these drawbacks, we proposed a robust multi-view fuzzy clustering algorithm based on self-weighting that can handle noisy image segmentation. The algorithm first introduces the consistent fuzzy division matrix and balance coefficient into the general model to actively learn common and individual information among different views; secondly, it adopts a self-weighting strategy to judge the importance degree of each view for clustering; and finally, we construct fuzzy factors for each view based on the local space information and map the improved multi-view algorithm to the kernel space, thereby enhancing its robustness. In addition, we use an alternating optimization method to solve the optimization model and Zangwill’s theorem to prove the convergence of our algorithm. The algorithm has optimal evaluation metrics in the segmentation tasks of synthetic, natural, and remote sensing images, where the ACC values are all greater than 0.91 and the PSNR values are all greater than 20, giving superior segmentation capability and interference resistance compared to several comparative algorithms.},

However, current GCN-based approaches for collaborative filtering recommendation have limitations in effectively embedding neighboring nodes during node and neighbor information aggregation. Furthermore, weight allocation for the user (or item) representations after convolution of each layer is too uniform. To resolve these limitations, we propose a new Graph Convolutional Collaborative Filtering recommendation method based on temporal information during the node aggregation process (TA-GCCF). The method aggregates and propagates information using Gated Recurrent Units, while dynamically updating features based on the timing and sequence of interactions between nodes and their neighbors. Concurrently, we have developed a convolution attention coefficient to ascertain the significance of embedding at distinct layers. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that our method significantly outperforms the comparison methods in the accuracy of prediction.},

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are excellent at automatic feature extraction, whereas Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) produce realistic images. Transfer learning uses pre-trained models, whereas semantic segmentation identifies pixels in images. Super-resolution, style transfer, and attention mechanisms can increase the quality of images and understanding. Adversarial defenses address purposeful manipulations, while 3D image processing handles three-dimensional data. These advancements make use of improved computational power and massive datasets to revolutionize image processing capabilities. Traditional image processing algorithms frequently fail to handle the complex and multidimensional structure of color images, particularly when dealing with uncertainty and imprecision. In this study, the 3D-EIFIM frame work is extented and scaled aggregation operations 3D-EIFIM tailored for image data are proposed. By representing each pixel as an entry of 3D-EIFIM and applying aggregation techniques to enable more effective image analysis, manipulation, and enhancement.

However, most patterns derived from subjective expertise without quantitative analysis. In this article, combining bullish/bearish patterns with ensemble learning, we present an intelligent system for making stock trading decisions. The Ensemble Classifier through Multimodal Perturbation (ECMP) is designed to generate a diverse set of precise base classifiers to further determine the candlestick patterns. It achieves this by: first, introducing perturbations to the sample space through bootstrap sampling; second, employing an attribute reduction algorithm based on neighborhood rough set theory to select relevant features; third, perturbing the feature space through random subspace selection. Ultimately, the trading decisions are guided by the classification outcomes of this procedure. To evaluate the proposed model, we apply it to empirical investigations within the context of the Chinese stock market. The results obtained from our experiments clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.},

However, GNNs-based models suffer from over-smoothing and data sparsity problems. Due to its self-supervised nature, contrastive learning has gained considerable attention in the field of recommendation, aiming at alleviating highly sparse data. Graph contrastive learning models are widely used to learn the consistency of representations by constructing different graph augmentation views. Most current graph augmentation with random perturbation destroy the original graph structure information, which mislead embeddings learning. In this paper, an effective graph contrastive learning paradigm CollaGCL is proposed, which constructs graph augmentation by using singular value decomposition to preserve crucial structure information. CollaGCL enables perturbed views to effectively capture global collaborative information, mitigating the negative impact of graph structural perturbations. To optimize the contrastive learning task, the extracted meta-knowledge was propagate throughout the original graph to learn reliable embedding representations. The self-information learning between views enhances the semantic information of nodes, thus alleviating the problem of over-smoothing. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the significant improvement of CollaGCL over state-of-the-art methods.},
