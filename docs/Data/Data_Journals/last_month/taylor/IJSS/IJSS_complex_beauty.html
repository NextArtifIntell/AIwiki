  abstract     = {Extensive research has been conducted in dynamic mathematical problems and real-time industrial control applications, leading to the emergence of zeroing neural dynamics (ZND) as a significant approach. This approach is guided by the fluctuating tendency of state errors, and a link is established between the stability of the zero solution in the neurodynamic system and the convergence of neuron states in a zeroing neural network. Over the last two decades, considerable efforts have been made by numerous scholars to advance the development of ZND, resulting in the formation of a series of ZND models for various mathematical issues and real-world applications. In this paper, the advances in ZND are synthesised from three aspects: models, theories, and applications. Specifically, ZND models are categorised into two main frameworks based on their structures and further classified into different types depending on the dynamics of the specific models under each framework. The two main frameworks identified are the foundational ZND framework and the integral ZND framework. The former serves as the basic structure for exponential type ZND, finite-time type ZND, fixed-time type ZND, and predefined-time type ZND, while the latter is extended with the single-integral type ZND and the double-integral type ZND. Furthermore, the primary analytical methods for the dynamics of each type of ZND are summarised, and the current applications of ZND, including robot manipulator control, multi-agent consistency, dynamic positioning, chaos synchronisation, and image processing, are introduced. Through this survey, a comprehensive understanding of the development history of ZND research, the current research focuses and challenges in ZND models, theories, and applications, as well as future directions and key breakthroughs in ZND research, will be provided to readers.},

A novel filtering algorithm derived from the Gaussian maximum correntropy criterion is developed to handle non-Gaussian noises and possibly occurred outliers. Furthermore, the FlexRay mechanism consisting of both Round-Robin protocol and try-once-discard protocol is convened to realise high-efficient schedule of communication resources. And scalar filter gains are derived by using fixed-point iterative update rules, resulting in enhanced performance against non-Gaussian noises. A distributed approach to determine an optimal weight matrix is developed by using the upper bounds of the filtering error covariance, balancing the trade-off between estimated states and measurements at different scales. Finally, the efficacy of the developed filtering algorithm are validated through numerical simulations, demonstrating its significant advantage in real-world engineering applications.},

First, to address the challenges of unavailable leader signals and non-differentiability issue caused by the DoS attacks, a class of first-order low-pass filters is employed to develop a novel distributed resilient observer, which accurately estimate the exosystem state with the existence of high-order derivatives. Then, by viewing the output of observer as the reference signal, a distributed resilient controller is designed for each follower to address the reference-tracking problem. By introducing a smooth function with positive integrable time-varying function, novel adaptive laws are developed and incorporated with the controller design to effectively compensate for the unknown time-varying parameters. By utilising Lyapunov stability theory, the asymptotic convergence of output regulation error can be ensured. Finally, simulation results are conducted to verify the validity of the designed method.},

However, their inherent structural flexibility causes the deformation of the manipulator link during task. The dynamic model of a flexible manipulator, which is ideally represented by a partial differential equation (PDE), is not be always conducive to the design of a comprehensive controller. To address this issue, this work proposes a controller design based on a balanced truncated model that effectively contains the dominant dynamics of the single link flexible manipulator system, which substantially reduces the computational cost of controller implementation while also simplifying the design process. Further, the work also proposes a strategy to design a robust functional observer-based output feedback sliding mode controller for position control of the single link flexible manipulator.

This control method combines decentralised adaptive event-triggering mechanism (DAETM) and anti-bump condition. The main work is as follows: First, a DAETM is considered to allocate network resources properly and resist data injection attacks. Then, a data buffer is adopted to consolidate data from decentralised channels for ensuring timely utilisation. In addition, a controller gain condition is presented to achieve the bumpless switching between subsystems. Moreover, by adopting piecewise Lyapunov function method, sufficient conditions are obtained for triggered switched systems to be exponentially stable and anti-bump under injection attacks.

The analysis employs the mode-dependent average dwell time approach. Firstly, the concept of dissipativity on finite-region for 2-D switched systems is introduced. Then, a sufficient condition under which the considered systems can demonstrate the finite-region boundedness with the external disturbances is established by the special recursive formulas. Additionally, a sufficient condition for finite-region dissipativity of the considered systems is provided. Furthermore, the dissipative state feedback controller is derived to ensure the finite-region dissipativity of the closed-loop systems.

In order to combat signal fading from sensors to controllers and improve communication reliability, spatial diversity is achieved through cooperative terminal relay signals. At each transmission instant, the terminal only selects a better signal for transmission and a switched system is constructed. The aim of this paper is to design a set of desired dynamic output feedback controllers in the framework of RMPC such that the switched system with the underlying DFCP is exponentially stable. By taking the influence of the randomness of DFCP derived from a three nodes model composed of DF relay, a new objective function based on the mathematical expectation of the traditional quadratic function of MPC is established. Then, the orthogonal complement technique is applied to handle the inherent couplings of variables to formulate a solvable optimisation problem. Moreover, the sufficient conditions are provided to guarantee the recursive feasibility of the MPC strategy and the stability of the established closed-loop system in terms of the average dwell time (ADT) method. Finally, three experiments are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with the robust model predictive control (RMPC) problem for a class of systems with polytopic uncertainties and persistent bounded disturbances in the long-distance transmission environment. The signal transmitted over a long distance is very likely to be destroyed by the channel fading. To address this issue, an amplify-and-forward cooperation protocol (AFCP) is adopted in the forward channel, i.e. from sensor nodes to the remote controller node, to improve the transmission quality. Considering the difficulty of obtaining the system state in practice, the dynamic output feedback control in the framework of RMPC is put forward. With respect to the parameter uncertainty, persistent bounded disturbances, and randomness of the transmission power stored in sensors and the AF relay, the objective function is defined by the mathematical expectation of a quadratic function over the infinite time horizon. Then, based on this establishment, a ‘min–max’ optimisation problem is readily formulated. Furthermore, the singular value decomposition technique is utilised to mitigate the non-convexity and formulate an auxiliary optimisation problem with the solvability, meanwhile, the sufficient criterion for the mean-square input-to-state stability of the underlying system is obtained. Finally, two simulation examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The outset of this manuscript involves introducing an analytical formula for the credibility of coherent trapezoidal fuzzy numbers, which represent an extended version of the traditional trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. With this formula, we present a precise counterpart to compute the credibilistic mean, semivariance, and skewness of coherent trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. Leveraging these analytical formulations, we construct a novel tri-objective portfolio selection problem, integrating credibilistic mean, semivariance, and skewness as objectives, along with some practical constraints. When used with the returns of the portfolio as a whole, the derived analytical expressions help to overcome the otherwise computationally expensive approach involving the simulation of results using individual assets&#39; returns. The proposed model is solved by adapting an efficient multiobjective genetic algorithm. The algorithm has been specifically designed to solve portfolio selection models of this type. The efficiency of the proposed model is then demonstrated by taking a real-world scenario of financial stock market datasets from the NSE India. Based on the results of this study, it appears that the proposed novel tri-objective portfolio selection model produces promising results compared to the baseline model and the NIFTY 50 Index considered as a benchmark.},

First, a distributed predefined-time observer is constructed to estimate the leader&#39;s state information for each follower agent. Then, based on the recovered information, the predefined-time local controller is designed for each follower agent by utilising the predefined-time backstepping control approach. Moreover, the neural network (NN) is incorporated to identify the lumped unknown item. Particularly, an indirect learning mechanism is adopted to determine the upper bound of the optimal NN weight. In this way, the computational cost of the presented controller is greatly degraded. Stability evaluation shows that the presented controller can guarantee the position and velocity synchronisation errors regulate to the minor regions around zero in predefined time. Lastly, simulated studies are conducted on the consensus of networked robotic manipulators to validate the obtained results.},

To start, the integration of a compensation controller within the control architecture is examined, aiming to formulate the projection error dynamics. By leveraging projection error system analysis alongside output observation and sliding mode control, a meticulously crafted derivative-based sliding mode surface along with a sliding mode controller are devised, ensuring both convergence and seamless sliding motion. Afterwards, the accessibility of the surface is assessed through relevant lemmas, Caputo derivative characteristics and the Lyapunov direct approach. The subsequent stability of sliding path is corroborated, and indispensable prerequisites for achieving finite-time projective synchronisation are outlined. Furthermore, the establishment of an upper bound for synchronisation time of distinct Caputo fractional-order delayed neural networks (CFDNNs) with inconsistent orders is carried out. Ultimately, simulations on distinct CFDNNs with consistent and inconsistent orders are conducted to exemplify our approach, employing the continuous frequency distribution model.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with the tracking control problem of nonlinear time delay systems. For time delay systems, we consider nonaffine pure-feedback structure. Additionally, the case where the time delay systems are subject to input saturation and unknown states is also taken into account. To begin with, a mean value theorem and an implicit function theorem are exploited to transform the systems into an affine form. Afterwards, a state observer is developed to estimate the unknown state variables and an extreme learning machine (ELM) is used to approximate the unknown functions. The output of the command filter replaces the virtual control signal&#39;derivative, thereby circumventing the problem of ‘explosion of complexity’. Meanwhile, compensation signals are introduced to eliminate the filtering errors in a dynamic surface control (DSC). A Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional is designed to mitigate the unknown constant state time delay. During the controller design process, combining a prescribed performance control (PPC) with a command filter control, the tracking error can converge to a predetermined bound. Additionally, the effect of input saturation is eliminated with the aid of an auxiliary system. Finally, the effectiveness of such controller is further proved by taking an electromechanical system as an application object.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel approach to the design of a discrete-time Fractional-Order Sliding Mode Control (FSMC) system for Single Input Single Output (SISO) applications, utilising the Autoregressive with exogenous input (ARX) method for system modelling. The proposed methodology emphasises the Prescribed Performance Control (PPC) to ensure minimal tracking errors through a transformation of tracking errors based on a specified performance function. A Fractional-Order Quasi-Sliding Mode Control (FQSMC) is subsequently developed to maintain the tracking error within predetermined bounds, effectively addressing the chattering phenomenon commonly associated with the traditional sliding mode control. The integration of fractional calculus enhances the smoothness of the output while ensuring accurate tracking, making it ideal for real-world applications. Additionally, a novel Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) observer is introduced to bolster the system&#39;s resilience against uncertainties and disturbances without complicating the computational process. The effectiveness of the proposed Prescribed Performance Fractional-Order Quasi-Sliding Mode Control (PP-FQSMC) is validated through extensive MATLAB simulations and experimental studies conducted on a Tank system. Results demonstrate that the PP-FQSMC significantly outperforms traditional methods, with maximum tracking errors of 1.6 × 10 −4 compared to 0.2 for the PP-QSMC and a Root Mean Square Tracking Error (RMSTE) of 1.3 × 10 −3 compared to 1.2 × 10 −4 for the PP-QSMC, ensuring strong tracking performance and stability. The findings indicate that the proposed controller effectively mitigates chattering in control signals while maintaining a smooth output. It showcases its potential for practical applications in environments characterised by model inaccuracies, time delays, and external disturbances.},

This sliding mode function contains two equilibrium points. When the states of the closed-loop system are on the sliding mode surface, they converge to the equilibrium point near the initial states. Based on this sliding mode function, an adaptive attitude stabilising control law with tuning parameters is designed to compensate the external disturbances and inertia uncertainty. The presented control law guarantees that the settling time of the closed-loop system and the bounds of the system states can be explicitly determined in advance by adjusting parameters of the sliding mode function and the control law. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented control law.

Specially, the proposed STD-ETESO incorporates a finite-time switching strategy, which improves the poor transient performance of the STD acting as a pre-filter to prepare relatively smooth signals for the ESO. The locally asymptotic boundedness of the estimation error can be guaranteed by the Input-state-stability (ISS) and existing research for the STD. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by a general example and a practical motion control system. Different integral criteria is introduced to evaluate the overall tracking accuracy and energy usage for comparison with existing different ESOs, which reveals the superiority of the proposed STD-ETESO in noise attenuation and disturbance rejection.},

  abstract     = {This article emphasises the adaptive quantised fault-tolerant output feedback control problem for one type of nonstrict-feedback nonlinear systems suffering from input and output quantisation as well as actuator and sensor faults. By introducing a bounded time-varying function (BTVF), a generalised intermediate-variable estimator (IVE) is designed to estimate actuator bias fault. For the scaling measurement sensor fault, by applying a projection operator containing the measured output quantised signal, a novel gain-compensated state observer is constructed. In addition, relying on fuzzy logic system (FLS) and intelligent adaptive algorithm, a fuzzy fault-tolerant controller is devised to handle dual faults and quantisation. After theoretical proof, the presented control framework can realise that the closed-loop system is semi-globally uniform ultimately bounded (SGUUB), while the tracking error is within an adjustable area. Lastly, the validity and superiority of the suggested scheme is confirmed by a relevant simulation example.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the event-driven intelligent fault-tolerant containment control problem for nonlinear multiagent systems affected by unknown disturbances, and conducts a comprehensive analysis of the dynamic stability of the system. Reduced-order modelling is employed for system modelling and identification, while radial basis function neural networks are utilised to estimate the nonlinear functions of the system model. An event-driven control scheme is designed based on the backstepping method and Lyapunov functional approach. In contrast to existing consensus control schemes, the proposed event-driven control schemes are specifically tailored to improve the energy efficiency and endurance of nonlinear multiagent systems operating in complex environments. Under the proposed control law, the output of each follower is converge to the convex hull spanned by the outputs of the leaders. The effectiveness of the proposed method is rigorously validated through numerical simulations. Furthermore, a practical example involving the design of a marine surface vehicle using advanced robotics technology is presented to further substantiate the efficacy of the proposed method.},
