  abstract     = {Nowadays, the prediction of student performance is still complicated to analyze the talent of individuals and the effort to improve their academic performance. Moreover, the researchers are performed to analyze the outcomes of student performance but the educational database consists of a huge data volume, which is hard to train the small sample. In this research work, a new hybrid deep learning model with optimized entropy rough set theory is developed to predict the student’s performance accurately. The preprocessing phase is performed with outlier removal and the data-filling method. The features are mined from the preprocessed data by Entropy weighted Rough set-based feature mining. A novel meta-heuristic hybrid Galactic Rider Swarm Optimization (GRSO) algorithm is developed for feature mining. A hybrid deep learning-based Convolutional Recurrent Network (CRN) is implemented for prediction, where the classification performance is improved by the GRSO algorithm. Here, the hyperparameters of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) are optimized by the GRSO algorithm. Here, the sensitivity and accuracy rate of the recommended GRSO-CRN method attain 94% and 93%. The simulation outcome of the proposed GRSO-CRN model achieves enriched performance.},

The fuzzy net present value method was used to determine the strategic importance of the SWOT matrix. Taking into account the theoretical foundation of the cooperative games, the fuzzy Shapley value was used to determine the optimal combination of SWOT matrix strategies to effectively overcome the ambiguities and uncertainty of real-world conditions. In the game, any type of strategy (WT, WO, ST, and SO) was considered as a player who had partial freedom to make some choices.

MPA integrating U-shape slots are renowned for including comparatively larger bandwidth impedance (around 30%). This article aims to develop an optimized U-slot MPA design, where the antenna measurements such as patch height or board thickness, patch length, patch width, and feed diameter are optimally tuned by a new hybrid optimization model. As the concepts of Dingo Optimization and Black Widow Optimization are combined, the adopted algorithm is called Black Widow in Dingo Model with Logistic Chaotic Map.

  abstract     = {Watermarking is a technique for protecting multimedia data, mainly images, from malicious attacks by adding a signature into these images. Traditional watermarking techniques, unfortunately, have drawbacks when used on sensitive images like those used in medicine. A reliable and blind watermarking method is suggested in this work to protect medical picture transferred in telemedicine. Medical picture marking enables accurate patient identification, prevents scan confusion, and minimizes the risk of diagnostic mistakes that could have negative consequences. In this method, three distinct transforms are used to acquire the frequency content of the image. The low frequency subbands are subsequently subjected to Schur decomposition. In order to incorporate the watermark bits, the resultant upper triangular matrix values are modified. The proposed approaches effectively retain a considerable quality of watermarked images and are impressively resistant against numerous conventional attacks, according to imperceptibility and robustness experimental results. The average Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) which was obtained was 44.90 dB, demonstrating that the integration procedure produces very low distortion to the original image. The observed results for robustness demonstrate that the watermark is resilient to the most of the attacks performed in watermarking, with a normalized cross correlation rate higher than 0.9.},

This article studies a distributed heterogeneous hybrid flow shop scheduling problem with a mixed-model assembly line (DHHFSP-MMAL), which consists of manufacturing and assembly stages. The DHHFSP-MMAL is modelled by a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model. Three constructive heuristics and a parallel deep adaptive large neighbourhood search (PDALNS) problem are presented. A constructive heuristic with a group strategy is employed to obtain an initial solution. Several deep destroy-and-repair operators are proposed where problem-specific greedy local search methods are applied. The PDALNS assigns weights to destroy-and-repair operators to guide the selection of operators. The parallel computing technique is introduced to increase the efficiency of training. The experiments demonstrate that the PDALNS algorithm is an efficient and effective algorithm for solving the DHHFSP-MMAL problem.},

Specifically, the Dynamic Aggregate Efficient Global Optimization (DA-EGO) algorithm decomposes the original high-dimensional design space into low-dimensional subspaces for efficient surrogate-based optimization search, and the optimal solutions of subspaces are combined as an elite-point for the global search. Most importantly, the subspace variables are updated in each iteration, according to the variable interaction analyses in the sub- and full-spaces. The perturbation method and the analysis of variance are used to detect variable interactions. After being validated on 21 benchmark functions ranging from 30 to 90 dimensions, the DA-EGO is used for the optimization of a transonic compressor rotor with 28 variables and a multi-stage compressor optimization with 60 variables. With the above, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is well demonstrated.},

In the competitive strategy, krill individuals with poor fitness are replaced with robust ‘competitive krill’ to accelerate global convergence. Then, the experimental results from CEC2017 benchmark functions demonstrate that, compared with other algorithms, CCKH shows superiority in most cases. Finally, six structural optimizations are used to evaluate the robustness of CCKH compared with other techniques. It is found that as the complexity of the structure increases, the competitiveness of CCKH becomes more pronounced, and the time complexity of the presented method is not affected by the two strategies.},

It is based on the idea of adaptive surrogate model-based optimization substituting the tolerance analysis subroutine with a surrogate model, which is iteratively re-modelled with intermediate optimization results to improve its accuracy continuously in potential optima regions.

  abstract     = {Shape optimization is important for improving the performance of mechanical components. In the past, gradient based optimization methods using the elegant adjoint formalism dominated the field. Gradient descent optimization, however, tends to get stuck in local minima if the optimization problem is non-convex. In this article, an improved approach to shape optimization is proposed that is capable of overcoming local minima. It is motivated by gradient based training methods in machine learning, which involve momentum. Here, the momentum method is derived from the formalism of dissipative Hamiltonian flows, which generalize gradient flows. While gradient descent can be seen as an Euler scheme discretization of the gradient flow, a symplectic Euler scheme is proposed in this article to discretize the Hamiltonian dynamics for the momentum method. To show the efficiency of the method, it is applied to a shape optimization problem involving ceramic components, with reliability, volume and avoidance of construction space constraints as target functions. Construction space constraints lead to manifestly non-convex shape optimization problems. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method solves these non-convex problems more efficiently than the traditional gradient descent approach.},

  abstract     = {Battery packs are vital components for storing and releasing energy. However, during driving, the intensity of heat emission and mechanical performance of electric vehicles are interrelated but conflicting indicators. To address this problem, this study topologically optimizes the power pack support structure with multiple objectives of minimizing compliance and heat dissipation, aiming to achieve a comprehensive and integrated design scheme. A floating projection topology optimization (FPTO) method is proposed, which normalizes the objectives of structural compliance and heat dissipation and derives the sensitivity. FPTO demonstrates superior objective function values and smoother topology configuration compared to the solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) method. Finally, the proposed method is applied to the power pack support structure. The results demonstrate that the method obtains a design solution with excellent mechanical performance and high heat dissipation performance with a suitable trade-off. The lightweight design of the overall structure of the battery pack is achieved.},

  abstract     = {Group technology is a managerial strategy used to optimize production by reducing setup times, lead times, and work-in-process inventories. Research on flow-shop sequence-dependent group scheduling problems (FSDGSPs) has primarily focused on minimizing makespan and total flow time to improve efficiency. However, the need for energy-efficient scheduling in FSDGSPs remains underexplored despite increasing sustainability concerns. To address this, the energy-efficient flow-shop sequence-dependent group scheduling problem (EEFSDGSP) is introduced. A novel multi-objective optimization (MOO) technique, the artificial neural network-based multi-objective genetic algorithm (ANN-MOGA), is proposed to minimize makespan and energy consumption in EEFSDGSP. ANN-MOGA advances MOO by using a neural network to evaluate fitness and guide selection, reducing computational complexity versus traditional methods like NSGA-II and SPEA2. A post-processing step (PPANNS) further enhances solution diversity and distribution. Results show ANN-MOGA, especially with PPANNS, outperforms NSGA-II and competes effectively with SPEA2 in larger problem instances.},

The proposed method has two main features. First, the number of nonlinear terms in the stability conditions is independent of the number of switched system modes. The result is that the computational cost is reduced, and it can be applied to switched systems with a large number of subsystems. Second, using switched Lyapunov functions, hybrid switching laws are designed to preserve the practical stability property in both the closed-loop state-dependent switching function and the open-loop time-dependent one. As a result, when the state data is lost during sensor or communication failures, the controller can change the control scheme from a closed-loop state-dependent switching function to an open-loop time-dependent one without loss of stability property. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the validity and efficiency of the proposed method.},

Since the dead-zone phenomenon is frequently encountered in the control of nonlinear strict feedback system, it is very necessary to consider the effect of dead-zone in the OB control. However, the published OB control methods are to rarely deal with the dead-zone problem because of the complex algorithm of reinforcement learning (RL). In this OB control, the dead-zone problem is effectively solved by utilising a simplified RL algorithm. For effective eliminating the effect of dead-zone, an adaptive compensation of dead-zone function&#39;s remainder is added to this RL. Since the RL under identifier-critic-actor architecture is implemented in every backstepping step, the requirement of complete dynamic acknowledge is released.

The linear part is designed to solve the main regulation problem, while the nonlinear part is designed to enhance the performance of the closed-loop system in the face of input saturation. The delay-range dependent stability conditions of the closed-loop system are analysed using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii (LK) approach, which involves solving an LMI problem to determine the parameters of the proposed controller. Furthermore, the admissibility of the closed-loop system is assessed to ensure the system’s stability, regularity, and causality.

Specifically, we add a kind of nonnegative impulses which is consistent with the switching behaviours for the systems. We first study switched homogeneous positive nonlinear systems (SHPNS) case, then we extend the SHPNS to a time-varying SHNS case. The primary difficulty of this research is the estimation of Lyapunov function value at switching-impulse points under the coupling effects of synchronous switches and state jumps. By employing the max-separable Lyapunov function approach, we present new sufficient stability criteria and design new switching-impulse signals, and successfully establish the new relation between the average dwell time parameter and impulse strength. Then, we apply the obtained results to the time-varying vehicle formation model with impulses.

In contrast to traditional DOBC, the proposed approach employs RBFNN technology to approximate unknown nonlinear functions in the system, instead of treating them as part of lumped disturbances. A novel disturbance observer is developed to estimate disturbances characterised by a nonlinear exogenous system. To enhance control performance, a PPF that characterises both transient and steady-state behaviour is used for the transformation of tracking errors. It can be proved that all the states of the closed-loop system can be guaranteed to be uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB), and that the tracking error evolves within the prespecified boundaries.

For a fixed integer n , we propose an adaptive update law (a differential equation in time) driven by real-time input-output data for estimating the first n + 1 coefficients in the numerator and the denominator of the transfer function. We show that the estimates for the transfer function coefficients generated by the update law are close to the true values at large times provided n is sufficiently large (the estimates converge to the true values as time and n tend to infinity). The unknown parameter can be reconstructed using the transfer function coefficient estimates obtained with n large and the algebraic expressions relating the transfer function coefficients to the unknown parameter. We also provide a numerical scheme for verifying the identifiability conditions and for choosing n sufficiently large so that the value of the reconstructed parameter is close to the true value. The class of systems to which our approach is applicable includes many partial differential equations with constant/spatially-varying coefficients and distributed/boundary input and output. We illustrate the efficacy of our approach using three examples: a delay system with four unknown scalars, a 1D heat equation with two unknown scalars and a 1D wave equation with an unknown linearly-varying (in space) coefficient.},

For this new class of control problems, we establish and characterise Wolfe, Mond-Weir and mixed type robust dual models.

  abstract     = {Extensive research has been conducted in dynamic mathematical problems and real-time industrial control applications, leading to the emergence of zeroing neural dynamics (ZND) as a significant approach. This approach is guided by the fluctuating tendency of state errors, and a link is established between the stability of the zero solution in the neurodynamic system and the convergence of neuron states in a zeroing neural network. Over the last two decades, considerable efforts have been made by numerous scholars to advance the development of ZND, resulting in the formation of a series of ZND models for various mathematical issues and real-world applications. In this paper, the advances in ZND are synthesised from three aspects: models, theories, and applications. Specifically, ZND models are categorised into two main frameworks based on their structures and further classified into different types depending on the dynamics of the specific models under each framework. The two main frameworks identified are the foundational ZND framework and the integral ZND framework. The former serves as the basic structure for exponential type ZND, finite-time type ZND, fixed-time type ZND, and predefined-time type ZND, while the latter is extended with the single-integral type ZND and the double-integral type ZND. Furthermore, the primary analytical methods for the dynamics of each type of ZND are summarised, and the current applications of ZND, including robot manipulator control, multi-agent consistency, dynamic positioning, chaos synchronisation, and image processing, are introduced. Through this survey, a comprehensive understanding of the development history of ZND research, the current research focuses and challenges in ZND models, theories, and applications, as well as future directions and key breakthroughs in ZND research, will be provided to readers.},

Then, by viewing the output of observer as the reference signal, a distributed resilient controller is designed for each follower to address the reference-tracking problem. By introducing a smooth function with positive integrable time-varying function, novel adaptive laws are developed and incorporated with the controller design to effectively compensate for the unknown time-varying parameters. By utilising Lyapunov stability theory, the asymptotic convergence of output regulation error can be ensured.

To address this issue, this work proposes a controller design based on a balanced truncated model that effectively contains the dominant dynamics of the single link flexible manipulator system, which substantially reduces the computational cost of controller implementation while also simplifying the design process. Further, the work also proposes a strategy to design a robust functional observer-based output feedback sliding mode controller for position control of the single link flexible manipulator.

The main work is as follows: First, a DAETM is considered to allocate network resources properly and resist data injection attacks. Then, a data buffer is adopted to consolidate data from decentralised channels for ensuring timely utilisation. In addition, a controller gain condition is presented to achieve the bumpless switching between subsystems. Moreover, by adopting piecewise Lyapunov function method, sufficient conditions are obtained for triggered switched systems to be exponentially stable and anti-bump under injection attacks.

  abstract     = {Dissipativity is a significant concern for 2-D switched systems, but existing research often overlooks the transient dynamics occurring within a finite region. This paper aims to address finite-region dissipativity and dissipative control for a class of Fornasini-Marchesini local state-space (FMLSS) type 2-D switched systems. The analysis employs the mode-dependent average dwell time approach. Firstly, the concept of dissipativity on finite-region for 2-D switched systems is introduced. Then, a sufficient condition under which the considered systems can demonstrate the finite-region boundedness with the external disturbances is established by the special recursive formulas. Additionally, a sufficient condition for finite-region dissipativity of the considered systems is provided. Furthermore, the dissipative state feedback controller is derived to ensure the finite-region dissipativity of the closed-loop systems. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller design approach, an example is presented.},

First, based on the fractional-order monotonicity theorem and the definition of conformable fractional-order derivative, novel conformable fractional-order Halanay inequalities are developed that extend and improve the existing ones. Second, using the obtained Halanay inequalities and the estimate of conformable fractional-order exponential functions, globally exponential stability conditions that depend on the infimum and supremum of impulsive step sizes are proposed for the systems. Third, more relaxing stability conditions are presented that do not depend on the infimum and supremum of impulsive step sizes, which means that the conditions on impulses are weaker than those commonly used in the existing literature.

In order to combat signal fading from sensors to controllers and improve communication reliability, spatial diversity is achieved through cooperative terminal relay signals. At each transmission instant, the terminal only selects a better signal for transmission and a switched system is constructed. The aim of this paper is to design a set of desired dynamic output feedback controllers in the framework of RMPC such that the switched system with the underlying DFCP is exponentially stable. By taking the influence of the randomness of DFCP derived from a three nodes model composed of DF relay, a new objective function based on the mathematical expectation of the traditional quadratic function of MPC is established. Then, the orthogonal complement technique is applied to handle the inherent couplings of variables to formulate a solvable optimisation problem. Moreover, the sufficient conditions are provided to guarantee the recursive feasibility of the MPC strategy and the stability of the established closed-loop system in terms of the average dwell time (ADT) method. Finally, three experiments are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with the robust model predictive control (RMPC) problem for a class of systems with polytopic uncertainties and persistent bounded disturbances in the long-distance transmission environment. The signal transmitted over a long distance is very likely to be destroyed by the channel fading. To address this issue, an amplify-and-forward cooperation protocol (AFCP) is adopted in the forward channel, i.e. from sensor nodes to the remote controller node, to improve the transmission quality. Considering the difficulty of obtaining the system state in practice, the dynamic output feedback control in the framework of RMPC is put forward. With respect to the parameter uncertainty, persistent bounded disturbances, and randomness of the transmission power stored in sensors and the AF relay, the objective function is defined by the mathematical expectation of a quadratic function over the infinite time horizon. Then, based on this establishment, a ‘min–max’ optimisation problem is readily formulated. Furthermore, the singular value decomposition technique is utilised to mitigate the non-convexity and formulate an auxiliary optimisation problem with the solvability, meanwhile, the sufficient criterion for the mean-square input-to-state stability of the underlying system is obtained. Finally, two simulation examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Through comprehensive numerical experiments, we illustrate the effectiveness of our observer in two distinct scenarios. Firstly, we demonstrate its application in synchronising a 4-component chaotic dynamical system. Secondly, we showcase its utility in tracking a reduced 2-component chemical engineering process. Our simulation results reveal that the proposed observer outperforms existing methods by achieving quicker convergence and higher estimation accuracy.

With this formula, we present a precise counterpart to compute the credibilistic mean, semivariance, and skewness of coherent trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. Leveraging these analytical formulations, we construct a novel tri-objective portfolio selection problem, integrating credibilistic mean, semivariance, and skewness as objectives, along with some practical constraints. When used with the returns of the portfolio as a whole, the derived analytical expressions help to overcome the otherwise computationally expensive approach involving the simulation of results using individual assets&#39; returns. The proposed model is solved by adapting an efficient multiobjective genetic algorithm. The algorithm has been specifically designed to solve portfolio selection models of this type. The efficiency of the proposed model is then demonstrated by taking a real-world scenario of financial stock market datasets from the NSE India. Based on the results of this study, it appears that the proposed novel tri-objective portfolio selection model produces promising results compared to the baseline model and the NIFTY 50 Index considered as a benchmark.},

Then, based on the recovered information, the predefined-time local controller is designed for each follower agent by utilising the predefined-time backstepping control approach. Moreover, the neural network (NN) is incorporated to identify the lumped unknown item. Particularly, an indirect learning mechanism is adopted to determine the upper bound of the optimal NN weight. In this way, the computational cost of the presented controller is greatly degraded. Stability evaluation shows that the presented controller can guarantee the position and velocity synchronisation errors regulate to the minor regions around zero in predefined time.

By leveraging projection error system analysis alongside output observation and sliding mode control, a meticulously crafted derivative-based sliding mode surface along with a sliding mode controller are devised, ensuring both convergence and seamless sliding motion. Afterwards, the accessibility of the surface is assessed through relevant lemmas, Caputo derivative characteristics and the Lyapunov direct approach. The subsequent stability of sliding path is corroborated, and indispensable prerequisites for achieving finite-time projective synchronisation are outlined. Furthermore, the establishment of an upper bound for synchronisation time of distinct Caputo fractional-order delayed neural networks (CFDNNs) with inconsistent orders is carried out. Ultimately, simulations on distinct CFDNNs with consistent and inconsistent orders are conducted to exemplify our approach, employing the continuous frequency distribution model.},

For the torsional vibration subsystem, a new robust state feedback controller is constructed via a backstepping technique to ensure the vibration angle of the motor rotor within given constraints via a proper asymmetric barrier function. The overall coupling vibration system is proved to be stable in the sense of uniform ultimate boundedness, and the vibration amplitude of the rolling mill can be reached arbitrarily small by selecting appropriate controller parameters.

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with the tracking control problem of nonlinear time delay systems. For time delay systems, we consider nonaffine pure-feedback structure. Additionally, the case where the time delay systems are subject to input saturation and unknown states is also taken into account. To begin with, a mean value theorem and an implicit function theorem are exploited to transform the systems into an affine form. Afterwards, a state observer is developed to estimate the unknown state variables and an extreme learning machine (ELM) is used to approximate the unknown functions. The output of the command filter replaces the virtual control signal&#39;derivative, thereby circumventing the problem of ‘explosion of complexity’. Meanwhile, compensation signals are introduced to eliminate the filtering errors in a dynamic surface control (DSC). A Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional is designed to mitigate the unknown constant state time delay. During the controller design process, combining a prescribed performance control (PPC) with a command filter control, the tracking error can converge to a predetermined bound. Additionally, the effect of input saturation is eliminated with the aid of an auxiliary system. Finally, the effectiveness of such controller is further proved by taking an electromechanical system as an application object.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel approach to the design of a discrete-time Fractional-Order Sliding Mode Control (FSMC) system for Single Input Single Output (SISO) applications, utilising the Autoregressive with exogenous input (ARX) method for system modelling. The proposed methodology emphasises the Prescribed Performance Control (PPC) to ensure minimal tracking errors through a transformation of tracking errors based on a specified performance function. A Fractional-Order Quasi-Sliding Mode Control (FQSMC) is subsequently developed to maintain the tracking error within predetermined bounds, effectively addressing the chattering phenomenon commonly associated with the traditional sliding mode control. The integration of fractional calculus enhances the smoothness of the output while ensuring accurate tracking, making it ideal for real-world applications. Additionally, a novel Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) observer is introduced to bolster the system&#39;s resilience against uncertainties and disturbances without complicating the computational process. The effectiveness of the proposed Prescribed Performance Fractional-Order Quasi-Sliding Mode Control (PP-FQSMC) is validated through extensive MATLAB simulations and experimental studies conducted on a Tank system. Results demonstrate that the PP-FQSMC significantly outperforms traditional methods, with maximum tracking errors of 1.6 × 10 −4 compared to 0.2 for the PP-QSMC and a Root Mean Square Tracking Error (RMSTE) of 1.3 × 10 −3 compared to 1.2 × 10 −4 for the PP-QSMC, ensuring strong tracking performance and stability. The findings indicate that the proposed controller effectively mitigates chattering in control signals while maintaining a smooth output. It showcases its potential for practical applications in environments characterised by model inaccuracies, time delays, and external disturbances.},

To guarantee predefined-time convergence and unwinding-free performance of the closed-loop system, a predefined-time sliding mode function with adjustable parameters is proposed. This sliding mode function contains two equilibrium points. When the states of the closed-loop system are on the sliding mode surface, they converge to the equilibrium point near the initial states. Based on this sliding mode function, an adaptive attitude stabilising control law with tuning parameters is designed to compensate the external disturbances and inertia uncertainty. The presented control law guarantees that the settling time of the closed-loop system and the bounds of the system states can be explicitly determined in advance by adjusting parameters of the sliding mode function and the control law. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented control law. The simulation results illustrate that the predefined-time convergence and unwinding-free property of the closed-loop system are guaranteed by adopting the presented control law.},

A special combination of super twisting differentiator (STD) and event-triggered ESO is devised with a designed event-triggered mechanism. Specially, the proposed STD-ETESO incorporates a finite-time switching strategy, which improves the poor transient performance of the STD acting as a pre-filter to prepare relatively smooth signals for the ESO. The locally asymptotic boundedness of the estimation error can be guaranteed by the Input-state-stability (ISS) and existing research for the STD. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by a general example and a practical motion control system. Different integral criteria is introduced to evaluate the overall tracking accuracy and energy usage for comparison with existing different ESOs, which reveals the superiority of the proposed STD-ETESO in noise attenuation and disturbance rejection.},

Despite their promise, ML algorithms may fail to accurately ascertain heterogeneous treatment effects under practical settings with many covariates and small sample size. In addition, the quantification of estimation uncertainty remains a challenge. We develop a general approach to statistical inference for heterogeneous treatment effects discovered by a generic ML algorithm. We apply the Neyman’s repeated sampling framework to a common setting, in which researchers use an ML algorithm to estimate the conditional average treatment effect and then divide the sample into several groups based on the magnitude of the estimated effects. We show how to estimate the average treatment effect within each of these groups, and construct a valid confidence interval. In addition, we develop nonparametric tests of treatment effect homogeneity across groups, and rank-consistency of within-group average treatment effects. The validity of our methodology does not rely on the properties of ML algorithms because it is solely based on the randomization of treatment assignment and random sampling of units. Finally, we generalize our methodology to the cross-fitting procedure by accounting for the additional uncertainty induced by the random splitting of data.},

The results indicate that narrative-based forecasts are more accurate than the benchmarks, especially during recession periods. Narrative-based forecasts perform better in long-run forecasting and provide incremental predictive information even after controlling macroeconomic big data. In particular, information about inflation expectations and prices of specific goods embedded in narratives contributes to their predictive power. Overall, we provide a novel representation of economic narratives and document the important role of economic narratives in inflation forecasting.},

We recover the joint distribution of choice sets and preferences from a cross-section of repeated choices. We assume that either the latent choice sets are sparse or that the number of repeated choices is sufficiently large. Sparsity requires the number of possible choice sets to be relatively small. It is satisfied, for instance, when the choice sets are nested or when they form a partition. Our estimation procedure is computationally fast and uses mixed-integer programming to recover the sparse support of choice sets. Analyzing the ready-to-eat cereal industry using a household scanner dataset, we find that ignoring the unobservability of choice sets can lead to incorrect estimates of preferences.},

Given two probability distributions P (null) and Q (alternative), we study the problem of detecting weak distribution shift deviating from the null P toward the alternative Q , where the level of deviation vanishes as a function of n , the sample size. We propose a model for weak distribution shifts via displacement interpolation between P and Q , drawing from the optimal transport theory. We study a hypothesis testing procedure based on the Wasserstein distance, derive sharp conditions under which detection is possible, and provide the exact characterization of the asymptotic Type I and Type II errors at the detection boundary using empirical processes. We demonstrate how the proposed testing procedure works in modeling and detecting weak distribution shifts in real datasets using two empirical examples: distribution shifts in consumer spending after COVID-19, and heterogeneity in the published p -values of statistical tests in journals across different disciplines.},

In this article we study the finite sample and asymptotic properties of various weighting estimators of the local average treatment effect (LATE), motivated by Abadie’s kappa theorem and offering the requisite flexibility relative to standard practice. We argue that two of the estimators under consideration, which are weight normalized, are generally preferable. Several other estimators, which are unnormalized, do not satisfy the properties of scale invariance with respect to the natural logarithm and translation invariance, thereby exhibiting sensitivity to the units of measurement when estimating the LATE in logs and the centering of the outcome variable more generally. We also demonstrate that, when noncompliance is one sided, certain weighting estimators have the advantage of being based on a denominator that is strictly greater than zero by construction. This is the case for only one of the two normalized estimators, and we recommend this estimator for wider use. We illustrate our findings with a simulation study and three empirical applications, which clearly document the sensitivity of unnormalized estimators to how the outcome variable is coded. We implement the proposed estimators in the Stata package kappalate .},

To account for effects from dominant (popular) units, the spatial weights matrix in our model can allow for unbounded column sums. To account for heterogeneity, our model includes two-way fixed effects and heteroscedastic errors. We further consider the potential endogeneity of the spatial weight matrix constructed from socioeconomic distance. We investigate the quasi-maximum likelihood estimator (QMLE), generalized methods of moments estimator (GMME), and root estimator (RTE), and establish their consistency and asymptotic normality based on the near epoch dependence (NED) framework. The RTE can derive a relatively computationally simple and closed-form solution without evaluating the QMLE’s Jacobian matrix as well as the iterations by GMME. We consider both n , T → ∞ , and the strength of the dominant units is equal to 1 when T → ∞ . For the purpose of empirical analysis, we derive the marginal effects and their limiting distributions based on the proposed estimators. In an empirical application, we apply our model to China’s prefecture city-level data, revealing significant spillover effects of the tertiary industry share. These findings suggest that the development of the tertiary sector in large cities can foster its growth in small cities.},

However, quantifying the magnitude of this dependence remains difficult. This article extends Infinitesimal Perturbation Analysis, widely used in classical simulation, to compute asymptotically unbiased and consistent sensitivities of posterior statistics with respect to prior parameters from Markov chain Monte Carlo inference via Gibbs sampling. The method demonstrates the possibility of efficiently computing the complete set of prior sensitivities for a wide range of posterior statistics, alongside the estimation algorithm using Automatic Differentiation. The method’s application is exemplified in Bayesian Vector Autoregression analysis of fiscal policy in U.S. macroeconomic time series data. The analysis assesses the sensitivities of posterior estimates, including the Impulse response functions and Forecast error variance decompositions, to prior parameters under common Minnesota shrinkage priors. The findings illuminate the significant and intricate influence of prior specification on the posterior distribution. This effect is particularly notable in crucial posterior statistics, such as the substantial absolute eigenvalue of the companion matrix, ultimately shaping the structural analysis.},

In this article, we propose a novel reduced-rank spatio-temporal model by assuming the coefficient matrices follow a reduced-rank structure. This specification avoids construction of the weights matrices and provides a good interpretation, especially for financial data. To estimate the unknown parameters, a quasi-maximum likelihood estimator (QMLE) is proposed and obtained via the Gradient descent algorithm with Armijo line search. We establish the asymptotic properties of QMLE when the number of units and the number of time periods both diverge to infinity. To determine the rank, we propose a ridge-type ratio estimator and demonstrate its rank selection consistency. The proposed methodology is illustrated via extensive simulation studies.

We then examine the asymptotic behavior of the proposed estimator in a time series framework and suggest a blockwise bootstrap method for inference. Applying this method, we investigate the effectiveness of U.S. macroprudential actions on bank credit growth from 1948 to 2019. Empirically, we find that the effects of macroprudential policy on credit growth are asymmetric and depend on the quantiles of credit growth. The tightening of macroprudential actions fails to rein in high credit growth, whereas easing policies do not effectively stimulate bank credit growth during low-growth periods. These findings suggest that U.S. macroprudential policies might not sufficiently address the challenges of soaring bank credit or ensure overarching financial stability.},

  abstract     = {We develop a nonparametric multivariate time series model that remains agnostic on the precise relationship between a (possibly) large set of macroeconomic time series and their lagged values. The main building block of our model is a Gaussian process prior on the functional relationship that determines the conditional mean of the model, hence, the name of Gaussian process vector autoregression (GP-VAR). A flexible stochastic volatility specification is used to provide additional flexibility and control for heteroscedasticity. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation is carried out through an efficient and scalable algorithm which can handle large models. The GP-VAR is used to analyze the effects of macroeconomic uncertainty, with a particular emphasis on time variation and asymmetries in the transmission mechanisms.},

The GD processes possess desirable properties and features: (i) it can produce any desirable invariant distribution with support on R + , (ii) it is time-reversible, and (iii) it has the transition density function given in an explicit form. Estimation of parameters is performed through the maximum likelihood method combined with a Gauss Laguerre quadrature to approximate the likelihood function. The evaluation of the estimators and also confidence intervals of parameters are explored via Monte Carlo simulation studies. Two generalizations of the GD processes are also proposed to handle nonstationary and long-memory time series. We apply the proposed methodologies to analyze the daily realized volatility of the FTSE 100 equity index.},

Our machinery therefore overcomes the well-known drawbacks that individually identified shocks (i) tend to be correlated to each other or (ii) can be separated under orthogonalizations with weak economic ground. We show that identification corresponds to solving a nontrivial optimization problem. We provide conditions for non-emptiness of solutions and point-identification, and Bayesian algorithms for estimation and inference. We use the approach to study the effects of uncertainty and financial shocks, allowing for the possibility that the former responds contemporaneously to other shocks, distinguishing macroeconomic from financial uncertainty and credit supply shocks. Using U.S. data we find that financial uncertainty mimics a demand shock, while the interpretation of macro uncertainty is more mixed. Furthermore, variation in uncertainty partially represents the endogenous response of uncertainty to other shocks.},

Yet, while they can acquire sign language (SL) to communicate with the dumb and the deaf, untrained persons are unable to speak with them. For such individuals, an SL to text system is more beneficial in enabling them to communicate more effectively with everyday people. To interact with the deaf and dumb, SL is a tactile gesture that employs the hands and eyes. This proposes a new model for translating SL video to text conversion or generation. Frame Conversion is the initial step, where the given input video is converted into frames. Subsequently, features considered are hierarchy of skeleton and Improved Motion estimation (ME). For generating the text, this work uses an optimised LSTM model, where training of weights is done by hybrid Combined Pelican and BES algorithm (CP-BES).

For debates among experts, in particular, it might be hard to discern (less) reliable information, as all actors by definition are qualified. In these cases, the use of trustworthiness metrics on sources is a useful proxy for establishing the truthfulness of contents. We introduce an algorithmic model for automatically generating a dynamic trustworthiness hierarchy among information sources based on several parameters, including fact-checking. The method is novel and significant, especially in two respects: first, the generated hierarchy represents a helpful tool for laypeople to navigate experts’ debates; second, it also allows to identify and overcome biases generated by intuitive rankings held by agents at the beginning of the debates.

  abstract     = {Deep drawing involves the use of a punch to plastically deform a workpiece to create sheet metal parts such as cups and channels. Upon release of the punch, the workpiece undergoes elastic recovery and results in a change in geometry known as the springback effect. The process is highly non-linear and involves many parameters, leading to large computation times to fully simulate the process or train a regression model on the high dimensionality of the data. In this paper, dimension-reduced neural networks (DR-NNs) for efficient springback prediction in the process of deep drawing a cylindrical cup are presented with consideration for different materials. The DR-NNs are trained on FEM data from a deep drawing simulation performed on ABAQUS/CAE. Features such as the workpiece’s initial coordinates, material properties, and thickness are introduced as inputs for the dimensionality reduction. Linear and non-linear dimensionality reduction methods reduce the input to a smaller set of principal components, which are fed as inputs to the neural networks for predicting the springback after punch release. The DR-NNs are compared against a deep neural network (DNN) and show improvements in lower computation time for training, prediction uncertainty, and less storage space required while retaining prediction accuracy.},

A fuzzy adaptive network as a hybrid AI system has already been used for CFD data machine learning. However, no investigation has been done for the ant colony optimisation (ACO) performance evaluation compared to the adaptive network. As a state-of-the-art method, the ACO and fuzzy system are combined and tuned to estimate the flow in a reactor. The liquid-phase velocity in the y-direction is predicted using a combination of fuzzy system and ACO in a large domain. The findings further indicate that, in addition to the CFD dataset and Navier-Stokes’s equations, employing an ant colony optimisation structure as a training technique may give an accurate approximation of two-phase flow. Furthermore, for numerical methods, a continuous link between input and output datasets may be a significant data source for the AI mechanism to train the physical process, incredibly bubbly flow. The ant colony optimisation shows a more accurate prediction than the adaptive network. As far as authors know, there are no such investigations to develop a new AI algorithm and performance analysis for fluid dynamics problems.},

Here, the ability to verify the accuracy of the outsourced data is present in the auditor, data owner, and IoT server. The setup, storage, and verification phase are the three stages that make up the data integrity model.

The high flexibility and diversity of current industrial production processes make monitoring technology for small batch processes even more important. In multivariate process monitoring, a broader applicability exists in multivariate coefficients of variation (MCV) based monitoring schemes due to the lower restriction of the process. In view of the effectiveness of MCV monitoring and with the aim to achieve further performance improvement of current MCV monitoring schemes in a finite horizon production, we additionally introduce two one-sided cumulative sum (CUSUM) MCV schemes. In the case of deterministic and random shifts, the design parameters of the proposed schemes are obtained via an optimization procedure designed by the Markov chain method and the corresponding performance is analysed based on different run length (RL) characteristics, including the mean and the standard deviation. Simulation comparisons with existing exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) MCV schemes show that the proposed CUSUM MCV schemes are more efficient in monitoring most of the shifts, including the deterministic and random shifts. Finally, to demonstrate the benefits of the new monitoring schemes, a comprehensive case study on monitoring a steel sleeve manufacturing process is conducted.},

In addition, Bayes estimates are explored based on a flexible Gamma-Dirichlet prior information. Furthermore, when there is a priori order information on competing risk parameters being available, traditional classical likelihood and Bayesian estimates are also established under restricted parameter case.

  abstract     = {The stock market index typically mirrors the financial market&#39;s performance. Hence, accurate prediction of stock market index trends is essential for investors aiming to mitigate financial risk and enhance future investment returns. Traditional statistical approaches often struggle with the non-linear nature of stock market index data, leading to potential inaccuracies in long-term predictions. To address this issue, we introduce the TCN-LSTM-SNN (TLSNN) model, a hybrid framework that integrates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) for robust feature extraction, within a highly efficient Spiking Neural Network (SNN) architecture. Additionally, we employ the Subtraction-Average-Based Optimizer (SABO) to refine the Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) technique, thereby separating the periodic and trend components of stock indices, reducing noise interference, and establishing a decomposition ensemble framework to bolster the model&#39;s resilience. The experimental results show that the VMD-TLSNN hybrid model suggested in this study surpasses other individual benchmark models and their hybrid models in prediction accuracy. Additionally, it demonstrates notably lower energy consumption compared to other hybrid models.},

Within this framework, the partial quantile regression components are approximated using a basis expansion approach. Consequently, we approximate the infinite-dimensional function-on-function linear quantile regression model using a multivariate quantile regression model constructed from these partial quantile regression components. To evaluate the efficacy of our proposed techniques, we conduct a series of Monte Carlo experiments and analyze an empirical dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods in finite-sample scenarios.

  abstract     = {There are many studies aimed at promoting positive lifestyle behaviors to reduce lifetime risk of cancer and related diseases. However, assessing these modifiable behaviors through statistical modeling is challenging because of the multidimensionality of interrelated measurements that may dramatically differ between at-risk individuals. Taking into account this heterogeneity while considering the multidimensionality of behavior changes is fundamental to tailoring interventions to their needs. Biomarkers that identify high-risk individuals may help validate proximal measures, but the number of validated methods that link biomarkers to multiple behavioral measurements by determining their dynamic relations with disease risks is limited to just a few, since it requires an advanced statistical methodology to address challenges in analyzing biomarker data, including left-censoring due to limits of detection. To address these challenges, we propose a method that constructs a quantile-specific weighted index of multiple behavioral measurements. Under the quantile regression framework, the proposed method renders a multidimensional view of risk-specific behavioral patterns by connecting them with biomarker levels to provide better insights into heterogeneous behavioral profiles among at-risk populations. We evaluate performances of the proposed method through simulations, and illustrate its applications to the Tu Salud ¡Sí Cuenta! data by examining behavior changes among Mexican-American adults.},

In the process of distribution of cold chain products, due to its perishable nature, it is not only necessary to consider the efficiency and economy of transportation, but also to pay attention to risk aversion factors. Therefore, the stochastic programming of cold chain logistics based on risk aversion has become an urgent problem to be solved. Aiming to minimize the economic cost and transform the carbon emission level of cold chain transportation into carbon emission cost, a distributionally robust mean-conditional value-at-risk optimization model for the perishable goods distribution management problem is established, in which the partial distribution information of uncertain demand and transportation environment temperature was known. Then a computationally tractable equivalence model is obtained under the box ambiguity set. For the proposed nonlinear model, a trust region sequential quadratic programming method with filter is proposed to solve it. Finally, through a case study, the relationship between the stochastic programming model and the distributionally robust model is analysed.},
