  abstract     = {A method of communication for the deaf and the dumb is sign language (SL). Knowing SL allows speakers and listeners to converse effectively with deaf and dumb people. Yet, while they can acquire sign language (SL) to communicate with the dumb and the deaf, untrained persons are unable to speak with them. For such individuals, an SL to text system is more beneficial in enabling them to communicate more effectively with everyday people. To interact with the deaf and dumb, SL is a tactile gesture that employs the hands and eyes. This proposes a new model for translating SL video to text conversion or generation. Frame Conversion is the initial step, where the given input video is converted into frames. Subsequently, features considered are hierarchy of skeleton and Improved Motion estimation (ME). For generating the text, this work uses an optimised LSTM model, where training of weights is done by hybrid Combined Pelican and BES algorithm (CP-BES). Moreover, the mean value for dataset ISL-CSLTR has achieved the proposed method is 27.3%, 31.6%, 28.7%, 33.4%, 29.8%, 24.5%, 36.2%, and 34.8% greater than the conventional schemes like CNN, FSU-CNN, ASL – CNN, RNN, LSTM +POA, LSTM +ARCHOA, LSTM +HGS, LSTM +PRO and LSTM +BES.},

  abstract     = {The algorithmic detection of disinformation online is currently based on two strategies: on the one hand, research focuses on automated fact-checking; on the other hand, models are being developed to assess the trustworthiness of information sources, including both empirical and theoretical research on credibility and content quality. For debates among experts, in particular, it might be hard to discern (less) reliable information, as all actors by definition are qualified. In these cases, the use of trustworthiness metrics on sources is a useful proxy for establishing the truthfulness of contents. We introduce an algorithmic model for automatically generating a dynamic trustworthiness hierarchy among information sources based on several parameters, including fact-checking. The method is novel and significant, especially in two respects: first, the generated hierarchy represents a helpful tool for laypeople to navigate experts’ debates; second, it also allows to identify and overcome biases generated by intuitive rankings held by agents at the beginning of the debates. We provide an experimental analysis of our algorithmic model applied to the debate on the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which took place among Italian medical specialists between 2020 and 2021.},

  abstract     = {Deep drawing involves the use of a punch to plastically deform a workpiece to create sheet metal parts such as cups and channels. Upon release of the punch, the workpiece undergoes elastic recovery and results in a change in geometry known as the springback effect. The process is highly non-linear and involves many parameters, leading to large computation times to fully simulate the process or train a regression model on the high dimensionality of the data. In this paper, dimension-reduced neural networks (DR-NNs) for efficient springback prediction in the process of deep drawing a cylindrical cup are presented with consideration for different materials. The DR-NNs are trained on FEM data from a deep drawing simulation performed on ABAQUS/CAE. Features such as the workpiece’s initial coordinates, material properties, and thickness are introduced as inputs for the dimensionality reduction. Linear and non-linear dimensionality reduction methods reduce the input to a smaller set of principal components, which are fed as inputs to the neural networks for predicting the springback after punch release. The DR-NNs are compared against a deep neural network (DNN) and show improvements in lower computation time for training, prediction uncertainty, and less storage space required while retaining prediction accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Computational data of a complex problem could be mapped and solved by artificial intelligence (AI) for postprocessing purposes and numerical time-saving. A fuzzy adaptive network as a hybrid AI system has already been used for CFD data machine learning. However, no investigation has been done for the ant colony optimisation (ACO) performance evaluation compared to the adaptive network. As a state-of-the-art method, the ACO and fuzzy system are combined and tuned to estimate the flow in a reactor. The liquid-phase velocity in the y-direction is predicted using a combination of fuzzy system and ACO in a large domain. The findings further indicate that, in addition to the CFD dataset and Navier-Stokes’s equations, employing an ant colony optimisation structure as a training technique may give an accurate approximation of two-phase flow. Furthermore, for numerical methods, a continuous link between input and output datasets may be a significant data source for the AI mechanism to train the physical process, incredibly bubbly flow. The ant colony optimisation shows a more accurate prediction than the adaptive network. As far as authors know, there are no such investigations to develop a new AI algorithm and performance analysis for fluid dynamics problems.},

  abstract     = {Hand gesture recognition is considered an essential task in various human-computer interaction (HCI) applications. Therefore, developing a robust system for hand gesture recognition is a challenge. This work proposed a new hybrid approach named hybrid deep recurrent neural network (RNN) incorporated with a chaos game optimisation (CGO) algorithm for efficiently recognising hand gestures. The main objective of a hybrid recurrent neural network with chaos game optimisation (RNN-CGO) is to achieve the recognition of alphabet signs from 2D gesture images. The different stages included in this technique are pre-processing, feature extraction, feature selection, and classification. The proposed approach is executed using American Sign Language (ASL) dataset with the help of the PYTHON platform. The precision, accuracy, f1-score, and recall obtained for the proposed approach are 99.28%, 99.96%, 99.25%, and 99.28%, respectively. The inference time required for the proposed approach is 0.121 s. The proposed technique has less computational complexity. The results showed that the proposed approach is better than the existing hand gesture recognition model approaches.},

  abstract     = {The development of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies allowed the rapid generation of massive amounts of data by people. Although moving data to a server is a useful solution for storage, the owner of the data loses control, which results in security lapses. An efficient method for cloud-based data models is data integrity. In order to protect data privacy in IoT healthcare, this paper develops a data integrity technique. The Data Owner, IoT server, Key Generator Center, and Auditor are the four entities that make up this model. Here, the ability to verify the accuracy of the outsourced data is present in the auditor, data owner, and IoT server. The setup, storage, and verification phase are the three stages that make up the data integrity model. Here, the proposed Taylor-based Border Collie Cat optimisation is used to generate integrity keys in the best possible way. Here, the Taylor series and Border Collie Cat optimisation (BCCO) are combined to derive the proposed Taylor-based BCCO. Python is used to carry out the proposed strategy’s implementation. The proposed method offered enhanced performance with highest normalised variance of 0.710, highest conditional privacy of 2.880, and smallest computation time of 0.179 sec using heart disease dataset.},

A good feature selection method, in addition to selecting the most relevant features with less redundancy, can also reduce computational costs and increase classification performance. One of the feature selection approaches is using meta-heuristic algorithms. This work provides a summary of some meta-heuristic feature selection methods proposed from 2018 to 2022 that were designed and implemented on a wide range of different data for solving feature selection problem. Evaluation criteria, fitness functions and classifiers used and the time complexity of each method are also depicted. The results of the study showed that some meta-heuristic algorithms alone cannot perfectly solve the feature selection problem on all types of datasets with an acceptable speed. In other words, depending on dataset, a special meta-heuristic algorithm should be used. The results of this study and the identified research gaps can be used by researchers in this field.},
