  abstract     = {To address the challenge of production scheduling in flexible flow shops with buffer capacity limitations, a mathematical model is established to minimize the maximum completion time and maximize equipment utilization. To efficiently solve the problem, an improved discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm with multi-population reduction (MPREDPSO) is developed. It integrates an elite retention strategy, which significantly contributes to its efficiency and robustness. The algorithm stands out for its ability to effectively navigate through potential local optima, a common pitfall in optimization problems, through a Euclid algorithm coupled with a sophisticated gene backtracking mechanism. The performance of MPREDPSO is rigorously tested and proven through comparative analyses. Its effectiveness is proven through comparisons with other algorithms, namely the discrete particle swarm algorithm, genetic algorithm, whale algorithm, grey wolf optimizer and whale swarm algorithm. In addition, MPREDPSO’s practical utility is demonstrated in a high-temperature ham sausage production workshop, showcasing its industrial application capabilities.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, manufacturing enterprises must have fast response and flexible production capabilities to meet personalized and diversified market demands. Mixed-model production and distributed production have become the preferred production methods for enterprises. This article studies a distributed heterogeneous hybrid flow shop scheduling problem with a mixed-model assembly line (DHHFSP-MMAL), which consists of manufacturing and assembly stages. The DHHFSP-MMAL is modelled by a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model. Three constructive heuristics and a parallel deep adaptive large neighbourhood search (PDALNS) problem are presented. A constructive heuristic with a group strategy is employed to obtain an initial solution. Several deep destroy-and-repair operators are proposed where problem-specific greedy local search methods are applied. The PDALNS assigns weights to destroy-and-repair operators to guide the selection of operators. The parallel computing technique is introduced to increase the efficiency of training. The experiments demonstrate that the PDALNS algorithm is an efficient and effective algorithm for solving the DHHFSP-MMAL problem.},

  abstract     = {To address challenges effectively in turbomachinery design optimization involving high-dimensional ( d ≥ 30 ) expensive black-box problems, a dedicated Efficient Global Optimization (EGO) algorithm is proposed with dynamic aggregation. This specialized approach efficiently navigates optimization tasks with limited sample evaluations. Specifically, the Dynamic Aggregate Efficient Global Optimization (DA-EGO) algorithm decomposes the original high-dimensional design space into low-dimensional subspaces for efficient surrogate-based optimization search, and the optimal solutions of subspaces are combined as an elite-point for the global search. Most importantly, the subspace variables are updated in each iteration, according to the variable interaction analyses in the sub- and full-spaces. The perturbation method and the analysis of variance are used to detect variable interactions. After being validated on 21 benchmark functions ranging from 30 to 90 dimensions, the DA-EGO is used for the optimization of a transonic compressor rotor with 28 variables and a multi-stage compressor optimization with 60 variables. With the above, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is well demonstrated.},

In the cooperative strategy, a crossover operator is established between the ‘best krill’ and ‘food’ to generate ‘cooperative krill’, which facilitates a balance between global exploration and local exploitation. In the competitive strategy, krill individuals with poor fitness are replaced with robust ‘competitive krill’ to accelerate global convergence. Then, the experimental results from CEC2017 benchmark functions demonstrate that, compared with other algorithms, CCKH shows superiority in most cases. Finally, six structural optimizations are used to evaluate the robustness of CCKH compared with other techniques. It is found that as the complexity of the structure increases, the competitiveness of CCKH becomes more pronounced, and the time complexity of the presented method is not affected by the two strategies.},

This article constructs a scheduling model for the tier-captive FSS/RS with multiple lifts and designs a two-stage optimization heuristic algorithm (OHA). A heuristic assignment algorithm is proposed to determine the retrieval request sequence, and the route-generation stage adopts an improved A-star algorithm with a multi-phase conflict avoidance method to generate shuttle conflict-free routes. Simulation results demonstrate that OHA can reliably generate high-quality solutions, with a low degree of fluctuation in the results, not exceeding 0.5%. The proposed scheduling method outperforms its competitors in all instances, reducing the makespan by 8%. Moreover, the evidence shows that the proposed method can obtain the most competitive scheduling scheme in FSS/RS with more shuttles and lifts.},

However, existing heuristic algorithms for WDN optimization often rely on specific parameters, limiting their performance and hindering their applicability to diverse network configurations, particularly in large-scale systems. To address this challenge, a novel method called circulatory system-based optimization (CSBO) is proposed, which minimizes the need for algorithm-specific parameters and achieves optimal designs across WDNs of various scale. The impact of a dynamic penalty function tailored to pressure constraints on the optimal design is also investigated. This study encompasses the optimization of the Goyang and combined gravity networks and the large-scale Balerma irrigation and Kang and Lansey networks under identical conditions. The results of the standard and dynamic CSBO approaches prove that the proposed algorithms have a superior performance, particularly in convergence rate and stability, compared to previous methods.},

Motivated to overcome this shortcoming, this article presents a novel strategy harmonizing metaheuristic optimization and surrogate modelling. It is based on the idea of adaptive surrogate model-based optimization substituting the tolerance analysis subroutine with a surrogate model, which is iteratively re-modelled with intermediate optimization results to improve its accuracy continuously in potential optima regions. On the one hand, a directed intensification of promising solutions and, on the other hand, an accelerated exploration of the search space is achieved. Optimization studies prove its positive effect on overall efficiency, where a case study with multiple nonlinear assembly response functions and geometrical tolerances serves as a use case.},

  abstract     = {Shape optimization is important for improving the performance of mechanical components. In the past, gradient based optimization methods using the elegant adjoint formalism dominated the field. Gradient descent optimization, however, tends to get stuck in local minima if the optimization problem is non-convex. In this article, an improved approach to shape optimization is proposed that is capable of overcoming local minima. It is motivated by gradient based training methods in machine learning, which involve momentum. Here, the momentum method is derived from the formalism of dissipative Hamiltonian flows, which generalize gradient flows. While gradient descent can be seen as an Euler scheme discretization of the gradient flow, a symplectic Euler scheme is proposed in this article to discretize the Hamiltonian dynamics for the momentum method. To show the efficiency of the method, it is applied to a shape optimization problem involving ceramic components, with reliability, volume and avoidance of construction space constraints as target functions. Construction space constraints lead to manifestly non-convex shape optimization problems. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method solves these non-convex problems more efficiently than the traditional gradient descent approach.},

A floating projection topology optimization (FPTO) method is proposed, which normalizes the objectives of structural compliance and heat dissipation and derives the sensitivity. FPTO demonstrates superior objective function values and smoother topology configuration compared to the solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) method.

To address this, the energy-efficient flow-shop sequence-dependent group scheduling problem (EEFSDGSP) is introduced. A novel multi-objective optimization (MOO) technique, the artificial neural network-based multi-objective genetic algorithm (ANN-MOGA), is proposed to minimize makespan and energy consumption in EEFSDGSP. ANN-MOGA advances MOO by using a neural network to evaluate fitness and guide selection, reducing computational complexity versus traditional methods like NSGA-II and SPEA2. A post-processing step (PPANNS) further enhances solution diversity and distribution. Results show ANN-MOGA, especially with PPANNS, outperforms NSGA-II and competes effectively with SPEA2 in larger problem instances.},
