  abstract     = {In this article, considering uncertainty and nonlinearity factors, the resonance phenomenon of conveyance is studied and a fuzzy adaptive back-stepping controller is proposed for rope lifting system with time-varying length and distributed parameters. Firstly, the dynamic model is constructed and derived by continuum mechanics, and the dynamical behavior is obtained by time-frequency analysis method. Secondly, the fuzzy adaptive back-stepping control method is proposed to suppress nonstationary vibration. Thirdly, based on Lyapunov function, the asymptotic stability of the system under the proposed control algorithm is verified. Finally, compared with proportion–integration–differentiation (PID) back-stepping controller, the efficiency of the proposed controller is proven by applying excitation with different frequency and uncertain parameters, and the adaptability and robustness are illustrated to validate under mixed frequency disturbance by simulation compared with PID back-stepping controller. Based on the dynamical behavior analysis and control method proposed in this article, the robustness of vibration controller of time-varying lifting system under uncertain nonlinear time-varying disturbance will be greatly improved.},

First, the reinforcement learning-based control policy is proposed to enable the flapping-wing micro-aerial vehicles to be recovery flight rapidly and keep the angular acceleration as small as possible. Then, a hybrid control approach is designed to significantly improve the flight stability by combining the reinforcement learning-based control approach with the proportional-derivative control approach. Finally, simulation results show the effectiveness of the reinforcement learning-based method and the hybrid control method for the flapping-wing micro-aerial vehicles under extreme attitudes.},

In this paper, a mapping method simulating human upper limb motion mechanism is proposed to solve this problem. This method reconstructs the human arm model quickly and maps it to the dual-arm robot model. Firstly, the movement mechanism of human upper limb is analyzed and the upper limb model is established. According to the human double-arm kinematics theory, the calculation of arm motion rotation center and the analysis of force and torque are carried out. Then the mapping concept is used to start from the human morphological structure, establish a robot model similar to the arm structure and motion of the human hand, and generate the anthropomorphic configuration. At last, the data collected from the movement of human double arms are matched with the robot model, and the experiment verifies the feasibility of the proposed mapping method.},

  abstract     = {Research on multitask scheduling systems in factory environments is a popular topic in the field of intelligent manufacturing. Existing research mainly focuses on the optimization of automated guided vehicle (AGV) path planning and scheduling, emphasizing on the minimization of conflicts and deadlocks, multi-objective task scheduling, and metaheuristic algorithm optimization, while ignoring path stability and real-time path planning in dynamic environments. Therefore, this paper aims to address these issues to better handle dynamic changes in actual operating environments. This paper establishes a mathematical model with the optimization objective of minimizing the overall running time of material distribution tasks and proposes an improved ant colony algorithm to optimize the model. First, the concept of prior time is introduced to improve the traditional ant colony algorithm. The path of the ongoing task is introduced with a time calculation, and the occupancy time window of each grid point on the path is calculated. Based on this, the initial pheromone distribution on subsequent paths is altered dynamically, which accelerates the convergence of the ants to a collision-free path. Second, in the pheromone update stage, the method of calculating the pheromone increment in the traditional ant colony algorithm is modified. The original distance influence factor is changed to a time influence factor, which ensures that all tasks still have the minimum running time when calculating a collision-free path. Finally, through 30 sets of simulation experiments on material distribution tasks, it is shown that the proposed algorithm shortens the total running time by 15.14%, 12.87%, and 10.59% compared to two ant colony algorithms and one strategic multi-AGV scheduling algorithm, respectively, thus verifying the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Stable flight is a challenge for quadrotors due to low-cost sensors and indoor flight safety constraints add to their complexity. In this study, an Arduino based quadrotor is designed to test 2nd order Complementary filters for state estimation along with a controller with collision safety for indoor flight. Ultrasonic sensors are used for object detection during flight. Detailed hardware assembling along with the implementation of Complementary filter and PID controller is discussed. System tunning is done using the Heuristic method and system response is tested in real time.

  abstract     = {Some of the most valuable science targets for future exploration mission located at the extreme terrains of the planetary surfaces are currently inaccessible to the conventional rovers. The tethered mobile robot with one end fixed to the mother robot or an anchor point has the ability to rappel down steep slopes and traverse rocky terrain, and is a reasonable solution to the above missions. Since the model of the tethered mobile robot can be formulated as a cascade of kinematics and dynamics, a novel backstepping motion control approach is proposed in this paper, in which the kinematic and dynamic controllers are designed independently in a recursive way. In the proposed approach, the optimal distribution of the tether tension and the torque to drive the left and right wheels of the tethered robot is obtained based on the minimization of the system power consumption when the robot traveling on the extreme terrains. In addition, a nonlinear disturbance observer is integrated into the dynamic controller to estimate the disturbance from the rugged terrains. Simulations are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {This research proposes a unique cable-driven two-degree-of-freedom wrist exoskeleton robotic device for Range of Motion (ROM) exercises related to Carpal Tunnel Recovery (CTR). A transportable platform for hand support powered by two actuators and a nonwearable sensing system comprised the basic, user-friendly design of the proposed exoskeleton robotic device. A specialized assist-as-needed control was installed to make the necessary movements with the robotic device. Transferring the data to the exoskeleton for rehabilitation, the control approach was combined with a computer vision system that imitated the therapist&#39;s wrist motions. Utilizing a computer algorithm, hand landmarks were produced to mimic the therapist&#39;s wrist movements. A total of 20 participants (Male: 55 % and Female: 45 %) were involved in the experimental procedure. High-accuracy ROM readings were obtained: 87.5 % for flexion, 90.0 % for extension, 92.5 % for ulnar deviation, and 90.0 % for radial deviation. In the conventional method, the healthy persons have a ROM for wrist flexion and extension of 71.6° and 63.0°, respectively, but Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) patients have a reduced ROM of 49.4° and 38.9°. Healthy participants have ulnar and radial deviations of 45.6° and 27.0°, respectively, while CTS patients have lower values of 28.7° and 20.1°. Using an exoskeleton, healthy people exhibit ROM flexion and extension of 64.9° and 59.0°, compared to 42.9° and 34.5° in CTS patients. This pattern is also shown in the ulnar and radial deviations, which are 44.1° and 25.6° for healthy individuals and 27.1° and 18.9° for CTS patients, respectively. These findings demonstrated the validity of the measurement techniques, which is crucial for clinical evaluations and rehabilitation plans.},
