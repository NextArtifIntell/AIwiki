  abstract = {The kinematic configuration space of a manipulator determines the set of all possible motions that may occur, and its differential properties have a strong, albeit indirect, influence on both static and dynamic performance. By viewing first-order kinematics as a field of Jacobian-defined ellipses across a workspace, a novel two degree-of-freedom manipulator was designed, and is tested in this paper for its benefits. The manipulator exhibits a field of ellipses that biases transmission characteristics in Cartesian directions of the end-effector. The horizontal direction is biased toward speed in order to move across the width of the workspace quickly, while the vertical direction is biased toward force production in order to resist gravitational loads. The latter bias endows the manipulator with load capacity in the absence of gears. Such an exclusion can forego the extra weight, complexity, backlash, transmission losses, and fragility of gearboxes. Additionally, a direct drive set-up improves backdrivability and transparency. The latter is relevant to applications that involve interacting with the environment or people. Our novel design is set through an array of theoretical and experimental performance studies in comparison to a conventional direct drive manipulator. The experimental results showed a 3.75× increase in payload capacity, a 2× increase in dynamic tracking accuracy, a 2.07× increase in dynamic cycling frequency, and at least a 3.70× reduction in power consumption, considering both static and dynamic experiments.},

  abstract = {In the last decades, supernumerary robotic limbs (SRLs) have been proposed as technological aids for rehabilitation, assistance, and functional augmentation. Whether they are in the form of wearable devices or grounded systems, SRLs can be used to compensate for lost motor functions in patients with disabilities, as well as to augment the human sensorimotor capabilities. By using SRLs, users gain the ability to perform a wide range of complex tasks that may otherwise be challenging or even impossible with their natural limbs. Designing effective strategies and policies for the control and operation of SRLs represents a substantial challenge in their development. A key aspect that remains insufficiently addressed is the formulation of successful and intuitive augmentation policies that do not hinder the functionality of a person’s natural limbs. This work introduces an innovative strategy based on the exploitation of the redundancy of the human kinematic chain involved in a task for commanding SRLs having one degree of freedom. This concept is summarized in the definition of the Intrinsic Kinematic Null Space (IKNS). The newly developed procedure encompasses a real-time analysis of body motion and a subsequent computation of the control signal for SRLs based on the IKNS for single-arm tasks. What sets our approach apart is its explicit emphasis on incorporating user-specific biomechanical and physiological characteristics and constraints. This ensures an efficient and intuitive approach to commanding SRLs, tailored to the individual user’s needs. Towards a complete evaluation of the proposed system, we studied the users’ capability of exploiting the IKNS both in virtual and real environments. Obtained results demonstrated that the exploitation of the Intrinsic Kinematic Null Space allows to perform complex tasks involving both biological and artificial limbs, and that practice improves the ability to accurately manage the coordination of human and supernumerary artificial limbs.},

  abstract = {Independent robotic manipulation of two large permanent magnets, in the form of the dual External Permanent Magnet (dEPM) system has demonstrated the possibility for enhanced magnetic control by allowing for actuation up to eight magnetic degrees of freedom (DOFs) at clinically relevant scales. This precise off-board control has facilitated the use of magnetic agents as medical devices, including catheter-like soft continuum robots (SCRs). The use of multiple robotically actuated permanent magnets poses the risk of collision between the robotic arms, the environment, and the patient. Furthermore, unconstrained transitions between actuation inputs can lead to undesired spikes in magnetic fields potentially resulting in unsafe manipulator deformation. This paper presents a hybrid approach to trajectory planning for the dEPM platform. This is performed by splitting the planning problem in two: first finding a collision-free physical path for the two robotically actuated permanent magnets before combining this with a path in magnetic space , which permits for a smooth change in magnetic fields and gradients. This algorithm was characterized by actuating each of the eight magnetic DOFs sequentially, eliminating any potential collisions and reducing the maximum undesired actuation value by 203.7 mT for fields and by 418.7 mT/m for gradients. The effect of this planned magnetic field actuation on a SCR was then examined through two case studies. First, a tip-driven SCR was moved to set points within a confined area. Actuation using the proposed planner reduced movement outside the restricted area by an average of 41.3%. Lastly, the use of the proposed magnetic planner was shown to be essential in navigating a multi-segment magnetic SCR to the site of an aneurysm within a silicone brain phantom.},

  abstract = {This work addresses the problem of online exploration and visual sensor coverage of unknown environments. We introduce a novel perception roadmap we refer to as the Active Perception Network (APN) that serves as a hierarchical topological graph describing how to traverse and perceive an incrementally built spatial map of the environment. The APN state is incrementally updated to expand a connected configuration space that extends throughout as much of the known space as possible, using efficient difference-awareness techniques that track the discrete changes of the spatial map to inform the updates. A frontier-guided approach is presented for efficient evaluation of information gain and covisible information, which guides view sampling and refinement to ensure maximum coverage of the unmapped space is maintained within the APN. The updated roadmap is hierarchically decomposed into subgraph regions which we use to facilitate a non-myopic global view sequence planner. A comparative analysis to several state-of-the-art approaches was conducted, showing significant performance improvements in terms of total exploration time and surface coverage, and demonstrating high computational efficiency that is scalable to large and complex environments.},

  abstract = {Various approaches and structures emerged recently to design continuum robots. One of the most promising designs regards a new concept of continuum concentric push–pull robots (CPPRs) that have the characteristic of combining several key advantages of tendon actuated, multi-backbone, and concentric tube ones (direct curvature actuation, small outer/inner diameter ratio, free lumen, etc.). Geometrically-exact models of such recently introduced robots are yet to be developed to gain leverage of their full potential. This article extends beyond usual definitions of Cosserat rod theory in order to take into account this new type of continuum robots, constituted by sliding rods, in a shape of tubes whose cross-sections are neither uniform nor symmetrical along their entire length. The introduced model is capable of considering versatile design options, external loads, 3D deformations, an arbitrary number of tubes and profiles of the centroid lines, as well as a new actuation method consisting of an input rotation. Numerical simulations and experiments on CPPR prototypes validate our model.},

  abstract = {Multi-legged robots with six or more legs are not in common use, despite designs with superior stability, maneuverability, and a low number of actuators being available for over 20 years. This may be in part due to the difficulty in modeling multi-legged motion with slipping and producing reliable predictions of body velocity. Here, we present a detailed measurement of the foot contact forces in a hexapedal robot with multiple sliding contacts, and provide an algorithm for predicting these contact forces and the body velocity. The algorithm relies on the recently published observation that even while slipping, multi-legged robots are principally kinematic, and employ a friction law ansatz that allows us to compute the shape-change to body-velocity connection and the foot contact forces. This results in the ability to simulate motion plans for a large number of contacts, each potentially with slipping. Furthermore, in homogeneous environments, this kind of simulation can run in (parallel) logarithmic time of the planning horizon.},

  abstract = {Continuous Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) with general belief-dependent rewards are notoriously difficult to solve online. In this paper, we present a complete provable theory of adaptive multilevel simplification for the setting of a given externally constructed belief tree and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) that constructs the belief tree on the fly using an exploration technique. Our theory allows to accelerate POMDP planning with belief-dependent rewards without any sacrifice in the quality of the obtained solution. We rigorously prove each theoretical claim in the proposed unified theory. Using the general theoretical results, we present three algorithms to accelerate continuous POMDP online planning with belief-dependent rewards. Our two algorithms, SITH-BSP and LAZY-SITH-BSP, can be utilized on top of any method that constructs a belief tree externally. The third algorithm, SITH-PFT, is an anytime MCTS method that permits to plug-in any exploration technique. All our methods are guaranteed to return exactly the same optimal action as their unsimplified equivalents. We replace the costly computation of information-theoretic rewards with novel adaptive upper and lower bounds which we derive in this paper, and are of independent interest. We show that they are easy to calculate and can be tightened by the demand of our algorithms. Our approach is general; namely, any bounds that monotonically converge to the reward can be utilized to achieve a significant speedup without any loss in performance. Our theory and algorithms support the challenging setting of continuous states, actions, and observations. The beliefs can be parametric or general and represented by weighted particles. We demonstrate in simulation a significant speedup in planning compared to baseline approaches with guaranteed identical performance.},
