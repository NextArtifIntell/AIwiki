Metal–organic cages are excellent hosts for various guests, but they generally incorporate rigid structural units that hinder dynamic adaptation to specific guests. Here we report a conformationally adaptable pseudo-cubic cage that can dynamically increase its cavity volume to fit guests with differing sizes. This pseudo-cube incorporates a tetramine subcomponent with 2,6-naphthalene arms that cooperatively adopt a non-planar conformation, enabling the cage faces to switch between endo and exo states. A wide range of guest molecules were observed to bind within the cavity of this cage, spanning a range of sizes from 46% to 154% of the cavity volume of the empty cage. Experimental and computational evidence characterizes the flipping of cage faces from endo to exo, expanding the cavity upon binding of larger guests. Synthetic nanocages that can adapt the size and shape of their cavity in response to a given guest have potential applications in various areas, including chemical purification. Now a flexible, pseudo-cubic metal–organic cage has been developed that is able to dynamically expand its cavity from 46% to 154% of its initial volume by flipping its cage faces.},

Natural vesicles are composed of a lipid layer that forms a membrane for the enclosure of substances inside. Here we report a coacervate vesicle formed by the liquid–liquid phase separation of cholesterol-modified DNA and histones. Unlike a phospholipid-based membrane-bounded vesicle, a coacervate vesicle lacks a membrane structure on the surface and is organized with a high-density liquid layer and a water-filled cavity. Through a straightforward coacervation process, we demonstrate that various biological agents, including virus particles, mRNA, cytokines and peptides, can be innocuously and directly enriched in the liquid phase. In contrast to the droplet-like coacervates that are prone to aggregation challenges, coacervate vesicles display superior kinetic stability, positioning them as a versatile delivery vehicle for biopharmaceuticals. We validate that incorporating oncolytic viruses into these coacervate vesicles endows them with potent oncolytic efficacy and elicits robust anti-tumour immune responses in mouse models. Natural vesicles typically consist of a lipid membrane enclosing substances. Now a coacervate vesicle formed by liquid–liquid phase separation of cholesterol-modified DNA and histones has been developed. Unlike traditional vesicles, these lack a membrane and feature a high-density liquid layer around a water-filled cavity, offering enhanced kinetic stability and potential as a biopharmaceutical delivery system.},

Transition-metal catalysis has the potential to greatly expand the scope of nucleophilic substitution reactions of alkyl electrophiles; unfortunately, in the case of alkyl amines as nucleophiles, only one success has been described so far: the selective mono-alkylation of primary amines to form secondary amines. Here, using photoinduced copper catalysis, we report the synthesis of tertiary alkyl amines from secondary amines and unactivated alkyl electrophiles, two readily available coupling partners. Utilizing an array of tools, we have analysed the mechanism of this process; specifically, we have structurally characterized the three principal copper-based intermediates that are detected during catalysis and provided support for the key steps of the proposed catalytic cycle, including the coupling of a copper(II)–amine intermediate with an alkyl radical to form a C–N bond. Alkyl amines are found in a wide array of bioactive compounds, making strategies for their synthesis very important. Now, a method has been developed to synthesize tertiary alkyl amines via photoinduced, copper-catalysed nucleophilic substitution of unactivated alkyl halides by secondary alkyl amines, with key copper intermediates elucidated in a detailed mechanistic study.},

  abstract     = {The chemistry of low-valent bismuth compounds has recently unlocked new concepts in catalysis and unique electronic structure fundamentals. In this work, we describe the synthesis and characterization of a highly reduced bismuth salt featuring a cationic core based on three contiguous Bi(I) centres. The triatomic bismuth-based core exhibits an electronic configuration that mimics the canonical description of the archetypical carbon-based π-allyl cation. Structural, spectroscopic and theoretical analyses validate the unique π-delocalization between the bismuth’s highly diffused 6p orbitals, resulting in a bonding situation in which the three bismuth atoms are interconnected by two bonds, formally possessing a 1.5 bond order each. This electronic situation defines this complex as the heaviest and stable π-allyl cation of the periodic table. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the newly synthesized complex is able to act as a synthon for the transfer of a Bi(I) cation to forge other low-valent organobismuth complexes. Heavier analogues of unsaturated organic molecules are of interest because of their bonding situation and their potential use in synthesis. Now, a Bi(I)-based allyl cation, which can be seen as a heavy congener of all-carbon π-allyl cations, has been reported. This complex serves as a synthon for Bi(I) transfer, enabling access to low-valent organobismuth compounds.},

  abstract     = {The biosynthesis of the lincosamide antibiotics lincomycin A and celesticetin involves the pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes LmbF and CcbF, which are responsible for bifurcation of the biosynthetic pathways. Despite recognizing the same S-glycosyl-l-cysteine structure of the substrates, LmbF catalyses thiol formation through β-elimination, whereas CcbF produces S-acetaldehyde through decarboxylation-coupled oxidative deamination. The structural basis for the diversification mechanism remains largely unexplored. Here we conduct structure–function analyses of LmbF and CcbF. X-ray crystal structures, docking and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that active-site aromatic residues play important roles in controlling the substrate binding mode and the reaction outcome. Furthermore, the reaction selectivity and oxygen-utilization of LmbF and CcbF were rationally engineered through structure- and calculation-based mutagenesis. Thus, the catalytic function of CcbF was switched to that of LmbF, and, remarkably, both LmbF and CcbF variants gained the oxidative-amidation activity to produce an unnatural S-acetamide derivative of lincosamide. The reaction mechanisms of the pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes LmbF and CcbF—involved in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic lincosamide—are characterized here. Structure–function analyses reveal structural features responsible for S-alkyl moiety diversification in lincosamides. Using structure- and calculation-based enzyme engineering, the selectivity profiles of these enzymes are designed to generate an unnatural lincosamide derivative.},

However, the role of anions in the formation of the solid–electrolyte interphase remains unclear. Here we combine electrochemical analyses and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, both with and without sample washing, together with computational simulations, to propose the reaction pathways of electrolyte decomposition and correlate the interphase component solubility with the efficacy of passivation. We discover that not all the products derived from interphase-forming reactions are incorporated into the resulting passivation layer, with a notable portion present in the liquid electrolyte. We also find that the high-performance electrolytes can afford a sufficiently passivating interphase with minimized electrolyte decomposition, by incorporating more anion-decomposition products. Overall, this work presents a systematic approach of coupling electrochemical and surface analyses to paint a comprehensive picture of solid–electrolyte interphase formation, while identifying the key attributes of high-performance electrolytes to guide future designs. Li-metal batteries often utilize liquid electrolytes that yield a solid–electrolyte interphase on electrodes; however, the role of anions in interphase formation remains unclear. Now it has been shown that anion-decomposition products provide varying contributions to interphase formation and that high-performance electrolytes balance effective interfacial passivation with minimized degradation.},

De novo peptide structures could be built by combining enzymes from different pathways, but determining the rules of their use is difficult. We present a biophysical model to combine enzymes sourced from bacterial ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) gene clusters. Using a pipeline to evaluate more than 1,000 peptides, the model was parameterized under uniform conditions in Escherichia coli for enzymes from different classes (graspetide, spliceotide, pantocin, cyanobactin, glycocin, lasso peptide and lanthipeptide). Synthetic leader peptides with recognition sequences for up to three enzymes were designed to modify core sequences sharing no identity to natural RiPPs. Empirically, RiPPs with the desired modifications constituted 7–67% of the total peptides produced, and 6 of our 8 peptide designs were successfully modified. This work is an example of the design of enzyme-modified peptides and libraries, using a framework that can be expanded to include new enzymes and chemical moieties. Combining enzymes from different pathways in nature could enable de novo peptide design, but determining enzyme-specificity rules is non-trivial. Here a biophysical model combining enzymes sourced from bacterial ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) gene clusters was generated to formalize enzyme-specificity rules and create peptide scaffolds with defined post-translational modifications.},

  abstract     = {sp2-carbon-linked covalent organic frameworks (sp2c-COFs) are crystalline porous polymers with repeat organic units linked by sp2 carbons, and have attracted increasing interest due to their robust skeleton and tunable semiconducting properties. Single-crystalline sp2c-COFs with well-defined structures can represent an ideal platform for investigating fundamental physics properties and device performance. However, the robust olefin bonds inhibit the reversible-reaction-based crystal self-correction, thus yielding polycrystalline or amorphous polymers. Here we report an imine-to-olefin transformation strategy to form single-crystal sp2c-COFs. The isolated single crystals display rectangular nanotube-like domains with sizes up to approximately 24 μm × 0.8 μm × 0.8 μm, and permanent pore distribution around 1.1 nm. The highly conjugated olefin linkage endows the crystals with enhanced electronic connectivity which determines a remarkable room-temperature metal-free ferromagnetism (8.6 × 10−3 emu g−1). Our protocol is robust and generally applicable for the synthesis of single-crystalline sp2c-COFs for future spin-electron devices. Olefin-linked covalent organic frameworks are materials with potential application as organic semiconductors, but their synthesis remains challenging. Now, single-crystal sp2-carbon-linked covalent organic frameworks have been prepared through an imine-to-olefin transformation strategy; the resulting materials feature enhanced room-temperature metal-free ferromagnetism.},

This strategy provides a straightforward methodology to access enantiomerically enriched six-membered N-heterocycles containing a trifluoromethylated quaternary stereocentre from planar N-heteroarenes. The synthetic utility of this enantiodivergent methodology was demonstrated by a broad evaluation of reaction scope, product derivatization and concise syntheses of drug analogues. Mechanistic studies reveal that the excellent asymmetric induction arises from the initial cyclopropanation step. The asymmetric single-atom insertion strategy is expected to have a broad impact on the field of single-atom skeletal editing and catalytic asymmetric dearomatization of aromatic compounds. Skeletal editing has emerged as an appealing strategy for scaffold-hopping-based drug discovery, but the enantioselective single-atom skeletal editing of N-heteroarenes is challenging. Now, using trifluoromethyl N-triftosylhydrazones as carbene precursors, the enantiodivergent dearomative skeletal editing of indoles and pyrroles has been achieved through asymmetric carbon-atom insertion.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the dynamics of membrane protein–ligand interactions within a native lipid bilayer is a major goal for drug discovery. Typically, cell-based assays are used, however, they are often blind to the effects of protein modifications. In this study, using the archetypal G protein-coupled receptor rhodopsin, we found that the receptor and its effectors can be released directly from retina rod disc membranes using infrared irradiation in a mass spectrometer. Subsequent isolation and dissociation by infrared multiphoton dissociation enabled the sequencing of individual retina proteoforms. Specifically, we categorized distinct proteoforms of rhodopsin, localized labile palmitoylations, discovered a Gβγ proteoform that abolishes membrane association and defined lipid modifications on G proteins that influence their assembly. Given reports of undesirable side-effects involving vision, we characterized the off-target drug binding of two phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors, vardenafil and sildenafil, to the retina rod phosphodiesterase 6 (PDE6). The results demonstrate differential off-target reactivity with PDE6 and an interaction preference for lipidated proteoforms of G proteins. In summary, this study highlights the opportunities for probing proteoform–ligand interactions within natural membrane environments. G protein-coupled receptors and their effectors can now be released directly from a lipid bilayer using infrared irradiation for proteoform-level characterization by native top-down mass spectrometry. This represents a critical development for drug discovery, as the direct role of post-translational modifications in protein–protein and protein–drug interactions can be characterized.},

  abstract     = {Oxide–water interfaces host a wide range of important reactions in nature and modern industrial applications; however, accurate knowledge about these interfaces is still lacking at the molecular level owing to difficulties in accessing buried oxide surfaces. Here we report an experimental scheme enabling in situ sum-frequency vibrational spectroscopy of oxide surfaces in liquid water. Application to the silica–water interface revealed the emergence of unexpected surface reaction pathways with water. With ab initio molecular dynamics and metadynamics simulations, we uncovered a surface reconstruction, triggered by deprotonation of surface hydroxylated groups, that led to unconventional five-coordinated silicon species. The results help demystify the multimodal chemistry of aqueous silica discovered decades ago, bringing in fresh information that modifies the current understanding. Our study will provide new opportunities for future in-depth physical and chemical characterizations of other oxide–water interfaces. Water–oxide interfaces are ubiquitous in nature, yet a molecular-level understanding of these complex environments is still lacking. Now, using in situ nonlinear optical spectroscopy, unconventional reaction pathways have been revealed during the structural evolution of a silicon oxide surface in liquid water, resolving long-standing controversies and providing new microscopic insights.},

  abstract     = {Hard ticks feed on their host for multiple days. To ensure firm attachment, they secrete a protein-rich saliva that eventually forms a solid cement cone. The underlying mechanism of this liquid-to-solid transition is currently not understood. This study focuses on the phase transitions of a disordered glycine-rich protein (GRP) found in tick saliva. We show that GRP undergoes liquid–liquid phase separation via simple coacervation to form biomolecular condensates in salty environments. Cation–π and π–π interactions mediated by periodically placed arginine and aromatic amino-acid residues are the primary driving forces that promote phase separation. Interestingly, GRP condensates exhibit ageing by undergoing liquid-to-gel transition over time and exhibit adhesive properties, similar to the naturally occurring cement cone. Finally, we provide evidence for protein-rich condensates in natural tick saliva. Our findings provide a starting point to gain further insights into the bioadhesion of ticks, to develop novel tick control strategies, and towards achieving biomedical applications such as tissue sealants. Ticks adhere firmly to their host by secreting a protein-rich saliva that eventually forms a solid bioadhesive, but the mechanism underlying this phase transition is not understood. Now it has been shown that a disordered glycine-rich protein present in tick saliva undergoes liquid–liquid phase separation, followed by a liquid-to-gel transition, and exhibits adhesive properties.},

  abstract     = {The synthesis of mesoporous metal–organic frameworks (meso-MOFs) is desirable as these materials can be used in various applications. However, owing to the imbalance in structural tension at the micro-scale (MOF crystallization) and the meso-scales (assembly of micelles with MOF subunits), the formation of single-crystal meso-MOFs is challenging. Here we report the preparation of uniform single-crystal meso-MOF nanoparticles with ordered mesopore channels in microporous frameworks with definite arrangements, through a cooperative assembly method co-mediated by strong and weak acids. These nanoparticles feature a truncated octahedron shape with variable size and well-defined two-dimensional hexagonally structured (p6mm) columnar mesopores. Notably, the match between the crystallization kinetics of MOFs and the assembly kinetics of micelles is critical for forming the single-crystal meso-MOFs. On the basis of this strategy, we have constructed a library of meso-MOFs with tunable large pore sizes, controllable mesophases, various morphologies and multivariate components. The imbalance in structural tension between crystalline materials and surfactant micelles makes the synthesis of crystalline mesoporous metal–organic frameworks (meso-MOFs) challenging. Now single-crystalline meso-MOFs featuring ordered mesopores have been prepared through the assembly of surfactant micelles and subunits of crystalline MOFs—a process co-mediated by strong and weak acids.},

The co-crystallization of nanoclusters with functional organic molecules provides opportunities to access an even wider range of structures and properties, but can be challenging to control synthetically. Here we introduce a supramolecular approach to direct the assembly of atomically precise silver nanoclusters into a series of nanocluster‒organic ionic co-crystals with tunable structures and properties. By leveraging non-covalent interactions between anionic silver nanoclusters and cationic organic macrocycles of varying sizes, the orientation of nanocluster surface ligands can be manipulated to achieve in situ resolution of enantiopure nanocluster‒organic ionic co-crystals that feature large chiroptical effects. Beyond chirality, this co-crystal assembly approach provides a promising platform for designing functional solid-state nanomaterials through a combination of supramolecular chemistry and atomically precise nanochemistry. The co-crystallization of nanoclusters with functional organic molecules can provide access to superlattices with unique properties, but this process remains synthetically challenging. Now it has been shown that silver nanoclusters and organic macrocycles can be assembled through a supramolecular approach into ionic co-crystals with tunable structures and large chiroptical effects.},
