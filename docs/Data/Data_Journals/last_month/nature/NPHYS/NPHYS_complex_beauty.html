  abstract     = {Although classical thermal machines power industries and modern living, quantum thermal engines have yet to prove their utility. Here, we demonstrate a useful quantum absorption refrigerator formed from superconducting circuits. We use it to cool a transmon qubit to a temperature lower than that achievable with any one available bath, thereby resetting the qubit to an initial state suitable for quantum computing. The process is driven by a thermal gradient and is autonomous, requiring no external feedback. The refrigerator exploits an engineered three-body interaction between the target qubit and two auxiliary qudits. Each auxiliary qudit is coupled to a physical heat bath, realized with a microwave waveguide populated with synthesized quasithermal radiation. If the target qubit is initially fully excited, its effective temperature reaches a steady-state level of approximately 22 mK, lower than what can be achieved by existing state-of-the-art reset protocols. Our results demonstrate that superconducting circuits with propagating thermal fields can be used to experimentally explore quantum thermodynamics and apply it to quantum information-processing tasks. Resetting qubits in a quantum computer requires significant hardware resources. Now, an experiment demonstrates an on-chip quantum refrigerator that uses a thermal gradient to reset a superconducting qubit more effectively than conventional methods.},

  abstract     = {Gauge theories describe the fundamental forces in the standard model of particle physics and play an important role in condensed-matter physics. The constituents of gauge theories, for example, charged matter and electric gauge field, are governed by local gauge constraints, which lead to key phenomena such as the confinement of particles that are not fully understood. In this context, quantum simulators may address questions that are challenging for classical methods. Although engineering gauge constraints is highly demanding, recent advances in quantum computing are beginning to enable digital quantum simulations of gauge theories. Here we simulate confinement dynamics in a $${{\mathbb{Z}}}_{2}$$ lattice gauge theory on a superconducting quantum processor. Tuning a term that couples only to the electric field produces confinement of charges, a manifestation of the tight bond that the gauge constraint generates between both. Moreover, we show how a modification of the gauge constraint from $${{\mathbb{Z}}}_{2}$$ towards U(1) symmetry freezes the system dynamics. Our work illustrates the restriction that the underlying gauge constraint imposes on the dynamics of a lattice gauge theory, showcases how gauge constraints can be modified and protected, and promotes the study of other models governed by multibody interactions. Gauge theories host important phenomena such as confinement that are difficult to study theoretically. Advances in quantum computers have now made it possible to perform digital quantum simulations of confinement dynamics in a gauge theory.},

  abstract     = {Understanding thermodynamical measurement noise is of central importance for electrical and optical precision measurements. These range from semiconductor sensors, in which the Brownian motion of charge carriers poses limits, to optical reference cavities for atomic clocks or gravitational wave detection, which are limited by thermo-refractive and thermo-elastic noise. Here we find that charge-carrier density fluctuations give rise to a noise process in electro-optic photonic integrated circuits. We show that the noise exhibited by lithium niobate and lithium tantalate photonic integrated microresonators feature a frequency scaling to the power of −1.2, deviating from thermo-refractive noise theory. This noise is consistent with thermodynamical charge noise, which leads to electrical field fluctuations that are transduced via the strong Pockels effects of electro-optic materials. Our results establish electrical Johnson–Nyquist noise as the fundamental limitation for electro-optic integrated photonics, crucial for determining performance limits for both classical and quantum devices. Thermal agitation of charge carriers, known as Johnson noise, is the dominant noise in electronic circuits. Now it has also been observed as a key noise source in integrated electro-optic photonic circuits, posing challenges for future applications.},

  abstract     = {Quantum error correction is essential for mitigating hardware errors in quantum computers by encoding logical information into several physical qubits. However, no single error-correcting code intrinsically supports a fault-tolerant implementation of all the gates needed for universal quantum computing. One approach for addressing this problem is to switch between two suitable error-correcting codes that in combination provide a fault-tolerant universal gate set. Here we present the experimental implementation of fault-tolerant code switching between two different codes in a trapped-ion processor. We switch between the 7-qubit colour code, which features fault-tolerant CNOT and H quantum gates, and the 10-qubit code, which allows for a fault-tolerant T gate implementation. Together, these codes form a complementary universal gate set. We construct logical circuits and prepare 12 different logical states that are not accessible natively in a fault-tolerant way within a single code. Finally, we use code switching to entangle two logical qubits using the full universal gate set in a single logical quantum circuit. Our results experimentally demonstrate a route towards deterministic control over logical qubits with low auxiliary qubit overhead and without relying on the probabilistic preparation of resource states. Quantum error correction is essential for reliable quantum computing, but no single code supports all required fault-tolerant gates. The demonstration of switching between two codes now enables universal quantum computation with reduced overhead.},

  abstract     = {Simulations of quantum chemistry and quantum materials are believed to be among the most important applications of quantum information processors. However, realizing practical quantum advantage for such problems is challenging because of the prohibitive computational cost of programming typical problems into quantum hardware. Here we introduce a simulation framework for strongly correlated quantum systems represented by model spin Hamiltonians that uses reconfigurable qubit architectures to simulate real-time dynamics in a programmable way. Our approach also introduces an algorithm for extracting chemically relevant spectral properties via classical co-processing of quantum measurement results. We develop a digital–analogue simulation toolbox for efficient Hamiltonian time evolution using digital Floquet engineering and hardware-optimized multi-qubit operations to accurately realize complex spin–spin interactions. As an example, we propose an implementation based on Rydberg atom arrays. In addition, we show how detailed spectral information can be extracted from the dynamics through snapshot measurements and single-ancilla control, enabling the evaluation of excitation energies and finite-temperature susceptibilities from a single dataset. To illustrate the approach, we show how to use the method to compute key properties of a polynuclear transition-metal catalyst and two-dimensional magnetic materials. Quantum simulations of chemistry and materials are challenging due to the complexity of correlated systems. A framework based on reconfigurable qubit architectures and digital–analogue simulations provides a hardware-efficient path forwards.},

  abstract     = {Malignancies of epithelial tissues, called carcinomas, account for most cancer cases. Research has largely focused on correlating different carcinoma subtypes to genetic alterations. However, as well as a rewiring in the signalling networks, carcinoma progression is accompanied by mechanical changes in the epithelial cells and the extracellular matrix. Here we reveal intricate morphologies in the basement membrane at the onset of bladder cancer and propose that they emerge from a mechanical instability upon epithelial overgrowth. We imaged mouse and human bladder tissue and performed differential growth simulations, and found that stiffness changes in the different mucosa layers can result in aberrant tissue morphologies. The resulting thickening, wrinkles and folds resemble early papillary tumours and carcinomas in situ. Atomic force microscopy confirmed local stiffness changes in the pathological basement membrane. Our findings suggest a possible mechanical origin of the different bladder carcinoma subtypes and may guide future developments in treatment and prophylaxis. Carcinoma subtypes are normally linked to specific genetic alterations, but tissue mechanical changes also play a role. Now, aberrant morphologies resembling bladder carcinoma are shown to emerge from stiffness changes during epithelial overgrowth.},

However, the mechanical signatures that influence the fate of extruding cells remain unknown. Here we show that modified force transmission across adherens junctions inhibits apoptotic cell eliminations. By combining cell experiments with varying levels of E-cadherin junctions and three-dimensional modelling of cell monolayers, we find that these changes not only affect the fate of the extruded cells but also shift extrusion from the apical to the basal side, leading to cell invasion into soft collagen gels. We generalize our findings using xenografts and cysts cultured in matrigel, derived from patients with breast cancer. Our results link intercellular force transmission regulated by cell–cell communication to cell extrusion mechanisms, with potential implications during morphogenesis and invasion of cancer cells. Tissues eliminate unwanted cells through cell extrusion, but the factors determining whether these extuded cells live or die are not fully understood. Now force transmission across adherens junctions is shown to have a role in shaping their fate.},

Here we perform microrheology experiments on concentrated emulsions and measure the storage and loss moduli for a wide range of frequencies. We applied a linear response formalism for microrheology to a soft sphere model that undergoes the jamming transition. We find that the theory quantitatively explains the experiments. Our analysis reveals that the anomalous viscous loss seen in emulsions results from the boson peak, which is a universal vibrational property of amorphous solids and reflects the marginal stability in soft jammed solids. We show that the anomalous viscous loss is universal in systems with various interparticle interactions as it stems from the universal boson peak; it even survives below the jamming density at which thermal fluctuation is pronounced and the dynamics becomes inherently nonlinear. The viscoelastic response of emulsions shows an anomalous loss. This effect is now shown to be related to the boson peak, a universal vibrational feature of amorphous solids.},

The yielded region of the phase diagram correlates with tissue fluidization, whereas the annealing region explains age-related maturation and stiffening. This suggests that some mechanical changes observed in ageing tissues can partially stem from processes analogous to enhanced ageing observed in active glasses. In addition to showing similar yielding diagrams, we strengthen the correspondence to oscillatory shear by demonstrating diverging time scales to steady states, the possibility of memory encoding and reading, and the importance of stress reversals in the annealing process in both cases. Finally, we study yielding in active solids and demonstrate that given the correct geometry, one can either suppress or promote brittle failure via shear band formation by tuning activity. Active glasses are dense, disordered structures made up of motile constituents. Simulations now show that motility-driven annealing in such systems leads to mechanical changes, including increased brittleness.},

  abstract     = {The intrinsic anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is driven by non-zero Berry curvature and spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking. This effect can be realized in two-dimensional moiré systems hosting flat electronic bands but is not usually seen in inversion-symmetric materials. Here, we show that this physics is manifested in helical trilayer graphene—three graphene layers, each twisted in sequence by the same angle—although the system retains global in-plane inversion symmetry. We uncover a phase diagram of correlated and magnetic states at a magic twist angle of 1.8∘, which is explained by a lattice relaxation that leads to the formation of large periodic domains where in-plane inversion symmetry is broken on the moiré scale. Each domain harbours flat topological bands with opposite Chern numbers in the two valleys. We find correlated states at multiple integer and fractional electron fillings per moiré unit cell and an AHE at a subset of them. The AHE disappears above a critical electric displacement field at one electron per unit cell, indicating a topological phase transition. We establish helical trilayer graphene as a platform that presents an opportunity to engineer topology due to its emergent moiré-scale symmetries. Trilayer graphene with the layers consecutively twisted by the same angle is shown to be a platform in which correlated and topological states exist, driven by local lattice relaxations.},

  abstract     = {Helices and spirals, prevalent across various physical systems, play a crucial role in characterizing symmetry, describing dynamics and enabling unique functionalities, all stemming from their inherent simplicity and chiral nature. Helical excitations on quantized vortices, referred to as Kelvin waves, are one example of such a physical system. Kelvin waves play a vital role in energy dissipation within inviscid quantum fluids. However, deliberately exciting Kelvin waves has proven to be challenging. Here we introduce a controlled method for exciting Kelvin waves on a quantized vortex in superfluid helium-4. We used a charged nanoparticle that oscillates when driven by a time-varying electric field to stimulate Kelvin waves on the vortex. Confirmation of the helical nature of Kelvin waves was achieved through three-dimensional image reconstruction, which provided visual evidence of their complex dynamics. Additionally, we determined the dispersion relation and the phase velocity of the Kelvin wave and identified the vorticity direction, thus enhancing our understanding of quantum fluid behaviour. This work elucidates the dynamics of Kelvin waves and initiates an approach for manipulating and observing quantized vortices in three dimensions, thereby opening avenues for exploring quantum fluidic systems. In classical hydrodynamics, Kelvin waves refer to helically vibrating normal modes. Experiments now show that quantum analogues of Kelvin waves can be excited in superfluid helium-4.},

Here we demonstrate a method for coherently steering the reaction flux across different product spin channels for a three-body recombination process in a cloud of trapped cold atoms. We use a magnetically tunable Feshbach resonance to admix, in a controlled way, a specific spin state to the reacting collision complex. This allows us to control the reaction flux into the admixed spin channel, which can be used to alter the reaction products. We also investigate the influence of an Efimov resonance on the reaction dynamics, observing a global enhancement of three-body recombination without favouring particular reaction channels. Our control scheme can be extended to other reaction processes and could be combined with other methods, such as quantum interference of reaction paths, to achieve further tuning capabilities of few-body reactions. Coherent control of chemical reactions is a central theme in quantum chemistry. Now, a cold atom experiment demonstrates a method for steering the outcome of three-body recombination processes using a tunable Feshbach resonance.},

  abstract     = {Flat bands in condensed matter systems can host emergent states of matter, from insulating states in twisted bilayer graphene to fractionalized excitations in frustrated magnets and quantum Hall materials. A key phenomenon in certain flat-band systems is Aharonov–Bohm caging, where particles become localized due to destructive interference caused by gauge fields. Here we report on the experimental realization of highly tunable flat-band models populated by strongly interacting Rydberg atoms. By employing synthetic dimensions, we engineer a flat-band rhombic lattice with twisted boundaries and explore the control of Aharonov–Bohm caging during non-equilibrium dynamics through a tunable gauge field. Microscopic measurements of Rydberg pairs reveal the interaction-driven breakdown of Aharonov–Bohm caging in the limit of strong dipolar interactions, where lattice bands mix. In the limit of weak interactions, where caging persists, we observe effective magnetism arising from the interaction-driven mixing of degenerate flat-band states. These observations offer insights into emergent phenomena in synthetic quantum materials and expand our understanding of quantum many-body physics in engineered lattice systems. The effect of strong interactions on the physics hosted by flat bands remains largely unexplored in atomic systems. An experiment in a synthetic flat-band lattice now demonstrates an interaction-driven transition from localization to delocalization.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, a self-consistent optical thermodynamic framework has emerged that offers a systematic methodology to understand, harness and exploit the complex collective dynamics of multimode nonlinear systems. These developments now allow consideration of a series of long-standing problems in optics, including the prospect of funnelling the entire power flowing in a multimode system into its ground state, for which no methodology currently exists. Here we demonstrate an all-optical Joule–Thomson expansion process mediated by photon–photon interactions whereby the temperature of the optical gas drops abruptly to zero. Our experiments in various configurations of coupled multicore nonlinear waveguide arrangements illustrate how light undergoing expansion-induced cooling can be channelled from arbitrary input states into the fundamental mode with near-unity efficiency. We show that the stability of the post-expansion state is ensured through an irreversible process of energy conversion. The all-optical thermodynamic phenomena explored in this study may enable innovative techniques where various uncorrelated but identical sources are merged into a unified spatially coherent state, offering a route for direct beam combining. An optical thermodynamic framework can describe the complex dynamics in highly multimodal systems. Now, the observation of all-optical Joule–Thompson expansion in an optical gas further validates this thermodynamic approach.},

  abstract     = {Counterflow superfluidity is an anomalous quantum phase that was predicted two decades ago in the context of a two-component Bose–Hubbard model. In this phase, although both components exhibit fluidity, their correlated counterflow currents cancel each other out, resulting in the system behaving as an incompressible Mott insulator. However, realizing and identifying this phase experimentally has proven challenging due to the stringent requirements for a single set-up, including defect-free state preparation, minimal heating during coherent manipulations, and spin- and site-resolved detection of the phases. Here, we report on the observation of counterflow superfluidity in a binary Bose mixture in optical lattices. After preparing a low-entropy spin-Mott state by conveying two spin-1/2 bosonic atoms at every single lattice site to form a doublon, we adiabatically drove the system to the counterflow superfluid phase at approximately 1 nK. We observed features of antipair correlations through site- and spin-resolved quantum-gas microscopy in both real and momentum spaces. Finally, we measured long-range off-diagonal spin correlations in the rotated basis, revealing a correlation length approaching the system size. These techniques and observations demonstrated here provide accessibility to Borromean counterfluids. Counterflow superfluidity is a quantum phase in which two fluid components flow in opposite directions without resistance, cancelling out their overall combined motion. This phase has now been observed in an optical lattice system hosting Bose mixtures.},

Our experimental protocol allows the characterization of the relevant spectral lines in 1 day, representing a 70-fold improvement in the data-taking rate. We show that the spectroscopy is applicable to laser-cooled antihydrogen with important implications for future tests of fundamental symmetries.

Traditionally rooted in classical electrodynamics, this field now reveals quantum-mechanical features that necessitate the frameworks of quantum electrodynamics and quantum optics. This shift compels a re-evaluation of well-established areas, bringing quantum-mechanical corrections to accelerator science and to electron-radiation phenomena. Simultaneously, the ability to shape single-electron wavefunctions opens new possibilities in microscopy and spectroscopy. These developments are primarily driven by innovations in electron microscopy and its intersection with laser science, where laser-driven electron modulation substantially influences quantum electron interactions with light and matter. In this Perspective, we review these developments, highlighting the current challenges and future opportunities. We explore the role of the free electron as a quantum resource, complementing conventional two-level systems and harmonic oscillators. In the coming years, free electrons may offer new modalities for reading and writing quantum information on ultrafast timescales, performing quantum-state tomography, and ultrafast quantum gates on the atomic scale. Free-electron quantum optics is an emerging field that requires a quantum-mechanical description of both the electronic and the optical contributions.
