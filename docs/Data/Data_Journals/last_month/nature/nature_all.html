  abstract     = {Soft materials underpin many domains of science and engineering, including soft robotics, structured fluids, and biological and particulate media. In response to applied mechanical, electromagnetic or chemical stimuli, such materials typically change shape, often dramatically. Predicting their structure is of great interest to facilitate design and mechanistic understanding, and can be cast as an optimization problem where a given energy function describing the physics of the material is minimized with respect to the shape of the domain and additional fields. However, shape-optimization problems are very challenging to solve, and there is a lack of suitable simulation tools that are both readily accessible and general in purpose. Here we present an open-source programmable environment, Morpho, and demonstrate its versatility by showcasing a range of applications from different areas of soft-matter physics: swelling hydrogels, complex fluids that form aspherical droplets, soap films and membranes, and filaments. This study introduces an extensible framework—Morpho—for shape optimization, enabling researchers to predict the structure of soft materials, such as complex fluids, gels, particulate and biological materials.},

  abstract     = {Understanding how visual information is encoded in biological and artificial systems often requires the generation of appropriate stimuli to test specific hypotheses, but available methods for video generation are scarce. Here we introduce the spatiotemporal style transfer (STST) algorithm, a dynamic visual stimulus generation framework that allows the manipulation and synthesis of video stimuli for vision research. We show how stimuli can be generated that match the low-level spatiotemporal features of their natural counterparts, but lack their high-level semantic features, providing a useful tool to study object recognition. We used these stimuli to probe PredNet, a predictive coding deep network, and found that its next-frame predictions were not disrupted by the omission of high-level information, with human observers also confirming the preservation of low-level features and lack of high-level information in the generated stimuli. We also introduce a procedure for the independent spatiotemporal factorization of dynamic stimuli. Testing such factorized stimuli on humans and deep vision models suggests a spatial bias in how humans and deep vision models encode dynamic visual information. These results showcase potential applications of the STST algorithm as a versatile tool for dynamic stimulus generation in vision science. The spatiotemporal style transfer (STST) algorithm enables video generation by selectively manipulating the spatial and temporal features of natural videos, fostering vision science research in both biological and artificial systems.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning plays an important role in quantum chemistry, providing fast-to-evaluate predictive models for various properties of molecules; however, most existing machine learning models for molecular electronic properties use density functional theory (DFT) databases as ground truth in training, and their prediction accuracy cannot surpass that of DFT. In this work we developed a unified machine learning method for electronic structures of organic molecules using the gold-standard CCSD(T) calculations as training data. Tested on hydrocarbon molecules, our model outperforms DFT with several widely used hybrid and double-hybrid functionals in terms of both computational cost and prediction accuracy of various quantum chemical properties. We apply the model to aromatic compounds and semiconducting polymers, evaluating both ground- and excited-state properties. The results demonstrate the model’s accuracy and generalization capability to complex systems that cannot be calculated using CCSD(T)-level methods due to scaling. A multi-task deep learning method for molecular electronic structures, called MEHnet, is developed to predict various molecular properties in a unified framework, approaching chemical accuracy while exhibiting local DFT-level computational costs.},

  abstract     = {Large-scale whole-genome sequencing (WGS) studies have improved our understanding of the contributions of coding and noncoding rare variants to complex human traits. Leveraging association effect sizes across multiple traits in WGS rare variant association analysis can improve statistical power over single-trait analysis, and also detect pleiotropic genes and regions. Existing multi-trait methods have limited ability to perform rare variant analysis of large-scale WGS data. We propose MultiSTAAR, a statistical framework and computationally scalable analytical pipeline for functionally informed multi-trait rare variant analysis in large-scale WGS studies. MultiSTAAR accounts for relatedness, population structure and correlation among phenotypes by jointly analyzing multiple traits, and further empowers rare variant association analysis by incorporating multiple functional annotations. We applied MultiSTAAR to jointly analyze three lipid traits in 61,838 multi-ethnic samples from the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program. We discovered and replicated new associations with lipid traits missed by single-trait analysis. MultiSTAAR provides a general and flexible statistical framework for functionally informed multi-trait rare variant analysis of biobank-scale sequencing studies by jointly analyzing multiple traits and incorporating annotation information.},

  abstract     = {Computational analysis of a large number of genomes requires a data structure that can represent the dataset compactly while also enabling efficient operations on variants and samples. However, encoding genetic data in existing tabular data structures and file formats has become costly and unsustainable. Here we introduce the genotype representation graph (GRG), a fully connected hierarchical data structure that losslessly encodes phased whole-genome polymorphisms. Exploiting variant-sharing across samples enables GRG to compress 200,000 UK Biobank phased human genomes to 5–26 gigabytes per chromosome, also enabling graph-traversal algorithms to reuse computed values in random access memory. Constructing and processing GRG files scales to a million whole genomes. Using allele frequencies and association effects as examples, we show that computation on GRG via graph traversal runs the fastest among all tested alternatives. GRG-based algorithms have the potential to increase the scalability and reduce the cost of analyzing large genomic datasets. The genotype representation graph (GRG) is a compact data structure that encodes 200,000 human genomes in just 5–26 gigabytes per chromosome. Computation on GRG via graph traversal greatly accelerates genome-wide analysis.},

  abstract     = {Crystallization of amorphous precursors into metastable crystals plays a fundamental role in the formation of new matter, from geological to biological processes in nature to the synthesis and development of new materials in the laboratory. Reliably predicting the outcome of such a process would enable new research directions in these areas, but has remained beyond the reach of molecular modeling or ab initio methods. Here we show that candidates for the crystallization products of amorphous precursors can be predicted in many inorganic systems by sampling the local structural motifs at the atomistic level using universal deep learning interatomic potentials. We show that this approach identifies, with high accuracy, the most likely crystal structures of the polymorphs that initially nucleate from amorphous precursors, across a diverse set of material systems, including polymorphic oxides, nitrides, carbides, fluorides, chlorides, chalcogenides and metal alloys. This study introduces a2c, a computational method that leverages machine learning and atomistic simulations to predict the most likely crystallization products upon annealing of amorphous precursors. The a2c tool was demonstrated on a variety of materials, including oxides, nitrides and metallic glasses, and can assist researchers in discovering synthesis pathways for materials design.},

  abstract     = {A pressing question resulting from global warming is how climate change will affect infectious diseases. Answering this question requires research into the effects of weather on the population dynamics of transmission and infection; elucidating these effects, however, has proved difficult due to the challenges of assessing causality from the predominantly observational data available in epidemiological research. Here we show how concepts from causal inference—the sub-field of statistics aiming at inferring causality from data—can guide that research. Through a series of case studies, we illustrate how such concepts can help assess study design and strategically choose a study’s location, evaluate and reduce the risk of bias, and interpret the multifaceted effects of meteorological variables on transmission. More broadly, we argue that interdisciplinary approaches based on explicit causal frameworks are crucial for reliably estimating the effect of weather and accurately predicting the consequences of climate change. A series of case studies is used to illustrate how concepts from causal interference can be used to guide research into the effects of weather on the transmission and population dynamics of infectious diseases.},

  abstract     = {Our understanding of animal ornaments and the mating preferences driving their exaggeration is limited by knowledge of their genetics. Post-copulatory sexual selection is credited with the rapid evolution of female sperm-storage organ morphology and corresponding sperm quality traits across diverse taxa. In Drosophila, the mechanisms by which longer flagella convey an advantage in the competition among sperm for limited storage space in the female, and by which female sperm-storage organ morphology biases fertilization in favour of longer sperm have been resolved. However, the evolutionary genetics underlying this model post-copulatory ornament and preference system have remained elusive. Here we combined comparative analyses of 149 Drosophila species, a genome-wide association study in Drosophila melanogaster and molecular evolutionary analysis of ~9,400 genes to elucidate how sperm and female sperm-storage organ length co-evolved into one of nature’s most extreme ornaments and preferences. Our results reveal a diverse repertoire of pleiotropic genes linking sperm length and seminal receptacle length expression to central nervous system development and sensory biology. Sperm length development appears condition-dependent and is governed by conserved hormonal (insulin/insulin-like growth factor) and developmental (including Notch and Fruitless) pathways. Central developmental pathway genes, including Notch, also comprised the majority of a restricted set of genes contributing to both intraspecific and interspecific variation in sperm length. Our findings support ‘good genes’ models of female preference evolution. A comparative analysis of morphological data across 149 species of Drosophilidae shows that sperm length in males has co-evolved with the length of the sperm-storage organ in females. Combining a genome-wide association study of these traits in Drosophila melanogaster with molecular evolutionary analyses of the genomes of 15 Drosophila species, the authors find that the genetic architecture underlying sperm length is associated with indirect genetic benefits in females, providing support for the ‘good genes’ hypothesis.},

  abstract     = {The probability of parallel genetic evolution is a function of the strength of selection and constraints imposed by genetic architecture. Inversions capture locally adapted alleles and suppress recombination between them, which limits the range of adaptive responses. In addition, the combined phenotypic effect of alleles within inversions is likely to be greater than that of individual alleles; this should further increase the contributions of inversions to parallel evolution. We tested the hypothesis that inversions contribute disproportionately to parallel genetic evolution in independent dune ecotypes of Helianthus petiolaris. We analysed habitat data and identified variables underlying parallel habitat shifts. Genotype–environment association analyses of these variables indicated parallel responses of inversions to shared selective pressures. We also confirmed larger seed size across the dunes and performed quantitative trait locus mapping with multiple crosses. Quantitative trait loci shared between locations fell into inversions more than expected by chance. We used whole-genome sequencing data to identify selective sweeps in the dune ecotypes and found that the majority of shared swept regions were found within inversions. Phylogenetic analyses of shared regions indicated that within inversions, the same allele typically was found in the dune habitat at both sites. These results confirm predictions that inversions drive parallel divergence in the dune ecotypes. Analysis of habitat data, quantitative trait locus mapping of seed size and selective sweeps show parallel selection acting on inversions in two independent dune ecotypes of the prairie sunflower, Helianthus petiolaris.},

  abstract     = {Environmental filtering and dispersal history limit plant distributions and affect biogeographical patterns, but how their relative importance varies across evolutionary timescales is unresolved. Phylogenetic beta diversity quantifies dissimilarity in evolutionary relatedness among assemblages and might help resolve the ecological and biogeographical mechanisms structuring biodiversity. Here, we examined the effects of environmental dissimilarity and geographical distance on phylogenetic and taxonomic turnover for ~270,000 seed plant species globally and across evolutionary timescales. We calculated past and present dispersal barriers using palaeogeographical reconstructions and calculated geographical linear and least-cost distances, accounting for dispersal over water, mountains or areas with unsuitable climates. Environmental dissimilarity and geographical distance jointly explained most of the deviance in taxonomic (up to 86.4%) and phylogenetic turnover (65.6%). While environmental dissimilarity consistently showed strongly positive effects, the effect of geographical distance on phylogenetic turnover was less pronounced further back in evolutionary time. Past physiogeographical barriers explained a relatively low amount of the variation across all timescales, with a slight peak at intermediate timescales (20–50 Myr bp). Our results suggest that while old lineages have generally dispersed widely, the imprint of environmental filtering on range expansion persists, providing insights into biogeographical and evolutionary processes underlying global biodiversity patterns. This modelling study integrates comprehensive regional plant inventories, environmental conditions and palaeogeographical reconstructions to assess the relative roles of environmental filtering and dispersal barriers in shaping global seed plant diversity, demonstrating that environmental filtering has a persistent effect on species distribution patterns across evolutionary timescales.},

While previous studies have often examined the extreme scenario of complete pollinator removal, showing negative impacts on plant reproductive success, we take a more realistic approach by focusing on the effects of decreasing pollinator diversity. Our global meta-analysis reveals a notable negative impact of reduced pollinator species diversity on plant reproductive success measures, such as seed set, fruit set and fruit weight. Notably, this effect varies across plant families, impacting both self-incompatible and self-compatible species. We also find that wild plant species suffer more than cultivated ones. Furthermore, the loss of invertebrate, nocturnal and wild pollinators has a more substantial impact than the loss of vertebrate, diurnal or managed pollinators. Overall, our findings consistently underscore the positive role of biodiversity in maintaining ecosystem functioning, highlighting the urgency of mitigating factors that lead to the decline in pollinator species diversity. A meta-analysis finds that decreasing diversity of pollinator species has a negative affect on multiple measures of plant reproductive success, with wild plant species affected more than cultivated species, and loss of invertebrate, nocturnal and wild pollinators being particularly problematic.},

  abstract     = {Anthropogenic landscape modification may lead to the proliferation of a few species and the loss of many. Here we investigate mechanisms and functional consequences of this winner–loser replacement in six human-modified Amazonian and Atlantic Forest regions in Brazil using a causal inference framework. Combining floristic and functional trait data for 1,207 tree species across 271 forest plots, we find that forest loss consistently caused an increased dominance of low-density woods and small seeds dispersed by endozoochory (winner traits) and the loss of distinctive traits, such as extremely dense woods and large seeds dispersed by synzoochory (loser traits). Effects on leaf traits and maximum tree height were rare or inconsistent. The independent causal effects of landscape configuration were rare, but local degradation remained important in multivariate trait-disturbance relationships and exceeded the effects of forest loss in one Amazonian region. Our findings highlight that tropical forest loss and local degradation drive predictable functional changes to remaining tree assemblages and that certain traits are consistently associated with winners and losers across different regional contexts. Tropical forest landscapes are increasingly being modified by human activities. Here the authors apply a causal inference approach to Neotropical forest data to disentangle the role of landscape-level and local drivers and reveal replacement of ‘loser’ by ‘winner’ tree species with distinct functional profiles.},

Even with other climatic factors controlled (for example, moisture index, temperature and vapour pressure deficit), wind speed clearly affected plant hydraulics; for example, on average, species from windier sites constructed sapwood with smaller D and lower KS that was more resilient to drought (more negative P50), deploying less leaf total area for a given sapwood cross-section. Species with these traits may be at an advantage under future climates with higher wind speeds. A global analysis of hydraulic traits in 1,922 woody plant species shows that wind speed has substantial effects on key traits related to plant water transport, independently of other climatic factors.},

Phenological changes may be unequal within and among trophic levels, potentially impacting the intricate interactions that regulate ecosystem functioning. Here we compile and analyse a global dataset of terrestrial phenological observations, including nearly half a million time series for both plants and animals. Our analysis reveals an increasing phenological asynchronization between plants and animals from 1981 to 2020, with a stronger overall advancement of late-season phenophases for plants than for animals. Almost 30% of temporal variations in plant phenophases can be explained by the timing of the preceding phenophases. This temporal dependency allows the advancement caused by warming to accumulate and propagate through seasons, advancing later phenophases more than earlier phases. By contrast, animals rely on various environmental cues and resource-tracking strategies to initiate their life-cycle activities, which weakens their cross-phenophase linkage and undermines the effect of warming. Our results suggest that future warming may increase phenological asynchronization between plants and animals and potentially disturb trophic interactions and ecosystem stability. Climate change is inducing widespread shifts in the phenology of terrestrial organisms. This global analysis reveals a growing asymmetry between plant and animal responses, with more pronounced phenological shifts in plants.},

  abstract     = {Testing the extent to which ecological communities are structured by deterministic (niche-based) assembly processes, resulting in predictable species abundance and composition, is a fundamental goal of ecology. Here we use a 10-year dataset of 55,156 lianas comprising 86 species in an old-growth tropical forest in Panama to test whether community assembly is consistent with niche-based assembly processes. We find that species diversity and community composition was maintained because species conformed to four general requirements of coexistence theory: (1) species have negative conspecific frequency-dependent feedback that control their local population size; (2) species have a stronger negative effect on their own population than that of heterospecifics; (3) the equilibrium frequencies of species correspond to their relative abundance; and (4) species have positive invasibility. These results indicate that coexistence through deterministic niche-based processes controls local population sizes and prevents any one species from displacing others. Rare species persisted because particularly strong negative feedbacks maintained them at their relatively low equilibrium abundances, thus preventing them from going extinct. Furthermore, we show that it is necessary to use population demography to test coexistence theory because stem mortality alone does not reflect species demography. These findings have broad implications for species coexistence and diversity maintenance in tropical forests and possibly other ecosystems. Ecological communities may arise through distinct assembly processes, which are difficult to disentangle. Here the authors show that deterministic niche-based, not neutral dispersal, assembly processes explain the vast majority of the structure of a tropical forest liana community.},

  abstract     = {Plant communities are composed of species that differ both in functional traits and evolutionary histories. As species’ functional traits partly result from their individual evolutionary history, we expect the functional diversity of communities to increase with increasing phylogenetic diversity. This expectation has only been tested at local scales and generally for specific growth forms or specific habitat types, for example, grasslands. Here we compare standardized effect sizes for functional and phylogenetic diversity among 1,781,836 vegetation plots using the global sPlot database. In contrast to expectations, we find functional diversity and phylogenetic diversity to be only weakly and negatively correlated, implying a decoupling between these two facets of diversity. While phylogenetic diversity is higher in forests and reflects recent climatic conditions (1981 to 2010), functional diversity tends to reflect recent and past climatic conditions (21,000 years ago). The independent nature of functional and phylogenetic diversity makes it crucial to consider both aspects of diversity when analysing ecosystem functioning and prioritizing conservation efforts. Functional diversity and phylogenetic diversity are expected to be positively correlated. Here the authors show that the covariation between these metrics in vascular plant communities around the world is often either inconsistent or negative.},

  abstract     = {Genomic and ancient DNA data have revolutionized palaeoanthropology and our vision of human evolution, with indisputable landmarks like the sequencing of Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes. Yet, using genetic data to identify, date and quantify evolutionary events—such as ancient bottlenecks or admixture—is not straightforward, as inferences may depend on model assumptions. In the last two decades, the idea that Neanderthals and members of the Homo sapiens lineage interbred has gained momentum. From the status of unlikely theory, it has reached consensus among human evolutionary biologists. This theory is mainly supported by statistical approaches that depend on demographic models minimizing or ignoring population structure, despite its widespread occurrence and the fact that, when ignored, population structure can lead to the inference of spurious demographic events. We simulated genomic data under a structured and admixture-free model of human evolution, and found that all the tested admixture approaches identified long Neanderthal fragments in our simulated genomes and an admixture event that never took place. We also observed that several published admixture models failed to predict important empirical diversity or admixture statistics, and that we could identify several scenarios from our structured model that better predicted these statistics jointly. Using a simulated time series of ancient DNA, the structured scenarios could also predict the trajectory of the empirical D statistics. Our results suggest that models accounting for population structure are fundamental to improve our understanding of human evolution, and that admixture between Neanderthals and H. sapiens needs to be re-evaluated in the light of structured models. Beyond the Neanderthal case, we argue that ancient hybridization events, which are increasingly documented in many species, including with other hominins, may also benefit from such re-evaluation. Simulating a metapopulation of human evolution without Neanderthal introgression into Homo sapiens still identifies Neanderthal fragments in simulated genomes, and an admixture event that never took place. This indicates that population structure must be accounted for in human evolutionary genomics and that putative ancient hybridization events should be reinterpreted in this light.},

  abstract     = {Ex situ living plant collections play a crucial role in providing nature-based solutions to twenty-first century global challenges. However, the complex dynamics of these artificial ecosystems are poorly quantified and understood, affecting biodiversity storage, conservation and utilization. To evaluate the management of ex situ plant diversity, we analysed a century of data comprising 2.2 million records, from a meta-collection currently holding ~500,000 accessions and 41% of global ex situ species diversity. Our study provides critical insights into the historical evolution, current state and future trajectory of global living collections. We reveal sigmoidal growth of a meta-collection that has reached capacity in both total accessions and total diversity, and identify intrinsic constraints on biodiversity management, including a median survival probability of 15 years. We explore the impact of external constraints and quantify the influence of the Convention on Biological Diversity, which we link to reduced acquisition of wild-origin and internationally sourced material by 44% and 38%, respectively. We further define the impact of these constraints on ex situ conservation but highlight targeted initiatives that successfully mitigate these challenges. Ultimately, our study underscores the urgent need for strategic prioritization and the re-evaluation of ex situ biodiversity management to achieve both scientific and conservation goals. The authors collate a meta-collection of ex situ living plant diversity held in 50 botanical collections worldwide, spanning a century of data and currently containing ~500,000 accessions. Their analyses examine the capacities and constraints within living plant collections, reveal the impact of the Convention on Biological Diversity and its consequences for material exchange and conservation, and call for the re-evaluation of strategic priorities.},

  abstract     = {Rapid growth in bio-logging—the use of animal-borne electronic tags to document the movements, behaviour, physiology and environments of wildlife—offers opportunities to mitigate biodiversity threats and expand digital natural history archives. Here we present a vision to achieve such benefits by accounting for the heterogeneity inherent to bio-logging data and the concerns of those who collect and use them. First, we can enable data integration through standard vocabularies, transfer protocols and aggregation protocols, and drive their wide adoption. Second, we need to develop integrated data collections on standardized data platforms that support data preservation through public archiving and strategies that ensure long-term access. We outline pathways to reach these goals, highlighting the need for resources to govern community data standards and guide data mobilization efforts. We propose the launch of a community-led coordinating body and provide recommendations for how stakeholders—including government data centres, museums and those who fund, permit and publish bio-logging work—can support these efforts. Animal-borne electronic tags, or bio-loggers, are increasingly used for research and wildlife conservation. This Perspective discusses the importance of standardization, long-term archiving and sharing of bio-logging data, and outlines a roadmap to achieve these goals.},

  abstract     = {The use of herbaria for science and conservation is enabling greatly enhanced scopes and scales of discovery, exploration and protection of biodiversity. The availability of digital, open-access herbarium data is, perhaps counter-intuitively, expanding the use of physical collections by researchers who use digital collections to find specimens and then sample physical collections for multiomics investigations, including genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics and microbiomics. These investigations are leading to new scientific insights and supporting the development of conservation actions, but they come with a substantial cost: the partial or complete destruction of often irreplaceable specimens, which constitute a global heritage that should be permanently safeguarded for future reference. Here we provide a set of recommended best practices for the sustainable, equitable and ethical sampling of herbarium specimens. Our recommendations are intended for two complementary and partially overlapping audiences—users and stewards—who together build, use and protect herbarium collections. Greater availability of digital herbarium data is leading to more researchers seeking to sample physical herbarium collections. This Perspective provides recommendations for stewards and users of herbarium collections to ensure optimal preservation of herbarium specimens.},

In particular, large language models introduce a fresh research paradigm to tackle scientific problems from a natural language processing perspective. Large language models significantly enhance our understanding and generation of molecules, often surpassing existing methods with their capabilities to decode and synthesize complex molecular patterns. However, two key issues remain: how to quantify the match between model and data modalities and how to identify the knowledge-learning preferences of models. To address these challenges, we propose a multimodal benchmark, named ChEBI-20-MM, and perform 1,263 experiments to assess the model’s compatibility with data modalities and knowledge acquisition. Through the modal transition probability matrix, we provide insights into the most suitable modalities for tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a statistically interpretable approach to discover context-specific knowledge mapping by localized feature filtering. Our analysis offers an exploration of the learning mechanism and paves the way for advancing large language models in molecular science. Large language models promise substantial advances in molecular modelling and design. A multimodal benchmark is proposed to analyse performance, and 1,263 experiments are conducted to examine the compatibility of a large language model with data modalities and knowledge acquisition.},

Here we introduce centroid- and orientation-aware disentangling autoencoder (CODAE), an encoder–decoder-based neural network that learns meaningful content of objects in a latent space. Specifically, a combination of a translation- and rotation-equivariant encoder, Euler encoding and an image moment loss enables CODAE to extract features invariant to positions and orientations of objects of interest from randomly translated and rotated images. We evaluate this approach on several publicly available scientific datasets, including protein images from life sciences, four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy data from material science and galaxy images from astronomy. The evaluation shows that CODAE learns centroids, orientations and their invariant features and outputs, as well as aligned reconstructions and the exact view reconstructions of the input images with high quality. Cha and colleagues present a translation- and rotation-equivariant autoencoder-based method for robust image recognition, which they demonstrate on diverse tasks from bioinformatics, material science and astronomy.},

We introduce clinical and omics multimodal analysis enhanced with transfer learning (COMET), a machine learning framework that incorporates large, observational electronic health record databases and transfer learning to improve the analysis of small datasets from omics studies. By pretraining on electronic health record data and adaptively blending both early and late fusion strategies, COMET overcomes the limitations of existing multimodal machine learning methods. Using two independent datasets, we showed that COMET improved the predictive modelling performance and biological discovery compared with the analysis of omics data with traditional methods. By incorporating electronic health record data into omics analyses, COMET enables more precise patient classifications, beyond the simplistic binary reduction to cases and controls. This framework can be broadly applied to the analysis of multimodal omics studies and reveals more powerful biological insights from limited cohort sizes. COMET, an artificial intelligence method that improves the analysis of small medical studies using large clinical databases, has been created. COMET can help develop better artificial intelligence tools and identify key biomarkers across many diseases, potentially changing medical research.},

  abstract     = {The immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated promising clinical efficacy across various tumour types, yet the percentage of patients who benefit from them remains low. The bindings between tumour antigens and human leukocyte antigen class I/T cell receptor molecules determine the antigen presentation and T cell activation, thereby playing an important role in the immunotherapy response. In this paper, we propose UnifyImmun, a unified cross-attention transformer model designed to simultaneously predict the bindings of peptides to both receptors, providing more comprehensive evaluation of antigen immunogenicity. We devise a two-phase strategy using virtual adversarial training that enables these two tasks to reinforce each other mutually, by compelling the encoders to extract more expressive features. Our method demonstrates superior performance in predicting both peptide-HLA and peptide-TCR binding on multiple independent and external test sets. Notably, on a large-scale COVID-19 peptide-TCR binding test set without any seen peptide in the training set, our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods by more than 10%. The predicted binding scores significantly correlate with the immunotherapy response and clinical outcomes on two clinical cohorts. Furthermore, the cross-attention scores and integrated gradients reveal the amino acid sites critical for peptide binding to receptors. In essence, our approach marks an essential step towards comprehensive evaluation of antigen immunogenicity. This work proposes a deep learning model based on the cross-attention mechanism to simultaneously predict peptide–HLA and peptide–TCR bindings. Experiments verify that its performance for both prediction tasks on multiple test sets compares favourably with previous methods.},

  abstract     = {Accurately predicting battery lifetime in early cycles holds tremendous value in real-world applications. However, this task poses significant challenges due to diverse factors influencing complex battery capacity degradation, such as cycling protocols, ambient temperatures and electrode materials. Moreover, cycling under specific conditions is both resource-intensive and time-consuming. Existing predictive models, primarily developed and validated within a restricted set of ageing conditions, thus raise doubts regarding their extensive applicability. Here we introduce BatLiNet, a deep learning framework tailored to predict battery lifetime reliably across a variety of ageing conditions. The distinctive design is integrating an inter-cell learning mechanism to predict the lifetime differences between two battery cells. This mechanism, when combined with conventional single-cell learning, enhances the stability of lifetime predictions for a target cell under varied ageing conditions. Our experimental results, derived from a broad spectrum of ageing conditions, demonstrate BatLiNet’s superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing models. BatLiNet also exhibits transferring capabilities across different battery chemistries, benefitting scenarios with limited resources. We expect this study could promote exploration of cross-cell insights and facilitate battery research across comprehensive ageing factors. Zhang and colleagues introduce an inter-cell learning mechanism to predict battery lifetime in the presence of diverse ageing conditions.},

Although this lifelong learning capability is considered an essential mechanism that makes up general intelligence, recent advancements in artificial intelligence predominantly excel in narrow, specialized domains and generally lack this lifelong learning capability. Here we introduce a robotic lifelong reinforcement learning framework that addresses this gap by developing a knowledge space inspired by the Bayesian non-parametric domain. In addition, we enhance the agent’s semantic understanding of tasks by integrating language embeddings into the framework. Our proposed embodied agent can consistently accumulate knowledge from a continuous stream of one-time feeding tasks. Furthermore, our agent can tackle challenging real-world long-horizon tasks by combining and reapplying its acquired knowledge from the original tasks stream. The proposed framework advances our understanding of the robotic lifelong learning process and may inspire the development of more broadly applicable intelligence. Humans continuously acquire knowledge and develop complex behaviours. Meng, Bing, Yao and colleagues present a robotic lifelong learning framework using a Bayesian non-parametric knowledge space, enabling agents to dynamically preserve and integrate knowledge from sequential tasks, enhancing adaptability.},

It creates molecules through a painting-like approach that simultaneously depicts local structures and global layout of the molecule. By visualizing molecular structures, various design tasks are unified within a single image-based framework. De novo design becomes sketching new molecular images, whereas editing tasks transform into filling partially drawn images.

MUNIS shows improved performance compared with existing models in predicting peptide presentation and CD8+ T cell epitope immunodominance hierarchies. Moreover, application of MUNIS to proteins from Epstein–Barr virus led to successful identification of both established and novel HLA-I epitopes which were experimentally validated by in vitro HLA-I-peptide stability and T cell immunogenicity assays. MUNIS performs comparably to an experimental stability assay in terms of immunogenicity prediction, suggesting that deep learning can reduce experimental burden and accelerate identification of CD8+ T cell epitopes for rapid T cell vaccine development. Accurate prediction of immunogenic CD8+ T cell epitopes would greatly accelerate T cell vaccine development.

  abstract     = {As artificial intelligence systems, particularly large language models (LLMs), become increasingly integrated into decision-making processes, the ability to trust their outputs is crucial. To earn human trust, LLMs must be well calibrated such that they can accurately assess and communicate the likelihood of their predictions being correct. Whereas recent work has focused on LLMs’ internal confidence, less is understood about how effectively they convey uncertainty to users. Here we explore the calibration gap, which refers to the difference between human confidence in LLM-generated answers and the models’ actual confidence, and the discrimination gap, which reflects how well humans and models can distinguish between correct and incorrect answers. Our experiments with multiple-choice and short-answer questions reveal that users tend to overestimate the accuracy of LLM responses when provided with default explanations. Moreover, longer explanations increased user confidence, even when the extra length did not improve answer accuracy. By adjusting LLM explanations to better reflect the models’ internal confidence, both the calibration gap and the discrimination gap narrowed, significantly improving user perception of LLM accuracy. These findings underscore the importance of accurate uncertainty communication and highlight the effect of explanation length in influencing user trust in artificial-intelligence-assisted decision-making environments. Understanding how people perceive and interpret uncertainty from large language models (LLMs) is crucial, as users often overestimate LLM accuracy, especially with default explanations. Steyvers et al. show that aligning LLM explanations with their internal confidence improves user perception.},

Despite considerable empirical and computational work on goals and goal-oriented behaviour, models are still far from capturing the richness of everyday human goals. Here we bridge this gap by collecting a dataset of human-generated playful goals (in the form of scorable, single-player games), modelling them as reward-producing programs and generating novel human-like goals through program synthesis. Reward-producing programs capture the rich semantics of goals through symbolic operations that compose, add temporal constraints and allow program execution on behavioural traces to evaluate progress. To build a generative model of goals, we learn a fitness function over the infinite set of possible goal programs and sample novel goals with a quality-diversity algorithm. Human evaluators found that model-generated goals, when sampled from partitions of program space occupied by human examples, were indistinguishable from human-created games. We also discovered that our model’s internal fitness scores predict games that are evaluated as more fun to play and more human-like. To enable artificial agents to generate human-like goals, a model must capture the complexity and diversity of human goals. Davidson et al. model playful goals from a naturalistic experiment as reward-producing programs, mapping an agent’s behaviour to goal success. They then develop a computational model to generate diverse human-like goals.},

Although model merging has emerged as a cost-effective promising approach for creating new models by combining existing ones, it currently relies on human intuition and domain knowledge, limiting its potential. Here we propose an evolutionary approach that overcomes this limitation by automatically discovering effective combinations of diverse open-source models, harnessing their collective intelligence without requiring extensive additional training data or compute. Our approach operates in both parameter space and data flow space, allowing optimization beyond just the weights of the individual models. This approach even facilitates cross-domain merging, generating models such as a Japanese LLM with math reasoning capabilities. Surprisingly, our Japanese math LLM achieved state-of-the-art performance on a variety of established Japanese LLM benchmarks, even surpassing models with substantially more parameters, despite not being explicitly trained for such tasks. Furthermore, a culturally aware Japanese vision–language model generated through our approach demonstrates its effectiveness in describing Japanese culture-specific content, outperforming previous Japanese vision–language models. This work not only contributes new state-of-the-art models back to the open-source community but also introduces a new paradigm for automated model composition, paving the way for exploring alternative, efficient approaches to foundation model development.

  abstract     = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and large models are producing realistic outputs across various domains, such as images, text, speech and music. Creating these advanced generative models requires significant resources, particularly large and high-quality datasets. To minimize training expenses, many algorithm developers use data created by the models themselves as a cost-effective training solution. However, not all synthetic data effectively improve model performance, necessitating a strategic balance in the use of real versus synthetic data to optimize outcomes. Currently, the previously well-controlled integration of real and synthetic data is becoming uncontrollable. The widespread and unregulated dissemination of synthetic data online leads to the contamination of datasets traditionally compiled through web scraping, now mixed with unlabelled synthetic data. This trend, known as the AI autophagy phenomenon, suggests a future where generative AI systems may increasingly consume their own outputs without discernment, raising concerns about model performance, reliability and ethical implications. What will happen if generative AI continuously consumes itself without discernment? What measures can we take to mitigate the potential adverse effects? To address these research questions, this Perspective examines the existing literature, delving into the consequences of AI autophagy, analysing the associated risks and exploring strategies to mitigate its impact. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive perspective on this phenomenon advocating for a balanced approach that promotes the sustainable development of generative AI technologies in the era of large models. With widespread generation and availability of synthetic data, AI systems are increasingly trained on their own outputs, leading to various technical and ethical challenges. The authors analyse this development and discuss measures to mitigate the potential adverse effects of ‘AI eating itself’.},

  abstract     = {The oestrogen receptor (ER or ERα), a nuclear hormone receptor that drives most breast cancer1, is commonly activated by phosphorylation at serine 118 within its intrinsically disordered N-terminal transactivation domain2,3. Although this modification enables oestrogen-independent ER function, its mechanism has remained unclear despite ongoing clinical trials of kinase inhibitors targeting this region4–6. By integration of small-angle X-ray scattering and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy with functional studies, we show that serine 118 phosphorylation triggers an unexpected expansion of the disordered domain and disrupts specific hydrophobic clustering between two aromatic-rich regions. Mutations mimicking this disruption rescue ER transcriptional activity, target-gene expression and cell growth impaired&amp;nbsp;by a phosphorylation-deficient S118A mutation. These findings,&amp;nbsp;driven by hydrophobic interactions, extend beyond electrostatic models and provide mechanistic insights into intrinsically disordered proteins7, with implications for other nuclear receptors8. This fundamental sequence–structure–function relationship advances our understanding of intrinsic ER disorder, crucial for developing targeted breast cancer therapeutics. Serine 118 phosphorylation drives conformational changes through the disruption of hydrophobic interactions between aromatic-rich clusters, showing how hydrophobic mutations can restore oestrogen receptor-mediated transcription.},

  abstract     = {Diversity-generating retroelements (DGRs) create massive protein sequence variation (up to 1030)1 in ecologically diverse microorganisms. A recent survey identified around 31,000 DGRs from more than 1,500 bacterial and archaeal genera, constituting more than 90 environment types2. DGRs are especially enriched in the human gut microbiome2,3 and nano-sized microorganisms that seem to comprise most microbial life and maintain DGRs despite reduced genomes4,5. DGRs are also implicated in the emergence of multicellularity6,7. Variation occurs during reverse transcription of a protein-encoding RNA template coupled to misincorporation at adenosines. In the prototypical Bordetella bacteriophage DGR, the template must be surrounded by upstream and downstream RNA segments for complementary DNA synthesis to be carried out by a complex of the DGR reverse transcriptase bRT and associated protein Avd. The function of the surrounding RNA was unknown. Here we show through cryogenic electron microscopy that this RNA envelops bRT and lies over the barrel-shaped Avd, forming an intimate ribonucleoprotein. An abundance of essential interactions in the ribonucleoprotein precisely position an RNA homoduplex in the bRT active site for initiation of reverse transcription. Our results explain how the surrounding RNA primes complementary DNA synthesis, promotes processivity, terminates polymerization and strictly limits mutagenesis to specific proteins through mechanisms that are probably conserved in DGRs belonging to distant taxa. This study presents cryogenic electron microscopy structural analysis of a diversity-generating retroelement (DGR) reverse transcription system from Bordetella bacteriophage, with results indicating that RNA surrounding the template controls reverse transcription through&amp;nbsp;mechanisms that are&amp;nbsp;conserved across distant taxa.},

  abstract     = {Identifying phase-separated structures remains challenging, and effective intervention methods are currently lacking1. Here we screened for phase-separated proteins in breast tumour cells and identified forkhead (FKH) box protein M1 (FOXM1) as the most prominent candidate. Oncogenic FOXM1 underwent liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) with FKH consensus DNA element, and compartmentalized the transcription apparatus in the nucleus, thereby sustaining chromatin accessibility and super-enhancer landscapes crucial for tumour metastatic outgrowth. Screening an epigenetics compound library identified AMPK agonists as suppressors of FOXM1 condensation. AMPK phosphorylated FOXM1 in the intrinsically disordered region (IDR), perturbing condensates, reducing oncogenic transcription, accumulating double-stranded DNA to stimulate innate immune responses, and endowing discrete FOXM1 with the ability to activate immunogenicity-related gene expressions. By developing a genetic code-expansion orthogonal system, we demonstrated that a phosphoryl moiety at a specific IDR1 site causes electrostatic repulsion, thereby abolishing FOXM1 LLPS and aggregation. A peptide targeting IDR1 and carrying the AMPK-phosphorylated residue was designed to disrupt FOXM1 LLPS and was shown to inhibit tumour malignancy, rescue tumour immunogenicity and improve tumour immunotherapy. Together, these findings provide novel and in-depth insights on function and mechanism of FOXM1 and develop methodologies that hold promising implications in clinics. The transcription factor FOXM1 forms functional condensates, the formation of which can be targeted with a specific peptide to suppress breast cancer growth and metastasis.},

  abstract     = {Cancer genome alterations often lead to vulnerabilities that can be used to selectively target cancer cells. Various inhibitors of such synthetic lethal targets have been approved by the FDA or are in clinical trials, highlighting the potential of this approach1–3. Here we analysed large-scale CRISPR knockout screening data from the Cancer Dependency Map and identified a new synthetic lethal target, PELO, for two independent molecular subtypes of cancer: biallelic deletion of chromosomal region 9p21.3 or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H). In 9p21.3-deleted cancers, PELO dependency emerges from biallelic deletion of the 9p21.3 gene FOCAD, a stabilizer of the superkiller complex (SKIc). In MSI-H cancers, PELO is required owing to MSI-H-associated mutations in TTC37&amp;nbsp;(also known as&amp;nbsp;SKIC3), a critical component of the SKIc. We show that both cancer subtypes converge to destabilize the SKIc, which extracts mRNA from stalled ribosomes. In SKIc-deficient cells, PELO depletion induces the unfolded protein response, a stress response to accumulation of misfolded or unfolded nascent polypeptides. Together, our findings indicate PELO as a promising therapeutic target for a large patient population with cancers characterized as MSI-H with deleterious TTC37 mutations or with biallelic 9p21.3 deletions involving FOCAD. Analysis of large-scale CRISPR screening data, combined with experiments in patient-derived tumour organoid models, identifies PELO as a potential therapeutic target in chromosomal 9p21.3-deleted cancers and&amp;nbsp;microsatellite-unstable cancers harbouring specific mutations.},

  abstract     = {Synthetic lethality exploits the genetic vulnerabilities of cancer cells to enable a targeted, precision approach to treat cancer1. Over the past 15 years, synthetic lethal cancer target discovery approaches have led to clinical successes of PARP inhibitors2 and ushered several next-generation therapeutic targets such as WRN3, USP14, PKMYT15, POLQ6 and PRMT57 into the clinic. Here we identify, in human cancer, a novel synthetic lethal interaction&amp;nbsp;between the PELO–HBS1L and SKI complexes of the mRNA quality control pathway. In distinct genetic contexts, including 9p21.3-deleted and high microsatellite instability&amp;nbsp;(MSI-H)&amp;nbsp;tumours, we found that phenotypically destabilized SKI complex leads to dependence on the PELO–HBS1L ribosomal rescue complex. PELO–HBS1L and SKI complex synthetic lethality alters the normal cell cycle and drives the unfolded protein response through the activation of IRE1, as well as robust tumour growth inhibition. Our results indicate that PELO and HBS1L represent novel therapeutic targets whose dependence converges upon SKI complex destabilization, a common phenotypic biomarker in diverse genetic contexts representing a significant population of patients with cancer.

  abstract     = {Single-cell RNA&amp;nbsp;sequencing has profiled hundreds of millions of human cells across organs, diseases, development and perturbations to date. Mining these growing atlases could reveal cell–disease associations, identify cell states in unexpected tissue contexts and relate in vivo biology to in vitro models. These require a common measure of cell similarity across the body and an efficient way to search. Here we develop SCimilarity, a metric-learning framework to learn a unified and interpretable representation that enables rapid queries of tens of millions of cell profiles from diverse studies for cells that are transcriptionally similar to an input cell profile or state. We use SCimilarity to query a 23.4-million-cell atlas of 412 single-cell RNA-sequencing studies for macrophage and fibroblast profiles from interstitial lung disease1 and reveal similar cell profiles across other fibrotic diseases and tissues. The top scoring in vitro hit for the macrophage query was a 3D hydrogel system2, which we experimentally demonstrated reproduces this cell state. SCimilarity serves as a foundation model for single-cell profiles that enables researchers to query for similar cellular states across the human body, providing a powerful tool for generating biological insights from the Human Cell Atlas. In a 23.4-million-cell atlas of 412 single-cell RNA-sequencing studies, SCimilarity query of macrophage and fibroblast profiles from interstitial lung disease reveals similar cell profiles across other fibrotic diseases and tissues.},

  abstract     = {Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) are de novo ectopic lymphoid aggregates that regulate immunity in chronically inflamed tissues, including tumours. Although TLSs form due to inflammation-triggered activation of the lymphotoxin (LT)–LTβ receptor (LTβR) pathway1, the inflammatory signals and cells that induce TLSs remain incompletely identified. Here we show that interleukin-33 (IL-33), the alarmin released by inflamed tissues2, induces TLSs. In mice, Il33 deficiency severely attenuates inflammation- and LTβR-activation-induced TLSs in models of colitis and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). In PDAC, the alarmin domain of IL-33 activates group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) expressing LT that engage putative LTβR+ myeloid organizer cells to initiate tertiary lymphoneogenesis. Notably, lymphoneogenic ILC2s migrate to PDACs from the gut, can be mobilized to PDACs in different tissues and are modulated by gut microbiota. Furthermore, we detect putative lymphoneogenic ILC2s and IL-33-expressing cells within TLSs in human PDAC that correlate with improved prognosis. To harness this lymphoneogenic pathway for immunotherapy, we engineer a recombinant human IL-33 protein that expands intratumoural lymphoneogenic ILC2s and TLSs and demonstrates enhanced anti-tumour activity in PDAC mice. In summary, we identify the molecules and cells of a druggable pathway that induces inflammation-triggered TLSs. More broadly, we reveal a lymphoneogenic function for alarmins and ILC2s. IL-33 induces tertiary lymphoid structures.},

  abstract     = {Single-cell genomic technologies enable the multimodal profiling of millions of cells across temporal and spatial dimensions. However, experimental limitations hinder the comprehensive measurement of cells under native temporal dynamics and in their native spatial tissue niche. Optimal transport has emerged as a powerful tool to address these constraints and has facilitated the recovery of the original cellular context1–4. Yet, most optimal transport applications are unable to incorporate multimodal information or scale to single-cell atlases. Here we introduce multi-omics single-cell optimal transport (moscot), a scalable framework for optimal transport in single-cell genomics that supports multimodality across all applications. We demonstrate the capability of moscot to efficiently reconstruct developmental trajectories of 1.7 million cells from mouse embryos across 20 time points. To illustrate the capability of moscot in space, we enrich spatial transcriptomic datasets by mapping multimodal information from single-cell profiles in a mouse liver sample and align multiple coronal sections of the mouse brain. We present moscot.spatiotemporal, an approach that leverages gene-expression data across both spatial and temporal dimensions to uncover the spatiotemporal dynamics of mouse embryogenesis. We also resolve endocrine-lineage relationships of delta and epsilon cells in a previously unpublished mouse, time-resolved pancreas development dataset using paired measurements of gene expression and chromatin accessibility. Our findings are confirmed through experimental validation of NEUROD2 as a regulator of epsilon progenitor cells in a model of human induced pluripotent stem cell islet cell differentiation. Moscot is available as open-source software, accompanied by extensive documentation. Moscot is an optimal transport approach that overcomes current limitations of similar methods to enable multimodal, scalable and consistent single-cell analyses of datasets across spatial and temporal dimensions.},

However, the scope and purpose of this anticommensal immune programme are not well defined, limiting our ability to harness it therapeutically. Here, we show that this colonist also induces a potent, durable and specific antibody response that is conserved in humans and non-human primates. A series of S. epidermidis cell-wall mutants revealed that the cell surface protein Aap is a predominant target. By colonizing mice with a strain of S. epidermidis in which the parallel β-helix domain of Aap is replaced by tetanus toxin fragment C, we elicit a potent neutralizing antibody response that protects mice against a lethal challenge. A similar strain of S. epidermidis expressing an Aap-SpyCatcher chimera can be conjugated with recombinant immunogens; the resulting labelled commensal elicits high antibody titres under conditions of physiologic colonization, including a robust IgA response in the nasal and pulmonary mucosa. Thus, immunity to a common skin colonist involves a coordinated T and B cell response, the latter of which can be redirected against pathogens as a new form of topical vaccination. Staphylococcus epidermidis induces a potent, durable and specific antibody response that is conserved in humans and non-human primates, and which could be redirected against pathogens as a new form of topical vaccination.},

  abstract     = {The microbiota colonizes each barrier site and broadly controls host physiology1. However, when uncontrolled, microbial colonists can also promote inflammation and induce systemic infection2. The unique strategies used at each barrier tissue to control the coexistence of the host with its microbiota remain largely elusive. Here we uncover that, in the skin, host–microbiota symbiosis depends on the ability of the skin to act as an autonomous lymphoid organ. Notably, an encounter with a new skin commensal promotes two parallel responses, both under the control of Langerhans cells. On one hand, skin commensals induce the formation of classical germinal centres in the lymph node associated with immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) and IgG3 antibody responses. On the other hand, microbial colonization also leads to the development of tertiary lymphoid organs in the skin that can locally sustain IgG2b and IgG2c responses. These phenomena are supported by the ability of regulatory T cells to convert into T follicular helper cells. Skin autonomous production of antibodies is sufficient to control local microbial biomass, as well as subsequent systemic infection with the same microorganism. Collectively, these results reveal a compartmentalization of humoral responses to the microbiota allowing for control of both microbial symbiosis and potential pathogenesis. A study reveals that the skin acts as an autonomous lymphoid organ, producing antibodies to control the local biomass of the microbiota and protect against systemic infection, maintaining homeostasis between the host and its microbiota.},

  abstract     = {During motor learning, breaks in practice are known to facilitate behavioural optimizations. Although this process has traditionally been studied over long breaks that last hours to days1–6, recent studies in humans have demonstrated that rapid performance gains during early motor sequence learning are most pronounced after very brief breaks lasting seconds to minutes7–10. However, the precise causal neural mechanisms that facilitate performance gains after brief breaks remain poorly understood. Here we recorded neural ensemble activity in the motor cortex of macaques while they performed a visuomotor sequence learning task interspersed with brief breaks. We found that task-related neural cofiring patterns were reactivated during brief breaks. The rate and content of reactivations predicted the magnitude and pattern of subsequent performance gains. Of note, we found that performance gains and reactivations were positively correlated with cortical ripples (80–120 Hz oscillations) but anti-correlated with β bursts (13–30 Hz oscillations), which ultimately dominated breaks after the fast learning phase plateaued. We then applied 20 Hz epidural alternating current stimulation (ACS) to motor cortex, which reduced reactivation rates in a phase-specific and dose-dependent manner. Notably, 20 Hz ACS also eliminated performance gains. Overall, our results indicate that the reactivations of task ensembles during brief breaks are causal drivers of subsequent performance gains. β bursts compete with this process, possibly to support stable performance. In macaques, motor cortex activity associated with motor learning tasks is reactivated during brief breaks between learning blocks and predicts subsequent performance gains.},

Clusters of neurons in transcriptomic space correspond to distinct cell types and in some cases—for example, Caenorhabditis elegans neurons1 and retinal ganglion cells2–4—have been shown to share morphology and function. The zebrafish optic tectum is composed of a spatial array of neurons that transforms visual inputs into motor outputs. Although the visuotopic map is continuous, subregions of the tectum are functionally specialized5,6. Here, to uncover the cell-type architecture of the tectum, we transcriptionally profiled its neurons, revealing more than 60 cell types that are organized in distinct anatomical layers. We measured the visual responses of thousands of tectal neurons by two-photon calcium imaging and matched them with their transcriptional profiles. Furthermore, we characterized the morphologies of transcriptionally identified neurons using specific transgenic lines. Notably, we found that neurons that are transcriptionally similar can diverge&amp;nbsp;in shape, connectivity and visual responses. Incorporating the spatial coordinates of neurons within the tectal volume revealed functionally and morphologically defined anatomical subclusters within individual transcriptomic clusters. Our findings demonstrate that extrinsic, position-dependent factors expand the phenotypic repertoire of genetically similar neurons.

  abstract     = {Growing evidence indicates that migratory animals exploit the magnetic field of the Earth for navigation, both as a compass to determine direction and as a map to determine geographical position1. It has long been proposed that, to navigate using a magnetic map, animals must learn the magnetic coordinates of the destination2,3, yet the pivotal hypothesis that animals can learn magnetic signatures of geographical areas has, to our knowledge, yet to be tested. Here we report that an iconic navigating species, the loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta), can learn such information. When fed repeatedly in magnetic fields replicating those that exist in particular oceanic locations, juvenile turtles learned to distinguish magnetic fields in which they encountered food from magnetic fields that exist elsewhere, an ability that might underlie foraging site fidelity. Conditioned responses in this new magnetic map assay were unaffected by radiofrequency oscillating magnetic fields, a treatment expected to disrupt radical-pair-based chemical magnetoreception4–6, suggesting that the magnetic map sense of the turtle does not rely on this mechanism. By contrast, orientation behaviour that required use of the magnetic compass was disrupted by radiofrequency oscillating magnetic fields. The findings provide evidence that two different mechanisms of magnetoreception underlie the magnetic map and magnetic compass in sea turtles. Loggerhead sea turtles, which undergo long-distance migrations, can learn magnetic signatures associated with different geographic areas and have two different magnetic senses, each based on a different underlying mechanism.},

We used ancient genome-wide data of 722 individuals and fine-grained interdisciplinary analysis of large seventh- to eighth-century ce neighbouring cemeteries south of Vienna (Austria) to address the centuries-long impact of this encounter1,2. We found that even 200 years after immigration, the ancestry at one site (Leobersdorf) remained dominantly East Asian-like, whereas the other site (Mödling) shows local, European-like ancestry. These two nearby sites show little biological relatedness, despite sharing a distinctive late-Avar culture3,4. We reconstructed six-generation pedigrees at both sites including up to 450 closely related individuals, allowing per-generation demographic profiling of the communities. Despite different ancestry, these pedigrees together with large networks of distant relatedness show absence of consanguinity, patrilineal pattern with female exogamy, multiple reproductive partnerships (for example, levirate) and direct correlation of biological connectivity with archaeological markers of social status. The generation-long genetic barrier was maintained by systematically choosing partners with similar ancestry from other sites in the Avar realm. Leobersdorf had more biological connections with the Avar heartlands than with Mödling, which is instead linked to another site from the Vienna Basin with European-like ancestry. Mobility between sites was mostly due to female exogamy pointing to different marriage networks as the main driver of the maintenance of the genetic barrier.

  abstract     = {Foraminifera are ubiquitous marine protists that intracellularly accumulate phosphate1, an important macronutrient in marine ecosystems and in fertilizer potentially leaked into the ocean. Intracellular phosphate concentrations can be 100–1,000 times higher than in the surrounding water1. Here we show that phosphate storage in foraminifera is widespread, from tidal flats to the deep sea. The total amount of intracellular phosphate stored in the benthic foraminifer Ammonia confertitesta in the Wadden Sea during a bloom is as high as around 5% of the annual consumption of phosphorus (P) fertilizer in Germany. Budget calculations for the Southern North Sea and the Peruvian Oxygen Minimum Zone indicate that benthic foraminifera may buffer riverine P runoff for approximately 37 days at the Southern North Sea and for about 21 days at the Peruvian margin. This indicates that these organisms are probably relevant for marine P cycling—they potentially buffer anthropogenic eutrophication in coastal environments. Phosphate is stored as polyphosphate in cell organelles that are potentially acidocalcisomes. Their metabolic functions can range from regulation of osmotic pressure and intracellular pH to calcium and energy storage. In addition, storage of energetic P compounds, such as creatine phosphate and polyphosphate, is probably an adaptation of foraminifera to O2 depletion. Phosphate storage in foraminifera is found to be widespread, indicating that these organisms are probably relevant for marine phosphorus cycling and potentially buffer anthropogenic eutrophication in coastal environments.},

  abstract     = {Turnover in species composition through time is a dominant form of biodiversity change, which has profound effects on the functioning of ecological communities1–4. Turnover rates differ markedly among communities4, but the drivers of this variation across taxa and realms remain unknown. Here we analyse 42,225 time series of species composition from marine, terrestrial and freshwater assemblages, and show that temporal rates of turnover were consistently faster in locations that experienced faster temperature change, including both warming and cooling. In addition, assemblages with limited access to microclimate refugia or that faced stronger human impacts on land were especially responsive to temperature change, with up to 48% of species replaced per decade. These results reveal a widespread signal of vulnerability to continuing climate change and highlight which ecological communities are most sensitive, raising concerns about ecosystem integrity as climate change and other human impacts accelerate. Global-scale analyses of marine, terrestrial and freshwater assemblages found that temporal rates of species replacement were faster in locations with faster temperature change, including warming and cooling, and vulnerable assemblages were especially responsive.},

  abstract     = {The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), vital for northwards heat transport in the Atlantic Ocean, is projected to weaken owing to global warming1, with significant global climate impacts2. However, the extent of AMOC weakening is uncertain with wide variation across climate models1,3,4 and some statistical indicators suggesting an imminent collapse5. Here we show that the AMOC is resilient to extreme greenhouse gas and North Atlantic freshwater forcings across 34 climate models. Upwelling in the Southern Ocean, driven by persistent Southern Ocean winds, sustains a weakened AMOC in all cases, preventing its complete collapse. As Southern Ocean upwelling must be balanced by downwelling in the Atlantic or Pacific, the AMOC can only collapse if a compensating Pacific Meridional Overturning Circulation (PMOC) develops. Remarkably, a PMOC does emerge in almost all models, but it is too weak to balance all of the Southern Ocean upwelling, suggesting that an AMOC collapse is unlikely this century. Our findings reveal AMOC-stabilizing mechanisms with implications for past and future AMOC changes, and hence for ecosystems and ocean biogeochemistry. They suggest that better understanding and estimates of the Southern Ocean and Indo-Pacific circulations are urgently needed to accurately predict future AMOC change. Climate models suggest that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation is unlikely to collapse this century, owing to stabilization from wind-driven upwelling in the Southern Ocean.},

  abstract     = {The synthesis of a complex molecule begins from an initial design stage1–4 in which possible routes are triaged by strategy and feasibility, on the basis of analogy to similar reactions2,3. However, as molecular complexity increases, predictability decreases5; inevitably, even experienced chemists resort to trial and error to identify viable intermediates en route to the target molecule. We encountered such a problem in the synthesis of picrotoxane sesquiterpenes in which pattern-recognition methods anticipated success, but small variations in structure led to failure. Here, to solve this problem but avoid tedious guess-and-check experimentation, we built a virtual library of elusive late-stage intermediate analogues that were triaged by reactivity and altered the synthesis pathway. The efficiency of this method led to concise routes to 25 naturally occurring picrotoxanes. Costly density-functional-theory transition-state calculations were replaced with faster reactant parameterizations to increase scalability and, in this case, inform the mechanism. This approach can serve as an add-on search to human or computer-assisted synthesis planning applicable to high-complexity targets and/or steps with little representation in the literature or reaction databases. Concise routes to 25 naturally occurring picrotoxanes were devised using a virtual library of intermediate analogues triaged by reactivity; this approach can overcome challenges in the use of computers for synthesis design.},

  abstract     = {Most current strategies for carbon management require CO2 removal (CDR) from the atmosphere on the multi-hundred gigatonne (Gt) scale by 2100 (refs. 1–5). Mg-rich silicate minerals can remove &amp;gt;105 Gt CO2 and sequester it as stable and innocuous carbonate minerals or dissolved bicarbonate ions3,6,7. However, the reaction rates of these minerals under ambient conditions are far too slow for practical use. Here we show that CaCO3 and CaSO4 react quantitatively with diverse Mg-rich silicates (for example, olivine, serpentine and augite) under thermochemical conditions to form Ca2SiO4 and MgO. On exposure to ambient air under wet conditions, Ca2SiO4 is converted to CaCO3 and silicic acid, and MgO is partially converted into a Mg carbonate within weeks, whereas the input Mg silicate shows no reactivity over 6 months. Alternatively, Ca2SiO4 and MgO can be completely carbonated to CaCO3 and Mg(HCO3)2 under 1 atm CO2 at ambient temperature within hours. Using CaCO3 as the Ca source, this chemistry enables a CDR process in which the output Ca2SiO4/MgO material is used to remove CO2 from air or soil and the CO2 process emissions are sequestered. Analysis of the energy requirements indicates that this process could require less than 1 MWh per tonne CO2 removed, approximately half the energy of CO2 capture with leading direct air capture technologies. The chemistry described here could unlock Mg-rich silicates as a vast resource for safe and permanent CDR. Reactions of Mg-rich silicates with calcium carbonates/sulfates result in the formation of materials that could potentially be used for low-cost carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere.},

  abstract     = {In advanced applications such as aerospace and space exploration, materials must balance lightness, functionality and extreme thermal fluctuation resistance1,2. Shape-memory alloys show promise with strength, toughness and substantial strain recovery due to superelasticity, but maintaining low mass and effective operation at cryogenic temperatures is challenging3–6. We hereby introduce a new shape-memory alloy that adheres to these stringent criteria. Predominantly composed of Ti and Al with a chemical composition of Ti75.25Al20Cr4.75, this alloy is characterized by a low density (4.36 × 103 kg m−3) and a high specific strength (185 × 103 Pa m3 per kg) at room temperature, while showing excellent superelasticity. The superelasticity, owing to a reversible stress-induced phase transformation from an ordered body-centred cubic parent phase to an ordered orthorhombic martensite, allows for a recoverable strain exceeding 7%. This functionality persists across a broad range of temperatures, from deep cryogenic 4.2 K to above room temperature, arising from an unconventional temperature dependence of transformation stresses. Below a certain threshold during cooling, the critical transformation stress inversely correlates with temperature. We interpret this behaviour from the perspective of a temperature-dependent anomalous lattice instability of the parent phase. This alloy holds potential in everyday appliances requiring flexible strain accommodation, as well as components designed for extreme environmental conditions such as deep space and liquefied gases. A Ti–Al-based&amp;nbsp;shape-memory alloy&amp;nbsp;adhering to the stringent criteria of lightness, functionality and extreme thermal fluctuation resistance is introduced, showing excellent superelasticity with a&amp;nbsp;recoverable strain exceeding 7%&amp;nbsp;and an ultra-wide temperature window from 4.2 K to 400 K.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors, particularly transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), are promising for advanced electronics beyond silicon1–3. Traditionally, TMDs are epitaxially grown on crystalline substrates by chemical vapour deposition. However, this approach requires post-growth transfer to target substrates, which makes controlling thickness and scalability difficult. Here we introduce a method called hypotaxy (‘hypo’ meaning downward and ‘taxy’ meaning arrangement), which enables wafer-scale single-crystal TMD growth directly on various substrates, including amorphous and lattice-mismatched substrates, while preserving crystalline alignment with an overlying 2D template. By sulfurizing or selenizing a pre-deposited metal film under graphene, aligned TMD nuclei form, coalescing into a single-crystal film as graphene is removed. This method achieves precise MoS2 thickness control from monolayer to hundreds of layers on diverse substrates, producing 4-inch single-crystal MoS2 with high thermal conductivity (about 120 W m−1 K−1) and mobility (around 87 cm2 V−1 s−1). Furthermore, nanopores created in graphene using oxygen plasma treatment allow MoS2 growth at a lower temperature of 400 °C, compatible with back-end-of-line processes. This hypotaxy approach extends to other TMDs, such as MoSe2, WS2 and WSe2, offering a solution to substrate limitations in conventional epitaxy and enabling wafer-scale TMDs for monolithic three-dimensional integration. A new method ‘hypotaxy’ enables wafer-scale, single-crystal transition metal dichalcogenides growth directly on crystalline, lattice-mismatched and amorphous substrates.},

However, it is challenging for ultrasmall CsPbI3 QDs to retain their solution-phase properties when they assemble into conductive films, greatly hindering their device application3,6. Here we report an approach for in situ deposit stabilized ultrasmall CsPbI3 QD conductive solids, by constructing CsPbI3 QD/quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) perovskite heteroepitaxy. The well-aligned periodic array of edge-oriented ligands at heterointerface triggers a substantial octahedral tilting in a critical layer thickness of CsPbI3 QDs, which heightens the Gibbs free energy difference between the tilted-CsPbI3 and δ-CsPbI3 leading to thermodynamic stabilization of CsPbI3 QDs. The approach allows us to fabricate stabilized CsPbI3 QD conductive films with tunable emission covering the entire red spectral region from 600 nm to 710 nm. Here we report the pure-red PeLEDs with narrow electroluminescence peak centred at 630 nm, matching the Rec. 2100 standard for ultrahigh-definition display. The champion device exhibits a certified external quantum efficiency of 24.6% and a half-lifetime of 6,330 min, ranking as one of the most efficient and stable pure-red PeLED reported to date. The approach is also compatible with large-area manufacturing, enabling 1 cm2 PeLED to exhibit the best external quantum efficiency of 20.5% at 630 nm.

  abstract     = {Gas samples relevant to health1–3 and the environment4–6 typically contain many molecular species that span a huge concentration dynamic range. Mid-infrared frequency comb spectroscopy with high-finesse cavity enhancement has allowed the most sensitive multispecies trace-gas detections so far2,7–13. However, the robust performance of this technique depends critically on ensuring absorption-path-length enhancement over a broad spectral coverage, which is severely limited by comb–cavity frequency mismatch if strongly absorbing compounds are present. Here we introduce modulated ringdown comb interferometry, a technique that resolves the vulnerability of comb–cavity enhancement to strong intracavity absorption or dispersion. This technique works by measuring ringdown dynamics carried by massively parallel comb lines transmitted through a length-modulated cavity, making use of both the periodicity of the field dynamics and the Doppler frequency shifts introduced from a Michelson interferometer. As a demonstration, we measure highly dispersive exhaled human breath samples and ambient air in the mid-infrared with finesse improved to 23,000 and coverage to 1,010 cm−1. Such a product of finesse and spectral coverage is orders of magnitude better than all previous demonstrations2,7–20, enabling us to simultaneously quantify 20 distinct molecular species at above 1-part-per-trillion sensitivity varying in concentrations by seven orders of magnitude. This technique unlocks next-generation sensing performance for complex and dynamic molecular compositions, with scalable improvement to both finesse and spectral coverage. A new optical technique, modulated ringdown comb interferometry, is introduced for measuring the concentration of gas species in a complex sample and its efficacy demonstrated using exhaled human breath and ambient air in the mid-infrared.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 has been discovered as a new superconductor with transition temperature Tc near 80 K under high pressure1–3. Despite extensive theoretical and experimental work to understand the nature of its superconductivity4–29, the requirement of extreme pressure restricts the use of many experimental probes and limits its application potential. Here we present signatures of superconductivity in La3Ni2O7 thin films at ambient pressure, facilitated by the application of epitaxial compressive strain. The onset Tc varies roughly from 26 to 42 K, with higher Tc values correlating with smaller in-plane lattice constants. We observed the co-existence of other Ruddlesden–Popper phases within the films and dependence of transport behaviour with ozone annealing, suggesting that the observed low zero resistance Tc of around 2 K can be attributed to stacking defects, grain boundaries and oxygen stoichiometry. This finding initiates numerous opportunities to stabilize and study superconductivity in bilayer nickelates at ambient pressure, and to facilitate the broad understanding of the ever-growing number of high temperature and unconventional superconductors in the transition metal oxides. Signatures of superconductivity in La3Ni2O7 thin films are demonstrated, facilitated by the application of epitaxial compressive strain, suggesting that the observed low zero resistance Tc of around 2 K can be attributed to several factors.},

  abstract     = {To solve problems of practical importance1,2, quantum computers probably need to incorporate quantum error correction, in which a logical qubit is redundantly encoded in many noisy physical qubits3–5. The large physical-qubit overhead associated with error correction motivates the search for more hardware-efficient approaches6–18. Here, using a superconducting quantum circuit19, we realize a logical qubit memory formed from the concatenation of encoded bosonic cat qubits with an outer repetition code of distance d = 5 (ref. 10). A stabilizing circuit passively protects cat qubits against bit flips20–24. The repetition code, using ancilla transmons for syndrome measurement, corrects cat qubit phase flips. We study the performance and scaling of the logical qubit memory, finding that the phase-flip correcting repetition code operates below the threshold. The logical bit-flip error is suppressed with increasing cat qubit mean photon number, enabled by our realization of a cat-transmon noise-biased CX gate. The minimum measured logical error per cycle is on average 1.75(2)% for the distance-3 code sections, and 1.65(3)% for the distance-5 code. Despite the increased number of fault locations of the distance-5 code, the high degree of noise bias preserved during error correction enables comparable performance. These results, where the intrinsic error suppression of the bosonic encodings enables us to use a hardware-efficient outer error-correcting code, indicate that concatenated bosonic codes can be a compelling model for reaching fault-tolerant quantum computation.

  abstract     = {Quantum error correction1–4 provides a path to reach practical quantum computing by combining multiple physical qubits into a logical qubit, in which the logical error rate is suppressed exponentially as more qubits are added. However, this exponential suppression only occurs if the physical error rate is below a critical threshold. Here we present two below-threshold surface code memories on our newest generation of superconducting processors, Willow: a distance-7 code and a distance-5 code integrated with a real-time decoder. The logical error rate of our larger quantum memory is suppressed by a factor of Λ = 2.14 ± 0.02 when increasing the code distance by 2, culminating in a 101-qubit distance-7 code with 0.143% ± 0.003 per cent error per cycle of error correction. This logical memory is also beyond breakeven, exceeding the lifetime of its best physical qubit by a factor of 2.4 ± 0.3. Our system maintains below-threshold performance when decoding in real time, achieving an average decoder latency of 63 microseconds at distance 5 up to a million cycles, with a cycle time of 1.1 microseconds. We also run repetition codes up to distance 29 and find that logical performance is limited by rare correlated error events, occurring approximately once every hour or 3 × 109 cycles. Our results indicate device performance that, if scaled, could realize the operational requirements of large-scale fault-tolerant quantum algorithms. Two below-threshold surface code memories on superconducting processors markedly reduce logical error rates, achieving high efficiency and real-time decoding, indicating potential for practical large-scale fault-tolerant quantum algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Photonics offers a promising platform for quantum computing1–4, owing to the availability of chip integration for mass-manufacturable modules, fibre optics for networking and room-temperature operation of most components. However, experimental demonstrations are needed of complete integrated systems comprising all basic functionalities for universal and fault-tolerant operation5. Here we construct a (sub-performant) scale model of a quantum computer using 35 photonic chips to demonstrate its functionality and feasibility. This combines all the primitive components as discrete, scalable rack-deployed modules networked over fibre-optic interconnects, including 84 squeezers6 and 36 photon-number-resolving detectors furnishing 12 physical qubit modes at each clock cycle. We use this machine, which we name Aurora, to synthesize a cluster state7 entangled across separate chips with 86.4 billion modes, and demonstrate its capability of implementing the foliated distance-2 repetition code with real-time decoding. The key building blocks needed for universality and fault tolerance are demonstrated: heralded synthesis of single-temporal-mode non-Gaussian resource states, real-time multiplexing actuated on photon-number-resolving detection, spatiotemporal cluster-state formation with fibre buffers, and adaptive measurements implemented using chip-integrated homodyne detectors with real-time single-clock-cycle feedforward. We also present a detailed analysis of our architecture’s tolerances for optical loss, which is the dominant and most challenging hurdle to crossing the fault-tolerant threshold. This work lays out the path to cross the fault-tolerant threshold and scale photonic quantum computers to the point of addressing useful applications. A proof-of-principle study reports a complete photonic quantum computer architecture that can, once appropriate component performance is achieved, deliver a universal and fault-tolerant quantum computer.},

  abstract     = {Mass-spectrometry&amp;nbsp;(MS)-based proteomics has evolved into a powerful tool for comprehensively analysing biological systems. Recent technological advances have markedly increased sensitivity, enabling single-cell proteomics and spatial profiling of tissues. Simultaneously, improvements in throughput and robustness are facilitating clinical applications. In this Review, we present the latest developments in proteomics technology, including novel sample-preparation methods, advanced instrumentation and innovative data-acquisition strategies. We explore how these advances drive progress in key areas such as protein–protein interactions, post-translational modifications and structural proteomics. Integrating artificial intelligence into the proteomics workflow accelerates data analysis and biological interpretation. We discuss the application of proteomics to single-cell analysis and spatial profiling, which can provide unprecedented insights into cellular heterogeneity and tissue architecture. Finally, we examine the transition of proteomics from basic research to clinical practice, including biomarker discovery in body fluids and the promise and challenges of implementing proteomics-based diagnostics. This Review provides a broad and high-level overview of the current state of proteomics and its potential to revolutionize our understanding of biology and transform medical practice. This Review summarizes advances in mass-spectrometry-based proteomics and explores the potential applications of these technologies in the clinic.},

  abstract     = {Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) has a central role in lipid and cholesterol metabolism and is a key agent in the development and progression of atherosclerosis, the leading cause of mortality worldwide1,2. Apolipoprotein B100 (apoB100), one of the largest proteins in the genome, is the primary structural and functional component of LDL, yet its size and complex lipid associations have posed major challenges for structural studies3. Here we present the structure of apoB100 resolved to subnanometre resolution in most regions using an integrative approach of cryo-electron microscopy, AlphaFold24 and molecular-dynamics-based refinement5. The structure consists of a large globular N-terminal domain and an approximately 61-nm-long continuous amphipathic β-sheet that wraps around the LDL particle like a belt. Distributed quasi-symmetrically across the two sides of the β-belt are nine strategically located interstrand inserts that extend across the lipid surface to provide additional structural support through a network of long-range interactions. We further compare our structure to a comprehensive list of more than 200 intramolecular cross-links and find close agreement between the two. These results suggest a mechanism for how the various domains of apoB100 act in concert to maintain LDL shape and cohesion across a range of particle sizes. More generally, they advance our fundamental understanding of LDL synthesis, form and function, and will help to accelerate the design of potential therapeutics. The structure of apolipoprotein B100 provides insights into how the various domains of apoB100 act in concert to maintain low-density lipoprotein shape and cohesion across a range of particle sizes.},

  abstract     = {Apolipoprotein B100 (apoB100) is a structural component of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and a ligand for the LDL receptor (LDLR)1. Mutations in apoB100 or in LDLR cause familial hypercholesterolaemia, an autosomal dominant disease that is characterized by a marked increase in LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) and a higher risk of cardiovascular disease2. The structure of apoB100 on LDL and its interaction with LDLR are poorly understood. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structures of apoB100&amp;nbsp;on LDL bound to the LDLR&amp;nbsp;and a nanobody complex, which can form a C2-symmetric, higher-order complex. Using local refinement, we determined high-resolution structures of the interfaces between apoB100 and LDLR. One binding interface is formed between several small-ligand-binding modules of LDLR and a series of basic patches that are scattered along a β-belt formed by apoB100, encircling LDL. The other binding interface is formed between the β-propeller domain of LDLR and the N-terminal domain of apoB100. Our results reveal how both interfaces are involved in LDL dimer formation, and how LDLR cycles between LDL- and self-bound conformations. In addition, known mutations in either apoB100 or LDLR, associated with high levels of LDL-C,&amp;nbsp;are located at the LDL–LDLR interface. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of apolipoprotein B100 (apoB100) in complex with the LDL receptor (LDLR) provide insight into binding interfaces and explain how mutations in apoB100 or in LDLR can give rise to familial hypercholesterolaemia.},

  abstract     = {Rubisco is the primary CO2-fixing enzyme of the biosphere1, yet it has slow kinetics2. The roles of evolution and chemical mechanism in constraining its biochemical function remain debated3,4. Engineering efforts aimed at adjusting the biochemical parameters of rubisco have largely failed5, although recent results indicate that the functional potential of rubisco has a wider scope than previously known6. Here we developed a massively parallel assay, using an engineered Escherichia coli7 in which enzyme activity is coupled to growth, to systematically map the sequence–function landscape of rubisco. Composite assay of more than 99% of single-amino acid mutants versus CO2 concentration enabled inference of enzyme velocity and apparent CO2 affinity parameters for thousands of substitutions. This approach identified many highly conserved positions that tolerate mutation and rare mutations that improve CO2 affinity. These data indicate that non-trivial biochemical changes are readily accessible and that the functional distance between rubiscos from diverse organisms can be traversed, laying the groundwork for further enzyme engineering efforts. A massively parallel assay developed to map the essential photosynthetic enzyme rubisco showed that non-trivial biochemical changes and improvements in CO2 affinity are possible, signposting further enzyme engineering efforts to increase crop yields.},

Here we find that sequence-dependent DNA shape dictates packaging of pericentromeric satellites in female meiosis through a conserved DNA-shape-recognizing chromatin architectural protein, high mobility group AT-hook 1 (HMGA1)4,5. Pericentromeric heterochromatin in two closely related mouse species, M. musculus and M. spretus, forms on divergent satellites that differ by both density of narrow DNA minor grooves and HMGA1 recruitment. HMGA1 binds preferentially to M. musculus satellites, and depletion in M. musculus oocytes causes massive stretching of pericentromeric satellites, disruption of kinetochore organization and delays in bipolar spindle assembly. In M. musculus&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;spretus hybrid oocytes, HMGA1 depletion disproportionately impairs M. musculus pericentromeres and microtubule attachment to their kinetochores. Thus, DNA shape affects both pericentromere packaging and the segregation machinery. We propose that rapid evolution of centromere and pericentromere DNA does not disrupt these essential processes when the satellites adopt DNA shapes recognized by conserved architectural proteins (such as HMGA1). By packaging these satellites, architectural proteins become part of the centromeric and pericentromeric chromatin, suggesting an evolutionary strategy that lowers the cost of megabase-scale satellite expansion. Divergent satellite DNA shapes influence architectural protein binding and chromatin organization in two mouse species so that the satellites can be packaged and centromere function maintained, mitigating the evolutionary cost of satellite DNA expansion.},

  abstract     = {Despite recent advances in mammalian synthetic biology, there remains a lack of modular synthetic receptors that can robustly respond to soluble ligands and, in turn, activate bespoke cellular functions. Such receptors would have extensive clinical potential to regulate the activity of engineered therapeutic cells, but so far only receptors against cell-surface targets have approached clinical translation1. To address this gap, here we adapt a receptor architecture called the synthetic intramembrane proteolysis receptor (SNIPR) for activation by soluble ligands. Our SNIPR platform can be activated by both natural and synthetic soluble factors, with notably low baseline activity and high fold activation, through an endocytic, pH-dependent cleavage mechanism. We demonstrate the therapeutic capabilities of the receptor platform by localizing the activity of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells to solid tumours in which soluble disease-associated factors are expressed, bypassing the major hurdle of on-target off-tumour toxicity in bystander organs. We further apply the SNIPR platform to engineer fully synthetic signalling networks between cells orthogonal to natural signalling pathways, expanding the scope of synthetic biology. Our design framework enables cellular communication and environmental interactions, extending the capabilities of synthetic cellular networking in clinical and research contexts. A synthetic receptor platform that enables mammalian cells to respond to soluble factors allows specific signalling networks to be precisely controlled, with a variety of therapeutic applications.},

  abstract     = {Endocytosis and lysosomal trafficking of cell surface receptors can be triggered by endogenous ligands. Therapeutic approaches such as lysosome-targeting chimaeras1,2 (LYTACs) and cytokine receptor-targeting chimeras3 (KineTACs) have used this to target specific proteins for degradation by fusing modified native ligands to target binding proteins. Although powerful, these approaches can be limited by competition with native ligands and requirements for chemical modification that limit genetic encodability and can complicate manufacturing, and, more generally, there may be no native ligands that stimulate endocytosis through a given receptor. Here we describe computational design approaches for endocytosis-triggering binding proteins (EndoTags) that overcome these challenges. We present EndoTags for insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor (IGF2R) and asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR), sortilin and transferrin receptors, and show that fusing these tags to soluble or transmembrane target protein binders leads to lysosomal trafficking and target degradation. As these receptors have different tissue distributions, the different EndoTags could enable targeting of degradation to different tissues. EndoTag fusion to a PD-L1 antibody considerably increases efficacy in a mouse tumour model compared to antibody alone. The modularity and genetic encodability of EndoTags enables AND gate control for higher-specificity&amp;nbsp;targeted degradation, and the localized secretion of degraders from engineered cells. By promoting endocytosis, EndoTag fusion increases signalling through an engineered ligand–receptor system by nearly 100-fold. EndoTags have considerable therapeutic potential as targeted degradation inducers, signalling activators for endocytosis-dependent pathways, and cellular uptake inducers for targeted antibody–drug and antibody–RNA conjugates. Computationally designed genetically encoded proteins can be used to target surface proteins, thereby triggering endocytosis and subsequent intracellular degradation, activating signalling or increasing cellular uptake in specific tissues.},

  abstract     = {Cancer cells require high levels of iron for rapid proliferation, leading to significant upregulation of cell-surface transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), which mediates iron uptake by binding to the iron-carrying protein transferrin1–3. Leveraging this phenomenon and the fast endocytosis rate of TfR1 (refs. 4,5), we developed transferrin receptor targeting chimeras (TransTACs), a heterobispecific antibody modality for membrane protein degradation. TransTACs are engineered to drive rapid co-internalization of a target protein of interest and TfR1 from the cell surface, and to enable target protein entry into the lysosomal degradation pathway. We show that TransTACs can efficiently degrade a diverse range of single-pass, multi-pass, native or synthetic membrane proteins, including epidermal growth factor receptor, programmed cell death 1 ligand 1, cluster of differentiation 20 and chimeric antigen receptor. In example applications, TransTACs enabled the reversible control of human primary chimeric antigen receptor T cells and the targeting of drug-resistant epidermal growth factor receptor-driven lung cancer with the exon 19 deletion/T790M/C797S mutations in a mouse xenograft model. TransTACs represent a promising new family of bifunctional antibodies for precise manipulation of membrane proteins and targeted cancer therapy. Transferrin receptor targeting chimeras have been developed that enable targeting of drug resistance in epidermal growth factor receptor-driven lung cancer and reversible control of human primary chimeric antigen receptor T cells, representing a promising new family of bifunctional antibodies for targeted cancer therapy.},

However, methods for measuring the organization of effector proteins at CREs across the genome are limited, hampering efforts to connect CRE structure to their function in cell fate and disease. Here we developed PRINT, a computational method that identifies footprints of DNA–protein interactions from bulk and single-cell chromatin accessibility data across multiple scales of protein size. Using these multiscale footprints, we created the seq2PRINT framework, which uses deep learning to allow precise inference of transcription factor and nucleosome binding and interprets regulatory logic at CREs. Applying seq2PRINT to single-cell chromatin accessibility data from human bone marrow, we observe sequential establishment and widening of CREs centred on pioneer factors across haematopoiesis. We further discover age-associated alterations in the structure of CREs in murine haematopoietic stem cells, including widespread reduction of nucleosome footprints and gain of de novo identified Ets composite motifs. Collectively, we establish a method for obtaining rich insights into DNA-binding protein dynamics from chromatin accessibility data, and reveal the architecture of regulatory elements across differentiation and ageing.

Artificial intelligence approaches that can effectively integrate multimodal data hold significant promise in advancing clinical care1,2. However, the scarcity of well-annotated multimodal datasets in clinical settings has hindered the development of useful models. In this study, we developed the Multimodal transformer with Unified maSKed modeling (MUSK), a vision–language foundation model designed to leverage large-scale, unlabelled, unpaired image and text data. MUSK was pretrained on 50 million pathology images from 11,577 patients and one billion pathology-related text tokens using unified masked modelling. It was further pretrained on one million pathology image–text pairs to efficiently align the vision and language features. With minimal or no further training, MUSK was tested in a wide range of applications and demonstrated superior performance across 23 patch-level and slide-level benchmarks, including image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval, visual question answering, image classification and molecular biomarker prediction. Furthermore, MUSK showed strong performance in outcome prediction, including melanoma relapse prediction, pan-cancer prognosis prediction and immunotherapy response prediction in lung and gastro-oesophageal cancers. MUSK effectively combined complementary information from pathology images and clinical reports and could potentially improve diagnosis and precision in cancer therapy. Trained on unlabelled, unpaired image and text data, the Multimodal transformer with Unified maSKed modeling excelled in outcome prediction, image-to-text retrieval and visual question answering, potentially improving cancer diagnosis and therapy precision.},

  abstract     = {Tolerance to dietary antigens is critical for avoiding deleterious type 2 immune responses resulting in food allergy (FA) and anaphylaxis1,2. However, the mechanisms resulting in both the maintenance and failure of tolerance to food antigens are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that the goblet-cell-derived resistin-like molecule β (RELMβ)3,4 is a critical regulator of oral tolerance. RELMβ is abundant in the sera of both patients with FA and mouse models of FA. Deletion of RELMβ protects mice from FA&amp;nbsp;and the development of food-antigen-specific IgE and anaphylaxis. RELMβ disrupts food tolerance through the modulation of the gut microbiome and depletion of indole-metabolite-producing Lactobacilli and Alistipes. Tolerance is maintained by the local production of indole derivatives driving FA protective RORγt+ regulatory T (Treg) cells5 through activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. RELMβ antagonism in the peri-weaning period restores oral tolerance and protects genetically prone offspring from developing FA later in life. Together, we show that RELMβ mediates a gut immune–epithelial circuit regulating tolerance to food antigens—a novel&amp;nbsp;mode of innate control of adaptive immunity through microbiome editing—and identify targetable candidates in this circuit for prevention and treatment of FA.

  abstract     = {Nutrient acquisition is crucial for sustaining life. Plants develop beneficial intracellular partnerships with arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) and nitrogen-fixing bacteria to surmount the scarcity of soil nutrients and tap into atmospheric dinitrogen, respectively1,2. Initiation of these root endosymbioses requires symbiont-induced oscillations in nuclear calcium (Ca2+) concentrations in root cells3. How the nuclear-localized ion channels, cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (CNGC) 15 and DOESN’T MAKE INFECTIONS1 (DMI1)4 are coordinated to specify symbiotic-induced nuclear Ca2+ oscillations remains unknown. Here we discovered an autoactive CNGC15 mutant that generates spontaneous low-frequency Ca2+ oscillations. While CNGC15 produces nuclear Ca2+ oscillations via a gating mechanism involving its helix 1, DMI1 acts as a pacemaker to specify the frequency of the oscillations. We demonstrate that the specificity of symbiotic-induced nuclear Ca2+ oscillations is encoded in its frequency. A high frequency activates endosymbiosis programmes, whereas a low frequency modulates phenylpropanoid pathways. Consequently, the autoactive cngc15 mutant, which is capable of generating both frequencies, has increased flavonoids that enhance AM, root nodule symbiosis and nutrient acquisition. We transferred this trait to wheat, resulting in field-grown wheat with increased AM colonization and nutrient acquisition. Our findings reveal a new strategy to boost endosymbiosis in the field and reduce inorganic fertilizer use while sustaining plant growth. Nuclear calcium oscillations initiate plant–arbuscular mycorrhiza&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;nitrogen-fixing bacteria symbioses for nutrient acquisition, with a newly discovered autoactive CNGC15 mutant enhancing these partnerships, potentially improving crop nutrition and reducing inorganic fertilizer dependence.},

  abstract     = {Hippocampal circuits in the brain enable two distinct cognitive functions: the construction of spatial maps for navigation, and the storage of sequential episodic memories1–5. Although there have been advances in modelling spatial representations in the hippocampus6–10, we lack good models of its role in episodic memory. Here we present a neocortical–entorhinal–hippocampal network model that implements a high-capacity general associative memory, spatial memory and episodic memory. By factoring content storage from the dynamics of generating error-correcting stable states, the circuit (which we call vector hippocampal scaffolded heteroassociative memory (Vector-HaSH)) avoids the memory cliff of prior memory models11,12, and instead exhibits a graceful trade-off between number of stored items and recall detail. A pre-structured internal scaffold based on grid cell states is essential for constructing even non-spatial episodic memory: it enables high-capacity sequence memorization by abstracting the chaining problem into one of learning low-dimensional transitions. Vector-HaSH reproduces several hippocampal experiments on spatial mapping and context-based representations, and provides a circuit model of the ‘memory palaces’ used by memory athletes13. Thus, this work provides a unified understanding of the spatial mapping and associative and episodic memory roles of the hippocampus. A neocortical–entorhinal–hippocampal network model based on grid cell states recapitulates experimental results and reconciles the spatial, associative and episodic memory roles of the hippocampus.},

  abstract     = {DNA is subject to continual damage, leaving each cell with thousands of individual DNA lesions at any given moment1–3. The efficiency of DNA repair means that most known classes of lesion have a half-life of minutes to hours3,4, but the extent to which DNA damage can persist for longer durations remains unknown. Here, using high-resolution phylogenetic trees from 89 donors, we identified mutations arising from 818 DNA lesions that persisted across multiple cell cycles in normal human stem cells from blood, liver and bronchial epithelium5–12. Persistent DNA lesions occurred at increased rates, with distinctive mutational signatures, in donors exposed to tobacco or chemotherapy, suggesting that they can arise from exogenous mutagens. In haematopoietic stem cells, persistent DNA lesions, probably from endogenous sources, generated the characteristic mutational signature SBS1913; occurred steadily throughout life, including in utero; and endured for 2.2 years on average, with 15–25% of lesions lasting at least 3 years. We estimate that on average, a haematopoietic stem cell has approximately eight such lesions at any moment in time, half of which will generate a mutation with each cell cycle. Overall, 16% of mutations in blood cells are attributable to SBS19, and similar proportions of driver mutations in blood cancers exhibit this signature. These data indicate the existence of a family of DNA lesions that arise from endogenous and exogenous mutagens, are present in low numbers per genome, persist for months to years, and can generate a substantial fraction of the mutation burden of somatic cells. Persistent DNA lesions can occur throughout the human lifespan and can remain in the genome of affected cells for several years and generate a substantial proportion of the mutational burden.},

  abstract     = {Population studies provide insights into the interplay between the gut microbiome and geographical, lifestyle, genetic and environmental factors. However, low- and middle-income countries, in which approximately 84% of the world’s population lives1, are not equitably represented in large-scale gut microbiome research2–4. Here we present the AWI-Gen 2 Microbiome Project, a cross-sectional gut microbiome study sampling 1,801 women from Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya and South Africa. By engaging with communities that range from rural and horticultural to post-industrial and&amp;nbsp;urban informal settlements, we capture a far greater breadth of the world’s population diversity. Using shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we identify taxa with geographic and lifestyle associations, including Treponema and Cryptobacteroides species loss and Bifidobacterium species gain in urban populations. We uncover 1,005 bacterial metagenome-assembled genomes, and we identify antibiotic susceptibility as a factor that might drive&amp;nbsp;Treponema succinifaciens absence in urban populations. Finally, we find an HIV infection signature defined by several taxa not previously associated with HIV, including Dysosmobacter welbionis and Enterocloster sp. This study represents the largest population-representative survey of gut metagenomes of African individuals so far, and paired with extensive clinical biomarkers and demographic data, provides extensive opportunity for microbiome-related discovery. A cross-sectional study from four African countries shows the importance of investigating the gut microbiome in previously under-represented populations and provides a framework for equitable microbiome research.},

  abstract     = {Modern humans arrived in Europe more than 45,000 years ago, overlapping at least 5,000 years with Neanderthals1–4. Limited genomic data from these early modern humans have shown that at least two genetically distinct groups inhabited Europe, represented by Zlatý kůň, Czechia3 and Bacho Kiro, Bulgaria2. Here we deepen our understanding of early modern humans by analysing one high-coverage genome and five low-coverage genomes from approximately 45,000-year-old remains from Ilsenhöhle in Ranis, Germany4, and a further high-coverage genome from Zlatý kůň. We show that distant familial relationships link the Ranis and Zlatý kůň individuals and that they were part of the same small, isolated population that represents the deepest known split from the Out-of-Africa lineage. Ranis genomes harbour Neanderthal segments that originate from a single admixture event shared with all non-Africans that we date to approximately 45,000–49,000 years ago. This implies that ancestors of all non-Africans sequenced so far resided in a common population at this time, and further suggests that modern human remains older than 50,000 years from outside Africa represent different non-African populations. High-coverage and low-coverage genomic data for some of the earliest modern humans in Europe provide insights into recent admixture with Neanderthals and familial relationship links with distant communities approximately 45,000 years ago.},

  abstract     = {Mitigating loss of genetic diversity is a major global biodiversity challenge1–4. To meet recent international commitments to maintain genetic diversity within species5,6, we need to understand relationships between threats, conservation management and genetic diversity change. Here we conduct a global analysis of genetic diversity change via meta-analysis of all available temporal measures of genetic diversity from more than three decades of research. We show that within-population genetic diversity is being lost over timescales likely to have been impacted by human activities, and that some conservation actions may mitigate this loss. Our dataset includes 628 species (animals, plants, fungi and chromists) across all terrestrial and most marine realms on Earth. Threats impacted two-thirds of the populations that we analysed, and less than half&amp;nbsp;of the populations analysed received conservation management. Genetic diversity loss occurs globally and is a realistic prediction for many species, especially birds and mammals, in the face of threats such as land use change, disease, abiotic natural phenomena and harvesting or harassment. Conservation strategies designed to improve environmental conditions, increase population growth rates and introduce new individuals (for example, restoring connectivity or performing translocations) may maintain or even increase genetic diversity. Our findings underscore the urgent need for active, genetically informed conservation interventions to halt genetic diversity loss. A comprehensive meta-analysis of global terrestrial and marine genetic diversity covering more than three decades of research demonstrates rapid loss of genetic diversity and identifies conservation interventions that could mitigate this process.},

  abstract     = {Aromatic compounds are used across chemistry and materials science as a result of their stability, characteristic interactions, defined molecular shape and the numerous approaches for their synthesis by a diversity of cyclization reactions1. By contrast, the cleavage of inert aromatic carbon–carbon bonds remained largely unfeasible owing to the unfavourable energetics of disrupting aromaticity on ring opening. For non-aromatic structures, alkene metathesis catalysed by transition-metal alkylidenes is established as one of the most versatile carbon–carbon bond-forming and -breaking reactions2,3. However, despite remarkable advancements, strategies to open aromatic compounds by metathesis remain elusive4. Here we report aromatic ring-opening metathesis (ArROM) for the cleavage of aromatic rings, including tetraphene, naphthalene, indole, benzofuran and phenanthrenes, by using Schrock–Hoveyda molybdenum catalysts. The reactions for each ring system proceed through unique alkylidene intermediates. We further show the possibility for stereoselective ArROM with exquisite catalyst control over the configuration of atropisomers. ArROM is, therefore, a viable and efficient approach to catalytically transform and interconvert various aromatics without the requirement for any reagents or photoexcitation. Aromatic ring-opening metathesis using Schrock–Hoveyda molybdenum catalysts enables the efficient cleavage of stable aromatic compounds such as tetraphene and naphthalene, offering controlled transformations without reagents or photoexcitation and overcoming previous challenges in aromatic bond cleavage.},

  abstract     = {The use of reactive supports to disperse metal species is crucial for constructing highly efficient interfacial catalysts, by tuning the competitive reactant adsorption–activation pattern in supported metal catalysts into a non-competitive mechanism1–3. However, these reactive supports are prone to deterioration during catalysis, limiting the lifespan of the catalyst and their potential practical applications4. New strategies are needed to simultaneously protect reactive supports and surface metal species without compromising the inherent catalytic performance. Here we report a new strategy to augment the structural stability of highly active interfacial catalysts by using inert nano-overlays to partially shield and partition the surface of the reactive support. Specifically, we demonstrate that atomically dispersed inert oxide nano-overlays on a highly active Pt/γ-Mo2N catalyst can block the redundant surface sites of γ-Mo2N responsible for surface oxidation of this reactive support and the resulting deactivation. This strategy yields an efficient and highly durable catalyst for hydrogen production by methanol-reforming reaction with a mere 0.26 wt% Pt loading, exhibiting a record-high turnover number, to our knowledge, of 15,300,000 and a notable apparent turnover frequency of $$\mathrm{24,500}\,{\text{mol}}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}\,{\text{mol}}_{{\rm{metal}}}^{-1}\,{\text{h}}^{-1}$$ . This innovative approach showcases the prospects of reducing noble metal consumption and boosting longevity, which could be applied to design effective and stable heterogeneous catalysts.

  abstract     = {Zinc is emerging as a key material for next-generation biodegradable implants1–5. However, its inherent softness limits its use in load-bearing orthopaedic implants. Although reducing the grain size of zinc can make it stronger, it also destabilizes its mechanical properties and thus makes it less durable at body temperature6. Here we show that extruded Zn alloys of dilute compositions can achieve ultrahigh strength and excellent durability when their micron-scale grain size is increased while maintaining a basal texture. In this inverse Hall–Petch effect, the dominant deformation mode changes from inter-granular grain boundary sliding and dynamic recrystallization at the original grain size to intra-granular pyramidal slip and unusual twinning at the increased grain size. The role of the anomalous twins, termed ‘accommodation twins’ in this work, is to accommodate the altered grain shape in the plane lying perpendicular to the external loading direction, in contrast to the well-known ‘mechanical twins’ whose role is to deliver plasticity along the external loading direction7,8. The strength level achieved in these dilute zinc alloys is nearly double those of biodegradable implants made of magnesium alloys—making them the strongest and most stable biodegradable alloys available, to our knowledge, for fabricating bone fixation implants. Extruded zinc alloys of dilute compositions can achieve ultrahigh strength and excellent durability when their micron-scale grain size is increased.},

  abstract     = {Lithium (Li) ions are central to the energy storing functionality of rechargeable batteries1. Present technology relies on sophisticated Li-inclusive electrode materials to provide Li ions and exactingly protect them to ensure a decent lifetime2. Li-deficient materials are thus excluded from battery design, and the battery fails when active Li ions are consumed3. Our study breaks this limit by means of a cell-level Li supply strategy. This involves externally adding an organic Li salt into an assembled cell, which decomposes during cell formation, liberating Li ions and expelling organic ligands as gases. This non-invasive and rapid process preserves cell integrity without necessitating disassembly. We leveraged machine learning to discover such functional salts and identified lithium trifluoromethanesulfinate (LiSO2CF3) with optimal electrochemical activity, potential, product formation, electrolyte solubility and specific capacity. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrated a 3.0 V, 1,192 Wh kg−1 Li-free cathode, chromium oxide, in the anode-less cell, as well as an organic sulfurized polyacrylonitrile cathode incorporated in a 388 Wh kg−1 pouch cell with a 440-cycle life. These systems exhibit improved energy density, enhanced sustainability and reduced cost compared with conventional Li-ion batteries. Furthermore, the lifetime of commercial LiFePO4 batteries was extended by at least an order of magnitude. With repeated external Li supplies, a commercial graphite|LiFePO4 cell displayed a capacity retention of 96.0% after 11,818 cycles. A strategy is reported that improves the performance and lifetime of lithium-ion batteries by adding organic Li salt after assembly, which decomposes during cell formation, liberating Li ions and expelling organic ligands as gases.},

Here we report a low-cost, green-solvent-based holistic recycling strategy to restore all valuable components from perovskite PV waste. We develop an efficient aqueous-based perovskite recycling approach that can also rejuvenate degraded perovskites. We further extend the scope of recycling to charge-transport layers, substrates, cover glasses and metal electrodes. After repeated degradation–recycling processes, the recycled devices show similar efficiency and stability compared with the fresh devices. Our holistic recycling strategy reduces by 96.6% resource depletion and by 68.8% human toxicity (cancer effects) impacts associated with perovskite PVs compared with the landfill treatment.

  abstract     = {When two insulating, neutral materials are contacted and separated, they exchange electrical charge1. Experiments have long suggested that this ‘contact electrification’ is transitive, with different materials ordering into ‘triboelectric series’ based on the sign of charge acquired2. At the same time, the effect is plagued by unpredictability, preventing consensus on the mechanism and casting doubt on the rhyme and reason that series imply3. Here we expose an unanticipated connection between the unpredictability and order in contact electrification: nominally identical materials initially exchange charge randomly and intransitively, but—over repeated experiments—order into triboelectric series. We find that this evolution is driven by the act of contact itself—samples with more contacts in their history charge negatively to ones with fewer contacts. Capturing this ‘contact bias’ in a minimal model, we recreate both the initial randomness and ultimate order in numerical simulations and use it experimentally to force the appearance of a triboelectric series of our choosing. With a set of surface-sensitive techniques to search for the underlying alterations contact creates, we only find evidence of nanoscale morphological changes, pointing to a mechanism strongly coupled with mechanics. Our results highlight the centrality of contact history in contact electrification and suggest that focusing on the unpredictability that has long plagued the effect may hold the key to understanding it. Nominally identical materials are found to spontaneously order into triboelectric series over repeated processes, which is found to be driven by the act of contact itself using&amp;nbsp;experiments as well as numerical simulations.},

However, limitations in model capabilities raise key challenges in integrating these technologies more fully into creative practices. Iterative tweaking and divergent thinking remain key to enabling creativity support using technology6,7, yet these practices are insufficiently supported by state-of-the-art generative AI models. Using game development as a lens, we demonstrate that we can make use of an understanding of user needs to drive the development and evaluation of generative AI models in a way that aligns with these creative practices. Concretely, we introduce a state-of-the-art generative model, the World and Human Action Model (WHAM), and show that it can generate consistent and diverse gameplay sequences and persist user modifications—three capabilities that we identify as being critical for this alignment. In contrast to previous approaches to creativity support tools that required manually defining or extracting structure for relatively narrow domains, generative AI models can learn relevant structure from available data, opening the potential for a much broader range of applications. A state-of-the-art generative artificial intelligence model of a video game is introduced to allow the support of human creative ideation, with the analysis of user study data highlighting three necessary capabilities, namely, consistency, diversity and persistency.},

  abstract     = {The fusion of non-Abelian anyons is a fundamental operation in measurement-only topological quantum computation1. In one-dimensional topological superconductors (1DTSs)2–4, fusion amounts to a determination of the shared fermion parity of Majorana zero modes (MZMs). Here we introduce a device architecture5 that is compatible with future tests of fusion rules. We implement a single-shot interferometric measurement of fermion parity6–11 in indium arsenide–aluminium heterostructures with a gate-defined superconducting nanowire12–14. The interferometer is formed by tunnel-coupling the proximitized nanowire to quantum dots. The nanowire causes a state-dependent shift of the quantum capacitance of these quantum dots of up to 1 fF. Our quantum-capacitance measurements show flux h/2e-periodic bimodality with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 1 in 3.6 μs at optimal flux values. From the time traces of the quantum-capacitance measurements, we extract a dwell time in the two associated states that is longer than 1 ms at in-plane magnetic fields of approximately 2 T. We discuss the interpretation of our measurements in terms of both topologically trivial and non-trivial origins. The large capacitance shift and long poisoning time enable a parity measurement with an assignment error probability of 1%. A device architecture based on indium arsenide–aluminium heterostructures with a gate-defined superconducting nanowire allows single-shot interferometric measurement of fermion parity and demonstrates an assignment error probability of 1%.},

  abstract     = {Crystal symmetry guides the development of condensed matter. The unique crystal symmetry connecting magnetic sublattices not only distinguishes altermagnetism1–6 from ferromagnetism and conventional antiferromagnetism but also enables it to combine the advantages of ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism4,5. Altermagnetic order is essentially&amp;nbsp;a magnetic crystal order7, determined by the magnetic-order (Néel) vector and crystal symmetry. Previous experimental studies have concentrated on manipulating the altermagnetic symmetry by tuning the Néel vector orientations8–12. However, manipulation of the crystal symmetry, which holds great promise for manipulating the altermagnetic order, remains challenging. Here we realize the manipulation of altermagnetic order in chromium antimonide (CrSb) films via crystal symmetry. The locking between the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya vector and the magnetic space symmetry helps to reconstruct the altermagnetic order, from a collinear Néel vector to a canted one. It generates a room-temperature spontaneous anomalous Hall effect in an altermagnet. The relative direction between the current-induced spin polarization and the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya vector determines the switching modes of altermagnetic order, that is, parallel for the field-assisted mode in CrSb $$(1\bar{1}00)$$ /Pt and non-parallel for the field-free mode in W/CrSb $$(11\bar{2}0)$$ . The Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya vector induces an asymmetric energy barrier in the field-assisted mode and generates an asymmetric driving force in the field-free mode. In particular, the latter is guaranteed by the emerging Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya torque in altermagnets. Reconstructing crystal symmetry adds a&amp;nbsp;new twist to the manipulation of altermagnetic order. It not only underpins the magnetic-memory and nano-oscillator technology4,5 but also inspires crossover studies between altermagnetism and other research topics. The altermagnetic order in CrSb films can be manipulated via crystal symmetry; the reconstructed altermagnetic order generates a room-temperature spontaneous anomalous Hall effect and designable&amp;nbsp;switching modes&amp;nbsp;as field-assisted and field-free modes.},

  abstract     = {Despite their high relative abundance in our Universe, neutrinos are the least understood fundamental particles of nature. In fact, the quantum properties of neutrinos emitted in experimentally relevant sources are theoretically contested1–4 and the spatial extent of the neutrino wavepacket is only loosely constrained by reactor neutrino oscillation data with a spread of 13 orders of magnitude5,6. Here we present a method to directly access this quantity by precisely measuring the energy width of the recoil daughter nucleus emitted in the radioactive decay of beryllium-7. The final state in the decay process contains a recoiling lithium-7 nucleus, which is entangled with an electron neutrino at creation. The lithium-7 energy spectrum is measured to high precision by directly embedding beryllium-7 radioisotopes into a high-resolution superconducting tunnel junction that is operated as a cryogenic sensor. Under this approach, we set a lower limit on the Heisenberg spatial uncertainty of the recoil daughter of 6.2 pm, which implies that the final-state system is localized at a scale more than a thousand times larger than the nucleus itself. From this measurement, the first,&amp;nbsp;to our knowledge, direct lower limit on the spatial extent of a neutrino wavepacket is extracted. These results may have implications in several areas including the theoretical understanding of neutrino properties, the nature of localization in weak nuclear decays and the interpretation of neutrino physics data. An innovative method using superconducting sensors precisely measures the recoil energy of lithium-7 nuclei, setting a lower limit on the spatial extent of neutrino wavepackets, advancing understanding of neutrino properties and weak nuclear decays.},

  abstract     = {Exoplanet surveys have shown a class of abundant exoplanets smaller than Neptune on close, &amp;lt;100-day orbits1–4. These planets form two populations separated by a natural division at about 1.8&amp;nbsp;R⊕ termed the radius valley. It is uncertain whether these populations arose from separate dry versus water-rich formation channels, evolved apart because of long-term atmospheric loss or a combination of both5–14. Here we report observations of ongoing hydrogen loss from two sibling planets, TOI-776 b (1.85 ± 0.13&amp;nbsp;R⊕) and TOI-776 c (2.02 ± 0.14&amp;nbsp;R⊕), the sizes of which near the radius valley and mature (1–4 Gyr) age make them valuable for investigating the origins of the divided population of which they are a part. During the transits of these planets, absorption appeared against the Lyman-α emission of the host star, compatible with hydrogen escape at rates equivalent to 0.03–0.6% and 0.1–0.9% of the total mass per&amp;nbsp;billion years of each planet, respectively. Observations of the outer planet, TOI-776 c, are incompatible with an outflow of dissociated steam, suggesting both it and its inner sibling formed in a dry environment. These observations support the strong role of hydrogen loss in the evolution of close-orbiting sub-Neptunes5–8,15,16. Ongoing hydrogen loss from two sibling exoplanets provides support for the role of such hydrogen loss in the evolution of close-orbiting sub-Neptunes.},

We first outline how recent advances in AI can accelerate breakthroughs in answering key epidemiological questions and we discuss specific AI methods that can be applied to routinely collected infectious disease surveillance data. Second, we elaborate on the social context of AI for infectious disease epidemiology, including issues such as explainability, safety, accountability and ethics. Finally, we summarize some limitations of AI applications in this field and provide recommendations for how infectious disease epidemiology can harness most effectively current and future developments in AI.

  abstract     = {Type A GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) receptors (GABAA receptors) mediate most fast inhibitory signalling in the brain and are targets for drugs that treat epilepsy, anxiety, depression and insomnia and for anaesthetics1,2. These receptors comprise a complex array of 19 related subunits, which form pentameric ligand-gated ion channels. The composition and structure of native GABAA receptors in the human brain have been inferred from subunit localization in tissue1,3, functional measurements and structural analysis from recombinant expression4–7 and in mice8. However, the arrangements of subunits that co-assemble physiologically in native human GABAA receptors remain unknown. Here we isolated α1 subunit-containing&amp;nbsp;GABAA receptors from human patients with epilepsy. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we defined a set of 12 native subunit assemblies and their 3D structures. We address inconsistencies between previous native and recombinant approaches, and reveal details of previously undefined subunit interfaces. Drug-like densities in a subset of these interfaces led us to uncover unexpected activity on the GABAA receptor of antiepileptic drugs and resulted in localization of one of these drugs to the benzodiazepine-binding site. Proteomics and further structural analysis suggest interactions with the auxiliary subunits neuroligin 2 and GARLH4, which localize and modulate GABAA receptors at inhibitory synapses. This work provides a structural foundation for understanding GABAA receptor signalling and targeted pharmacology in the human brain. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of native type A GABA receptors from human brain reveal diverse subunit compositions, protein binding partners and binding sites for antiepileptic drugs.},

Despite remarkable recent progress in accurately designing new self-assembling proteins, the size and complexity of these assemblies has been limited by a reliance on strict symmetry3. Here, inspired by the pseudosymmetry observed in bacterial microcompartments and viral capsids, we developed a hierarchical computational method for designing large pseudosymmetric self-assembling protein nanomaterials. We computationally designed pseudosymmetric heterooligomeric components and used them to create discrete, cage-like protein assemblies with icosahedral symmetry containing 240, 540 and 960 subunits. At 49, 71 and 96 nm diameter, these nanocages are the largest bounded computationally designed protein assemblies generated to date. More broadly, by moving beyond strict symmetry, our work substantially broadens the variety of self-assembling protein architectures that are accessible through design. A new computational method for design of pseudosymmetric self-assembling protein nanomaterials has resulted in purification of cage-like protein assemblies containing 960 subunits with a diameter of 96 nm.},

Electron microscopy confirms the structures of T = 4 cages with 48 (tetrahedral), 96 (octahedral) and 240 (icosahedral) subunits, each with 4 distinct chains and 6 different protein–protein interfaces, and diameters of 33 nm, 43 nm and 75 nm, respectively. Higher triangulation number viruses possess very sophisticated functionalities; our general route to higher triangulation number nanocages should similarly enable a next generation of multiple antigen-displaying vaccine candidates10,11 and targeted delivery vehicles12,13.

  abstract     = {Sequencing-based genetic tests have uncovered a vast array of BRCA2 sequence variants1. Owing to limited clinical, familial and epidemiological data, thousands of variants are considered to be variants of uncertain significance2–4 (VUS). Here we have utilized CRISPR–Cas9-based saturation genome editing in a humanized mouse embryonic stem cell line to determine the functional effect of VUS. We have categorized nearly all possible single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the region that encodes the carboxylate-terminal DNA-binding domain of BRCA2. We have generated function scores for 6,551 SNVs, covering 96.4% of possible SNVs in exons 15–26 spanning BRCA2 residues 2479–3216. These variants include 1,282 SNVs that are categorized as missense VUS in the clinical variant database ClinVar, with 77.2% of these classified as benign and 20.4% classified as pathogenic using our functional score. Our assay provides evidence that 3,384 of the SNVs in the region are benign and 776 are pathogenic. Our classification aligns closely with pathogenicity data from ClinVar, orthogonal functional assays and computational meta predictors. We have integrated our embryonic stem cell-based BRCA2-saturation genome editing dataset with other available evidence and utilized the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics/Association for Molecular Pathology guidelines for clinical classification of all possible SNVs. This classification is available as a sequence–function map and serves as a valuable resource for interpreting unidentified variants in the population and for physicians and genetic counsellors to assess BRCA2 VUS in patients. CRISPR–Cas9-based saturation genome editing in a humanized mouse embryonic stem cell line was used for comprehensive functional characterization of single nucleotide variants in a region of BRCA2, and shows good agreement with existing variant classifications and high predictive power.},

  abstract     = {Germline BRCA2 loss-of function variants, which can be identified through clinical genetic testing, predispose to several cancers1–5. However, variants of uncertain significance limit the clinical utility of test results. Thus, there is a need for functional characterization and clinical classification of all BRCA2 variants to facilitate the clinical management of individuals with these variants. Here we analysed all possible single-nucleotide variants from exons 15 to 26 that encode the BRCA2 DNA-binding domain hotspot for pathogenic missense variants. To enable this, we used saturation genome editing CRISPR–Cas9-based knock-in endogenous targeting of human haploid HAP1 cells6. The assay was calibrated relative to nonsense and silent variants and was validated using pathogenic and benign standards from ClinVar and results from a homology-directed repair functional assay7. Variants (6,959 out of 6,960 evaluated) were assigned to seven categories of pathogenicity based on a VarCall Bayesian model8. Single-nucleotide variants that encode loss-of-function missense variants were associated with increased risks of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. The functional assay results were integrated into models from ClinGen, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, and the Association for Molecular Pathology9 for clinical classification of BRCA2 variants. Using this approach, 91% were classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic or as benign or likely benign. These classified variants can be used to improve clinical management of individuals with a BRCA2 variant.

  abstract     = {During normal cellular homeostasis, unfolded and mislocalized proteins are recognized and removed, preventing the build-up of toxic byproducts1. When protein homeostasis is perturbed during ageing, neurodegeneration or cellular stress, proteins can accumulate several forms of chemical damage through reactive metabolites2,3. Such modifications have been proposed to trigger the selective removal of chemically marked proteins3–6; however, identifying modifications that are sufficient to induce protein degradation has remained challenging. Here, using a semi-synthetic chemical biology approach coupled to cellular assays, we found that C-terminal amide-bearing proteins (CTAPs) are rapidly cleared from human cells. A CRISPR screen identified FBXO31 as a reader of C-terminal amides. FBXO31 is a substrate receptor for the SKP1–CUL1–F-box protein (SCF) ubiquitin ligase SCF–FBXO31, which ubiquitylates CTAPs for subsequent proteasomal degradation. A conserved binding pocket enables FBXO31 to bind to almost any C-terminal peptide bearing an amide while retaining exquisite selectivity over non-modified clients. This mechanism facilitates binding and turnover of endogenous CTAPs that are formed after oxidative stress. A dominant human mutation found in neurodevelopmental disorders reverses CTAP recognition, such that non-amidated neosubstrates are now degraded and FBXO31 becomes markedly toxic. We propose that CTAPs may represent the vanguard of a largely unexplored class of modified amino acid degrons that could provide a general strategy for selective yet broad surveillance of chemically damaged proteins. SCF–FBXO31 scans proteins for C-terminal amidation and marks them for subsequent proteasomal degradation.},

  abstract     = {Breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease whose prognosis and treatment as defined by the expression of three receptors—oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2; encoded by ERBB2)—is insufficient to capture the full spectrum of clinical outcomes and therapeutic vulnerabilities. Previously, we demonstrated that transcriptional and genomic profiles define eleven integrative subtypes with distinct clinical outcomes, including four ER+ subtypes with increased risk of relapse decades after diagnosis1,2. Here, to determine whether these subtypes reflect distinct evolutionary histories, interactions with the immune system and pathway dependencies, we established a meta-cohort of 1,828 breast tumours spanning pre-invasive, primary invasive and metastatic disease with whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing. We demonstrate that breast tumours fall along a continuum constrained by three genomic archetypes. The ER+ high-risk integrative subgroup is characterized by complex focal amplifications, similar to HER2+ tumours, including cyclic extrachromosomal DNA amplifications induced by ER through R-loop formation and APOBEC3B-editing, which arise in pre-invasive lesions. By contrast, triple-negative tumours exhibit genome-wide instability and tandem duplications and are enriched for homologous repair deficiency-like signatures, whereas ER+ typical-risk tumours are largely genomically stable. These genomic archetypes, which replicate in an independent cohort of 2,659 primary tumours, are established early during tumorigenesis, sculpt the tumour microenvironment and are conserved in metastatic disease. These complex structural alterations contribute to replication stress and immune evasion, and persist throughout tumour evolution, unveiling potential vulnerabilities. A study identifies three dominant genomic archetypes of breast cancer induced by discrete mutational processes, describing a continuum of genomic profiles and detailing the mechanisms underlying the progression of breast cancer.},

  abstract     = {Glioblastoma is an incurable brain malignancy. By the time of clinical diagnosis, these tumours exhibit a degree of genetic and cellular heterogeneity that provides few clues to the mechanisms that initiate and drive gliomagenesis1,2. Here, to explore the early steps in gliomagenesis, we utilized conditional gene deletion and lineage tracing in tumour mouse models, coupled with serial magnetic resonance imaging, to initiate and then closely track tumour formation. We isolated labelled and unlabelled cells at multiple stages—before the first visible abnormality, at the time of the first visible lesion, and then through the stages of tumour growth—and subjected cells of each stage to single-cell profiling. We identify a malignant cell state with a neural crest-like gene expression signature that is highly abundant in the early stages, but relatively diminished in the late stage of tumour growth. Genomic analysis based on the presence of copy number alterations suggests that these neural crest-like states exist as part of a heterogeneous clonal hierarchy that evolves with tumour growth. By exploring the injury response in wounded normal mouse brains, we identify cells with a similar signature that emerge following injury and then disappear over time, suggesting that activation of an injury response program occurs during tumorigenesis. Indeed, our experiments reveal a non-malignant injury-like microenvironment that is initiated in the brain following oncogene activation in cerebral precursor cells. Collectively, our findings provide insight into the early stages of glioblastoma, identifying a unique cell state and an injury response program tied to early tumour formation. These findings have implications for glioblastoma therapies and raise new possibilities for early diagnosis and prevention of disease. A study using glioblastoma mouse models, serial magnetic resonance imaging and single-cell profiling details changes in the identity and balance of cellular states from initiation of tumorigenesis to the end point.},

  abstract     = {Inflammatory diseases are often chronic and recurrent, and current treatments do not typically remove underlying disease drivers1. T cells participate in a wide range of inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis2, Crohn’s disease3, oesophagitis4 and multiple sclerosis5,6, and clonally expanded antigen-specific T cells may contribute to disease chronicity and recurrence, in part by forming persistent pathogenic memory. Chronic rhinosinusitis and asthma are inflammatory airway diseases that often present as comorbidities7. Chronic rhinosinusitis affects more than 10% of the general population8. Among these patients, 20–25% would develop nasal polyps, which often require repeated surgical resections owing to a high incidence of recurrence9. Whereas abundant T cells infiltrate the nasal polyps tissue10,11, T cell subsets that drive the disease pathology and promote recurrence are not fully understood. By comparing T cell repertoires in nasal polyp tissues obtained from consecutive surgeries, here we report that persistent CD8+ T cell clones carrying effector memory-like features colonize the mucosal tissue during disease recurrence, and these cells characteristically express the tryptase Granzyme K (GZMK). We find that GZMK cleaves many complement components, including C2, C3, C4 and C5, that collectively contribute to the activation of the complement cascade. GZMK-expressing CD8+ T cells participate in organized tertiary lymphoid structures, and tissue GZMK levels predict the disease severity and comorbidities better than well-established biomarkers such as eosinophilia and tissue interleukin-5. Using a mouse asthma model, we further show that GZMK-expressing CD8+ T cells exacerbate the disease in a manner dependent on the proteolytic activity of GZMK and complements. Genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of GZMK after the disease onset markedly alleviates tissue pathology and restores lung function. Our work identifies a pathogenic CD8+ memory T cell subset that promotes tissue inflammation and recurrent airway diseases by the effector molecule GZMK and suggests GZMK as a potential therapeutic target. Comparing T cells in nasal polyps from repeated surgeries shows that effector memory-like persistent clones colonize the mucosal tissue during disease recurrence and promote inflammation by producing Granzyme K, a complement-activating tryptase, which is a potential therapeutic target.},

However, mice lacking its putative target, protein kinase PKMζ, exhibit normal learning and memory as well as LTP2,3, making the mechanism of ZIP unclear. Here we show that ZIP disrupts LTP by removing surface AMPA receptors through its cationic charge alone. This effect requires endophilin-A2-mediated endocytosis and is fully blocked by drugs suppressing macropinocytosis. ZIP and other cationic peptides remove newly inserted AMPA receptor nanoclusters at potentiated synapses, providing a mechanism by which these peptides erase memories without altering basal synaptic function. When delivered in vivo, cationic peptides can&amp;nbsp;modulate memories on local and brain-wide scales, and these mechanisms can be leveraged to prevent memory loss in a model of traumatic brain injury. Our findings uncover a previously unknown synaptic mechanism by which memories are maintained or lost. Elucidation of the mechanism by which zeta inhibitory peptide erases memories, involving endocytosis of AMPA receptors on potentiated synapses, provides insight into more general mechanisms of memory maintenance and response to traumatic brain injury.},

  abstract     = {The ventrolateral pallial (VLp) excitatory neurons in the claustro-amygdalar complex and piriform cortex (PIR; which forms part of the palaeocortex) form reciprocal connections with the prefrontal cortex (PFC), integrating cognitive and sensory information that results in adaptive behaviours1–5. Early-life disruptions in these circuits are linked to neuropsychiatric disorders4–8, highlighting the importance of understanding their development. Here we reveal that the transcription factors SOX4, SOX11 and TFAP2D have a pivotal role in the development, identity and PFC connectivity of these excitatory neurons. The absence of SOX4 and SOX11 in post-mitotic excitatory neurons results in a marked reduction in the size of the basolateral amygdala complex (BLC), claustrum (CLA) and PIR. These transcription factors control BLC formation through direct regulation of Tfap2d expression. Cross-species analyses, including in humans, identified conserved Tfap2d expression in developing excitatory neurons of BLC, CLA, PIR and the associated transitional areas of the frontal, insular and temporal cortex. Although the loss and haploinsufficiency of Tfap2d yield similar alterations in learned threat-response behaviours, differences emerge in the phenotypes at different Tfap2d dosages, particularly in terms of changes observed in BLC size and BLC–PFC connectivity. This underscores the importance of Tfap2d dosage in orchestrating developmental shifts in BLC–PFC connectivity and behavioural modifications that resemble symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders. Together, these findings reveal key elements of a conserved gene regulatory network that shapes the development and function of crucial VLp excitatory neurons and their PFC connectivity and offer insights into their evolution and alterations in neuropsychiatric disorders. A conserved gene regulatory network involving SOX4, SOX11 and TFAP2D shapes the development of excitatory neurons in ventrolateral pallium and their connectivity with the prefrontal cortex.},

Academic institutions need to take critical decisions on hiring and promotion, while facing external pressure by also being subject to research assessment1–4. Here we present an outlook on research assessment for career progression with specific focus on promotion to full professorship, based on 314 policies from 190 academic institutions and 218 policies from 58 government agencies, covering 32 countries in the Global North and 89 countries in the Global South. We investigated how frequently various promotion criteria are mentioned and carried out a statistical analysis to infer commonalities and differences across policies. Although quantitative methods of assessment remain popular, in agreement with what is found in more geographically restricted studies5–9, they are not omnipresent. We find differences between the Global North and the Global South as well as between institutional and national policies, but less so between disciplines. A preference for bibliometric indicators is more marked in upper-middle-income countries. Although we see some variation, many promotion policies are based on the assumption of specific career paths that become normative rather than embracing diversity. In turn, this restricts opportunities for researchers. These results challenge current practice and have strategic implications for researchers, research managers and national governments. Analysis of policies for promotion criteria to full professor from academic institutions and government agencies worldwide reveals considerable variation in assessment practices, particularly between the Global North and South.},

Infections in bats are largely asymptomatic2,3, indicating limited tissue-damaging inflammation and immunopathology. To investigate the genomic basis of disease resistance, the Bat1K project generated reference-quality genomes of ten bat species, including potential viral reservoirs. Here we describe a systematic analysis covering 115 mammalian genomes that revealed that signatures of selection in immune genes are more prevalent in bats than in other mammalian orders. We found an excess of immune gene adaptations in the ancestral chiropteran branch and in many descending bat lineages, highlighting viral entry and detection factors, and regulators of antiviral and inflammatory responses. ISG15, which is an antiviral gene contributing to hyperinflammation during COVID-19 (refs. 4,5), exhibits key residue changes in rhinolophid and hipposiderid bats. Cellular infection experiments show species-specific antiviral differences and an essential role of protein conjugation in antiviral function of bat ISG15, separate from its role in secretion and inflammation in humans. Furthermore, in contrast to humans, ISG15 in most rhinolophid and hipposiderid bats has strong anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Our work reveals molecular mechanisms that contribute to viral tolerance and disease resistance in bats. A systematic analysis of 115 mammalian genomes, including 10 new bat genomes, reveals prevalent positive selection in immune genes in bats and shows key adaptations in the antiviral gene ISG15 that aid disease resistance in bats, including to coronaviruses.},

Although they have feathered wings, the known Jurassic birds are more similar to non-avialan theropods in having the ancestral long reptilian tail9–11. This is in stark contrast to most Cretaceous and crownward taxa, which have a short tail that terminates in a compound bone called the pygostyle12–14. Here we report on the oldest short-tailed avialan, Baminornis zhenghensis gen. et sp. nov., from the recently discovered Late Jurassic Zhenghe Fauna15, which fills a noticeable spatio-temporal gap in the earliest branching avialan fossil record. B. zhenghensis exhibits a unique combination of derived ornithothoracine-like pectoral and pelvic girdles and plesiomorphic non-avialan maniraptoran hand, demonstrating mosaic evolution along stem avialan line. An avialan furcula collected from the same locality is referrable to ornithuromorphs on the basis of our morphometric and phylogenetic analyses. These newly discovered fossils demonstrate the early appearance of highly derived bird features, and together with an anchiornithine fossil from the same locality, they suggest an earlier origin of birds and a radiation of early birds in the Jurassic. Two recently discovered bird fossils from the Late Jurassic Zhenghe Fauna demonstrate that highly derived bird-like features and the origin of birds appeared much earlier in the Jurassic period than previously estimated.},

  abstract     = {Positive effects of plant diversity on productivity have been globally demonstrated and explained by two main effects: complementarity effects and selection effects1–4. However, plant diversity experiments have shown substantial variation in these effects, with driving factors poorly understood4–6. On the basis of a meta-analysis of 452 experiments across the globe, we show that productivity increases on average by 15.2% from monocultures to species mixtures with an average species richness of 2.6; net biodiversity effects are stronger in grassland and forest experiments and weaker in container, cropland and aquatic ecosystems. Of the net biodiversity effects, complementarity effects and selection effects contribute 65.6% and 34.4%, respectively. Complementarity effects increase with phylogenetic diversity, the mixing of nitrogen-fixing and non-nitrogen-fixing species and the functional diversity of leaf nitrogen contents, which indicate the key roles of niche partitioning, biotic feedback and abiotic facilitation in complementarity effects. More positive selection effects occur with higher species biomass inequality in their monocultures. Complementarity effects increase over time, whereas selection effects decrease over time, and they remain consistent across global variations in climates. Our results provide key insights into understanding global variations in plant diversity effects on productivity and underscore the importance of integrating both complementarity and selection effects into strategies for biodiversity conservation and ecological restoration. A meta-analysis of biodiversity effects on plant productivity found that complementarity effects increased over time whereas selection effects decreased, and both remained consistent across global variations in climate.},

  abstract     = {Enhanced weathering (EW) with agriculture uses crushed silicate rocks to drive carbon dioxide removal (CDR)1,2. If widely adopted on farmlands, it could help achieve net-zero emissions by 20502–4. Here we show, with a detailed US state-specific carbon cycle analysis constrained by resource provision, that EW deployed on agricultural land could sequester 0.16–0.30 GtCO2 yr−1 by 2050, rising to 0.25–0.49 GtCO2 yr−1 by 2070. Geochemical assessment of rivers and oceans suggests effective transport of dissolved products from EW from soils, offering CDR on intergenerational timescales. Our analysis further indicates that EW may temporarily help lower ground-level ozone and concentrations of secondary aerosols in agricultural regions. Geospatially mapped CDR costs show heterogeneity across the USA, reflecting a combination of cropland distance from basalt source regions, timing of EW deployment and evolving CDR rates. CDR costs are highest in the first two decades before declining to about US$100–150 tCO2−1 by 2050, including for states that contribute most to total national CDR. Although EW cannot be a substitute for emission reductions, our assessment strengthens the case for EW as an overlooked practical innovation for helping the USA meet net-zero 2050 goals5,6. Public awareness of EW and equity impacts of EW deployment across the USA require further exploration7,8 and we note that mobilizing an EW industry at the necessary scale could take decades. A state-level analysis of the impact of enhanced weathering deployment on carbon sequestration on agricultural land suggests that enhanced weathering could help the USA meet net-zero 2050 goals.},

  abstract     = {The construction of superlattices with a spatial modulation of chemical compositions allows for the creation of artificial materials with tailorable periodic potential landscapes and tunable electronic and optical properties1–5. Conventional semiconductor superlattices with designable potential modulation in one dimension has enabled high-electron-mobility transistors and quantum-cascade lasers. More recently, a diverse set of superlattices has been constructed through self-assembly or guided assembly of multiscale building units, including zero-dimensional nanoclusters and nanoparticles6,7, one-dimensional nanorods and nanowires8,9, two-dimensional nanolayers and nanosheets10–13, and hybrid two-dimensional molecular assemblies14–17. These self-assembled superlattices feature periodic structural modulation in two or three dimensions, but often lack atomic precision owing to the inevitable structural disorder at the interfaces between the constituent units. Here we report a one-pot synthesis of multi-dimensional single-crystalline superlattices consisting of periodic arrangement of zero-, one- and two-dimensional building units. By exploiting zirconium (IV) metal–organic frameworks as host templates for directed nucleation and precise growth of metal-halide sublattices through a coordination-assisted assembly strategy, we synthesize a family of single-crystalline porous superlattices. Single-crystal X-ray crystallography and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy clearly resolve the high-order superlattice structure with deterministic atomic coordinates. Further treatment with selected amine molecules produces perovskite-like superlattices with highly tunable photoluminescence and chiroptical properties. Our study creates a platform of high-order single-crystalline porous superlattices, opening opportunities to tailor the electronic, optical and quantum properties beyond the reach of conventional crystalline solids. Using zirconium metal–organic frameworks as the host template for directed nucleation and precise growth of metal-halide sublattices, multi-dimensional single-crystalline porous superlattices can be achieved through a one-pot synthesis.},

  abstract     = {Linear conducting polymers show ballistic transport, imposed by mobile carriers moving along the polymer chains1,2, whereas conductance in the extended dimension, that is, between polymer strands or layers, remains weak due to the lack of intermolecular ordering and electronic coupling3–5. Here we report a multilayer-stacked two-dimensional polyaniline (2DPANI) crystal, which shows metallic out-of-plane charge transport with high electrical conductivity. The material comprises columnar π arrays with an interlayer distance of 3.59 Å and periodic rhombohedral lattices formed by interwoven polyaniline chains. Electron spin resonance spectroscopy reveals significant electron delocalization in the 2DPANI lattices. First-principles calculations indicate the in-plane 2D conjugation and strong interlayer electronic coupling in 2DPANI facilitated by the Cl-bridged layer stacking. To assess the local optical conductivity, we used terahertz and infrared nanospectroscopy to unravel a Drude-type conductivity with an infrared plasma frequency and an extrapolated local d.c. conductivity of around 200 S cm−1. Conductive scanning probe microscopy showed an unusually high out-of-plane conductivity of roughly 15 S cm−1. Transport measurements through vertical and lateral micro-devices revealed comparable high out-of-plane (roughly 7 S cm−1) and in-plane conductivity (roughly 16 S cm−1). The vertical micro-devices further showed increasing conductivity with decreasing temperature, demonstrating unique out-of-plane metallic transport behaviour. By using this multilayer-stacked 2D conducting polymer design, we predict the achievement of strong electronic coupling beyond in-plane interactions, potentially reaching three-dimensional metallic conductivity6,7. A multilayer-stacked two-dimensional polyaniline crystal shows high electrical conductivity and unique out-of-plane metallic transport behaviour, indicating potential for strong electronic coupling beyond in-plane interactions and three-dimensional metallic conductivity.},

  abstract     = {The precise control of mechanochemical activation within deep tissues using non-invasive ultrasound holds profound implications for advancing our understanding of fundamental biomedical sciences and revolutionizing disease treatments1–4. However, a theory-guided mechanoresponsive materials system with well-defined ultrasound activation has yet to be explored5,6. Here we present the concept of using porous hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) as toolkits for focused ultrasound (FUS) programmably triggered drug activation to control specific cellular events in the deep brain, through on-demand scission of the supramolecular interactions. A theoretical model is developed to potentially visualize the mechanochemical scission and ultrasound mechanics, providing valuable guidelines for the rational design of mechanoresponsive materials to achieve programmable control. To demonstrate the practicality of this approach, we encapsulate the designer drug clozapine N-oxide (CNO) into the optimal HOF nanocrystals for FUS-gated release to activate engineered G-protein-coupled receptors in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of mice and rats and hence achieve targeted neural circuit modulation even at depth 9 mm with a latency of seconds. This work demonstrates the capability of ultrasound to precisely control molecular interactions and develops ultrasound-programmable HOFs to non-invasively and spatiotemporally control cellular events, thereby facilitating the establishment of precise molecular therapeutic possibilities. The concept of using hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks triggered by non-invasive focused ultrasound for programmable drug&amp;nbsp;activation is explored and demonstrated practically with the designer drug clozapine N-oxide&amp;nbsp;for&amp;nbsp;deep brain stimulation in mice and rats.},

  abstract     = {Topological wave structures, such as vortices1–6, polarization textures7–11 and skyrmions12–19, appear in various quantum and classical wave fields, including optics and acoustics. In particular, optical vortices have found numerous applications20,21, ranging from quantum information to astrophysics. Furthermore, both optical and acoustic structured waves are crucial in the manipulation of small particles22–25, from atoms to macroscopic biological objects. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in structured water surface waves, which can be notable analogues of quantum, optical and acoustic wave systems26–29. However, topological water-wave forms, especially their ability to manipulate particles, have not yet been demonstrated. Here we describe the controllable generation of topological structures, namely wave vortices, skyrmions and polarization Möbius strips, in gravity water waves. Most importantly, we demonstrate the efficient manipulation of subwavelength and wavelength-order floating particles with topologically structured water waves. This includes trapping the particles in the high-intensity field zones and controlling their orbital and spinning motion due to the orbital and spin angular momenta of the water waves. Our results reveal the water-wave counterpart of optical and acoustic manipulation, which paves the way for applications in hydrodynamics and microfluidics. Interfering water waves can be tailored to realize topological structures, namely wave vortices, skyrmions and polarization Möbius strips, that can be used to manipulate particles floating on the water surface.},

  abstract     = {Expanding the performance of field-effect devices is a key challenge of the ever-growing chip industry at the core of current technologies1. Non-volatile multiferroic transistors that control atomic movements rather than purely electronic distribution are highly desired2. Recently, a field-effect control over structural transitions was achieved in commensurate stacking configurations of honeycomb van der Waals (vdW) polytypes by sliding boundary strips between oppositely polarized domains3–6. This ferroelectric hysteretic response, however, relied on pre-existing dislocation strips between relatively large micron-scale domains, severely limiting practical implementations3,7,8. Here we report the robust electric switching of single-domain polytypes in nanometre-scale islands embedded in super-lubricant vdW arrays. We etch cavities into a thin layered spacer and then encapsulate it with functional flakes. The flakes above/under the lattice-mismatched spacer sag and touch at each cavity to form islands of commensurate and metastable polytype configurations. By imaging the polarization of the polytypes, we observe nucleation and annihilation of boundary strips and geometry-adaptable ferroelectric hysteresis loops. Using mechanical stress, we further control the position of boundary strips, modify marginal twist angles and nucleate patterns of polar domain. This super-lubricant arrays of polytype (SLAP) concept suggests ‘slidetronics’ device applications such as elastic-coupled neuromorphic memory cells and non-volatile multiferroic tunnelling transistors and programmable response by designing the size, shape and symmetry of the islands and of the arrays9. By etching cavities into a thin lubricant spacer and encapsulating it with functional flakes, electric and mechanical&amp;nbsp;switching of single-crystal,&amp;nbsp;van der Waals stacking&amp;nbsp;configurations is demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {Distributed quantum computing (DQC) combines the computing power of multiple networked quantum processing modules, ideally enabling the execution of large quantum circuits without compromising performance or qubit connectivity1,2. Photonic networks are well suited as a versatile and reconfigurable interconnect layer for DQC; remote entanglement shared between matter qubits across the network enables all-to-all logical connectivity through quantum gate teleportation (QGT)3,4. For a scalable DQC architecture, the QGT implementation must be deterministic and repeatable; until now, no demonstration has satisfied these requirements. Here we experimentally demonstrate the distribution of quantum computations between two photonically interconnected trapped-ion modules. The modules, separated by about&amp;nbsp;two metres, each contain dedicated network and circuit qubits. By using heralded remote entanglement between the network qubits, we deterministically teleport a controlled-Z (CZ) gate between two circuit qubits in separate modules, achieving 86% fidelity. We then execute Grover’s search algorithm5—to our knowledge, the first implementation of a distributed quantum algorithm comprising several non-local two-qubit gates—and measure a 71% success rate. Furthermore, we implement distributed iSWAP and SWAP circuits, compiled with two and three instances of QGT, respectively, demonstrating the ability to distribute arbitrary two-qubit operations6. As photons can be interfaced with a variety of systems, the versatile DQC architecture demonstrated here provides a viable pathway towards large-scale quantum computing for a range of physical platforms. The distribution of quantum computations is demonstrated between two photonically interconnected trapped-ion modules, using repeatable, deterministic teleported controlled-Z gates to perform Grover’s search algorithm.},

  abstract     = {The detection of cosmic neutrinos with energies above a teraelectronvolt (TeV) offers a unique exploration into astrophysical phenomena1–3. Electrically neutral and interacting only by means of the weak interaction, neutrinos are not deflected by magnetic fields and are rarely absorbed by interstellar matter: their direction indicates that their cosmic origin might be from the farthest reaches of the Universe. High-energy neutrinos can be produced when ultra-relativistic cosmic-ray protons or nuclei interact with other matter or photons, and their observation could be a signature of these processes. Here we report an exceptionally high-energy event observed by KM3NeT, the deep-sea neutrino telescope in the Mediterranean Sea4, which we associate with a cosmic neutrino detection. We detect a muon with an estimated energy of $$12{0}_{-60}^{+110}$$ petaelectronvolts (PeV). In light of its enormous energy and near-horizontal direction, the muon most probably originated from the interaction of a neutrino of even higher energy in the vicinity of the detector. The cosmic neutrino energy spectrum measured up to now5–7 falls steeply with energy. However, the energy of this event is much larger than that of any neutrino detected so far. This suggests that the neutrino may have originated in a different cosmic accelerator than the lower-energy neutrinos, or this may be the first detection of a cosmogenic neutrino8, resulting&amp;nbsp;from the interactions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays with background photons in the Universe. A&amp;nbsp;very high-energy muon observed by the KM3NeT experiment in the Mediterranean Sea is evidence for the interaction of an exceptionally high-energy neutrino of cosmic origin. &amp;nbsp;},

  abstract     = {Recent discoveries from time-domain surveys are defying our expectations for how matter accretes onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs). The increased rate of short-timescale, repetitive events around SMBHs, including the recently discovered quasi-periodic eruptions1–5, are garnering further interest in stellar-mass companions around SMBHs and the progenitors to millihertz-frequency gravitational-wave events. Here we report the discovery of a highly significant millihertz quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in an actively accreting SMBH, 1ES 1927+654, which underwent a major optical, ultraviolet and X-ray outburst beginning in 20186,7. The QPO was detected in 2022 with a roughly 18-minute period, corresponding to coherent motion on a scale of less than 10 gravitational radii, much closer to the SMBH than typical quasi-periodic eruptions. The period decreased to 7.1 minutes over 2 years with a decelerating period evolution ( $$\ddot{P}$$ greater than zero). To our knowledge, this evolution has never been seen in SMBH QPOs or high-frequency QPOs in stellar-mass black holes. Models invoking orbital decay of a stellar-mass companion struggle to explain the period evolution without stable mass transfer to offset angular-momentum losses, and the lack of a direct analogue to stellar-mass black-hole QPOs means that many instability models cannot explain all of the observed properties of the QPO in 1ES 1927+654. Future X-ray monitoring will test these models, and if it is a stellar-mass orbiter, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) should detect its low-frequency gravitational-wave emission. A millihertz frequency X-ray&amp;nbsp;quasi-periodic oscillation has been observed near the innermost orbit of an actively accreting supermassive black hole&amp;nbsp;and its frequency has evolved significantly&amp;nbsp;over&amp;nbsp;2 years, a phenomenon that is difficult to explain with existing models.},

  abstract     = {Galaxy clusters contain vast amounts of hot ionized gas known as the intracluster medium (ICM). In relaxed cluster cores, the radiative cooling time of the ICM is shorter than the age of the cluster. However, the absence of line emission associated with cooling suggests heating mechanisms that offset the cooling, with feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) being the most likely source1,2. Turbulence and bulk motions, such as the oscillating (‘sloshing’) motion of the core gas in the cluster potential well, have also been proposed as mechanisms for heat distribution from the outside of the core3,4. Here we present X-ray spectroscopic observations of the Centaurus galaxy cluster with the X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission satellite. We find that the hot gas flows along the line of sight relative to the central galaxy, with velocities from 130 km s−1 to 310 km s−1 within about&amp;nbsp;30 kpc of the centre. This indicates bulk flow consistent with core gas sloshing. Although the bulk flow may prevent excessive accumulation of cooled gas at the centre, it could distribute the heat injected by the AGN and bring in thermal energy from the surrounding ICM. The velocity dispersion of the gas is found to be only ≲120 km s−1 in the core, even within about 10 kpc of the AGN. This suggests that the influence of the AGN on the surrounding ICM motion is limited in the cluster. X-ray spectroscopic observations of the Centaurus galaxy cluster with the X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission satellite show that the hot gas flows along the line of sight relative to the central galaxy.},

  abstract     = {In the centres of many galaxy clusters, the hot (approximately 107 kelvin) intracluster medium can become dense enough that it should cool on short timescales1,2. However, the low measured star formation rates in massive central galaxies3–6 and the absence of soft X-ray lines from the cooling gas7–9 suggest that most of this gas never cools. This is known as the cooling flow problem. The latest observations suggest that black hole jets are maintaining the vast majority of gas at high temperatures10–16. A cooling flow has yet to be fully mapped through all the gas phases in any galaxy cluster. Here we present observations of the Phoenix cluster17 using the James Webb Space Telescope to map the [Ne vi] λ 7.652-μm emission line, enabling us to probe the gas at 105.5 kelvin on large scales. These data show extended [Ne vi] emission&amp;nbsp;that is cospatial with the cooling peak in the intracluster medium, the coolest gas phases and the&amp;nbsp;sites of active star formation. Taken together, these imply a recent episode of rapid cooling, causing a short-lived spike in the cooling rate, which we estimate to be 5,000–23,000&amp;nbsp;solar masses per year. These data provide a&amp;nbsp;large-scale map of gas at temperatures between 105 kelvin and 106 kelvin in a cluster core, and highlight the critical role that black hole feedback has in not only regulating cooling but also promoting it18. Observations of the Phoenix cluster using the James Webb Space Telescope reveal rapid cooling in galaxy cluster cores, driven by black hole jets, with gas temperatures mapped between 105 K and 106 K and cooling rates of 5,000–23,000 M⊙ yr−1.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in functional genomics and human cellular models have substantially enhanced our understanding of the structure and regulation of the human genome. However, our grasp of the molecular functions of human genes remains incomplete and biased towards specific gene classes. The Molecular Phenotypes of Null Alleles in Cells (MorPhiC) Consortium aims to address this gap by creating a comprehensive catalogue of the molecular and cellular phenotypes associated with null alleles of all human genes using in vitro multicellular systems. In this Perspective, we present the strategic vision of the MorPhiC Consortium and discuss various strategies for generating null alleles, as well as the challenges involved. We describe the cellular models and scalable phenotypic readouts that will be used in the consortium’s initial phase, focusing on 1,000 protein-coding genes. The resulting molecular and cellular data will be compiled into a catalogue of null-allele phenotypes. The methodologies developed in this phase will establish best practices for extending these approaches to all human protein-coding genes. The resources generated—including engineered cell lines, plasmids, phenotypic data, genomic information and computational tools—will be made available to the broader research community to facilitate deeper insights into human gene functions. This Perspective discusses strategies and challenges for the Molecular Phenotypes of Null Alleles in Cells (MorPhiC) Consortium as it aims to catalogue the molecular and cellular phenotypes associated with null alleles of all human genes.},

  abstract     = {Achieving net-zero global emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), with declining emissions of other greenhouse gases, is widely expected to halt global warming. CO2 emissions will continue to drive warming until fully balanced by active anthropogenic CO2 removals. For practical reasons, however, many greenhouse gas accounting systems allow some ‘passive’ CO2 uptake, such as enhanced vegetation growth owing to CO2 fertilization, to be included as removals in the definition of net anthropogenic emissions. By including passive CO2 uptake, nominal net-zero emissions would not halt global warming, undermining the Paris Agreement. Here we discuss measures to address this problem, to ensure residual fossil fuel use does not cause further global warming: land management categories should be disaggregated in emissions reporting and targets to better separate the role of passive CO2 uptake; where possible, claimed removals should be additional to passive uptake; and targets should acknowledge the need for Geological Net Zero, meaning one tonne of CO2 permanently restored to the solid Earth for every tonne still generated from fossil sources. We also argue that scientific understanding of Net Zero provides a basis for allocating responsibility for the protection of passive carbon sinks during and after the transition to Geological Net Zero. Including passive CO2 uptake as an anthropogenic removal in greenhouse gas accounting systems could undermine the Paris Agreement; measures to address this include acknowledging the need for Geological Net Zero and disaggregated accounting for carbon sinks.},

  abstract     = {The nervous and immune systems have complementary roles in the adaptation of organisms to environmental changes. However, the mechanisms that mediate cross-talk between the nervous and immune systems, called neuroimmune interactions, are poorly understood. In this Review, we summarize advances in the understanding of neuroimmune communication, with a principal focus on the central nervous system (CNS): its response to immune signals and the immunological consequences of CNS activity. We highlight these themes primarily as they relate to neurological diseases, the control of immunity, and the regulation of complex behaviours. We also consider the importance and challenges linked to the study of the neuroimmune connectome, which is defined as the totality of neuroimmune interactions in the body, because this provides a conceptual framework to identify mechanisms of disease pathogenesis and therapeutic approaches. Finally, we discuss how the latest techniques can advance our understanding of the neuroimmune connectome, and highlight the outstanding questions in the field. A review of studies on communication between the nervous and immune systems redefines the neuroimmune connectome with a focus on health and disease, and discusses how the latest techniques can advance our understanding.},

  abstract     = {Non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are megaenzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of many clinically important natural products, from early modern medicines (penicillin, bacitracin) to current blockbuster drugs (cubicin, vancomycin) and newly approved therapeutics (rezafungin)1,2. The key chemical step in these biosyntheses is amide bond formation between aminoacyl building blocks, catalysed by the condensation (C) domain3. There has been much debate over the mechanism of this reaction3–12. NRPS condensation has been difficult to fully characterize because it is one of many successive reactions in the NRPS synthetic cycle and because the canonical substrates are each attached transiently as thioesters to mobile carrier domains, which are often both contained in the same very flexible protein as the C domain. Here we have produced a dimodular NRPS protein in two parts, modified each with appropriate non-hydrolysable substrate analogues13,14, assembled the two parts with protein ligation15, and solved the structures of the substrate- and product-bound states. The structures show the precise orientation of the megaenzyme preparing the nucleophilic attack of its key chemical step, and enable biochemical assays and quantum mechanical simulations to precisely interrogate the reaction. These data suggest that NRPS C domains use a concerted reaction mechanism, whereby the active-site histidine likely functions not as a general base, but as a crucial stabilizing hydrogen bond acceptor for the developing ammonium. The condensation domains of non-ribosomal peptide synthetases use a concerted reaction mechanism in which the active site histidine probably serves as a crucial stabilizing hydrogen bond acceptor for the developing ammonium.},

  abstract     = {Non-ribosomal peptide synthetases are assembly line biosynthetic pathways that are used to produce critical therapeutic drugs and are typically arranged as large multi-domain proteins called megasynthetases1. They synthesize polypeptides using peptidyl carrier proteins that shuttle each amino acid through modular loading, modification and elongation2 steps, and remain challenging to structurally characterize, owing in part to the inherent dynamics of their multi-domain and multi-modular architectures3. Here we have developed site-selective crosslinking probes to conformationally constrain and resolve the interactions between carrier proteins and their partner enzymatic domains4,5. We apply tetrazine click chemistry to trap the condensation of two carrier protein substrates within the active site of the condensation domain that unites the first two modules of tyrocidine biosynthesis and report the high-resolution cryo-EM structure of this complex. Together with the X-ray crystal structure of the first carrier protein crosslinked to its epimerization domain, these structures highlight captured intermodular recognition events and define the processive movement of a carrier protein from one catalytic step to the next. Characterization of these structural relationships remains central to understanding the molecular details of these unique synthetases and critically informs future synthetic biology design of these pathways. Structural studies of tyrocidine synthetase using site-selective crosslinking probes to link condensation domains with carrier protein substrates define key interactions and molecular mechanisms of non-ribosomal protein synthesis.},

  abstract     = {Cellular identity requires the concerted action of multiple transcription factors (TFs) bound together to enhancers of cell-type-specific genes. Despite TFs recognizing specific DNA motifs within accessible chromatin, this information is insufficient to explain how TFs select enhancers1. Here we compared four different TF combinations that induce different cell states, analysing TF genome occupancy, chromatin accessibility, nucleosome positioning and 3D genome organization at the nucleosome resolution. We show that motif recognition on mononucleosomes can decipher only the individual binding of TFs. When bound together, TFs act cooperatively or competitively to target nucleosome arrays with defined 3D organization, displaying motifs in particular patterns. In one combination, motif directionality funnels TF combinatorial binding along chromatin loops, before infiltrating laterally to adjacent enhancers. In other combinations, TFs assemble on motif-dense and highly interconnected loop junctions, and subsequently translocate to nearby lineage-specific sites. We propose a guided-search model in which motif grammar on nucleosome fibres acts as signpost elements, directing TF combinatorial binding to enhancers.

  abstract     = {Lung metastases occur in up to 54% of patients with metastatic tumours1,2. Contributing factors to this high frequency include the physical properties of the pulmonary system and a less oxidative environment that may favour the survival of cancer cells3. Moreover, secreted factors from primary tumours alter immune cells and the extracellular matrix of the lung, creating a permissive pre-metastatic environment primed for the arriving cancer cells4,5. Nutrients are also primed during pre-metastatic niche formation6. Yet, whether and how nutrients available in organs in which tumours metastasize confer cancer cells with aggressive traits is mostly undefined. Here we found that pulmonary aspartate triggers a cellular signalling cascade in disseminated cancer cells, resulting in a translational programme that boosts aggressiveness of lung metastases. Specifically, we observe that patients and mice with breast cancer have high concentrations of aspartate in their lung interstitial fluid. This extracellular aspartate activates the ionotropic N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor in cancer cells, which promotes CREB-dependent expression of deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH). DOHH is essential for hypusination, a post-translational modification that is required for the activity of the non-classical translation initiation factor eIF5A. In turn, a translational programme with TGFβ signalling as a central hub promotes collagen synthesis in lung-disseminated breast cancer cells. We detected key proteins of this mechanism in lung metastases from patients with breast cancer. In summary, we found that aspartate, a classical biosynthesis metabolite, functions in the lung environment as an extracellular signalling molecule to promote aggressiveness of metastases. Aspartate in the tumour environment activates&amp;nbsp;the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor in cancer cells to&amp;nbsp;induce cellular programmes that increase the aggressiveness of metastasis.},

As clinical sequencing technologies continue to advance, the ability to identify patients with rare disease harbouring pathogenic genetic variants amenable to this therapeutic strategy will probably improve. Here we describe a scalable platform for generating patient-derived cellular models and demonstrate that these personalized models can be used for preclinical evaluation of patient-specific ASOs. We describe protocols for delivery of ASOs to patient-derived organoid models and confirm reversal of disease-associated phenotypes in cardiac organoids derived from a patient with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) with a structural deletion in the gene encoding dystrophin (DMD) that is amenable to treatment with existing ASO therapeutics. Furthermore, we designed novel patient-specific ASOs for two additional patients with DMD (siblings) with a deep intronic variant in the DMD gene that gives rise to a novel splice acceptor site, incorporation of a cryptic exon and premature transcript termination. We showed that treatment of patient-derived cardiac organoids with patient-specific ASOs results in restoration of DMD expression and reversal of disease-associated phenotypes. The approach outlined here provides the foundation for an expedited path towards the design and preclinical evaluation of personalized ASO therapeutics for a broad range of rare diseases.

  abstract     = {Cancer cells in the tumour microenvironment use various mechanisms to evade the immune system, particularly T cell attack1. For example, metabolic reprogramming in the tumour microenvironment and mitochondrial dysfunction in tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) impair antitumour immune responses2–4. However, detailed mechanisms of such processes remain unclear. Here we analyse clinical specimens and identify mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations in TILs that are shared with cancer cells. Moreover, mitochondria with mtDNA mutations from cancer cells are able to transfer to TILs. Typically, mitochondria in TILs readily undergo mitophagy through reactive oxygen species. However, mitochondria transferred from cancer cells do not undergo mitophagy, which we find is due to mitophagy-inhibitory molecules. These molecules attach to mitochondria and together are transferred to TILs, which results in homoplasmic replacement. T cells that acquire mtDNA mutations from cancer cells exhibit metabolic abnormalities and senescence, with defects in effector functions and memory formation. This in turn leads to impaired antitumour immunity both in vitro and in vivo. Accordingly, the presence of an mtDNA mutation in tumour tissue is a poor prognostic factor for immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with melanoma or non-small-cell lung cancer. These findings reveal a previously unknown mechanism of cancer immune evasion through mitochondrial transfer and can contribute to the development of future cancer immunotherapies. Mitochondria with mutations in their DNA from cancer cells can be transferred to T cells in the tumour microenvironment, which leads to T cell dysfunction and impaired antitumour immunity.},

However, to what extent host responses balance the physiological effects of microbiota-derived metabolites remains unclear9,10. Here, using untargeted metabolomics of mouse tissues, we identified a family of BA–methylcysteamine (BA–MCY) conjugates that are abundant in the intestine and dependent on vanin 1 (VNN1), a pantetheinase highly expressed in intestinal tissues. This host-dependent MCY conjugation inverts BA function in the hepatobiliary system. Whereas microbiota-derived free BAs function as agonists of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and negatively regulate BA production, BA–MCYs act as potent antagonists of FXR and promote expression of BA biosynthesis genes in vivo. Supplementation with stable-isotope-labelled BA–MCY increased BA production in an FXR-dependent manner, and BA–MCY supplementation in a mouse model of hypercholesteraemia decreased lipid accumulation in the liver, consistent with BA–MCYs acting as intestinal FXR antagonists. The levels of BA–MCY were reduced in microbiota-deficient mice and restored by transplantation of human faecal microbiota. Dietary intervention with inulin fibre further increased levels of both free BAs and BA–MCY levels, indicating that BA–MCY production by the host is regulated by levels of microbiota-derived free BAs. We further show that diverse BA–MCYs are also present in human serum. Together, our results indicate that BA–MCY conjugation by the host balances host-dependent and microbiota-dependent metabolic pathways that regulate FXR-dependent physiology. A family of host-derived bile acid–methylcysteamine conjugates functions as FXR antagonists, forming part of a microbiota-dependent metabolic network that regulates FXR-dependent physiology.},

  abstract     = {Stem cells reside in specialized microenvironments, termed niches, at several different locations in tissues1–3. The differential functions of heterogeneous stem cells and niches are important given the increasing clinical applications of stem-cell transplantation and immunotherapy. Whether hierarchical structures among stem cells at distinct niches exist and further control aspects of immune tolerance is unknown. Here we describe previously unknown new hierarchical arrangements in haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and bone marrow niches that dictate both regenerative potential and immune privilege. High-level nitric oxide-generating (NOhi) HSCs are refractory to immune attack and exhibit delayed albeit robust long-term reconstitution. Such highly immune-privileged, primitive NOhi HSCs co-localize with distinctive capillaries characterized by primary ciliated endothelium and high levels of the immune-checkpoint molecule CD200. These capillaries regulate the regenerative functions of NOhi HSCs through the ciliary protein IFT20 together with CD200, endothelial nitric oxide synthase and autophagy signals, which further mediate immunoprotection. Notably, previously described niche constituents, sinusoidal cells and type-H vessels2–10 co-localize with less immune-privileged and less potent NOlow HSCs. Together, we identify highly immune-privileged, late-rising primitive HSCs and characterize their immunoprotective niches comprising specialized vascular domains. Our results indicate that the niche orchestrates hierarchy in stem cells and immune tolerance, and highlight future immunotherapeutic targets. Previously undescribed hierarchical arrangements in haematopoietic stem cells and their niches that mediate both regenerative potential and immune privilege are identified.},

  abstract     = {Plants lack specialized and mobile immune cells. Consequently, any cell type that encounters pathogens must mount immune responses and communicate with surrounding cells for successful defence. However, the diversity, spatial organization and function of cellular immune states in pathogen-infected plants are poorly understood1. Here we infect Arabidopsis thaliana leaves with bacterial pathogens that trigger or supress immune responses and integrate time-resolved single-cell transcriptomic, epigenomic and spatial transcriptomic data to identify cell states. We describe cell-state-specific gene-regulatory logic that involves transcription factors, putative cis-regulatory elements and target genes associated with disease and immunity. We show that a rare cell population emerges at the nexus of immune-active hotspots, which we designate as primary immune responder (PRIMER) cells. PRIMER cells have non-canonical immune signatures, exemplified by the expression and genome accessibility of a previously uncharacterized transcription factor, GT-3A, which contributes to plant immunity against bacterial pathogens. PRIMER cells are surrounded by another cell state (bystander) that activates genes for long-distance cell-to-cell immune signalling. Together, our findings suggest that interactions between these cell states propagate immune responses across the leaf. Our molecularly defined single-cell spatiotemporal atlas provides functional and regulatory insights into immune cell states in plants. The development of a molecularly defined spatiotemporal atlas of pathogen-infected Arabidopsis thaliana leaves reveals specific cell states that have distinct roles in plant immunity.},

  abstract     = {Biological ageing can be defined as a gradual loss of homeostasis across various aspects of molecular and cellular function1,2. Mammalian brains consist of thousands of cell types3, which may be differentially susceptible or resilient to ageing. Here we present a comprehensive single-cell RNA sequencing dataset containing roughly 1.2 million high-quality single-cell transcriptomes of brain cells from young adult and aged mice of both sexes, from regions spanning the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain. High-resolution clustering of all cells results in 847 cell clusters and reveals at least 14 age-biased clusters that are mostly glial types. At the broader cell subclass and supertype levels, we find age-associated gene expression signatures and provide a list of 2,449 unique differentially expressed genes (age-DE genes) for many neuronal and non-neuronal cell types. Whereas most age-DE genes are unique to specific cell types, we observe common signatures with ageing across cell types, including a decrease in expression of genes related to neuronal structure and function in many neuron types, major astrocyte types and mature oligodendrocytes, and an increase in expression of genes related to immune function, antigen presentation, inflammation, and cell motility in immune cell types and some vascular cell types. Finally, we observe that some of the cell types that demonstrate the greatest sensitivity to ageing are concentrated around the third ventricle in the hypothalamus, including tanycytes, ependymal cells, and certain neuron types in the arcuate nucleus, dorsomedial nucleus and paraventricular nucleus that express genes canonically related to energy homeostasis. Many of these types demonstrate both a decrease in neuronal function and an increase in immune response. These findings suggest that the third ventricle in the hypothalamus may be a hub for ageing in the mouse brain. Overall, this study systematically delineates a dynamic landscape of cell-type-specific transcriptomic changes in the brain associated with normal ageing that will serve as a foundation for the investigation of functional changes in ageing and the interaction of ageing and disease. A comprehensive single-cell RNA sequencing study delineates cell-type-specific transcriptomic changes in the brain associated with normal ageing that will inform the investigation into functional changes and the interaction of ageing and disease.},

  abstract     = {Cerebral cortex development in humans is a highly complex and orchestrated process that is under tight genetic regulation. Rare mutations that alter gene expression or function can disrupt the structure of the cerebral cortex, resulting in a range of neurological conditions1. Lissencephaly (‘smooth brain’) spectrum disorders comprise a group of rare, genetically heterogeneous congenital brain malformations commonly associated with epilepsy and intellectual disability2. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis remain unknown. Here we establish hypoactivity of the mTOR pathway as a clinically relevant molecular mechanism in lissencephaly spectrum disorders. We characterized two types of cerebral organoid derived from individuals with genetically distinct lissencephalies with a recessive mutation in p53-induced death domain protein 1 (PIDD1) or a heterozygous chromosome 17p13.3 microdeletion leading to Miller–Dieker lissencephaly syndrome (MDLS). PIDD1-mutant organoids and MDLS organoids recapitulated the thickened cortex typical of human lissencephaly and demonstrated dysregulation of protein translation, metabolism and the mTOR pathway. A brain-selective activator of mTOR complex 1 prevented and reversed cellular and molecular defects in the lissencephaly organoids. Our findings show that a converging molecular mechanism contributes to two genetically distinct lissencephaly spectrum disorders. Cellular, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells show that mTOR pathway hypoactivation is involved in two genetically distinct lissencephaly spectrum disorders.},

  abstract     = {Old age is associated with a decline in cognitive function and an increase in neurodegenerative disease risk1. Brain ageing is complex and is accompanied by many cellular changes2. Furthermore, the influence that aged cells have on neighbouring cells and how this contributes to tissue decline is unknown. More generally, the tools to systematically address this question in ageing tissues have not yet been developed. Here we generate a spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomics brain atlas of 4.2 million cells from 20 distinct ages across the adult lifespan and across two rejuvenating interventions—exercise and partial reprogramming. We build spatial ageing clocks, machine learning models trained on this spatial transcriptomics atlas, to identify spatial and cell-type-specific transcriptomic fingerprints of ageing, rejuvenation and disease, including for rare cell types. Using spatial ageing clocks and deep learning, we find that T cells, which increasingly infiltrate the brain with age, have a marked pro-ageing proximity effect on neighbouring cells. Surprisingly, neural stem cells have a strong pro-rejuvenating proximity effect on neighbouring cells. We also identify potential mediators of the pro-ageing effect of T cells and the pro-rejuvenating effect of neural stem cells on their neighbours. These results suggest that rare cell types can have a potent influence on their neighbours and could be targeted to counter tissue ageing. Spatial ageing clocks represent a useful tool for studying cell–cell interactions in spatial contexts and should allow scalable assessment of the efficacy of interventions for ageing and disease. A spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomics map of the mouse brain at different ages reveals signatures of ageing, rejuvenation and disease, including ageing effects associated with T cells and rejuvenation associated with neural stem cells.},

  abstract     = {Female mammalian cells have two X chromosomes, one of maternal origin and one of paternal origin. During development, one X chromosome randomly becomes inactivated1–4. This renders either the maternal X (Xm) chromosome or the paternal X (Xp) chromosome inactive, causing X mosaicism that varies between female individuals, with some showing considerable or complete skew of the X chromosome that remains active5–7. Parent-of-X origin can modify epigenetics through DNA methylation8,9 and possibly gene expression; thus, mosaicism could buffer dysregulated processes in ageing and disease. However, whether X skew or its mosaicism alters functions in female individuals is largely unknown. Here we tested whether skew towards an active Xm chromosome influences the brain and body—and then delineated unique features of Xm neurons and Xp neurons. An active Xm chromosome impaired cognition in female mice throughout the lifespan and led to worsened cognition with age. Cognitive deficits were accompanied by Xm-mediated acceleration of biological or epigenetic ageing of the hippocampus, a key centre for learning and memory, in female mice. Several genes were imprinted on the Xm chromosome of hippocampal neurons, suggesting silenced cognitive loci. CRISPR-mediated activation of Xm-imprinted genes improved cognition in ageing female mice. Thus, the Xm chromosome impaired cognition, accelerated brain ageing and silenced genes that contribute to cognition in ageing. Understanding how Xm impairs brain function could lead to an improved understanding of heterogeneity in cognitive health in female individuals and to X-chromosome-derived pathways that protect against cognitive deficits and brain ageing. The maternal X chromosome in female mice impairs cognition through the silencing of certain genes and accelerates ageing of the hippocampus.},

  abstract     = {Fossils representing Cretaceous lineages of crown clade birds (Aves) are exceptionally rare but are crucial to elucidating major ecological shifts across early avian divergences. Among the earliest known putative crown birds is Vegavis iaai1–5, a foot-propelled diver from the latest Cretaceous (69.2–68.4 million years ago)6 of Antarctica with controversial phylogenetic affinities2,7–10. Initially recovered by phylogenetic analyses as a stem anatid (ducks and closely related species)1,2,11, Vegavis has since been recovered as a stem member of Anseriformes (waterfowl)7–9, or outside Aves altogether10. Here we report a new, nearly complete skull of Vegavis that provides new insight into its feeding ecology and exhibits morphologies that&amp;nbsp;support placement among waterfowl within crown-group birds. Vegavis has an avian beak (absence of teeth and&amp;nbsp;reduced maxilla) and brain shape (hyperinflated cerebrum and&amp;nbsp;ventrally shifted optic lobes). The temporal fossa is well excavated and expansive, indicating that this bird had hypertrophied jaw musculature. The beak is narrow and pointed, and the mandible lacks retroarticular processes. Together, these features comprise a feeding apparatus unlike that of&amp;nbsp;any other known anseriform but like that of&amp;nbsp;other extant birds that capture prey underwater (for example, grebes and loons). The Cretaceous occurrence of Vegavis, with a feeding ecology unique among known Galloanserae (waterfowl and landfowl), is further indication that the earliest anseriform divergences were marked by evolutionary experiments unrepresented in the extant diversity3,11–13. A new, nearly complete fossil skull of Vegavis from the&amp;nbsp;James Ross Basin, Antarctic Peninsula, provides insight into its feeding ecology and exhibits morphologies that&amp;nbsp;support placement among waterfowl within crown-group birds.},

  abstract     = {Freshwater ecosystems are highly biodiverse1 and important for livelihoods and economic development2, but are under substantial stress3. To date, comprehensive global assessments of extinction risk have not included any speciose groups primarily living in freshwaters. Consequently, data from predominantly terrestrial tetrapods4,5 are used to guide environmental policy6 and conservation prioritization7, whereas recent proposals for target setting in freshwaters use abiotic factors8–13. However, there is evidence14–17 that such data are insufficient to represent the needs of freshwater species and achieve biodiversity goals18,19. Here we present the results of a multi-taxon global freshwater fauna assessment for The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species covering 23,496 decapod crustaceans, fishes and odonates, finding that one-quarter are threatened with extinction. Prevalent threats include pollution, dams and water extraction, agriculture and invasive species, with overharvesting also driving extinctions. We also examined the degree of surrogacy of both threatened tetrapods and freshwater abiotic factors (water stress and nitrogen) for threatened freshwater species. Threatened tetrapods are good surrogates when prioritizing sites to maximize rarity-weighted richness, but poorer when prioritizing based on the most range-restricted species. However, they are much better surrogates than abiotic factors, which perform worse than random. Thus, although global priority regions identified for tetrapod conservation are broadly reflective of those for freshwater faunas, given differences in key threats and habitats, meeting the needs of tetrapods cannot be assumed sufficient to conserve freshwater species at local scales. A global multi-taxon extinction risk assessment of freshwater fauna&amp;nbsp;for The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species finds one-quarter of species to be at high risk of extinction.},

  abstract     = {The fate of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS)1 is the largest cause of uncertainty in long-term sea-level projections. In the last interglacial (LIG) around 125,000 years ago, data suggest that sea level was several metres higher than today2–4, and required a significant contribution from Antarctic ice loss, with WAIS usually implicated. Antarctica and the Southern Ocean were warmer than today5–8, by amounts comparable to those expected by 2100 under moderate to high future warming scenarios. However, direct evidence about the size of WAIS in the LIG is sparse. Here we use sea salt data from an ice core from Skytrain Ice Rise, adjacent to WAIS, to show that, during most of the LIG, the Ronne Ice Shelf was still in place, and close to its current extent. Water isotope data are consistent with a retreat of WAIS9, but seem inconsistent with more dramatic model realizations10 in which both WAIS and the large Antarctic ice shelves were lost. This new constraint calls for a reappraisal of other elements of the LIG sea-level budget. It also weakens the observational basis that motivated model simulations projecting the highest end of projections for future rates of sea-level rise to 2300 and beyond. Sea salt data from an ice core record show that Antarctica’s Ronne Ice Shelf survived the last interglacial, the last period of enhanced and sustained global warmth about 125,000 years ago.},

The key challenge is achieving selectivity for one particular C(sp3)−H bond1–3. In recent years, metalloenzymes have been found to perform C(sp3)−H bond functionalization4,5. Despite substantial progresses in the past two decades6,7, enzymatic halogenation and pseudohalogenation of unactivated C(sp3)−H—providing a functional handle for further modification—have been achieved with only non-haem iron/α-ketoglutarate-dependent halogenases, and are therefore limited by the chemistry possible with these enzymes8. Here we report the discovery and characterization of a previously unknown halogenase ApnU, part of a protein family containing domain of unknown function 3328 (DUF3328). ApnU uses copper in its active site to catalyse iterative chlorinations on multiple unactivated C(sp3)−H bonds. By taking advantage of the softer copper centre, we demonstrate that ApnU can catalyse unprecedented enzymatic C(sp3)−H bond functionalization such as iodination and thiocyanation. Using biochemical characterization and proteomics analysis, we identified the functional oligomeric state of ApnU as a covalently linked homodimer, which contains three essential pairs—one interchain and two intrachain—of disulfide bonds. The metal-coordination active site in ApnU consists of binuclear type II copper centres, as revealed by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. This discovery expands the enzymatic capability of C(sp3)−H halogenases and provides a foundational understanding of this family of binuclear copper-dependent oxidative enzymes. A halogenase enzyme uses the copper in its active site to catalyse iterative chlorinations on multiple unactivated carbon−hydrogen bonds, enabling carbon−hydrogen functionalization that is not achievable with an iron-based halogenase.},

Many strategies to access crosslinked polymers that are bioderived or degradable-by-design have been proposed, but they require several resource-intensive synthesis and purification steps and are not yet feasible alternatives to conventional consumer materials4–8. Here we present a modular, one-pot synthesis of degradable thermosets from the commercially available, biosourced monomer 2,3-dihydrofuran (DHF)9. In the presence of a ruthenium catalyst and photoacid generator, DHF undergoes slow ring-opening metathesis polymerization to give a soft polymer; then, exposure to light triggers strong acid generation and promotes the cationic polymerization of the same DHF monomer to spatially crosslink and strengthen the material10–12. By manipulating catalyst loading and light exposure, we can access materials with physical properties spanning orders of magnitude and achieve spatially resolved material domains. Importantly, the DHF-based thermosets undergo stimuli-selective degradation and can be recycled to the&amp;nbsp;monomer under mild heating. The use of two distinct polymerization mechanisms on a single functional group allows the synthesis of degradable and recyclable thermoset materials with precisely controlled properties. Degradable thermoset multimaterials can be synthesized from a commercially accessible, biosourced monomer using orthogonal polymerizations in a single pot; after selective degredation, the resulting small molecules can be repolymerized.},

  abstract     = {Dense crowds form some of the most dangerous environments in modern society1. Dangers arise from uncontrolled collective motions, leading to compression against walls, suffocation and fatalities2–4. Our current understanding of crowd dynamics primarily relies on heuristic collision models, which effectively capture the behaviour observed in small groups of people5,6. However, the emergent dynamics of dense crowds, composed of thousands of individuals, remains a formidable many-body problem lacking quantitative experimental characterization and explanations rooted in first principles. Here we analyse the dynamics of thousands of densely packed individuals at the San Fermín festival (Spain) and infer a physical theory of dense crowds in confinement. Our measurements reveal that dense crowds can self-organize into macroscopic chiral oscillators, coordinating the orbital motion of hundreds of individuals without external guidance. Guided by these measurements and symmetry principles, we construct a mechanical model of dense-crowd motion. Our model demonstrates that emergent odd frictional forces drive a non-reciprocal phase transition7 towards collective chiral oscillations, capturing all our experimental observations. To test the robustness of our findings, we show that similar chiral dynamics emerged at the onset of the 2010 Love Parade disaster and propose a protocol that could help anticipate these previously unpredictable dynamics. Analysis of the confined crowds at the San Fermín festival in Spain shows that dense crowds can self-organize into macroscopic chiral oscillators, coordinating the orbital motion of hundreds of individuals without external guidance.},

  abstract     = {A particle current generated by pumping in the absence of gradients in potential energy, density or temperature1 is associated with non-trivial dynamics. A representative example is charge pumping that is associated with the quantum Hall effect2 and the quantum anomalous Hall effect3. Spin pumping, the spin equivalent of charge pumping, refers to the emission of a spin current by magnetization dynamics4–7. Previous studies have focused solely on transversal spin pumping arising from classical dynamics, which corresponds to precessing atomic moments with constant magnitude. However, longitudinal spin pumping arising from quantum fluctuations, which correspond to a temporal change in the atomic moment’s magnitude, remains unexplored. Here we experimentally investigate longitudinal spin pumping using iron–rhodium (FeRh), which undergoes a first-order antiferromagnet-to-ferromagnet phase transition during which the atomic moment’s magnitude varies over time. By injecting a charge current into a FeRh/platinum bilayer, we induce a rapid phase transition of FeRh in nanoseconds, leading to the emission of a spin current to the platinum layer. The observed inverse spin Hall signal is about one order of magnitude larger than expected for transversal spin pumping, suggesting the presence of longitudinal spin pumping driven by quantum fluctuations and indicating its superiority over classical transversal spin pumping. Our result highlights the significance of quantum fluctuations in spin pumping and holds broad applicability in diverse angular momentum dynamics, such as laser-induced ultrafast demagnetization8, orbital pumping9,10 and quantum spin transfer11–13. Longitudinal spin pumping is experimentally demonstrated using the magnetic phase transition of iron–rhodium, and the observed inverse spin Hall signal indicates that longitudinal spin pumping is driven by quantum fluctuations.},

  abstract     = {The physics of superconductivity in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) is a topic of keen interest in moiré systems research, and it may provide an insight into the pairing mechanism of other strongly correlated materials such as high-critical-temperature superconductors. Here we use d.c. transport and microwave circuit quantum electrodynamics to directly measure the superfluid stiffness of superconducting MATBG through its kinetic inductance. We find the superfluid stiffness to be much larger than expected from conventional Fermi liquid theory. Rather, it is comparable to theoretical predictions1 and recent experimental indications2 of quantum geometric effects that are dominant at the magic angle. The temperature dependence of the superfluid stiffness follows a power law, which contraindicates an isotropic Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer (BCS) model. Instead, the extracted power-law exponents indicate an anisotropic superconducting gap, whether interpreted in the Fermi liquid framework or by considering the quantum geometry of flat-band superconductivity. Moreover, a quadratic dependence of the superfluid stiffness on both d.c. and microwave current is observed, which is consistent with the Ginzburg–Landau theory. Taken together, our findings show that MATBG is an unconventional superconductor with an anisotropic gap and strongly suggest a connection between quantum geometry, superfluid stiffness and unconventional superconductivity in MATBG. The combined d.c.–microwave measurement platform used here is applicable to the investigation of other atomically thin superconductors. Research on superconductivity in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene reveals unconventional behaviour, an anisotropic gap and a significant role of quantum geometry, using combined d.c. transport and microwave measurements, suggesting new insights into superconductivity mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {The robustness of the macroscopic quantum nature of a superconductor can be characterized by the superfluid stiffness, ρs, a quantity that describes the energy required to vary the phase of the macroscopic quantum wavefunction. In unconventional superconductors, such as cuprates, the low-temperature behaviour of ρs markedly differs from that of conventional superconductors owing to quasiparticle excitations from gapless points (nodes) in momentum space. Intensive research on the recently discovered magic-angle twisted graphene family has revealed, in addition to superconducting states, strongly correlated electronic states associated with spontaneously broken symmetries, inviting the study of ρs to uncover the potentially unconventional nature of its superconductivity. Here we report the measurement of ρs in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene (TTG), revealing unconventional nodal-gap superconductivity. Utilizing radio-frequency reflectometry techniques to measure the kinetic inductive response of superconducting TTG coupled to a microwave resonator, we find a linear temperature dependence of ρs at low temperatures and nonlinear Meissner effects in the current-bias dependence, both indicating nodal structures in the superconducting order parameter. Furthermore, the doping dependence shows a linear correlation between the zero-temperature ρs and the superconducting transition temperature Tc, reminiscent of Uemura’s relation in cuprates, suggesting phase-coherence-limited superconductivity. Our results provide strong evidence for nodal superconductivity in TTG and put strong constraints on the mechanisms of these graphene-based superconductors. Measurements of the superfluid stiffness in twisted trilayer graphene reveal unconventional nodal-gap superconductivity, where the superconducting transition is controlled by phase fluctuations rather than Cooper-pair breaking.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the collective quantum dynamics of non-equilibrium many-body systems is an outstanding challenge in quantum science. In particular, dynamics driven by quantum fluctuations are important for the formation of exotic quantum phases of matter1, fundamental high-energy processes2, quantum metrology3,4 and quantum algorithms5. Here we use a programmable quantum simulator based on Rydberg atom arrays to experimentally study collective dynamics across a (2+1)-dimensional Ising quantum phase transition. After crossing the quantum critical point, we observe a gradual growth of correlations through coarsening of antiferromagnetically ordered domains6. By deterministically preparing and following the evolution of ordered domains, we show that the coarsening is driven by the curvature of domain boundaries, and find that the dynamics accelerate with proximity to the quantum critical point. We quantitatively explore these phenomena and further observe long-lived oscillations of the order parameter, corresponding to an amplitude (‘Higgs’) mode7. These observations offer a viewpoint into emergent collective dynamics in strongly correlated quantum systems and non-equilibrium quantum processes. A programmable quantum simulator based on Rydberg atom arrays is used to study the collective dynamics of a quantum phase transition and observe the phenomenon of quantum coarsening.},

  abstract     = {Understanding how interacting particles approach thermal equilibrium is a major challenge of quantum simulators1,2. Unlocking the full potential of such systems towards this goal requires flexible initial state preparation, precise time evolution and extensive probes for final state characterization. Here we present a quantum simulator comprising 69 superconducting qubits that supports both universal quantum gates and high-fidelity analogue evolution, with performance beyond the reach of classical simulation in cross-entropy benchmarking experiments. This hybrid platform features more versatile measurement capabilities compared with analogue-only simulators, which we leverage here to reveal a coarsening-induced breakdown of Kibble–Zurek scaling predictions3 in the XY model, as well as signatures of the classical Kosterlitz–Thouless phase transition4. Moreover, the digital gates enable precise energy control, allowing us to study the effects of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis5–7 in targeted parts of the eigenspectrum. We also demonstrate digital preparation of pairwise-entangled dimer states, and image the transport of energy and vorticity during subsequent thermalization in analogue evolution. These results establish the efficacy of superconducting analogue–digital quantum processors for preparing states across many-body spectra and unveiling their thermalization dynamics. A hybrid analogue–digital quantum simulator is used to demonstrate beyond-classical performance in benchmarking experiments and to study thermalization phenomena in an XY quantum magnet, including the breakdown of Kibble–Zurek scaling predictions and signatures of the Kosterlitz–Thouless phase transition.},

Although large asteroids (≥100 kilometres) have remained in the main belt since their formation7, small asteroids are commonly transported to the near-Earth object (NEO) population8,9. However, owing to the lack of direct observational constraints, their size–frequency distribution (SFD)—which informs our understanding of the NEOs and the delivery of meteorite samples to Earth—varies substantially among models10–14. Here we report 138 detections of some of&amp;nbsp;the smallest asteroids (≳10 metres) ever observed in the main belt, which were enabled by JWST’s infrared capabilities covering the emission peaks of the asteroids15 and synthetic tracking techniques16–18. Despite small orbital arcs, we constrain the distances and phase angles of the objects using known asteroids as proxies, allowing us to derive sizes through radiometric techniques. Their SFD shows a break at about&amp;nbsp;100 metres (debiased cumulative slopes of q = −2.66 ± 0.60 and&amp;nbsp;−0.97 ± 0.14 for diameters smaller and larger than roughly&amp;nbsp;100 metres, respectively), suggestive of a population driven by collisional cascade. These asteroids were sampled from several asteroid families—most probably Nysa, Polana and Massalia—according to the geometry of pointings considered here. Through further long-stare infrared observations, JWST is poised to serendipitously detect thousands of decametre-scale asteroids across the sky, examining individual asteroid families19 and the source regions of meteorites13,14 ‘in situ’. Combining the infrared capabilities of JWST and synthetic tracking techniques, the&amp;nbsp;detection of some of the smallest asteroids ever observed in the main belt&amp;nbsp;is reported; their large abundance reveals a population driven by collisional cascade.},

  abstract     = {Io experiences tidal deformation as a result of its eccentric orbit around Jupiter, which provides a primary energy source for Io’s continuing volcanic activity and infrared emission1. The amount of tidal energy dissipated within Io is enormous and has been suggested to support the large-scale melting of its interior and the formation of a global subsurface magma ocean. If Io has a shallow global magma ocean, its tidal deformation would be much larger than in the case of a more rigid, mostly solid interior2. Here we report the measurement of Io’s tidal deformation, quantified by the gravitational tidal Love number k2, enabled by two recent flybys of the Juno spacecraft. By combining Juno3,4 and Galileo5–7 Doppler data from the NASA Deep Space Network and astrometric observations, we recover Re(k2) of 0.125 ± 0.047 (1σ) and the tidal dissipation parameter Q of 11.4 ± 3.6 (1σ). These measurements confirm that a shallow global magma ocean in Io does not exist and are consistent with Io having a mostly solid mantle2. Our results indicate that tidal forces do not universally create global magma oceans, which may be prevented from forming owing to rapid melt ascent, intrusion and eruption8,9, so even strong tidal heating—such as that expected on several known exoplanets and super-Earths10—may not guarantee the formation of magma oceans on moons or planetary bodies. By measuring the tidal deformation of Io as it orbits Jupiter using Juno Doppler&amp;nbsp;and historically available data, the hypothesis of a shallow global magma ocean in Io is shown to be false.},

We discuss how Two-Eyed Seeing and other dual perspectives can bring both breadth of knowledge and humility to the development of research and clinical practices for brain health. In this forward-looking discussion, we include both traditional academic and non-academic traditions and the work of Indigenous scholars on methodologies, life, health, culture, language and history. To describe challenges and consider solutions, we offer broad strategies for allyship, humility and universalism and situate them in four specific examples pertaining to disability, suicide, migration and the environment. We further advance the power of Two-Eyed Seeing in the context of new considerations for communication and public engagement. Two-Eyed Seeing, per se, is only one approach, but as neuroscience becomes ever more global, inclusive and ethically proactive, it must universally see the world of brain and mental health through the eyes of both reductionism and holism. Combining Indigenous insights with neuroscience methods through Two-Eyed Seeing can broaden the understanding of brain function and mental wellbeing by merging reductionist and holistic perspectives across various domains, while promoting allyship, humility and inclusive communication.},

  abstract     = {Over the past billion years, the fungal kingdom has diversified to more than two million species, with over 95% still undescribed. Beyond the well-known macroscopic mushrooms and microscopic yeast, fungi are heterotrophs that feed on almost any organic carbon, recycling nutrients through the decay of dead plants and animals and sequestering carbon into Earth’s ecosystems. Human-directed applications of fungi extend from leavened bread, alcoholic beverages and biofuels to pharmaceuticals, including antibiotics and psychoactive compounds. Conversely, fungal infections pose risks to ecosystems ranging from crops to wildlife to humans; these risks are driven, in part, by human and animal movement, and might be accelerating with climate change. Genomic surveys are expanding our knowledge of the true biodiversity of the fungal kingdom, and genome-editing tools make it possible to imagine harnessing these organisms to fuel the bioeconomy. Here, we examine the fungal threats facing civilization and investigate opportunities to use fungi to combat these threats. This Review delves into the fungal kingdom, exploring the relationships among fungi, animals, plants and the environment, and investigating both the threats posed by fungi and their potential benefits.},

  abstract     = {A key challenge of analyzing data from high-resolution spatial profiling technologies is to suitably represent the features of cellular neighborhoods or niches. Here we introduce the covariance environment (COVET), a representation that leverages the gene–gene covariate structure across cells in the niche to capture the multivariate nature of cellular interactions within it. We define a principled optimal transport-based distance metric between COVET niches that scales to millions of cells. Using COVET to encode spatial context, we developed environmental variational inference (ENVI), a conditional variational autoencoder that jointly embeds spatial and single-cell RNA sequencing data into a latent space. ENVI includes two decoders: one to impute gene expression across the spatial modality and a second to project spatial information onto single-cell data. ENVI can confer spatial context to genomics data from single dissociated cells and outperforms alternatives for imputing gene expression on diverse spatial datasets. Using gene–gene covariance structure to represent cellular neighborhoods improves the integration of single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics data.},

  abstract     = {Single-cell RNA sequencing has been widely used to investigate cell state transitions and gene dynamics of biological processes. Current strategies to infer the sequential dynamics of genes in a process typically rely on constructing cell pseudotime through cell trajectory inference. However, the presence of concurrent gene processes in the same group of cells and technical noise can obscure the true progression of the processes studied. To address this challenge, we present GeneTrajectory, an approach that identifies trajectories of genes rather than trajectories of cells. Specifically, optimal transport distances are calculated between gene distributions across the cell–cell graph to extract gene programs and define their gene pseudotemporal order. Here we demonstrate that GeneTrajectory accurately extracts progressive gene dynamics in myeloid lineage maturation. Moreover, we show that GeneTrajectory deconvolves key gene programs underlying mouse skin hair follicle dermal condensate differentiation that could not be resolved by cell trajectory approaches. GeneTrajectory facilitates the discovery of gene programs that control the changes and activities of biological processes. Gene dynamics of concurrent biological processes are unraveled by considering gene trajectories instead of cell trajectories.},

Here we present LINGER (Lifelong neural network for gene regulation), a machine-learning method to infer GRNs from single-cell paired gene expression and chromatin accessibility data. LINGER incorporates atlas-scale external bulk data across diverse cellular contexts and prior knowledge of transcription factor motifs as a manifold regularization. LINGER achieves a fourfold to sevenfold relative increase in accuracy over existing methods and reveals a complex regulatory landscape of genome-wide association studies, enabling enhanced interpretation of disease-associated variants and genes. Following the GRN inference from reference single-cell multiome data, LINGER enables the estimation of transcription factor activity solely from bulk or single-cell gene expression data, leveraging the abundance of available gene expression data to identify driver regulators from case-control studies.

Here we test the therapeutic potential of ds-cRNAs in a mouse model of imiquimod-induced psoriasis. We find that genetic supplementation of ds-cRNAs leads to inhibition of PKR, resulting in alleviation of downstream interferon-α and dsRNA signals and attenuation of psoriasis phenotypes. Delivery of ds-cRNAs by lipid nanoparticles to the spleen attenuates PKR activity in examined splenocytes, resulting in reduced epidermal thickness. These findings suggest that ds-cRNAs represent a promising approach to mitigate excessive PKR activation for therapeutic purposes.

Starfysh improves the characterization of spatial dynamics in complex tissues using histology images and enables the comparison of niches as spatial hubs across tissues. Integrative analysis of primary estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and metaplastic breast cancer (MBC) tissues led to the identification of spatial hubs with patient- and disease-specific cell type compositions and revealed metabolic reprogramming shaping immunosuppressive hubs in aggressive MBC.

Here we describe a high-throughput, personalized TCR discovery pipeline that enables the assembly of complex synthetic TCR libraries in a one-pot reaction, followed by pooled expression in reporter T cells and functional genetic screening against patient-derived tumor or antigen-presenting cells. We applied the method to screen thousands of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL)-derived TCRs from multiple patients and identified dozens of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell-derived TCRs with potent tumor reactivity, including TCRs that recognized patient-specific neoantigens.

Here, we report that this system can lead to frequent concatemeric insertions of the viral vector genome at the target site that are difficult to detect. Such errors can cause adverse and unreliable phenotypes that are antithetical to the goal of precision genome engineering. The concatemeric knockins occurred regardless of locus, vector concentration, cell line or cell type, including human pluripotent and hematopoietic stem cells. Although these highly abundant errors were found in more than half of the edited cells, they could not be readily detected by common analytical methods. We describe strategies to detect and thoroughly characterize the concatemeric viral vector insertions, and we highlight analytical pitfalls that mask their prevalence. We then describe strategies to prevent the concatemeric inserts by cutting the vector genome after transduction. This approach is compatible with established gene editing pipelines, enabling robust genetic knockins that are safer, more reliable and more reproducible.

In some cases, such as anticoagulant drugs or immunotherapeutics, it is important to be able to quickly reverse the drug’s action. Here, we report a general strategy to achieve on-demand reversibility by designing a supramolecular drug (a noncovalent assembly of two cooperatively interacting drug fragments held together by transient hybridization of peptide nucleic acid (PNA)) that can be reversed with a PNA antidote that outcompetes the hybridization between the fragments. We demonstrate the approach with thrombin-inhibiting anticoagulants, creating very potent and reversible bivalent direct thrombin inhibitors (Ki = 74 pM). The supramolecular inhibitor effectively inhibited thrombus formation in mice in a needle injury thrombosis model, and this activity could be reversed by administration of the PNA antidote. This design is applicable to therapeutic targets where two binding sites can be identified. A supramolecular drug design yields anticoagulants that are rapidly reversible.},

  abstract     = {The creation of hosts capable of accommodating different guest molecules may enable these hosts to play useful roles in chemical purifications, among other applications. Metal–organic cages are excellent hosts for various guests, but they generally incorporate rigid structural units that hinder dynamic adaptation to specific guests. Here we report a conformationally adaptable pseudo-cubic cage that can dynamically increase its cavity volume to fit guests with differing sizes. This pseudo-cube incorporates a tetramine subcomponent with 2,6-naphthalene arms that cooperatively adopt a non-planar conformation, enabling the cage faces to switch between endo and exo states. A wide range of guest molecules were observed to bind within the cavity of this cage, spanning a range of sizes from 46% to 154% of the cavity volume of the empty cage. Experimental and computational evidence characterizes the flipping of cage faces from endo to exo, expanding the cavity upon binding of larger guests. Synthetic nanocages that can adapt the size and shape of their cavity in response to a given guest have potential applications in various areas, including chemical purification. Now a flexible, pseudo-cubic metal–organic cage has been developed that is able to dynamically expand its cavity from 46% to 154% of its initial volume by flipping its cage faces.},

  abstract     = {Vesicles play critical roles in cellular materials storage and signal transportation, even in the formation of organelles and cells. Natural vesicles are composed of a lipid layer that forms a membrane for the enclosure of substances inside. Here we report a coacervate vesicle formed by the liquid–liquid phase separation of cholesterol-modified DNA and histones. Unlike a phospholipid-based membrane-bounded vesicle, a coacervate vesicle lacks a membrane structure on the surface and is organized with a high-density liquid layer and a water-filled cavity. Through a straightforward coacervation process, we demonstrate that various biological agents, including virus particles, mRNA, cytokines and peptides, can be innocuously and directly enriched in the liquid phase. In contrast to the droplet-like coacervates that are prone to aggregation challenges, coacervate vesicles display superior kinetic stability, positioning them as a versatile delivery vehicle for biopharmaceuticals. We validate that incorporating oncolytic viruses into these coacervate vesicles endows them with potent oncolytic efficacy and elicits robust anti-tumour immune responses in mouse models. Natural vesicles typically consist of a lipid membrane enclosing substances. Now a coacervate vesicle formed by liquid–liquid phase separation of cholesterol-modified DNA and histones has been developed. Unlike traditional vesicles, these lack a membrane and feature a high-density liquid layer around a water-filled cavity, offering enhanced kinetic stability and potential as a biopharmaceutical delivery system.},

Transition-metal catalysis has the potential to greatly expand the scope of nucleophilic substitution reactions of alkyl electrophiles; unfortunately, in the case of alkyl amines as nucleophiles, only one success has been described so far: the selective mono-alkylation of primary amines to form secondary amines. Here, using photoinduced copper catalysis, we report the synthesis of tertiary alkyl amines from secondary amines and unactivated alkyl electrophiles, two readily available coupling partners. Utilizing an array of tools, we have analysed the mechanism of this process; specifically, we have structurally characterized the three principal copper-based intermediates that are detected during catalysis and provided support for the key steps of the proposed catalytic cycle, including the coupling of a copper(II)–amine intermediate with an alkyl radical to form a C–N bond. Alkyl amines are found in a wide array of bioactive compounds, making strategies for their synthesis very important. Now, a method has been developed to synthesize tertiary alkyl amines via photoinduced, copper-catalysed nucleophilic substitution of unactivated alkyl halides by secondary alkyl amines, with key copper intermediates elucidated in a detailed mechanistic study.},

  abstract     = {The chemistry of low-valent bismuth compounds has recently unlocked new concepts in catalysis and unique electronic structure fundamentals. In this work, we describe the synthesis and characterization of a highly reduced bismuth salt featuring a cationic core based on three contiguous Bi(I) centres. The triatomic bismuth-based core exhibits an electronic configuration that mimics the canonical description of the archetypical carbon-based π-allyl cation. Structural, spectroscopic and theoretical analyses validate the unique π-delocalization between the bismuth’s highly diffused 6p orbitals, resulting in a bonding situation in which the three bismuth atoms are interconnected by two bonds, formally possessing a 1.5 bond order each. This electronic situation defines this complex as the heaviest and stable π-allyl cation of the periodic table. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the newly synthesized complex is able to act as a synthon for the transfer of a Bi(I) cation to forge other low-valent organobismuth complexes. Heavier analogues of unsaturated organic molecules are of interest because of their bonding situation and their potential use in synthesis. Now, a Bi(I)-based allyl cation, which can be seen as a heavy congener of all-carbon π-allyl cations, has been reported. This complex serves as a synthon for Bi(I) transfer, enabling access to low-valent organobismuth compounds.},

  abstract     = {The biosynthesis of the lincosamide antibiotics lincomycin A and celesticetin involves the pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes LmbF and CcbF, which are responsible for bifurcation of the biosynthetic pathways. Despite recognizing the same S-glycosyl-l-cysteine structure of the substrates, LmbF catalyses thiol formation through β-elimination, whereas CcbF produces S-acetaldehyde through decarboxylation-coupled oxidative deamination. The structural basis for the diversification mechanism remains largely unexplored. Here we conduct structure–function analyses of LmbF and CcbF. X-ray crystal structures, docking and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that active-site aromatic residues play important roles in controlling the substrate binding mode and the reaction outcome. Furthermore, the reaction selectivity and oxygen-utilization of LmbF and CcbF were rationally engineered through structure- and calculation-based mutagenesis. Thus, the catalytic function of CcbF was switched to that of LmbF, and, remarkably, both LmbF and CcbF variants gained the oxidative-amidation activity to produce an unnatural S-acetamide derivative of lincosamide. The reaction mechanisms of the pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes LmbF and CcbF—involved in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic lincosamide—are characterized here. Structure–function analyses reveal structural features responsible for S-alkyl moiety diversification in lincosamides. Using structure- and calculation-based enzyme engineering, the selectivity profiles of these enzymes are designed to generate an unnatural lincosamide derivative.},

However, the role of anions in the formation of the solid–electrolyte interphase remains unclear. Here we combine electrochemical analyses and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, both with and without sample washing, together with computational simulations, to propose the reaction pathways of electrolyte decomposition and correlate the interphase component solubility with the efficacy of passivation. We discover that not all the products derived from interphase-forming reactions are incorporated into the resulting passivation layer, with a notable portion present in the liquid electrolyte. We also find that the high-performance electrolytes can afford a sufficiently passivating interphase with minimized electrolyte decomposition, by incorporating more anion-decomposition products. Overall, this work presents a systematic approach of coupling electrochemical and surface analyses to paint a comprehensive picture of solid–electrolyte interphase formation, while identifying the key attributes of high-performance electrolytes to guide future designs. Li-metal batteries often utilize liquid electrolytes that yield a solid–electrolyte interphase on electrodes; however, the role of anions in interphase formation remains unclear. Now it has been shown that anion-decomposition products provide varying contributions to interphase formation and that high-performance electrolytes balance effective interfacial passivation with minimized degradation.},

De novo peptide structures could be built by combining enzymes from different pathways, but determining the rules of their use is difficult. We present a biophysical model to combine enzymes sourced from bacterial ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) gene clusters. Using a pipeline to evaluate more than 1,000 peptides, the model was parameterized under uniform conditions in Escherichia coli for enzymes from different classes (graspetide, spliceotide, pantocin, cyanobactin, glycocin, lasso peptide and lanthipeptide). Synthetic leader peptides with recognition sequences for up to three enzymes were designed to modify core sequences sharing no identity to natural RiPPs. Empirically, RiPPs with the desired modifications constituted 7–67% of the total peptides produced, and 6 of our 8 peptide designs were successfully modified. This work is an example of the design of enzyme-modified peptides and libraries, using a framework that can be expanded to include new enzymes and chemical moieties. Combining enzymes from different pathways in nature could enable de novo peptide design, but determining enzyme-specificity rules is non-trivial. Here a biophysical model combining enzymes sourced from bacterial ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) gene clusters was generated to formalize enzyme-specificity rules and create peptide scaffolds with defined post-translational modifications.},

  abstract     = {sp2-carbon-linked covalent organic frameworks (sp2c-COFs) are crystalline porous polymers with repeat organic units linked by sp2 carbons, and have attracted increasing interest due to their robust skeleton and tunable semiconducting properties. Single-crystalline sp2c-COFs with well-defined structures can represent an ideal platform for investigating fundamental physics properties and device performance. However, the robust olefin bonds inhibit the reversible-reaction-based crystal self-correction, thus yielding polycrystalline or amorphous polymers. Here we report an imine-to-olefin transformation strategy to form single-crystal sp2c-COFs. The isolated single crystals display rectangular nanotube-like domains with sizes up to approximately 24 μm × 0.8 μm × 0.8 μm, and permanent pore distribution around 1.1 nm. The highly conjugated olefin linkage endows the crystals with enhanced electronic connectivity which determines a remarkable room-temperature metal-free ferromagnetism (8.6 × 10−3 emu g−1). Our protocol is robust and generally applicable for the synthesis of single-crystalline sp2c-COFs for future spin-electron devices. Olefin-linked covalent organic frameworks are materials with potential application as organic semiconductors, but their synthesis remains challenging. Now, single-crystal sp2-carbon-linked covalent organic frameworks have been prepared through an imine-to-olefin transformation strategy; the resulting materials feature enhanced room-temperature metal-free ferromagnetism.},

This strategy provides a straightforward methodology to access enantiomerically enriched six-membered N-heterocycles containing a trifluoromethylated quaternary stereocentre from planar N-heteroarenes. The synthetic utility of this enantiodivergent methodology was demonstrated by a broad evaluation of reaction scope, product derivatization and concise syntheses of drug analogues. Mechanistic studies reveal that the excellent asymmetric induction arises from the initial cyclopropanation step. The asymmetric single-atom insertion strategy is expected to have a broad impact on the field of single-atom skeletal editing and catalytic asymmetric dearomatization of aromatic compounds.

  abstract     = {Understanding the dynamics of membrane protein–ligand interactions within a native lipid bilayer is a major goal for drug discovery. Typically, cell-based assays are used, however, they are often blind to the effects of protein modifications. In this study, using the archetypal G protein-coupled receptor rhodopsin, we found that the receptor and its effectors can be released directly from retina rod disc membranes using infrared irradiation in a mass spectrometer. Subsequent isolation and dissociation by infrared multiphoton dissociation enabled the sequencing of individual retina proteoforms. Specifically, we categorized distinct proteoforms of rhodopsin, localized labile palmitoylations, discovered a Gβγ proteoform that abolishes membrane association and defined lipid modifications on G proteins that influence their assembly. Given reports of undesirable side-effects involving vision, we characterized the off-target drug binding of two phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors, vardenafil and sildenafil, to the retina rod phosphodiesterase 6 (PDE6). The results demonstrate differential off-target reactivity with PDE6 and an interaction preference for lipidated proteoforms of G proteins. In summary, this study highlights the opportunities for probing proteoform–ligand interactions within natural membrane environments. G protein-coupled receptors and their effectors can now be released directly from a lipid bilayer using infrared irradiation for proteoform-level characterization by native top-down mass spectrometry.

The results help demystify the multimodal chemistry of aqueous silica discovered decades ago, bringing in fresh information that modifies the current understanding. Our study will provide new opportunities for future in-depth physical and chemical characterizations of other oxide–water interfaces.

  abstract     = {Hard ticks feed on their host for multiple days. To ensure firm attachment, they secrete a protein-rich saliva that eventually forms a solid cement cone. The underlying mechanism of this liquid-to-solid transition is currently not understood. This study focuses on the phase transitions of a disordered glycine-rich protein (GRP) found in tick saliva. We show that GRP undergoes liquid–liquid phase separation via simple coacervation to form biomolecular condensates in salty environments. Cation–π and π–π interactions mediated by periodically placed arginine and aromatic amino-acid residues are the primary driving forces that promote phase separation. Interestingly, GRP condensates exhibit ageing by undergoing liquid-to-gel transition over time and exhibit adhesive properties, similar to the naturally occurring cement cone. Finally, we provide evidence for protein-rich condensates in natural tick saliva. Our findings provide a starting point to gain further insights into the bioadhesion of ticks, to develop novel tick control strategies, and towards achieving biomedical applications such as tissue sealants. Ticks adhere firmly to their host by secreting a protein-rich saliva that eventually forms a solid bioadhesive, but the mechanism underlying this phase transition is not understood.

  abstract     = {The synthesis of mesoporous metal–organic frameworks (meso-MOFs) is desirable as these materials can be used in various applications. However, owing to the imbalance in structural tension at the micro-scale (MOF crystallization) and the meso-scales (assembly of micelles with MOF subunits), the formation of single-crystal meso-MOFs is challenging. Here we report the preparation of uniform single-crystal meso-MOF nanoparticles with ordered mesopore channels in microporous frameworks with definite arrangements, through a cooperative assembly method co-mediated by strong and weak acids. These nanoparticles feature a truncated octahedron shape with variable size and well-defined two-dimensional hexagonally structured (p6mm) columnar mesopores. Notably, the match between the crystallization kinetics of MOFs and the assembly kinetics of micelles is critical for forming the single-crystal meso-MOFs. On the basis of this strategy, we have constructed a library of meso-MOFs with tunable large pore sizes, controllable mesophases, various morphologies and multivariate components. The imbalance in structural tension between crystalline materials and surfactant micelles makes the synthesis of crystalline mesoporous metal–organic frameworks (meso-MOFs) challenging. Now single-crystalline meso-MOFs featuring ordered mesopores have been prepared through the assembly of surfactant micelles and subunits of crystalline MOFs—a process co-mediated by strong and weak acids.},

  abstract     = {Atomically precise nanoclusters can be assembled into ordered superlattices with unique electronic, magnetic, optical and catalytic properties. The co-crystallization of nanoclusters with functional organic molecules provides opportunities to access an even wider range of structures and properties, but can be challenging to control synthetically. Here we introduce a supramolecular approach to direct the assembly of atomically precise silver nanoclusters into a series of nanocluster‒organic ionic co-crystals with tunable structures and properties. By leveraging non-covalent interactions between anionic silver nanoclusters and cationic organic macrocycles of varying sizes, the orientation of nanocluster surface ligands can be manipulated to achieve in situ resolution of enantiopure nanocluster‒organic ionic co-crystals that feature large chiroptical effects. Beyond chirality, this co-crystal assembly approach provides a promising platform for designing functional solid-state nanomaterials through a combination of supramolecular chemistry and atomically precise nanochemistry. The co-crystallization of nanoclusters with functional organic molecules can provide access to superlattices with unique properties, but this process remains synthetically challenging. Now it has been shown that silver nanoclusters and organic macrocycles can be assembled through a supramolecular approach into ionic co-crystals with tunable structures and large chiroptical effects.},

  abstract     = {Resolving the molecular basis of a Mendelian condition remains challenging owing to the diverse mechanisms by which genetic variants cause disease. To address this, we developed a synchronized long-read genome, methylome, epigenome and transcriptome sequencing approach, which enables accurate single-nucleotide, insertion–deletion and structural variant calling and diploid de novo genome assembly. This permits the simultaneous elucidation of haplotype-resolved CpG methylation, chromatin accessibility and full-length transcript information in a single long-read sequencing run. Application of this approach to an Undiagnosed Diseases Network participant with a chromosome X;13-balanced translocation of uncertain significance revealed that this translocation disrupted the functioning of four separate genes (NBEA, PDK3, MAB21L1 and RB1) previously associated with single-gene Mendelian conditions. Notably, the function of each gene was disrupted via a distinct mechanism that required integration of the four ‘omes’ to resolve. These included fusion transcript formation, enhancer adoption, transcriptional readthrough silencing and inappropriate X-chromosome inactivation of autosomal genes. Overall, this highlights the utility of synchronized long-read multi-omic profiling for mechanistically resolving complex phenotypes. Simultaneous profiling of the genome, methylome, epigenome and transcriptome using single-molecule chromatin fiber sequencing and multiplexed arrays isoform sequencing identifies the genetic and molecular basis of an undiagnosed Mendelian disease case with an X;13-balanced translocation.},

However, performing GWASs on millions of samples often leads to trade-offs between computational efficiency and statistical power, reducing the benefits of large-scale data collection efforts. We developed Quickdraws, a method that increases association power in quantitative and binary traits without sacrificing computational efficiency, leveraging a spike-and-slab prior on variant effects, stochastic variational inference and graphics processing unit acceleration. We applied Quickdraws to 79 quantitative and 50 binary traits in 405,088 UK Biobank samples, identifying 4.97% and 3.25% more associations than REGENIE and 22.71% and 7.07% more than FastGWA. Quickdraws had costs comparable to REGENIE, FastGWA and SAIGE on the UK Biobank Research Analysis Platform service, while being substantially faster than BOLT-LMM. These results highlight the promise of leveraging machine learning techniques for scalable GWASs without sacrificing power or robustness. Quickdraws is a mixed-model association tool with a noninfinitesimal prior for analyzing binary and quantitative traits, using a scalable variational inference that allows analysis of biobank-scale cohorts.},

Although single-cell RNA sequencing identifies rare populations that express specific marker transcript combinations, traditional flow sorting requires cell surface markers with high-fidelity antibodies, limiting our ability to interrogate these populations. In addition, many single-cell studies require the isolation of nuclei from tissue, eliminating the ability to enrich learned rare cell states based on extranuclear protein markers. In the present report, we addressed these limitations by developing Programmable Enrichment via RNA FlowFISH by sequencing (PERFF-seq), a scalable assay that enables scRNA-seq profiling of subpopulations defined by the abundance of specific RNA transcripts. Across immune populations (n = 184,126 cells) and fresh-frozen and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded brain tissue (n = 33,145 nuclei), we demonstrated that programmable sorting logic via RNA-based cytometry can isolate rare cell populations and uncover phenotypic heterogeneity via downstream, high-throughput, single-cell genomics analyses. Programmable Enrichment via RNA FlowFISH by sequencing (PERFF-seq) isolates rare cells based on RNA marker transcripts for single-cell RNA sequencing profiling of complex tissues, with applicability to a broad variety of samples and cell types.},

We developed a barley pan-transcriptome using 20 inbred genotypes representing domesticated barley diversity by generating and analyzing short- and long-read RNA-sequencing datasets from multiple tissues. To overcome single reference bias in transcript quantification, we constructed genotype-specific reference transcript datasets (RTDs) and integrated these into a linear pan-genome framework to create a pan-RTD, allowing transcript categorization as core, shell or cloud. Focusing on the core (expressed in all genotypes), we observed significant transcript abundance variation among tissues and between genotypes driven partly by RNA processing, gene copy number, structural rearrangements and conservation of promotor motifs. Network analyses revealed conserved co-expression module::tissue correlations and frequent functional diversification. To complement the pan-transcriptome, we constructed a comprehensive cultivar (cv.) Morex gene-expression atlas and illustrate how these combined datasets can be used to guide biological inquiry. A long- and short-read barley pan-transcriptome assembled from 20 diverse barley genotypes offers insights into genotype- and tissue-dependent gene expression and function.},

  abstract     = {Rice production is facing substantial threats from global warming associated with extreme temperatures. Here we report that modifying a heat stress-induced negative regulator, a negative regulator of thermotolerance 1 (NAT1), increases wax deposition and enhances thermotolerance in rice. We demonstrated that the C2H2 family transcription factor NAT1 directly inhibits bHLH110 expression, and bHLH110 directly promotes the expression of wax biosynthetic genes CER1/CER1L under heat stress conditions. In situ hybridization revealed that both NAT1 and bHLH110 are predominantly expressed in epidermal layers. By using gene-editing technology, we successfully mutated NAT1 to eliminate its inhibitory effects on wax biosynthesis and improved thermotolerance without yield penalty under normal temperature conditions. Field trials further confirmed the potential of NAT1-edited rice to increase seed-setting rate and grain yield. Therefore, our findings shed light on the regulatory mechanisms governing wax biosynthesis under heat stress conditions in rice and provide a strategy to enhance heat resilience through the modification of NAT1. Negative regulator of thermotolerance 1 (NAT1) is identified as a negative regulator of thermotolerance in rice through the NAT1–bHLH110–CER1/CER1L module. Modifying NAT1 by targeted gene editing increases wax deposition and enhances thermotolerance in rice.},

  abstract     = {Human adipose depots are functionally distinct. Yet, recent single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) analyses largely uncovered overlapping or similar cell-type landscapes. We hypothesized that adipocyte subtypes, differentiation trajectories and/or intercellular communication patterns could illuminate this depot similarity–difference gap. For this, we performed snRNA-seq of human subcutaneous or visceral adipose tissues (five or ten samples, respectively). Of 27,665 adipocyte nuclei in both depots, most were ‘classical’, namely enriched in lipid metabolism pathways. However, we also observed ‘nonclassical’ adipocyte subtypes, enriched in immune-related, extracellular matrix deposition (fibrosis), vascularization or angiogenesis or ribosomal and mitochondrial processes. Pseudo-temporal analysis showed a developmental trajectory from adipose progenitor cells to classical adipocytes via nonclassical adipocytes, suggesting that the classical state stems from loss, rather than gain, of specialized functions. Last, intercellular communication routes were consistent with the different inflammatory tone of the two depots. Jointly, these findings provide a high-resolution view into the contribution of cellular composition, differentiation and intercellular communication patterns to human fat depot differences. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing of human visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues is used to identify adipocyte subpopulations and explore their developmental trajectories and interactions.},

  abstract     = {Targeting cancer stem cells (CSCs) is crucial for effective cancer treatment, yet resistance mechanisms to LGR5+ CSC depletion in WNT-driven colorectal cancer (CRC) remain elusive. In the present study, we revealed that mutant intestinal stem cells (SCs) depart from their canonical identity, traversing a dynamic phenotypic spectrum. This enhanced plasticity is initiated by oncofetal (OnF) reprogramming, driven by YAP and AP-1, with subsequent AP-1 hyperactivation promoting lineage infidelity. The retinoid X receptor serves as a gatekeeper of OnF reprogramming and its deregulation after adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) loss of function establishes an OnF ‘memory’ sustained by YAP and AP-1. Notably, the clinical significance of OnF and LGR5+ states in isolation is constrained by their functional redundancy. Although the canonical LGR5+ state is sensitive to the FOLFIRI regimen, an active OnF program correlates with resistance, supporting its role in driving drug-tolerant states. Targeting this program in combination with the current standard of care is pivotal for achieving effective and durable CRC treatment. Oncofetal (OnF) reprogramming, driven by YAP and AP-1, induces phenotypic plasticity and therapy resistance in WNT-dependent colorectal cancer (CRC). Targeting the OnF state in combination with chemotherapy substantially attenuates tumor growth in mouse models and patient-derived CRC tumoroids.},

  abstract     = {Segmental duplications (SDs) contribute significantly to human disease, evolution and diversity but have been difficult to resolve at the sequence level. We present a population genetics survey of SDs by analyzing 170 human genome assemblies (from 85 samples representing 38 Africans and 47 non-Africans) in which the majority of autosomal SDs are fully resolved using long-read sequence assembly. Excluding the acrocentric short arms and sex chromosomes, we identify 173.2 Mb of duplicated sequence (47.4 Mb not present in the telomere-to-telomere reference) distinguishing fixed from structurally polymorphic events. We find that intrachromosomal SDs are among the most variable, with rare events mapping near their progenitor sequences. African genomes harbor significantly more intrachromosomal SDs and are more likely to have recently duplicated gene families with higher copy numbers than non-African samples. Comparison to a resource of 563 million full-length isoform sequencing reads identifies 201 novel, potentially protein-coding genes corresponding to these copy number polymorphic SDs. Analysis of 170 human genomes assembled using long-read sequencing provides a map of structural variation within regions of segmental duplication and identifies novel candidate protein-coding genes supported by full-length Iso-Seq reads.},

We developed a statistical pipeline to infer fine-scale Ancestry Components and applied it to UK Biobank data. Ancestry Components identify population structure not captured by widely used principal components, improving stratification correction for geographically correlated traits. To estimate the similarity of genetic effect sizes between groups, we developed ANCHOR, which estimates changes in the predictive power of an existing PGS in distinct local ancestry segments. ANCHOR infers highly similar (estimated correlation 0.98 ± 0.07) effect sizes between UK Biobank participants of African and European ancestry for 47 of 53 quantitative phenotypes, suggesting that gene–environment and gene–gene interactions do not play major roles in poor cross-ancestry PGS transferability for these traits in the United Kingdom, and providing optimism that shared causal mutations operate similarly in different populations. This study introduces the concept of Ancestry Components and shows that they can offer improved population stratification correction for geographically correlated traits. By using ancestry-aware polygenic score construction in admixed individuals, the authors find that effect sizes are conserved across ancestry groups.},

In the present study, we quantified the impact of TR size variation on brain gene regulation across distinct molecular phenotypes, based on 4,412 multi-omics samples from 1,597 donors, including 1,586 newly sequenced ones. We identified ~2.2 million TR molecular quantitative trait loci (TR-xQTLs), linking ~139,000 unique TRs to nearby molecular phenotypes, including many known disease-risk TRs, such as the G2C4 expansion in C9orf72 associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Fine-mapping revealed ~18,700 TRs as potential causal variants. Our in vitro experiments further confirmed the causal and independent regulatory effects of three TRs. Additional colocalization analysis indicated the potential causal role of TR variation in brain-related phenotypes, highlighted by a 3ʹ-UTR TR in NUDT14 linked to cortical surface area and a TG repeat in PLEKHA1, associated with Alzheimer’s disease. Mapping of multi-omic molecular quantitative trait loci associated with tandem repeat size variation in up to 4,412 human brain samples from 1,597 donors offers insights into how these variants affect gene regulation and mediate disease risk.},

Given that obesity strongly influences circulating protein levels, we investigated proteins mediating the effects of obesity on coronary artery disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes. By integrating two-step proteome-wide Mendelian randomization, colocalization, epigenomics and single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified five mediators and prioritized collagen type VI α3 (COL6A3). COL6A3 levels were strongly increased by body mass index and increased coronary artery disease risk. Notably, the carboxyl terminus product of COL6A3, endotrophin, drove this effect. COL6A3 was highly expressed in disease-relevant cell types and tissues. Finally, we found that body fat reduction could reduce plasma levels of COL6A3-derived endotrophin, indicating a tractable way to modify endotrophin levels. In summary, we provide actionable insights into how circulating proteins mediate the effects of obesity on cardiometabolic diseases and prioritize endotrophin as a potential therapeutic target. Two-step Mendelian randomization, combined with multiple layers of omics evidence, implicates COL6A3-derived endotrophin as a mediator of coronary artery disease risk in the context of obesity.},

We identified 318 independent genome-wide significant (P ≤ 5 × 10−8) variants, 184 of which were novel. Most demonstrated evidence of replication in an independent cohort (n = 95,768). Meta-analyzing discovery and replication (n = 392,522) identified 447 variants, of which a further 111 were novel. Out-of-sample variance in PSA explained by our genome-wide polygenic risk scores ranged from 11.6% to 16.6% for European ancestry, 5.5% to 9.5% for African ancestry, 13.5% to 18.2% for Hispanic/Latino and 8.6% to 15.3% for Asian ancestry and decreased with increasing age. Midlife genetically adjusted PSA levels were more strongly associated with overall and aggressive prostate cancer than unadjusted PSA levels.

  abstract     = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) yield large numbers of genetic loci associated with traits and diseases. Predicting the effector genes that mediate these locus-trait associations remains challenging. Here we present the FLAMES (fine-mapped locus assessment model of effector genes) framework, which predicts the most likely effector gene in a locus. FLAMES creates machine learning predictions from biological data linking single-nucleotide polymorphisms to genes, and then evaluates these scores together with gene-centric evidence of convergence of the GWAS signal in functional networks. We benchmark FLAMES on gene-locus pairs derived by expert curation, rare variant implication and domain knowledge of molecular traits. We demonstrate that combining single-nucleotide-polymorphism-based and convergence-based modalities outperforms prioritization strategies using a single line of evidence. Applying FLAMES, we resolve the FSHB locus in the GWAS for dizygotic twinning and further leverage this framework to find schizophrenia risk genes that converge with rare coding evidence and are relevant in different stages of life. FLAMES is a machine learning approach combining variant fine-mapping, SNP-to-gene annotations and convergence-based gene prioritization scores to identify candidate effector genes at genome-wide associated loci with high accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Huntington’s disease, one of more than 50 inherited repeat expansion disorders1, is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by a CAG expansion in HTT2. Inherited CAG repeat length is the primary determinant of age of onset, with human genetic studies underscoring that the disease is driven by the CAG length-dependent propensity of the repeat to further expand in the brain3–9. Routes to slowing somatic CAG expansion, therefore, hold promise for disease-modifying therapies. Several DNA repair genes, notably in the mismatch repair pathway, modify somatic expansion in Huntington’s disease mouse models10. To identify novel modifiers of somatic expansion, we used CRISPR–Cas9 editing in Huntington’s disease knock-in mice to enable in vivo screening of expansion-modifier candidates at scale. This included testing of Huntington’s disease onset modifier genes emerging from human genome-wide association studies as well as interactions between modifier genes, providing insight into pathways underlying CAG expansion and potential therapeutic targets. A novel in vivo screening strategy identifies new modifiers of somatic CAG repeat expansion that contribute to age of onset in Huntington’s disease.},

Here, with a series of developed lines with or without PFT but all possessing HisR and five HisR-carrying PFT mutant lines created via gene editing, we show that PFT does not confer FHB resistance and that the HisR resistance effect does not require PFT in the tested conditions. We also show that PFT mutations are not associated with morphological and phenological characteristics that often affect FHB severity. Analysis of wheat lines generated through introgression or gene editing provides evidence that Fhb1-mediated resistance to Fusarium head blight is independent of the pore-forming toxin gene PFT.},

  abstract     = {In the past decade, our understanding of how new genes originate in diverse organisms has advanced substantially, and more than a dozen molecular mechanisms for generating initial gene structures were identified, in addition to gene duplication. These new genes have been found to integrate into and modify pre-existing gene networks primarily through mutation and selection, revealing new patterns and rules with stable origination rates across various organisms. This progress has challenged the prevailing belief that new proteins evolve from pre-existing genes, as new genes may arise de novo from noncoding DNA sequences in many organisms, with high rates observed in flowering plants. New genes have important roles in phenotypic and functional evolution across diverse biological processes and structures, with detectable fitness effects of sexual conflict genes that can shape species divergence. Such knowledge of new genes can be of translational value in agriculture and medicine. This Review discusses the various molecular mechanisms underlying the generation of new genes and highlights their important functions and phenotypes with an emphasis on the evolutionary forces underlying natural selection and sexual conflict.},

In this Perspective, we identify definitions of broad that have been used interchangeably, despite their distinct implications. We further offer a framework with clarified concepts for genomic data sharing and probe six examples in genomics that produced public data. Finally, we articulate three challenges. First, we explore the need to reinterpret the limits of general research use data. Second, we consider the governance of public data deposition from extant samples. Third, we ask whether, in light of changing concepts of broad, participants should be encouraged to share their status as participants publicly or not. Each of these challenges is followed with recommendations. This Perspective discusses the definitions of ‘broad’ that have been used in the context of sharing of human genomic data and proposes a clarified and reformed terminology for describing genomic data sharing more precisely.},

These behaviours, occurring over hours to days, influence long-term cell fates including differentiation. Here we report a whole-cell movement that occurs in sliding hydrogels at the minutes timescale, termed cell tumbling, characterized by three-dimensional cell dynamics and hydrogel deformation elicited by heightened seconds-to-minutes-scale cytoskeletal and nuclear activity. Studies inhibiting or promoting the cell tumbling of mesenchymal stem cells show that this behaviour enhances differentiation into chondrocytes. Further, it is associated with a decrease in global chromatin accessibility, which is required for enhanced differentiation. Cell tumbling also occurs during differentiation into other lineages and its differentiation-enhancing effects are validated in various hydrogel platforms. Our results establish that cell tumbling is an additional regulator of stem cell differentiation, mediated by rapid niche deformation and nuclear mechanotransduction. Minutes-scale whole-cell movements fuelled by fast cytoskeletal dynamics and nuclear activity regulate mesenchymal stem cells differentiation into chondrocytes in hydrogels, being another process modulating the stem cell fate.},

Patients with B cell lymphoma on effective immunotherapies exhibit diminished antibody production, leading to higher infection rates and reduced vaccine efficacy, even after B cell recovery. Current ex vivo models fail to sustain long-term GC reactions and effectively test B cell responses. Here we developed synthetic hydrogels mimicking the lymphoid tissue microenvironment, enabling human GCs from tonsils and peripheral blood mononuclear cell-derived B cells. Immune organoids derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells maintain GC B cells and plasma cells longer than tonsil-derived ones and exhibit unique B cell programming, including GC compartments, somatic hypermutation, immunoglobulin class switching and B cell clones. Chemical inhibition of transcriptional and epigenetic processes enhances plasma cell formation. While integrating polarized CXCL12 protein in a lymphoid organ-on-chip modulates GC responses in healthy donor B cells, it fails with B cells derived from patients with lymphoma. Our system allows rapid, controlled modelling of immune responses and B cell disorders.

  abstract     = {A successful therapeutic outcome in the treatment of solid tumours requires efficient intratumoural drug accumulation and retention. Here we demonstrate that zinc gluconate in oral supplements assembles with plasma proteins to form ZnO nanoparticles that selectively accumulate into papillary Caki-2 renal tumours and promote the recruitment of dendritic cells and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells to tumour tissues. Renal tumour targeting is mediated by the preferential binding of zinc ions to metallothionein-1X proteins, which are constitutively overexpressed in Caki-2 renal tumour cells. This binding event further upregulates intracellular metallothionein-1X expression to induce additional nanoparticle binding and retention. In both tumour animal models and human renal tumour samples, we show that ZnO nanoparticles actively cross the vascular wall to achieve high intratumoural accumulation. We further explore this feature of ZnO nanoparticles for the delivery of chemotherapeutics to mouse and rabbit cancer models. Our findings demonstrate that ZnO nanoparticles derived from supplements can serve as a multifunctional drug delivery and cancer immunotherapy platform.

  abstract     = {The shape of biological matter is central to cell function at different length scales and determines how cellular components recognize, interact and respond to one another. However, their shapes are often transient and hard to reprogramme. Here we construct a synthetic cell model composed of signal-responsive DNA nanorafts, biogenic pores and giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). We demonstrate that reshaping of DNA rafts at the nanoscale can be coupled to reshaping of GUVs at the microscale. The nanorafts collectively undergo reversible transitions between isotropic and short-range local order on the lipid membrane, programmably remodelling the GUV shape. Assisted by the biogenic pores, during GUV shape recovery the locally ordered DNA rafts perforate the membrane, forming sealable synthetic channels for large cargo transport. Our work outlines a versatile platform for interfacing reconfigurable DNA nanostructures with synthetic cells, expanding the potential of DNA nanotechnology in synthetic biology. The shape of biological matter is central to their function and interaction with other cellular components. A combination of DNA origami nanorafts with biogenic pores reversibly controls the shape and permeability of lipid vesicles at the microscale.},

  abstract     = {Supercooled liquids display sluggish dynamics, often attributed to their structural characteristics, yet the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here we conduct numerical investigations into the structure–dynamics relationship in model glass-forming liquids, with a specific focus on an elementary particle rearrangement mode known as the ‘T1 process’. We discover that the ability of a T1 process to preserve glassy structural order before and after is pivotal towards determining a liquid’s fragility—whether it exhibits super-Arrhenius-like or Arrhenius-like behaviour. If a T1 process disrupts local structural order, it must occur independently without cooperativity, resulting in Arrhenius-like behaviour. By contrast, if it can maintain order, it sequentially propagates from disordered peripheries to the middle of high-structural-order regions, leading to cooperativity and super-Arrhenius-like behaviour. Our study establishes a microscopic link between liquid-structure ordering, dynamic cooperativity and super-Arrhenius-like dynamics, extending the understanding of the structure–dynamics relationships in supercooled liquids. An elementary particle rearrangement mode known as the T1 process links liquid dynamics and local structural ordering to understand the physical mechanisms of super-Arrhenius-like behaviour in glass-forming liquids.},

This control is central to such diverse fields as molecular optoelectronics, quantum sensing, quantum biology and spin chemistry, but its effect is typically fairly weak in pure molecular systems. Here we introduce hybrid radical pairs constructed from semiconductor quantum dots and organic molecules. The large g-factor difference enables us to directly observe the radical-pair spin quantum beats usually hidden in previous studies, which are further accelerated by the strong exchange coupling of radical pairs enabled by the quantum confinement of quantum dots. The rapid quantum beats enable the efficient and coherent control of charge recombination dynamics at room temperature, with the modulation level of the yield of spin-triplet products reaching 400%. Photochemical quantum process in quantum dot–molecule hybrids is normally weak and difficult to be coherently controlled.

However, the substantial open-circuit voltage loss in the wide-bandgap perovskite subcell hinders further improvements in power-conversion efficiency. Here we develop wide-bandgap perovskite films with improved (100) crystal orientation that suppress non-radiative recombination. We show that using two-dimensional perovskite as an intermediate phase on the film surface promotes heterogeneous nucleation along the (100) three-dimensional perovskite facets during crystallization. Preferred (100) orientations can be realized by augmenting the quantity of two-dimensional phases through surface composition engineering, without the need for excessive two-dimensional ligands that otherwise impede carrier transport. We demonstrate an open-circuit voltage of 1.373 V for 1.78 eV wide-bandgap perovskite solar cells, along with a high fill factor of 84.7%. This yields an open-circuit voltage of 2.21 V and a certified power-conversion efficiency of 29.1% for all-perovskite tandem solar cells, measured under the maximum power-point conditions. Substantial open-circuit voltage loss and inherent non-radiative recombination hinder efficiency improvements in wide-bandgap perovskite solar cells.

  abstract     = {Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) hold great promise for next-generation safe, durable and energy-dense battery technology. However, solid-state sulfur conversion reactions are kinetically sluggish and primarily constrained to the restricted three-phase boundary area of sulfur, carbon and solid electrolytes, making it challenging to achieve high sulfur utilization. Here we develop and implement mixed ionic–electronic conductors (MIECs) in sulfur cathodes to replace conventional solid electrolytes and invoke conversion reactions at sulfur–MIEC interfaces in addition to traditional three-phase boundaries. Microscopic and tomographic analyses reveal the emergence of mixed-conducting domains embedded in sulfur at sulfur–MIEC boundaries, helping promote the thorough conversion of active sulfur into Li2S. Consequently, substantially improved active sulfur ratios (up to 87.3%) and conversion degrees (&amp;gt;94%) are achieved in Li–S ASSBs with high discharge capacity (&amp;gt;1,450 mAh g–1) and long cycle life (&amp;gt;1,000 cycles). The strategy is also applied to enhance the active material utilization of other conversion cathodes. Low-cost conversion cathodes are promising for future all-solid-state battery technology, but their poor electronic and ionic conductivity restrict reactions to three-phase boundaries. By using mixed ionic–electronic conductors, conversion reactions can be initiated at two-phase boundaries, resulting in enhanced discharge capacity and lifespan.},

Typically, chemically prepared c-Na2V2(PO4)3, obtained by annealing an equimolar mixture of Na3V2(PO4)3 and NaV2(PO4)3, exhibits a specific sodium-ion distribution (occupancy of the Na(1) site of only 0.66(4)), whereas that of the electrochemically obtained e-Na2V2(PO4)3 (from Na3V2(PO4)3) is close to 1. Unlike conventional Na3V2(PO4)3, when used as positive electrode materials in Na-ion batteries, the NaxV2(PO4)3 compositions lead to unusual single-phase Na+ extraction/insertion mechanisms with continuous voltage changes upon Na+ extraction/insertion. We demonstrate that the average equilibrium operating voltage observed upon Na+ deintercalation from single-phase Na2V2(PO4)3 is increased up to an average value of ~3.70 V versus Na+/Na (thanks to the activation of the V4+/V5+ redox couple) compared to 3.37 V versus Na+/Na in conventional Na3V2(PO4)3, thus leading to an increase in the theoretical energy density from 396.3 Wh kg–1 to 458.1 Wh kg–1. Electrochemical and chemical Na+ deintercalation from c-Na2V2(PO4)3 enables complete Na-ion extraction, increasing energy density. Single-phase NaxV2(PO4)3 compositions obtained by annealing mixtures of Na3V2(PO4)3 and NaV2(PO4)3 enable the complete electrochemical extraction of Na+ through the activation of the V4+/V5+ couple.

In van der Waals antiferromagnets, a new type of magnetic polymorphism arises, presenting multiple layer-selective magnetic structures with identical total magnetization. However, resolving and manipulating such magnetic polymorphs remain challenging. Here, phase-resolved magnetic second harmonic generation microscopy is used to elucidate magnetic polymorphism in 2D layered antiferromagnet CrSBr, demonstrating deterministic and layer-selective switching of magnetic polymorphs. Using a nonlinear magneto-optical technique, we unambiguously resolve the polymorphic spin-flip transitions in CrSBr bilayers and tetralayers through both the amplitude and phase of light. Remarkably, the deterministic routing of polymorphic spin-flip transitions originates from a ‘layer-sharing’ effect, where the transitions are governed by laterally extended layers acting as ‘control bits’. We envision that such controllable magnetic polymorphism could be ubiquitous for van der Waals layered antiferromagnets, enabling new designs and constructions of spintronic and opto-spintronic devices for probabilistic computation and neuromorphic engineering.

So far, it has been shown that electric-field pulses in the spectral region from the visible to the terahertz range can be used to induce ultrafast switching between different spin states. Here we demonstrate that a multicycle terahertz magnetic-field pulse can be used to induce non-thermal spin switching in antiferromagnets. When a strong pulse is applied to Sm0.7Er0.3FeO3, the magnetic order parameter is first driven away from the barrier between the two potential minima of this antiferromagnet and then, in the subsequent inertial motion towards the opposite direction, it crosses the barrier. Our analysis reveals that the initial motion is driven by a dynamical modification of the magnetic potential, and this modification is enhanced through coupling between the two magnon modes. The authors realize non-thermal spin switching in a canted antiferromagnet through dynamically modifying the magnetic potential using a strong multicycle terahertz magnetic near field.},

Recent advances in the study of chiral systems have stimulated interest in the discovery of symmetry-breaking states that enable exotic phenomena such as spontaneous gyrotropic order and superconductivity. Here we examine the interaction between light chirality and electron spins in indium selenide and study the effect of magnetic field on emerging tunnelling photocurrents at the Van Hove singularity. Although the effect is symmetric under linearly polarized light excitation, a non-symmetric signal emerges when the excitation is circularly polarized, making it possible to electrically detect light’s chirality. Our study shows a negligible out-of-plane g-factor for few-layer indium selenide at the valence band edge, resulting in an unbalanced Zeeman splitting in hexagonal boron nitride spin bands. This finding allows us to measure the change in energy barrier height with exceptional resolution (~15 μeV). Furthermore, we confirm the long-standing theoretical prediction of spin-polarized hole accumulation in the flat valence band at increasing laser powers. Light chirality and electron spin interactions and the dependence of tunnelling photocurrent on the magnetic field are studied in indium selenide, exploiting its non-symmetric response to circularly polarized light to electrically detect chirality.},

One key challenge is the development of insulators with high dielectric constant, wide bandgap and high tunnel masses. Here, we show that two-dimensional monocrystalline gadolinium pentoxide, which is devised through combining particle swarm optimization algorithm and theoretical calculations and synthesized via van der Waals epitaxy, could exhibit a high dielectric constant of ~25.5 and a wide bandgap simultaneously. A desirable equivalent oxide thickness down to 1 nm with an ultralow leakage current of ~10−4 A cm−2 even at 5 MV cm−1 is achieved. The molybdenum disulfide transistors gated by gadolinium pentoxide exhibit high on/off ratios over 108 and near-Boltzmann-limit subthreshold swing at an operation voltage of 0.5 V. We also constructed inverter circuits with high gain and nanowatt power consumption. This reliable approach to integrating ultrathin monocrystalline insulators paves the way to future nanoelectronics. Two-dimensional monocrystalline gadolinium pentoxide with high dielectric constant and wide bandgap was prepared through van der Waals epitaxy, allowing the realization of sub-1 nm equivalent oxide thickness and low-power nanoelectronics.},

  abstract     = {Batch production of single-crystal two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides is one prerequisite for the fabrication of next-generation integrated circuits. Contemporary strategies for the wafer-scale high-quality crystallinity of 2D materials centre on merging unidirectionally aligned, differently sized domains. However, an imperfectly merged area with a translational lattice brings about a high defect density and low device uniformity, which restricts the application of the 2D materials. Here we establish a liquid-to-solid crystallization in 2D space that can rapidly grow a centimetre-scale single-crystal MoS2 domain with no grain boundaries. The large MoS2 single crystal obtained shows superb uniformity and high quality with an ultra-low defect density. A statistical analysis of field effect transistors fabricated from the MoS2 reveals a high device yield and minimal variation in mobility, positioning this FET as an advanced standard monolayer MoS2 device. This 2D Czochralski method has implications for fabricating high-quality and scalable 2D semiconductor materials and devices. A 2D Czochralski method is introduced for rapidly growing centimetre-scale single-crystal MoS2 domains with low defect density and impressive electrical performance. This method shows potential for fabricating high-quality and scalable 2D semiconductor materials and devices.},

This Perspective elucidates the progress, challenges and opportunities in moving MOFs to market, focusing on applied research. The five applied research steps that enable technology development and demonstration are reviewed: synthesis, forming, processing (washing and activation), prototyping and compliance. Furthermore, the importance of a comprehensive techno-economic analysis incorporating a complete picture of costs and revenues is discussed. Readers can use the understanding of applied research presented herein to tackle their MOF commercialization challenges. Metal–organic frameworks are a class of materials that have attracted researchers for over 25 years and have been proposed for many applications. This Perspective discusses critical topics in applied research for commercialization, and highlights challenges associated with product development.},

  abstract     = {CD8+ T cells exhibit remarkable phenotypic diversity in inflammation and cancer. However, a comprehensive understanding of their clonal landscape and dynamics remains elusive. Here we introduce scAtlasVAE, a deep-learning-based model for the integration of large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing data and cross-atlas comparisons. scAtlasVAE has enabled us to construct an extensive human CD8+ T cell atlas, comprising 1,151,678 cells from 961 samples across 68 studies and 42 disease conditions, with paired T cell receptor information. Through incorporating information in T cell receptor clonal expansion and sharing, we have successfully established connections between distinct cell subtypes and shed light on their phenotypic and functional transitions. Notably, our approach characterizes three distinct exhausted T cell subtypes and reveals diverse transcriptome and clonal sharing patterns in autoimmune and immune-related adverse event inflammation. Furthermore, scAtlasVAE facilitates the automatic annotation of CD8+ T cell subtypes in query single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, enabling unbiased and scalable analyses. In conclusion, our work presents a comprehensive single-cell reference and computational framework for CD8+ T cell research. scAtlasVAE is a deep learning-based model for cross-atlas integration. Here it enables the development of a large-scale human CD8+ T cell atlas with integrated T cell receptor data.},

  abstract     = {Over a lifetime, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) adjust their lineage output to support age-aligned physiology. In model organisms, stereotypic waves of hematopoiesis have been observed corresponding to defined age-biased HSC hallmarks. However, how the properties of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells change over the human lifespan remains unclear. To address this gap, we profiled individual transcriptome states of human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells spanning gestation, maturation and aging. Here we define the gene expression networks dictating age-specific differentiation of HSCs and the dynamics of fate decisions and lineage priming throughout life. We additionally identifiy and functionally validate a fetal-specific HSC state with robust engraftment and multilineage capacity. Furthermore, we observe that classification of acute myeloid leukemia against defined transcriptional age states demonstrates that utilization of early life transcriptional programs associates with poor prognosis. Overall, we provide a disease-relevant framework for heterochronic orientation of stem cell ontogeny along the real time axis of the human lifespan. This Resource presents an atlas classifying the age-related changes in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from gestation through aging.},

  abstract     = {The native membrane environment profoundly influences every aspect of membrane protein (MP) biology. Despite this, the most prevalent method of studying MPs uses detergents to disrupt and remove this vital membrane context, impeding our ability to decipher the local molecular context and its effect. Here we develop a membrane proteome-wide platform that enables rapid spatially resolved extraction of target MPs directly from cellular membranes into native nanodiscs that maintain the local membrane context, using a library of membrane-active polymers. We accompany this with an open-access database that quantifies the polymer-specific extraction efficiency for 2,065 unique mammalian MPs and provides the most optimized extraction condition for each. To validate, we demonstrate how this resource can enable rapid extraction and purification of target MPs from different organellar membranes with high efficiency and purity. Further, we show how the database can be extended to capture overexpressed multiprotein complexes by taking two synaptic vesicle MPs. We expect these publicly available resources to empower researchers across disciplines to efficiently capture membrane ‘nano-scoops’ containing a target MP and interface with structural, functional and bioanalytical approaches. This manuscript reports a high-throughput platform for nanoscale spatially resolved extraction of membrane proteins into native nanodiscs by using a library of membrane-active polymers while maintaining their local membrane context.},

We describe automatic assessment protocols for comparisons between prediction and experiment. Our analyses reveal some critical steps to be overcome to achieve good accuracy in modeling RNA structures: identification of helix-forming pairs and of non-Watson–Crick modules, correct coaxial stacking between helices and avoidance of entanglements. Three of the top four modeling groups in this round also ranked among the top four in the CASP15 contest.

Here we developed Moculus, a head-mounted virtual reality platform for mice that covers the entire visual field, and allows binocular depth perception and full visual immersion. This controllable environment, with three-dimensional (3D) corridors and 3D objects, in combination with 3D acousto-optical imaging, affords rapid visual learning and the uncovering of circuit substrates in one measurement session. Both the control and reinforcement-associated visual cue coding neuronal assemblies are transiently expanded by reinforcement feedback to near-saturation levels. This increases computational capability and allows competition among assemblies that encode behaviorally relevant information. The coding assemblies form partially orthogonal and overlapping clusters centered around hub cells with higher and earlier ramp-like responses, as well as locally increased functional connectivity. Moculus is a virtual reality headset for mice that allows realistic display of three-dimensional environments. The system improves performance in visual-learning tasks and can be combined with various microscopes to study neural circuitry.},

Here, we have developed vibrational fiber photometry as a low-invasive method for label-free monitoring of the biomolecular content of arbitrarily deep regions of the mouse brain in vivo through spontaneous Raman spectroscopy. Using a tapered fiber probe as thin as 1 µm at its tip, we elucidate the cytoarchitecture of the mouse brain, monitor molecular alterations caused by traumatic brain injury, as well as detect markers of brain metastasis with high accuracy. We view our approach, which introduces a deep learning algorithm to suppress probe background, as a promising complement to the existing palette of tools for the optical interrogation of neural function, with application to fundamental and preclinical investigations of the brain and other organs. Vibrational fiber photometry enables Raman spectroscopy in the mouse brain with low impact, owing to the use of tapered fibers.},

  abstract     = {Dissecting human neurobiology at high resolution and with mechanistic precision requires a major leap in scalability, given the need for experimental designs that include multiple individuals and, prospectively, population cohorts. To lay the foundation for this, we have developed and benchmarked complementary strategies to multiplex brain organoids by pooling cells from different pluripotent stem cell (PSC) lines either during organoid generation (mosaic models) or before single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) library preparation (downstream multiplexing). We have also developed a new computational method, SCanSNP, and a consensus call to deconvolve cell identities, overcoming current criticalities in doublets and low-quality cell identification. We validated both multiplexing methods for charting neurodevelopmental trajectories at high resolution, thus linking specific individuals’ trajectories to genetic variation. Finally, we modeled their scalability across different multiplexing combinations and showed that mosaic organoids represent an enabling method for high-throughput settings. Together, this multiplexing suite of experimental and computational methods provides a highly scalable resource for brain disease and neurodiversity modeling. This paper develops two approaches for multiplexing cortical organoids and SCanSNP, a method for deconvolving cell identities, to trace neurodevelopmental trajectories at scale.},

Here we present 4Pi-SIM, a substantial revamp of I5S that synergizes 3D-SIM with interferometric microscopy to achieve isotropic optical resolution through interference in both the illumination and detection wavefronts. We evaluate the performance of 4Pi-SIM by imaging various subcellular structures across different cell types with high fidelity. Furthermore, we demonstrate its capability by conducting time-lapse volumetric imaging over hundreds of time points, achieving a 3D resolution of approximately 100 nm. Additionally, we illustrate its ability to simultaneously image in two colors and capture the rapid interactions between closely positioned organelles in three dimensions. These results underscore the great potential of 4Pi-SIM for elucidating subcellular architecture and revealing dynamic behaviors at the nanoscale.

In most biomedical studies, the cells being compared are in different mutant and control animals and, therefore, do not experience the same epigenetic changes and tissue microenvironment. The experimental induction of genetic mosaics is essential to determine a gene cell-autonomous function and to model the etiology of diseases caused by somatic mutations. Current technologies used to induce genetic mosaics in mice lack either accuracy, throughput or barcoding diversity. Here we present the iFlpMosaics toolkit comprising a large set of new genetic tools and mouse lines that enable recombinase-dependent ratiometric induction and single-cell clonal tracking of multiple fluorescently labeled wild-type and Cre-mutant cells within the same time window and tissue microenvironment. The labeled cells can be profiled by multispectral imaging or by fluorescence-activated flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing. iFlpMosaics facilitate the induction and analysis of genetic mosaics in any quiescent or progenitor cell, and for any given single or combination of floxed genes, thus enabling a more accurate understanding of how induced genetic mutations affect the biology of single cells during tissue development, homeostasis and disease. iFlpMosaics are a compendium of mouse lines and genetic tools for tissue-agnostic generation and analysis of genetic mosaics.},

We introduce SurfDock, a deep-learning method that addresses this challenge by integrating protein sequence, three-dimensional structural graphs and surface-level features into an equivariant architecture. SurfDock employs a generative diffusion model on a non-Euclidean manifold, optimizing molecular translations, rotations and torsions to generate reliable binding poses. Our extensive evaluations across various benchmarks demonstrate SurfDock’s superiority over existing methods in docking success rates and adherence to physical constraints. It also exhibits remarkable generalizability to unseen proteins and predicted apo structures, while achieving state-of-the-art performance in virtual screening tasks. In a real-world application, SurfDock identified seven novel hit molecules in a virtual screening project targeting aldehyde dehydrogenase 1B1, a key enzyme in cellular metabolism. This showcases SurfDock’s ability to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying cellular processes. These results highlight SurfDock’s potential as a transformative tool in structural biology, offering enhanced accuracy, physical plausibility and practical applicability in understanding protein–ligand interactions. SurfDock is a method for predicting protein–ligand complex structures by leveraging multimodal protein information and generative diffusion frameworks.

  abstract     = {Spatially resolved transcriptomics technologies provide high-throughput measurements of gene expression in a tissue slice, but the sparsity of these data complicates analysis of spatial gene expression patterns. We address this issue by deriving a topographic map of a tissue slice—analogous to a map of elevation in a landscape—using a quantity called the isodepth. Contours of constant isodepths enclose domains with distinct cell type composition, while gradients of the isodepth indicate spatial directions of maximum change in expression. We develop GASTON (gradient analysis of spatial transcriptomics organization with neural networks), an unsupervised and interpretable deep learning algorithm that simultaneously learns the isodepth, spatial gradients and piecewise linear expression functions that model both continuous gradients and discontinuous variation in gene expression. We show that GASTON accurately identifies spatial domains and marker genes across several tissues, gradients of neuronal differentiation and firing in the brain, and gradients of metabolism and immune activity in the tumor microenvironment. Gene expression topography analysis by GASTON portrays domain organization and spatial gradients of gene expression and cell type composition using spatially resolved transcriptomics data.},

  abstract     = {The prediction of molecular phenotypes from DNA sequences remains a longstanding challenge in genomics, often driven by limited annotated data and the inability to transfer learnings between tasks. Here, we present an extensive study of foundation models pre-trained on DNA sequences, named Nucleotide Transformer, ranging from 50 million up to 2.5 billion parameters and integrating information from 3,202 human genomes and 850 genomes from diverse species. These transformer models yield context-specific representations of nucleotide sequences, which allow for accurate predictions even in low-data settings. We show that the developed models can be fine-tuned at low cost to solve a variety of genomics applications. Despite no supervision, the models learned to focus attention on key genomic elements and can be used to improve the prioritization of genetic variants. The training and application of foundational models in genomics provides a widely applicable approach for accurate molecular phenotype prediction from DNA sequence. Nucleotide Transformer is a series of genomics foundation models of different parameter sizes and training datasets that can be applied to various downstream tasks by fine-tuning.},

Image-based profiling leverages the rich information in images to identify similarities or differences among biological samples, rather than measuring a few features, as in high-content screening. Here, we review a decade of advancements and applications of Cell Painting, a microscopy-based cell-labeling assay aiming to capture a cell’s state, introduced in 2013 to optimize and standardize image-based profiling. Cell Painting’s ability to capture cellular responses to various perturbations has expanded owing to improvements in the protocol, adaptations for different perturbations, and enhanced methodologies for feature extraction, quality control, and batch-effect correction. Cell Painting is a versatile tool that has been used in various applications, alone or with other -omics data, to decipher the mechanism of action of a compound, its toxicity profile, and other biological effects. Future advances will likely involve computational and experimental techniques, new publicly available datasets, and integration with other high-content data types. This Review synthesizes the literature from over 10 years of Cell Painting for image-based profiling and highlights how advances in this technology enable new biological discovery of cellular phenotypes and cell responses to perturbations.},

Moreover, considering the perpetual metabolism and communication within cells, it is essential to determine the time-series changes of the molecular library, rather than obtaining data at only one time point. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop a single-molecule strategy for this omics analysis to elucidate the biosystem heterogeneity and temporal dynamics. In this Perspective, we explore the potential application of nanopores for single-molecule temporal omics to characterize individual molecules beyond mass, in both a single-molecule and high-throughput manner. Accordingly, recent advances in nanopores available for single-molecule temporal omics are reviewed from the view of single-molecule mass identification, revealing single-molecule heterogeneity and illustrating temporal evolution. Furthermore, we discuss the primary challenges associated with using nanopores for single-molecule temporal omics in complex biological samples, and present the potential strategies and notes to respond to these challenges.

  abstract     = {Although classical thermal machines power industries and modern living, quantum thermal engines have yet to prove their utility. Here, we demonstrate a useful quantum absorption refrigerator formed from superconducting circuits. We use it to cool a transmon qubit to a temperature lower than that achievable with any one available bath, thereby resetting the qubit to an initial state suitable for quantum computing. The process is driven by a thermal gradient and is autonomous, requiring no external feedback. The refrigerator exploits an engineered three-body interaction between the target qubit and two auxiliary qudits. Each auxiliary qudit is coupled to a physical heat bath, realized with a microwave waveguide populated with synthesized quasithermal radiation. If the target qubit is initially fully excited, its effective temperature reaches a steady-state level of approximately 22 mK, lower than what can be achieved by existing state-of-the-art reset protocols. Our results demonstrate that superconducting circuits with propagating thermal fields can be used to experimentally explore quantum thermodynamics and apply it to quantum information-processing tasks. Resetting qubits in a quantum computer requires significant hardware resources. Now, an experiment demonstrates an on-chip quantum refrigerator that uses a thermal gradient to reset a superconducting qubit more effectively than conventional methods.},

  abstract     = {Gauge theories describe the fundamental forces in the standard model of particle physics and play an important role in condensed-matter physics. The constituents of gauge theories, for example, charged matter and electric gauge field, are governed by local gauge constraints, which lead to key phenomena such as the confinement of particles that are not fully understood. In this context, quantum simulators may address questions that are challenging for classical methods. Although engineering gauge constraints is highly demanding, recent advances in quantum computing are beginning to enable digital quantum simulations of gauge theories. Here we simulate confinement dynamics in a $${{\mathbb{Z}}}_{2}$$ lattice gauge theory on a superconducting quantum processor. Tuning a term that couples only to the electric field produces confinement of charges, a manifestation of the tight bond that the gauge constraint generates between both. Moreover, we show how a modification of the gauge constraint from $${{\mathbb{Z}}}_{2}$$ towards U(1) symmetry freezes the system dynamics. Our work illustrates the restriction that the underlying gauge constraint imposes on the dynamics of a lattice gauge theory, showcases how gauge constraints can be modified and protected, and promotes the study of other models governed by multibody interactions. Gauge theories host important phenomena such as confinement that are difficult to study theoretically. Advances in quantum computers have now made it possible to perform digital quantum simulations of confinement dynamics in a gauge theory.},

These range from semiconductor sensors, in which the Brownian motion of charge carriers poses limits, to optical reference cavities for atomic clocks or gravitational wave detection, which are limited by thermo-refractive and thermo-elastic noise. Here we find that charge-carrier density fluctuations give rise to a noise process in electro-optic photonic integrated circuits. We show that the noise exhibited by lithium niobate and lithium tantalate photonic integrated microresonators feature a frequency scaling to the power of −1.2, deviating from thermo-refractive noise theory. This noise is consistent with thermodynamical charge noise, which leads to electrical field fluctuations that are transduced via the strong Pockels effects of electro-optic materials. Our results establish electrical Johnson–Nyquist noise as the fundamental limitation for electro-optic integrated photonics, crucial for determining performance limits for both classical and quantum devices. Thermal agitation of charge carriers, known as Johnson noise, is the dominant noise in electronic circuits. Now it has also been observed as a key noise source in integrated electro-optic photonic circuits, posing challenges for future applications.},

  abstract     = {Quantum error correction is essential for mitigating hardware errors in quantum computers by encoding logical information into several physical qubits. However, no single error-correcting code intrinsically supports a fault-tolerant implementation of all the gates needed for universal quantum computing. One approach for addressing this problem is to switch between two suitable error-correcting codes that in combination provide a fault-tolerant universal gate set. Here we present the experimental implementation of fault-tolerant code switching between two different codes in a trapped-ion processor. We switch between the 7-qubit colour code, which features fault-tolerant CNOT and H quantum gates, and the 10-qubit code, which allows for a fault-tolerant T gate implementation. Together, these codes form a complementary universal gate set. We construct logical circuits and prepare 12 different logical states that are not accessible natively in a fault-tolerant way within a single code. Finally, we use code switching to entangle two logical qubits using the full universal gate set in a single logical quantum circuit. Our results experimentally demonstrate a route towards deterministic control over logical qubits with low auxiliary qubit overhead and without relying on the probabilistic preparation of resource states. Quantum error correction is essential for reliable quantum computing, but no single code supports all required fault-tolerant gates. The demonstration of switching between two codes now enables universal quantum computation with reduced overhead.},

  abstract     = {Simulations of quantum chemistry and quantum materials are believed to be among the most important applications of quantum information processors. However, realizing practical quantum advantage for such problems is challenging because of the prohibitive computational cost of programming typical problems into quantum hardware. Here we introduce a simulation framework for strongly correlated quantum systems represented by model spin Hamiltonians that uses reconfigurable qubit architectures to simulate real-time dynamics in a programmable way. Our approach also introduces an algorithm for extracting chemically relevant spectral properties via classical co-processing of quantum measurement results. We develop a digital–analogue simulation toolbox for efficient Hamiltonian time evolution using digital Floquet engineering and hardware-optimized multi-qubit operations to accurately realize complex spin–spin interactions. As an example, we propose an implementation based on Rydberg atom arrays. In addition, we show how detailed spectral information can be extracted from the dynamics through snapshot measurements and single-ancilla control, enabling the evaluation of excitation energies and finite-temperature susceptibilities from a single dataset. To illustrate the approach, we show how to use the method to compute key properties of a polynuclear transition-metal catalyst and two-dimensional magnetic materials. Quantum simulations of chemistry and materials are challenging due to the complexity of correlated systems. A framework based on reconfigurable qubit architectures and digital–analogue simulations provides a hardware-efficient path forwards.},

Research has largely focused on correlating different carcinoma subtypes to genetic alterations. However, as well as a rewiring in the signalling networks, carcinoma progression is accompanied by mechanical changes in the epithelial cells and the extracellular matrix. Here we reveal intricate morphologies in the basement membrane at the onset of bladder cancer and propose that they emerge from a mechanical instability upon epithelial overgrowth. We imaged mouse and human bladder tissue and performed differential growth simulations, and found that stiffness changes in the different mucosa layers can result in aberrant tissue morphologies. The resulting thickening, wrinkles and folds resemble early papillary tumours and carcinomas in situ. Atomic force microscopy confirmed local stiffness changes in the pathological basement membrane. Our findings suggest a possible mechanical origin of the different bladder carcinoma subtypes and may guide future developments in treatment and prophylaxis. Carcinoma subtypes are normally linked to specific genetic alterations, but tissue mechanical changes also play a role. Now, aberrant morphologies resembling bladder carcinoma are shown to emerge from stiffness changes during epithelial overgrowth.},

However, the mechanical signatures that influence the fate of extruding cells remain unknown. Here we show that modified force transmission across adherens junctions inhibits apoptotic cell eliminations. By combining cell experiments with varying levels of E-cadherin junctions and three-dimensional modelling of cell monolayers, we find that these changes not only affect the fate of the extruded cells but also shift extrusion from the apical to the basal side, leading to cell invasion into soft collagen gels. We generalize our findings using xenografts and cysts cultured in matrigel, derived from patients with breast cancer. Our results link intercellular force transmission regulated by cell–cell communication to cell extrusion mechanisms, with potential implications during morphogenesis and invasion of cancer cells. Tissues eliminate unwanted cells through cell extrusion, but the factors determining whether these extuded cells live or die are not fully understood. Now force transmission across adherens junctions is shown to have a role in shaping their fate.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the mechanical properties of soft jammed solids that consist of densely packed particles, such as foams and emulsions, requires insights into the microscopic origins of linear viscoelasticity—how a solid responds to an infinitesimal deformation. Here we perform microrheology experiments on concentrated emulsions and measure the storage and loss moduli for a wide range of frequencies. We applied a linear response formalism for microrheology to a soft sphere model that undergoes the jamming transition. We find that the theory quantitatively explains the experiments. Our analysis reveals that the anomalous viscous loss seen in emulsions results from the boson peak, which is a universal vibrational property of amorphous solids and reflects the marginal stability in soft jammed solids. We show that the anomalous viscous loss is universal in systems with various interparticle interactions as it stems from the universal boson peak; it even survives below the jamming density at which thermal fluctuation is pronounced and the dynamics becomes inherently nonlinear. The viscoelastic response of emulsions shows an anomalous loss. This effect is now shown to be related to the boson peak, a universal vibrational feature of amorphous solids.},

  abstract     = {Active glasses are dense and disordered systems consisting of motile particles that display phenomenology observed in many biological systems. Here we investigate motility-driven annealing and fluidization in these systems and establish a correspondence between the yielding behaviour of glassy systems under active dynamics and their yielding under oscillatory shear. The yielded region of the phase diagram correlates with tissue fluidization, whereas the annealing region explains age-related maturation and stiffening. This suggests that some mechanical changes observed in ageing tissues can partially stem from processes analogous to enhanced ageing observed in active glasses. In addition to showing similar yielding diagrams, we strengthen the correspondence to oscillatory shear by demonstrating diverging time scales to steady states, the possibility of memory encoding and reading, and the importance of stress reversals in the annealing process in both cases. Finally, we study yielding in active solids and demonstrate that given the correct geometry, one can either suppress or promote brittle failure via shear band formation by tuning activity. Active glasses are dense, disordered structures made up of motile constituents. Simulations now show that motility-driven annealing in such systems leads to mechanical changes, including increased brittleness.},

These modes facilitate both long-range coupling and the possibility of controlling their phase, which is a crucial aspect for device application. Here, we demonstrate variable-phase coupling between two nano-constriction spin Hall nano-oscillators and their mutual synchronization driven by propagating spin waves. Using electrical measurements and phase-resolved micro-focused Brillouin light scattering microscopy, we show that the phase of the mutual synchronization can be tuned by modulating the drive current or the applied field. Our micromagnetic simulations explore the phase tunability using voltage gating. Our results advance the capabilities of mutually synchronized spin Hall nano-oscillators and open the possibilities for applications in spin-wave logic-based devices. Phase tuning of propagating spin waves is a crucial step in the development of devices based on magnons, which are the quanta of spin waves.

  abstract     = {The intrinsic anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is driven by non-zero Berry curvature and spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking. This effect can be realized in two-dimensional moiré systems hosting flat electronic bands but is not usually seen in inversion-symmetric materials. Here, we show that this physics is manifested in helical trilayer graphene—three graphene layers, each twisted in sequence by the same angle—although the system retains global in-plane inversion symmetry. We uncover a phase diagram of correlated and magnetic states at a magic twist angle of 1.8∘, which is explained by a lattice relaxation that leads to the formation of large periodic domains where in-plane inversion symmetry is broken on the moiré scale. Each domain harbours flat topological bands with opposite Chern numbers in the two valleys. We find correlated states at multiple integer and fractional electron fillings per moiré unit cell and an AHE at a subset of them. The AHE disappears above a critical electric displacement field at one electron per unit cell, indicating a topological phase transition. We establish helical trilayer graphene as a platform that presents an opportunity to engineer topology due to its emergent moiré-scale symmetries. Trilayer graphene with the layers consecutively twisted by the same angle is shown to be a platform in which correlated and topological states exist, driven by local lattice relaxations.},

  abstract     = {Helices and spirals, prevalent across various physical systems, play a crucial role in characterizing symmetry, describing dynamics and enabling unique functionalities, all stemming from their inherent simplicity and chiral nature. Helical excitations on quantized vortices, referred to as Kelvin waves, are one example of such a physical system. Kelvin waves play a vital role in energy dissipation within inviscid quantum fluids. However, deliberately exciting Kelvin waves has proven to be challenging. Here we introduce a controlled method for exciting Kelvin waves on a quantized vortex in superfluid helium-4. We used a charged nanoparticle that oscillates when driven by a time-varying electric field to stimulate Kelvin waves on the vortex. Confirmation of the helical nature of Kelvin waves was achieved through three-dimensional image reconstruction, which provided visual evidence of their complex dynamics. Additionally, we determined the dispersion relation and the phase velocity of the Kelvin wave and identified the vorticity direction, thus enhancing our understanding of quantum fluid behaviour. This work elucidates the dynamics of Kelvin waves and initiates an approach for manipulating and observing quantized vortices in three dimensions, thereby opening avenues for exploring quantum fluidic systems. In classical hydrodynamics, Kelvin waves refer to helically vibrating normal modes. Experiments now show that quantum analogues of Kelvin waves can be excited in superfluid helium-4.},

We use a magnetically tunable Feshbach resonance to admix, in a controlled way, a specific spin state to the reacting collision complex. This allows us to control the reaction flux into the admixed spin channel, which can be used to alter the reaction products. We also investigate the influence of an Efimov resonance on the reaction dynamics, observing a global enhancement of three-body recombination without favouring particular reaction channels. Our control scheme can be extended to other reaction processes and could be combined with other methods, such as quantum interference of reaction paths, to achieve further tuning capabilities of few-body reactions. Coherent control of chemical reactions is a central theme in quantum chemistry.

  abstract     = {Flat bands in condensed matter systems can host emergent states of matter, from insulating states in twisted bilayer graphene to fractionalized excitations in frustrated magnets and quantum Hall materials. A key phenomenon in certain flat-band systems is Aharonov–Bohm caging, where particles become localized due to destructive interference caused by gauge fields. Here we report on the experimental realization of highly tunable flat-band models populated by strongly interacting Rydberg atoms. By employing synthetic dimensions, we engineer a flat-band rhombic lattice with twisted boundaries and explore the control of Aharonov–Bohm caging during non-equilibrium dynamics through a tunable gauge field. Microscopic measurements of Rydberg pairs reveal the interaction-driven breakdown of Aharonov–Bohm caging in the limit of strong dipolar interactions, where lattice bands mix. In the limit of weak interactions, where caging persists, we observe effective magnetism arising from the interaction-driven mixing of degenerate flat-band states. These observations offer insights into emergent phenomena in synthetic quantum materials and expand our understanding of quantum many-body physics in engineered lattice systems. The effect of strong interactions on the physics hosted by flat bands remains largely unexplored in atomic systems. An experiment in a synthetic flat-band lattice now demonstrates an interaction-driven transition from localization to delocalization.},

These developments now allow consideration of a series of long-standing problems in optics, including the prospect of funnelling the entire power flowing in a multimode system into its ground state, for which no methodology currently exists. Here we demonstrate an all-optical Joule–Thomson expansion process mediated by photon–photon interactions whereby the temperature of the optical gas drops abruptly to zero. Our experiments in various configurations of coupled multicore nonlinear waveguide arrangements illustrate how light undergoing expansion-induced cooling can be channelled from arbitrary input states into the fundamental mode with near-unity efficiency. We show that the stability of the post-expansion state is ensured through an irreversible process of energy conversion. The all-optical thermodynamic phenomena explored in this study may enable innovative techniques where various uncorrelated but identical sources are merged into a unified spatially coherent state, offering a route for direct beam combining. An optical thermodynamic framework can describe the complex dynamics in highly multimodal systems. Now, the observation of all-optical Joule–Thompson expansion in an optical gas further validates this thermodynamic approach.},

  abstract     = {Counterflow superfluidity is an anomalous quantum phase that was predicted two decades ago in the context of a two-component Bose–Hubbard model. In this phase, although both components exhibit fluidity, their correlated counterflow currents cancel each other out, resulting in the system behaving as an incompressible Mott insulator. However, realizing and identifying this phase experimentally has proven challenging due to the stringent requirements for a single set-up, including defect-free state preparation, minimal heating during coherent manipulations, and spin- and site-resolved detection of the phases. Here, we report on the observation of counterflow superfluidity in a binary Bose mixture in optical lattices. After preparing a low-entropy spin-Mott state by conveying two spin-1/2 bosonic atoms at every single lattice site to form a doublon, we adiabatically drove the system to the counterflow superfluid phase at approximately 1 nK. We observed features of antipair correlations through site- and spin-resolved quantum-gas microscopy in both real and momentum spaces. Finally, we measured long-range off-diagonal spin correlations in the rotated basis, revealing a correlation length approaching the system size. These techniques and observations demonstrated here provide accessibility to Borromean counterfluids. Counterflow superfluidity is a quantum phase in which two fluid components flow in opposite directions without resistance, cancelling out their overall combined motion. This phase has now been observed in an optical lattice system hosting Bose mixtures.},

Traditionally rooted in classical electrodynamics, this field now reveals quantum-mechanical features that necessitate the frameworks of quantum electrodynamics and quantum optics. This shift compels a re-evaluation of well-established areas, bringing quantum-mechanical corrections to accelerator science and to electron-radiation phenomena. Simultaneously, the ability to shape single-electron wavefunctions opens new possibilities in microscopy and spectroscopy. These developments are primarily driven by innovations in electron microscopy and its intersection with laser science, where laser-driven electron modulation substantially influences quantum electron interactions with light and matter. In this Perspective, we review these developments, highlighting the current challenges and future opportunities. We explore the role of the free electron as a quantum resource, complementing conventional two-level systems and harmonic oscillators. In the coming years, free electrons may offer new modalities for reading and writing quantum information on ultrafast timescales, performing quantum-state tomography, and ultrafast quantum gates on the atomic scale. Free-electron quantum optics is an emerging field that requires a quantum-mechanical description of both the electronic and the optical contributions.
