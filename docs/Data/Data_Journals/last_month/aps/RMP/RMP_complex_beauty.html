  abstract = {The buckling of a soft elastic sample under growth or swelling has highlighted a new interest in materials science, morphogenesis, and biology or physiology. Indeed, the change of mass or volume is a common fact of any living species, and on a scale larger than the cell size, a macroscopic view can help to explain many features of common observation. Many morphologies of soft materials result from the accumulation of elastic compressive stress due to growth and thus from the minimization of a nonlinear elastic energy. The similarity between growth and compression of a piece of rubber has revived the instability formalism of nonlinear elastic samples in compression and, in particular, Biot’s instability. Here a modern treatment of this instability is presented in the light of complex analysis, and the richness of possible profiles that an interface can present under buckling, even if one restricts oneself to the two spatial dimensions, is demonstrated. Special attention is given to wrinkles, folds, and cusps, a surprising observation in swelling gels or clays, and a new threshold for crease patterns below the traditional Biot threshold is discovered. The standard techniques of complex analysis, nonlinear bifurcation theory, and path-independent integrals are revisited to highlight the role of physical parameters at the origin of the observed patterns below and above the Biot threshold.},

  abstract = {The traditional view from particle physics is that quantum-gravity effects should become detectable only at extremely high energies and small length scales. Owing to the significant technological challenges involved, there has been limited progress in identifying experimentally detectable effects that can be accessed in the foreseeable future. However, in recent decades the size and mass of quantum systems that can be controlled in the laboratory have reached unprecedented scales, enabled by advances in ground-state cooling and quantum-control techniques. Preparations of massive systems in quantum states pave the way for the explorations of a low-energy regime in which gravity can be both sourced and probed by quantum systems. Such approaches constitute an increasingly viable alternative to accelerator-based, laser-interferometric, torsion-balance, and cosmological tests of gravity. In this review an overview of proposals where massive quantum systems act as interfaces between quantum mechanics and gravity is provided. Conceptual difficulties in the theoretical description of quantum systems in the presence of gravity are discussed, tools for modeling massive quantum systems in the laboratory are reviewed, and an overview of the current state-of-the-art experimental landscape is provided. Proposals covered in this review include precision tests of gravity, tests of gravitationally induced wave-function collapse and decoherence, and gravity-mediated entanglement. The review concludes with an outlook and summary of the key questions raised.},
