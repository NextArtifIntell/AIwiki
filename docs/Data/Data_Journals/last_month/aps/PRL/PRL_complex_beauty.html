Differential membrane contractions between cells significantly influence segregation.

The interface decay exponent is close to λ ∼ 1 / 3 , differing from previous cluster fusion and diffusion model predictions.},

Selecting an interaction potential for which a LLPT occurs in the bulk liquid, we conduct simulations of supercooled water nanodroplets having between 1000 and 80000 molecules. We show that as the droplet size decreases, the Laplace pressure grows large enough to drive the droplets through the transition from the low-density to the high-density liquid phase, and that all droplets in this size range are large enough to have cores exhibiting the structure and properties of bulk water. To guide experiments, we estimate the range of values for the critical pressure of the LLPT in real water that can be observed using nanodroplets, and propose structural and dynamical measures by which the LLPT in nanodroplets can be detected.},

In our work, we investigate the relationship between higher-order mechanisms and higher-order behavioral observables in two representative models with group interactions: a simplicial Ising model and a social contagion model. In both systems, we find that group (higher-order) interactions show emergent synergistic (higher-order) behavior. The emergent synergy appears only at the group level and depends in a complex, nonlinear way on the trade-off between the strengths of the low- and higher-order mechanisms and is invisible to low-order behavioral observables. Our work sets the basis for systematically investigating the relation between causal mechanisms and behavioral patterns in complex networked systems with group interactions, offering a robust methodological framework to tackle this challenging task.},

  abstract     = {The synergistic control of light’s frequency and orbital angular momentum (OAM) via integrated nonlinear ring microresonators is crucial for creating spatiotemporal optical waveforms and advancing optical metrology. A direct analog of this capability in acoustics is challenging due to the nonlinearity-based mechanisms’ dependence on external driving and limited frequency conversion efficiency. Here, we present an acoustic synthesized comb structure derived from spatiotemporal metasurfaces, concurrently controlling frequency and OAM characteristics with high conversion efficiency and removing the constraints of critical driving frequency and power level in nonlinear mechanisms. By optimizing comb structures, energy distributions among OAM modes are adjusted to different frequency lines. We finally propose spatiotemporal metalens devices based on vortex-frequency combs, enabling synchronously multiple-order spatial differential operations for parallel data processing. This Letter is groundbreaking in integrating spectral- and spatial-domain acoustic waves, promising multifunctional imaging and advantages in spatiotemporal beams.},

  abstract     = {Using first-principles electronic structure calculation, we demonstrate the spin dissipation process in bulk Fe by orbital excitations within the energy bands of pure spin character. The variation of orbitals in the intraband transitions provides an efficient channel to convert spin to orbital angular momentum with spin-orbit interaction. This mechanism dominates the Gilbert damping of Fe below room temperature. The theoretical prediction is confirmed by the ferromagnetic resonance experiment performed on single-crystal Fe(001) films. A significant thickness-dependent damping oscillation is found at low temperature induced by the quantum well states of the corresponding energy bands. Our findings not only explain the microscopic nature of the recently reported ultralow damping of Fe-based alloys but also help for the understanding of the transport and dissipation process of orbital currents.},

Its transition temperature is high, reaching a few percent of the Fermi temperature scale. Here, we advance a mechanism for superconductivity based on the notion that electronic topology enables quantum fluctuations in a suitable regime of intermediate correlations. In this regime, the Coulomb interaction requires that an active topological flat band and nearby wider bands are considered together. Compact molecular orbitals arise, which give rise to quantum fluctuations through topology-dictated hybridization with the other molecular orbitals. The hybridization competes with the active flat band’s natural tendency toward static electronic ordering, thereby weakening the latter; we link this effect with certain salient observations by experiments. Furthermore, the competition yields a quantum critical regime where quasiparticles are lost. The corresponding quantum critical fluctuations drive superconductivity. Broader implications and new connections among correlated materials platforms are discussed.},

  abstract     = {The recent observation of high- T c superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La 3 Ni 2 O 7 under pressure has garnered significant interest. While researches have predominantly focused on the role of electron-electron interactions in the superconducting mechanism, the impact of electron-phonon coupling (EPC) has remained elusive and unexplored. In this Letter, we perform first-principles calculations to study the phonon spectrum and electron-phonon coupling within La 3 Ni 2 O 7 under pressure and explore the interplay between EPC and electronic interactions on the superconductivity by employing functional renormalization group (FRG) approach. Our calculations reveal that EPC alone is insufficient to trigger superconductivity in La 3 Ni 2 O 7 under pressure. We identify unique out-of-plane and in-plane breathing phonon modes which selectively couple with the Ni d z 2 and d x 2 − y 2 orbitals, showcasing an orbital-selective EPC. Within the bilayer two-orbital model, it is revealed that solely electronic interactions foster s ± -wave pairing characterized by notable frustration in the band space, leading to a relatively low transition temperature. Remarkably, we find that the out-of-plane EPC can act in concert with electronic interactions to promote the interlayer pairing in the d z 2 orbital, partially releasing the pairing frustration and thus elevating T c . In contrast, the inclusion of in-plane EPC only marginally affects the superconductivity, distinct from the cuprates. Potential experimental implications in La 3 Ni 2 O 7 are also discussed.},

  abstract     = {Anisotropic pair breaking close to surfaces favors the chiral A phase of the superfluid He 3 over the time-reversal invariant B phase. Confining the superfluid He 3 into a cavity of height D of the order of the Cooper pair size characterized by the coherence length ξ 0 —ranging between 16 nm (34 bar) and 77 nm (0 bar)—extends the surface effects over the whole sample volume, thus allowing stabilization of the A phase at pressures P and temperatures T where otherwise the B phase would be stable. In this Letter, the surfaces of such a confined sample are covered with a superfluid He 4 film to create specular quasiparticle scattering boundary conditions, preventing the suppression of the superfluid order parameter. We show that the chiral A phase is the stable superfluid phase under strong confinement over the full P − T phase diagram down to a quasi-two-dimensional limit D / ξ 0 = 1 , where D = 80 nm . The planar phase, which is degenerate with the chiral A phase in the weak-coupling limit, is not observed. The gap inferred from measurements over the wide pressure range from 0.2 to 21.0 bar leads to an empirical ansatz for temperature-dependent strong-coupling effects. We discuss how these results pave the way for the realization of the fully gapped two-dimensional p x + i p y superfluid under more extreme confinement.},

  abstract     = {The standard magnetorotational instability (SMRI) with a magnetic field component parallel to the rotation axis is widely believed to be responsible for the fast accretion in astronomical disks. In conventional base flows with a Keplerian profile or an ideal Couette profile, most studies focus on axisymmetric SMRI, since excitation of nonaxisymmetric SMRI in such flows requires a magnetic Reynolds number (Rm) more than an order of magnitude larger. Here, we report that, in a magnetized Taylor-Couette flow, nonaxisymmetric SMRI with an azimuthal mode number m = 1 can be triggered by a free-shear layer in the base flow at Rm ≳ 1 , the same threshold as for axisymmetric SMRI. Global linear analysis reveals that the free-shear layer reduces the required Rm, possibly by introducing an extremum in the vorticity of the base flow. Nonlinear simulations validate the results from linear analysis and confirm that a novel instability recently discovered experimentally [Wang et al. , Nat. Commun. 13 , 4679 (2022) ] is the nonaxisymmetric m = 1 SMRI. Our finding has astronomical implications as free-shear layers are ubiquitous in celestial systems, such as the disk-star boundary layer, the solar tachocline, and the edge of planet-opened gaps in protoplanetary disks.},

The coupling between the atoms and the cavity field is induced by a transverse pump beam. Taking fluctuations around the mean-field solutions into account, we find that a transition to a self-organized phase takes place at a critical value of the pump strength. In the self-organized phase the cavity field takes a finite expectation value and the atoms show a modulation in the density. Surprisingly, at even larger pump strengths two self-organized stable solutions of the cavity field and the atoms occur, signaling the presence of a bistability. We show that the bistable behavior is induced by the atoms-cavity fluctuations and is not captured by the mean-field approach.},

Thanks to their tunable-range interactions, they are promising building blocks for quantum simulators. Here, we study the dynamics of an atom-photon bound state emerging from coupling a frequency-tunable quantum emitter—a transmon-type superconducting circuit—to the band edge of a microwave metamaterial. Employing precise temporal control over the frequency detuning of the emitter from the band edge, we examine the transition from adiabatic to nonadiabatic behavior in the formation of the bound state and its melting into the propagating modes of the metamaterial. Moreover, we experimentally observe multimode emission from the bound state, triggered by a fast change of the emitter’s frequency. Our Letter offers insight into the dynamic preparation of APBS and provides a method to characterize their photonic content, with implications in quantum optics and quantum simulation.},

  abstract     = {Rydberg dressing is a powerful tool for entanglement generation in long-lived atomic states. While already employed effectively in several demonstrations, a key challenge for this technique is the collective loss triggered by blackbody-radiation-driven transitions to contaminant Rydberg states of opposite parity. We demonstrate the rapid removal of such contaminants using autoionization (AI) transitions found in alkaline-earth-like atoms. The AI is shown to be compatible with coherent operation of an array of optical clock qubits. By incorporating AI pulses into a stroboscopic Rydberg dressing (SRD) sequence, we enhance lifetimes by an order of magnitude for system sizes of up to 144 atoms, while maintaining an order of magnitude larger duty cycle than previously achieved. To highlight the utility of our approach, we use the AI-enhanced SRD protocol to improve the degree of achieved spin-squeezing during early time dressing dynamics. These results bring Rydberg dressing lifetimes closer to fundamental limits, opening the door to previously infeasible dressing proposals.},

This also provides important constraints on the as-yet elusive all- N form of the rational part. Via Mellin transformation, we thus obtain the exact functional form in x of the respective piece of the nonsinglet Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi splitting function at four loops.

However, EPR spectroscopy using NV ensembles is less efficient due to inhomogeneities in both sensors and targets. Spectral line broadening induced by ensemble averaging is even detrimental to spectroscopy. Here we show a kind of cross-relaxation EPR spectroscopy at zero field, where the sensor is tuned by an amplitude-modulated control field to match the target. The modulation makes detection robust to the sensors inhomogeneity, while zero-field EPR is naturally robust to the targets inhomogeneity. We demonstrate an efficient EPR measurement on an ensemble of ∼ 30 000 NV centers.

In this Letter, we introduce a family of multiplayer quantum games for which topologically ordered phases of matter are a resource yielding quantum advantage. Unlike previous examples, quantum advantage persists away from the exactly solvable point and is robust to arbitrary local perturbations, irrespective of system size. We demonstrate this robustness experimentally on Quantinuum’s H1-1 quantum computer by playing the game with a continuous family of randomly deformed toric code states that can be created with constant-depth circuits leveraging midcircuit measurements and unitary feedback. We are thus able to tune through a topological phase transition—witnessed by the loss of robust quantum advantage—on currently available quantum hardware. This behavior is contrasted with an analogous family of deformed Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states, for which arbitrarily weak local perturbations destroy quantum advantage in the thermodynamic limit. Finally, we discuss a topological interpretation of the game, which leads to a natural generalization involving an arbitrary number of players.},

The trade-off for this enhanced charging power is a relative inefficiency since a large fraction of the incoming energy is lost through spontaneous emission to the environment. Nevertheless, we find that the system can store a large amount of coherence and release the stored energy coherently through spontaneous emission, again with a power scaling as N 2 .},

Results show that the classification algorithms were able to separate proteins on the basis of explosion footprints from structurally similar proteins into distinct groups. The explosion footprints, therefore, provide a unique identifier for each protein. We envision that method could be used concurrently with single-particle coherent imaging experiments to provide additional information on shape, mass, or conformation.},

  abstract     = {Phages and bacteria coexist under widely different conditions, ranging from liquid cultures to oceans, soil, and the human gut. However, our models are typically limited to well-mixed liquid cultures governed by mass-action kinetics. Here, we suggest a modification to the Lotka-Volterra dynamics by including the formation of microcolonies. By analyzing the model in an open system with a steady influx of bacteria, we predict that the colony size distribution is power-low distributed with steeper exponents for the stronger external influx. In the realistic case where the phage attack rate to individual colonies is proportional to their radius, we obtain self-organization to a steady state where the maximal colony size is smaller for stronger external driving.},

Our findings reveal that loop extrusion can enhance the dynamics of condensation and promotes coalescence and ripening of condensates. Further, the DNA loop enables condensate formation under DNA tension and position condensates. The concurrent presence of loop extrusion and condensate formation results in the formation of distinct domains similar to TADs, an outcome not achieved by either process alone.},

While in general nonuniversal, η p = 1 / 4 universally at the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, where orientational order is lost because of the unbinding of disclinations. Here, we demonstrate that, in active liquid crystals, the notion of quasi-long-ranged order fundamentally differs from its equilibrium counterpart, and the exponent η p is allowed to vary in the range 0 &lt; η p ≤ 2 , with the upper bound corresponding to the isotropic phase.

In contrast to passive polymers, our results reveal that in disordered configurations, increasing the pillar density enhances the long-time diffusion of our active polymerlike worms, while we observe the opposite trend in ordered pillar arrays. We found that in disordered media, living worms reptate through available curvilinear tubes, whereas they become trapped within pores of ordered media. Intriguingly, we show that reducing the worm’s activity significantly boosts its spread, enabling passive sorting of worms by activity level.

Geometric confinement is often used for controlling soft matter systems. However, in comparison to the case of Newtonian fluids, the effects of solid interfaces on microswimmers moving through an anisotropic fluid are far less understood. By means of nematic multiparticle collision dynamics simulations and analytical modeling, we investigate the dynamical behavior of swimmers immersed in a nematic liquid crystal and confined by solid walls. For isolated squirmers, we find a rich phase diagram including oscillatory dynamics for weak pushers, depending on the strength of their propulsion and degree of confinement. Our theoretical model shows that, unlike in the isotropic case, in a nematic fluid, force dipole, source dipole, and source quadrupole singularities all are required for the onset of oscillations. Increasing the number of squirmers shows the emergence of cooperativity in pusher-type squirmers, while pullers’ flow fields hinder each other’s motion. The interplay of nematodynamic torque, wall-induced elastic repulsion, and active flows thus offers the opportunity for both control and transport in active nematic systems.},

We apply the algorithm to an additive Lennard-Jones mixture and show that, compared to the states obtained via thermal annealing, virial homogenized glasses are characterized by a considerable increase in both kinetic stability and the number of locally favored structures, and melt during heating ramps via an accumulation of localized events.

The expectation that f should furnish a hallmark of universal behavior contrasts with its sensible dependence on nonuniversal features. We show that both nonuniversal amplitudes and universal exponents of leading power law singularities in all large deviation functions are determined by the fact that, due to extensivity, f ( m ) ∼ | m | ≫ 1 exp ( − c | m | δ + 1 ) , with δ = y H / ( d − y H ) and c a nonuniversal coefficient.

In large systems, first passage times statistics exhibit a biscaling behavior, challenging the use of a single timescale. In this work, we present a biscaling theory for the probability density function of first passage times in confined compact processes, applicable to both Euclidean and fractal domains and for diverse geometries. Our theory employs two distinct scaling functions: one for short times, capturing initial dynamics in unbounded systems, and the other for long times, which is sensitive to finite size effects. The combined framework is argued to provide a complete expression for first passage time statistics across all timescales. As our detailed calculations show, the theory describes various scenarios with and without external force fields, for active and thermal settings, and in the presence of resetting when a nonequilibrium steady state emerges.},

We report experimental results where two-photon absorption is resonant with various Rydberg states of excitons in copper oxide and we detect their emission dynamics on a streak camera with subpicosecond resolution. This technique enables the direct measurement of the Rydberg states lifetimes, which are in good agreement with the expected Rydberg scaling law. Moreover, we observe several intriguing dynamics including the presence of long-lived coherent oscillations. Finally, we independently measure the coherence time of the Rydberg states using a modified Michelson interferometer and find a good agreement with the coherent oscillations detected in the exciton emission dynamics. The lifetimes also reveal the absence of inhomogeneous broadening in the current high-precision spectroscopic data for the S series, which together with the presence of significant coherence time confirms the suitability of the system for coherent engineering.},

The avoided-crossing gap opening is small (large) when BiYIG and Py magnetizations are nearly perpendicular (partially collinear) to each other, indicating that interfacial fieldlike torque from spin pumping plays a dominant role.

The pumping of orbital and spin currents is jointly investigated in nanodevices made of naturally oxidized Cu, pure Cu, Pt, and Cr. The absence of charge conduction in BiYIG and the negligible spin-to-charge conversion of oxidized Cu allows us to disambiguate the orbital current contribution. Comparative measurements on YIG and BiYIG show that the origin of the orbital pumping in BiYIG/oxidized Cu is the dynamics of the orbital magnetization in the magnetic insulator. In Cr, the pumping signal is dominated by the negative spin Hall effect rather than the positive orbital Hall effect, indicating that orbital currents represent a minority of the total angular momentum current pumped from the magnetic insulator.

This nonequilibrium braiding topology, closely related to the breakdown of continuous time translation symmetry, is characterized by an invariant derived from Floquet operators. In sharp contrast to static lattices, the Floquet-Bloch braids can be directly manipulated using temporal engineering, enabling an arbitrary braiding degree even in a two-band lattice without long-range hopping. Experimentally, we synthesize Floquet-Bloch bands in an acoustic platform with time-modulated unidirectional couplers. We not only realize a series of Floquet-Bloch braids with distinct topologies, but also observe the transition states featuring state-coalesced Floquet exceptional points. Our findings reveal a fundamental interplay between non-Hermiticity and Floquet engineering, and pave the way for experimentally exploring the rich and uncharted territory of nonequilibrium non-Hermitian physics.},

  abstract     = {The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) has emerged as a key indicator of time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) and topological features in electronic band structures. Absent of a magnetic field, the AHE requires spontaneous TRSB but has proven hard to probe due to averaging over domains. The anomalous component of the Hall effect is thus frequently derived from extrapolating the magnetic field dependence of the Hall response. We show that discerning whether the AHE is an intrinsic property of the field-free system becomes intricate in the presence of strong magnetic fluctuations. As a study case, we use the Weyl semimetal PrAlGe, where TRSB can be toggled via a ferromagnetic transition, providing a transparent view of the AHE’s topological origin. Through a combination of thermodynamic, transport, and muon spin relaxation measurements, we contrast the behavior below the ferromagnetic transition temperature to that of strong magnetic fluctuations above. Our results on PrAlGe provide general insights into the interpretation of anomalous Hall signals in systems where TRSB is debated, such as families of kagome metals or certain transition metal dichalcogenides.},

  abstract     = {A striking example of frustration in physics is Hofstadter’s butterfly, a fractal structure that emerges from the competition between a crystal’s lattice periodicity and the magnetic length of an applied field. Current methods for predicting the topological invariants associated with Hofstadter’s butterfly are challenging or impossible to apply to a range of materials, including those that are disordered or lack a bulk spectral gap. Here, we demonstrate a framework for predicting a material’s local Chern markers using its position-space description and validate it against experimental observations of quantum transport in artificial graphene in a semiconductor heterostructure, inherently accounting for fabrication disorder strong enough to close the bulk spectral gap. By resolving local changes in the system’s topology, we reveal the topological origins of antidot-localized states that appear in artificial graphene in the presence of a magnetic field. Moreover, we show the breadth of this framework by simulating how Hofstadter’s butterfly emerges from an initially unpatterned 2D electron gas as the system’s potential strength is increased and predict that artificial graphene becomes a topological insulator at the critical magnetic field. Overall, we anticipate that a position-space approach to determine a material’s Chern invariant without requiring prior knowledge of its occupied states or bulk spectral gaps will enable a broad array of fundamental inquiries and provide a novel route to material discovery, especially in metallic, aperiodic, and disordered systems.},

Here we consider the energy spectra of approximate matrix product ground states, such as those obtained with the density matrix renormalization group. Despite the high accuracy of these states, contributions to the spectra are roughly constant out to surprisingly high energy, with an increase in the bond dimension reducing the amplitude but not the extent of these high-energy tails. The unusual spectra appear to be a general feature of compressed wavefunctions, independent of boundary or dimensionality, and are also observed in neural network wavefunctions. The unusual spectra can have a strong effect on sampling-based methods, yielding large fluctuations. The energy variance, which can be used to extrapolate observables to eliminate truncation error, is subject to these large fluctuations when sampled. Nevertheless, we devise a sampling-based variance approach which gives excellent and efficient extrapolations.},

Their constituents are fermionic charge carriers resonantly coupled to long-lived bosonic interlayer excitons, allowing them to form trion bound states. Such platforms promise to achieve comparable densities of fermions and bosons at low relative temperatures. Here, we predict the transport properties of correlated Bose–Fermi mixtures close to a narrow solid-state Feshbach resonance. When driving a hole current, the responses of doped holes, excitons, and trions are significantly modified by the resonant interactions, leading to deviations from the typical Drude behavior and to a sign change of the exciton drag. Our results on the temperature-dependent resistivities demonstrate that near resonance interaction effects dominate over established conventional scattering mechanisms in these solid-state Bose–Fermi mixtures.},

Hitherto unknown negative transit time due to in-plane scattering is discovered in monolayers of graphene, h-BN, and oxygen. Moreover, Wigner time delay is found to diverge at the scattering resonances caused by the emergence of secondary diffracted beams. This offers a way to manipulate the propagation timing of the wave packet without sacrificing the transmitted intensity. The spatial reshaping of the wave packet at the resonances may help elucidate details of the streaking by an inhomogeneous field at the surface.},

Such physics is attributed to the vanishing kinetic energy and strong spatial localization of the flat-band states. Here, we use numerical simulations to examine the electronic transport properties of such flat bands in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene in the presence of disorder. We find that while a conventional downscaling of the mean free path with increasing disorder strength occurs at higher energies, in the flat bands the mean free path can actually increase with increasing disorder strength. This phenomenon is also captured by the disorder-dependent quantum metric, which is directly linked to the ground state localization. This disorder-induced delocalization suggests that weak disorder may have a strong impact on the exotic physics of magic-angle bilayer graphene and other related moiré systems.},

In far-from-equilibrium situations, such as atomic collision cascades, these rearrangements may not necessarily follow a thermodynamically gainful path, but may be kinetically limited. In this Letter, we focus on such crystallization instead of amorphization in collision cascades in gallium oxide ( ). We determine the disorder threshold for irreversible polymorph transition and explained why it results in elevating energy to that of the polymorph, which exhibits the highest polymorph energy in the system below the amorphous state. Specifically, we demonstrate that upon reaching the disorder transition threshold, the Ga sublattice kinetically favors transitioning to the -like configuration, requiring significantly less migration for Ga atoms to reach the lattice sites during postcascade processes. As such, our data provide a consistent explanation of this remarkable phenomenon and can serve as a toolbox for predictive multipolymorph fabrication.},

  abstract     = {The coherent interaction between free electrons and optical fields can produce free-electron compression and push the temporal resolution of ultrafast electron microscopy to the attosecond regime. However, a large electron-light interaction is required to attain a strong compression, generally necessitating short light and electron pulses combined with optical scattering at nanostructures. Here, we theoretically investigate an alternative configuration based on stimulated Compton scattering, whereby two counterpropagating Gaussian light beams induce energy jumps in a collinear electron beam by multiples of their photon-energy difference. Strong recoil effects are produced by extending the electron-light interaction over millimetric distances, enabling a dramatic increase in temporal compression and substantially reshaping the electron spectra for affordable laser powers. Beyond its fundamental interest, our Letter introduces a practical scheme to achieve a large temporal compression of continuous electron beams without involving optical scattering by material structures.},

  abstract     = {Localization phenomena during transport are typically associated with disordered scalar potentials. Here, we predict a universal pseudospin localization phenomenon driven by a disordered vectorial potential and experimentally observe its onset in an optical analog of a classical disordered spin-glass magnetic phase. In our system, disorder in the second-order nonlinear coupling of a nonlinear photonic crystal causes the idler-signal light beam, representing the pseudospin current, to approach localization in the transverse plane. This effect depends strongly on the nonlinear coupling strength, controlled by the optical pump power, revealing its inherently nonlinear nature. Furthermore, this phenomenon is marked by decaying Rabi oscillations between the idler and signal fields, linked to the disorder properties, suggesting an accompanied longitudinal decoherence effect. Our findings offer new insights into spin transport in disordered magnetic textures and open avenues for exploring complex magnetic phases and phase transitions using nonlinear optics.},

  abstract     = {The nonlinear interaction of a microresonator pumped by a laser has revealed complex dynamics, including soliton formation and chaos. Initial studies of coupled-resonator systems reveal even more complicated dynamics that can lead to deterministic mode locking and efficient comb generation. Here, we perform theoretical analysis and experiments that provide insight into the dynamical behavior of coupled-resonator systems operating in the normal group-velocity-dispersion regime. Our stability analysis and simulations reveal that the strong mode-coupling regime, which gives rise to spectrally broad comb states, can lead to an instability mechanism in the auxiliary resonator that destabilizes the comb state and prevents mode locking. We find that this instability can be suppressed by introducing loss in the auxiliary resonator. We investigate the stability of both single- and multipulse solutions and verify our theoretical predictions by performing experiments in a silicon-nitride platform. Our results provide an understanding for accessing broad, efficient, relatively flat high-power mode-locked combs for numerous applications in spectroscopy, time-frequency metrology, and data communications.},

  abstract     = {Long-range interactions are a key resource in many quantum phenomena and technologies. Free-space photons mediate power-law interactions but lack tunability and suffer from decoherence processes due to their omnidirectional emission. Engineered dielectrics can yield tunable and coherent interactions, but typically at the expense of making them both shorter ranged and sensitive to material disorder and photon loss. Here, we propose a platform that can circumvent all these limitations based on three-dimensional subwavelength atomic arrays subjected to magnetic fields. Our key result is to show how to design the polaritonic bands of these atomic metamaterials to feature a pair of frequency-isolated Weyl points, i.e., points in reciprocal space around which the bands disperse linearly and defining monopoles of the Berry curvature. As predicted by recent works, such Weyl excitations can mediate interactions that are simultaneously long range, due to their gapless nature; robust, due to the topological protection of Weyl points; and decoherence-free, due to their subradiant character. We demonstrate the robustness of these isolated Weyl points for a large regime of interatomic distances and magnetic field values and characterize the emergence of their corresponding Fermi arcs surface states. The latter can lead to two-dimensional, nonreciprocal atomic interactions with no analogue in other chiral quantum optical setups.},

For the single quantum dipole case, we identify the correct form of the local spectral density, revealing a surprising gauge-dependent ∼ ω ± 1 prefactor scaling, as well as a spatially dependent correction.

While a plethora of ground states are known to have topological underpinning, it is still quite unclear if and how topology manifests itself in the relaxation dynamics of strongly correlated many-body systems. In this Letter, we study time evolution of interacting bosons in a finite one-dimensional superlattice and uncover surprising emergent topological phenomena in the long-time stationary states. Beginning with simple product states, the system evolves into stationary states with high energy whose string correlation and entanglement are investigated. Based on extensive numerical simulations and effective-model analysis, it is demonstrated that the stationary states are nonthermal for a wide range of parameters, and they exhibit certain features that are characteristic of the symmetry-protected topological ground state of the Hamiltonian. In contrast, no topological feature is found in the stationary state as long as the system thermalizes. This difference is further corroborated by the distinct behavior of quantum entanglement and edge states of the system. Our theoretical prediction can be examined by current experimental techniques and paves the way for a more comprehensive understanding of topological phases in nonequilibrium settings.},

  abstract     = {The two-loop self-energy correction to the bound-electron g factor in hydrogenlike ions is investigated, taking into account the electron-nucleus interaction exactly. This all-order calculation is required to improve the total theoretical uncertainty of the g factor, which is limited by the fact that two-loop self-energy corrections have only been calculated so far in the form of an expansion in Z α . Here, Z is the nuclear charge number and α is the fine-structure constant. In this work, we report calculations of the last missing parts of the total two-loop self-energy correction, exactly in Z α . We apply our theory to the recently measured g factor of the hydrogenlike Sn 118 49 + ion [J. Morgner et al. , Nature (London) 622 , 53 (2023) ] and, with a factor of 8, improve the accuracy of its state-of-the-art theoretical value by almost one order of magnitude, enabling more detailed tests of quantum electrodynamics and new physics in strong fields.},

  abstract     = {We report on the first global analysis of transverse-momentum dependent helicity distributions of the proton. The analysis is performed at next-to-leading order with the evolution factor at next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy. Nonzero signals are determined for up and down quarks, and their k T -integrated polarization is consistent with analyses in collinear factorization, while the distributions of other flavors are loosely constrained by existing data. With increasing transverse momentum, quarks at large x become less polarized while those at small x become more polarized.},

  abstract     = {By analyzing experimental data on semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering off longitudinally polarized targets, we extract the transverse momentum dependence of the quark helicity distribution, i.e., the difference between the three-dimensional motion of quarks with polarization parallel or antiparallel to the longitudinal polarization of the parent hadron. We perform the analysis at next-to-leading and next-to-next-to-leading perturbative accuracy. The quality of the fit is very good for both cases, reaching a χ 2 per number of data points equal to 1.11 and 1.09, respectively. Although the limited number of data points leads to significant uncertainties, the data are consistent with an interpretation in which the helicity distribution is narrower in transverse momentum than the unpolarized distribution.},

  abstract     = {Neutrino-nucleus elastic scattering ( ) with partial quantum-mechanical coherency has been observed in several nuclei with neutrinos from decay-at-rest pions. This interaction with reactor neutrinos where coherency is has not yet been experimentally observed. We present new results on the studies of the cross section with an electrocooled -type point-contact germanium detector at the Kuo-Sheng Reactor Neutrino Laboratory. A total of 242(357) kg-days of Reactor ON(OFF) data at a detector threshold of 200 eV in ionization energy are analyzed. The Lindhard model parametrized by a single variable which characterizes the quenching function was used. A limit at 90% confidence level of at the predicted value of is derived, where is the ratio of the measured to standard model (SM) cross section. Conversely, at the SM value of .},

  abstract     = {A search is performed for dark matter particles produced in association with a resonantly produced pair of b -quarks with 30 &lt; m b b &lt; 150 GeV using 140 fb − 1 of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. This signature is expected in extensions of the standard model predicting the production of dark matter particles, in particular those containing a dark Higgs boson s that decays into b b ¯ . The highly boosted s → b b ¯ topology is reconstructed using jet reclustering and a new identification algorithm. This search places stringent constraints across regions of the dark Higgs model parameter space that satisfy the observed relic density, excluding dark Higgs bosons with masses between 30 and 150 GeV in benchmark scenarios with Z ′ mediator masses up to 4.8 TeV at 95% confidence level.},

Even less is known about the relevant boundary deformations that connect them. A natural approach to the problem is via conformal perturbation theory, which, however, becomes quickly intractable. Using the formalism of open string field theory, we construct the corresponding classical solution, from which we can easily extract the boundary theory data. As a simple illustration we calculate the boundary degeneracy g to next-to-leading order for a generic theory.},

Utilizing the covariant phase space formalism, we identify the relevant degrees of freedom that localize to the -dimensional bifurcate horizon and, upon canonical quantization, determine their commutators. On this phase space, we find two Iyer-Wald charges. The first of these charges, proportional to the area of the causal diamond, is responsible for shifting the null time along the horizon and has been well documented in the literature. The second charge is much less understood, being integrable for only if we allow for field-dependent diffeomorphisms and is responsible for changing the size of the causal diamond.},

  abstract     = {Compact objects observed in gravitational-wave astronomy so far always come in pairs and never individually. Identifying the two components of a binary system is a delicate operation that is often taken for granted. The labeling procedure (i.e., which is object “1” and which is object “2”) effectively acts as systematics, or, equivalently, an unspecified prior, in gravitational-wave data inference. The common approach is to label the objects solely by their masses, on a sample-by-sample basis. We show that object identification can instead be tackled using the posterior distribution as a whole. We frame the problem in terms of constrained clustering—a flavor of semisupervised machine learning—and find that unfolding the labeling systematics can significantly impact, and arguably improve, our interpretation of the data. In particular, the precision of black-hole spin measurements improves by up to 50%, multimodalities and tails tend to disappear, posteriors become closer to Gaussian distributions, and the identification of the nature of the object (i.e., black hole vs neutron star) is facilitated. We estimate that about 10% of the LIGO/Virgo posterior samples are affected by this relabeling, i.e., they might have been attributed to the other compact object in the observed binaries.},

  abstract     = {Recent nonmagnetized studies of binary neutron star mergers have indicated the possibility of identifying equation-of-state features, such as a phase transition or a quark-hadron crossover, based on the frequency shift of the main peak in the postmerger gravitational wave spectrum. By performing a series of general relativistic, magnetohydrodynamic simulations we show that similar frequency shifts can be obtained due to the effect of the magnetic field. The existing degeneracy can either mask or nullify a shift due to a specific equation-of-state feature, and therefore the interpretation of observational data is more complicated than previously thought, requiring a more complete treatment that would necessarily include the neutron star’s magnetic field.},

  abstract     = {A dedicated search for upward-going air showers at zenith angles exceeding 110° and energies has been performed using the Fluorescence Detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The search is motivated by two “anomalous” radio pulses observed by the ANITA flights I and III that appear inconsistent with the standard model of particle physics. Using simulations of both regular cosmic-ray showers and upward-going events, a selection procedure has been defined to separate potential upward-going candidate events and the corresponding exposure has been calculated in the energy range [0.1–33] EeV. One event has been found in the search period between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2018, consistent with an expected background of events from misreconstructed cosmic-ray showers. This translates to an upper bound on the integral flux of and for an and spectrum, respectively. An upward-going flux of showers normalized to the ANITA observations is shown to predict over 34 events for an spectrum and over 8.1 events for a conservative spectrum, in strong disagreement with the interpretation of the anomalous events as upward-going showers.},

  abstract     = {We show that dark matter direct detection experiments are sensitive to the existence of particles with a small effective charge (for instance, via couplings to a kinetically mixed, low-mass dark photon).

Rather, these experiments are sensitive to the irreducible abundance produced in the early Universe through the freeze-in mechanism. We find that ongoing and proposed direct detection experiments will have world-leading sensitivity to effective charges Q ∼ 10 − 12 across 9 orders of magnitude in mass, corresponding to a dark matter subfraction as low as ∼ 10 − 3 .},

We demonstrate that the nontrivial dynamics of metastables in the plasma alters the impact of the new physics particles on the neutrino population, including the effective number of neutrino degrees of freedom, N eff , modifies neutrino spectral distortions, and may induce asymmetries in neutrino and antineutrino energy distributions. These modifications have important implications for observables such as big bang nucleosynthesis and the cosmic microwave background, especially in light of upcoming cosmic microwave background observations aiming to reach percent-level precision on N eff .

Traditional methods to prepare these states often rely on adiabatic evolution, which may diminish the quantum sensing advantage. In this Letter, we propose a quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) enhanced critical sensing protocol for quantum many-body systems with exotic phase diagrams. Starting from product states and utilizing QRL-discovered gate sequences, we explore sensing accuracy in the presence of unknown external magnetic fields, covering both local and global regimes. Our results demonstrate that QRL-learned sequences reach the finite quantum speed limit and generalize effectively across systems of arbitrary size, ensuring accuracy regardless of preparation time. This method can robustly achieve Heisenberg and super-Heisenberg limits, even in noisy environments with practical Pauli measurements. Our study highlights the efficacy of QRL in enabling precise quantum state preparation, thereby advancing scalable, high-accuracy quantum critical sensing.},

CPDD does not use short pulses, making it particularly suitable for experiments with limited driving power or nuclear magnetic resonance at high magnetic fields. It requires control of the timing of the phase changes, offering much greater precision than the Rabi frequency control needed in standard continuous sensing schemes. We successfully apply our method to nanoscale nuclear magnetic resonance and combine it with quantum heterodyne detection, achieving microhertz uncertainty in the estimated signal frequency for a 120 s measurement.

One of the dominant errors limiting the performance of quantum error correction codes across multiple technology platforms is leakage out of the computational subspace arising from the multilevel structure of qubit implementations. Here, we present a resource-efficient universal leakage reduction unit for superconducting qubits using parametric flux modulation. This operation removes leakage down to our measurement inaccuracy of in approximately 50 ns with a low error of on the computational subspace, thereby reaching durations and fidelities comparable to those of single-qubit gates. We demonstrate that using the leakage reduction unit in repeated weight-two stabilizer measurements reduces the total number of detected errors in a scalable fashion to close to what can be achieved using leakage-rejection methods that do not scale. Our approach does not require additional control electronics or on-chip components and is applicable to both auxiliary and data qubits. These benefits make our method particularly attractive for mitigating leakage in large-scale quantum error correction circuits, a crucial requirement for the practical implementation of fault-tolerant quantum computation.},

Past work has experimentally observed entanglement phase transitions on near-term quantum computers, but the characterization approach using entanglement entropy is not scalable due to exponential overhead of quantum state tomography and postselection. Recently, an alternative protocol to detect entanglement phase transitions using linear cross entropy was proposed, attempting to eliminate both bottlenecks. Here, we report demonstrations of this protocol in systems with one-dimensional and all-to-all connectivities on IBM’s quantum hardware on up to 22 qubits, a regime which is presently inaccessible if postselection is required. We demonstrate data collapses onto scaling functions with critical exponents in semiquantitative agreement with theory. Our demonstration of the cross entropy benchmark (XEB) protocol paves the way for studies of measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions and associated critical phenomena on larger near-term quantum systems.},

This Letter introduces a machine learning model with dual capabilities: it can deduce time-dependent Hamiltonian parameters from observed changes in local observables within quantum many-body systems, and it can predict the evolution of these observables based on Hamiltonian parameters. Our model’s validity was confirmed through theoretical simulations across various scenarios and further validated by two experiments. Initially, the model was applied to a nuclear magnetic resonance quantum computer, where it accurately predicted the dynamics of local observables. The model was then tested on a superconducting quantum computer with initially unknown Hamiltonian parameters, successfully inferring them.

  abstract     = {The emergence of classical behavior in quantum theory is often ascribed to the interaction of a quantum system with its environment, which can be interpreted as environmental monitoring of the system. As a result, off-diagonal elements of the density matrix of the system are damped in the basis of a preferred observable, often taken to be the position, leading to the phenomenon of decoherence. This effect can be modeled dynamically in terms of a Lindblad equation driven by the position operator. Here the question of decoherence resulting from a monitoring of position and momentum, i.e., a phase-space measurement, by the environment is addressed. There is no standard quantum observable corresponding to the detection of phase-space points, which is forbidden by Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. This issue is addressed by use of a coherent-state-based positive operator-valued measure for modeling phase-space monitoring by the environment. In this scheme, decoherence in phase space implies the diagonalization of the density matrix in both position and momentum representations. This is shown to be linked to a Lindblad equation where position and momentum appear as two independent Lindblad operators.},

In simulations of the buckling of the epithelium under compression and numerical solutions of the corresponding continuum model, we discover an “unbuckling” bifurcation: at large compression, the buckling amplitude can decrease with increasing compression. By asymptotic solution of the continuum equations, we reveal that this bifurcation comes with a large stiffening of the epithelium. Our results thus provide the mechanical basis for absorption of compressive stresses by tissue folds such as the cephalic furrow during germband extension in Drosophila .},

These characteristics highlight the importance of designing processes to reproducibly direct the structure evolution of complex, spatially modulated structures. Using general symmetry considerations, we design a process that deterministically transforms the common, double-gyroid (DG) phase of linear diblock copolymers into a metastable A15 structure by irreversibly switching a conformationally symmetric A B B ′ diblock copolymer into an A B A ′ triblock copolymer. Key to the fabrication of the Frank-Kasper A15 structure is the nonmonotonic time evolution of the segregation that allows us to partition the large unit cell of the DG phase into 8 equivalent A15 units. Comparison between dynamic self-consistent field theory and particle-based simulations demonstrates the robustness of the designed pathway against thermal fluctuations and memory effects due to the underlying Rouse dynamics. Metastable structures that can be accessed from the DG phase are systematically explored as a function of molecular asymmetry and incompatibility.},

At ultralow ionic strength and packing fractions, we reveal both experimentally and numerically a direct transition from a nematic to a crystalline smectic-B phase, previously identified as a glass state. This transition, bypassing the smectic-A intermediate phase, results from minimizing Coulomb repulsion and maximizing entropic gains due to fluctuations in the crystalline structure. This demonstrates how long-range electrostatic repulsion significantly alters the phase behavior of rod-shaped particles and highlights its key role in driving the self-organization of anisotropic particles.},

  abstract     = {Systems with nonreciprocal interactions generically display time-dependent states. These are routinely observed in finite systems, from neuroscience to active matter, in which globally ordered oscillations exist. However, the stability of these uniform nonreciprocal phases in noisy spatially-extended systems, their fate in the thermodynamic limit, and the critical behavior of the corresponding phase transitions are not fully understood. Here, we address these questions by introducing a nonreciprocal generalization of the Ising model and study its phase transitions by means of numerical and analytical approaches. While the mean-field equations predict three stable homogeneous phases (disordered, ordered, and a time-dependent swap phase), our large scale numerical simulations reveal a more complex picture. Static order is destroyed in any finite dimension due to the growth of rare droplets unless the symmetry between the two spin types is broken, triggering a stabilizing droplet-capture mechanism. The swap phase is destroyed by fluctuations in two dimensions through the proliferation of spiral defects but stabilized in three dimensions, where nonreciprocity changes the critical exponents from Ising to XY, thus giving rise to a robust spatially-distributed clock.},

The backbone exponent captures the leading asymptotic, while the other roots of the elementary equation capture the asymptotic of the remaining terms. This suggests that the backbone exponent is part of a conformal field theory (CFT) whose bulk spectrum contains this set of roots.

Using inelastic neutron scattering, we discover quasi-one-dimensional magnetic excitations in CeSb 2 emerging from nearly square Ce layers with minor orthorhombic deformation. We show that the data are well described by a ferromagnetic spin ladder model, where the “rungs” of the ladder straddle Ce bilayers. Moreover, we find that diffuse excitations akin to those in the ordered phase persist well above T N , suggesting that quasi-one-dimensional ferromagnetic paramagnons may significantly contribute to the unusual superconductivity that appears under pressure once magnetic order is suppressed.},

However, fully compensated ferrimagnetism, which exhibits band spin splitting but zero net magnetization, has yet to receive enough attention. Since the experimental preparation of two-dimensional (2D) magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials in 2017, 2D magnetic materials, thanks to their super tunability, have quickly become an important playground for spintronics. Here, we extend the concept of fully compensated ferrimagnetism (fFIM) to two dimensions and propose 2D filling-enforced fFIM, demonstrate its stability and ease of manipulation, and present three feasible realization schemes with respective exemplary candidate materials. A simple model for 2D fully compensated ferrimagnets (fFIMs) is developed. Further investigation of 2D fFIMs’ physical properties reveals that they not only exhibit significant magneto-optical response but also show fully spin-polarized currents and the anomalous Hall effect in the half-metallic states, displaying characteristics previously almost exclusive to ferromagnetic materials, greatly broadening the research and application prospects of spintronic materials.},

Combined with the confined electrons and distinct lattice dynamics of two-dimensional (2D) materials, exploring UMA, especially its temperature dependence in 2D ferromagnets, is significant. Here, we report an unprecedented exotic behavior of temperature dependence of UMA in the 2D van der Waals ferromagnet . Below 20 K, the temperature-dependent UMA constant exhibits a canonical Akulov-Zener-Callen-Callen-type with rapidly decreasing trend. Strikingly, above 20 K, it transitions to an anomalous Carr-type one with rapidly increasing trend. Temperature-dependent x-ray diffraction measurements combined with first-principles calculations reveal that the enhanced ferromagnetic exchange coupling caused by the lattice variation preserves the two-ion anisotropy at high temperature. Therein, both the itinerant nature and lattice thermal expansion are altered, thus triggering such exotic . Our findings not only deepen the basic understanding of the temperature dependence of UMA but also favor optimizing the ultra-high-density heat-assisted magnetic recording technology by considering the cooperation between lattice and ferromagnetic exchange coupling.},

Here, we show that the merging of two areas, namely the altermagnetism and the physics of curvilinear low-dimensional magnets gives rise to a distinct novel physical effect: a curvature-induced magnetization in bend altermagnetic films. This effect opens a promising possibility for imaging of the domain structure in the magnetically compensated structures. We consider a thin film of a -wave altermagnet bent in a stretching-free manner and demonstrate that gradients of the film curvature induce a local magnetization that is approximately tangential to the film. The magnetization amplitude directly reflects the altermagnetic symmetry and depends on the direction of bending. It is maximal for the bending along directions of the maximal altermagnetic splitting of the magnon bands. A periodically bent film of sinusoidal shape possesses a total magnetic moment per period , where and are the bending amplitude and wave vector, respectively. The total magnetic moment is perpendicular to the plane of the unbent film and its direction (up or down) is determined by the bending direction. A film roll-up to a nanotube possesses a toroidal moment directed along the tube per one coil, where and are the coil radius and the pitch between coils. All these analytical predictions agree with numerical spin-lattice simulations.},

This mode emerges from the hybridization of the homogeneous Dirac point mode and in-gap topological corner modes. Remarkably, this hybridized mode possesses unique chirality related to the chiral symmetry. We experimentally observe such hybridized mode in a two-dimensional (2D) photonic system and demonstrate its robustness by introducing disorders in the structure. Our findings advance the frontier of higher-order topology research, transitioning it from single-lattice systems to hybridized multilattice systems.

We first show the existence of topological zero modes in this system by solving the interacting model with tensor networks, and demonstrate their robustness against disorder. To unveil the origin of the topological zero modes, we analyze the associated periodic Anderson model showing that it can be mapped to a topological non-Hermitian model, enabling rationalizing the origin of the topological zero modes.

Over the past two decades, substantial advancements have been achieved in Landau levels in systems with linear band crossing points, like Weyl points, which exhibit fascinating features like chiral zero modes. The Landau levels observed thus far are independent of the magnetic field’s orientation. In this Letter, we experimentally demonstrate unconventional oriented Landau levels in acoustic Berry dipole systems, wherein by reversing the orientation of the pseudomagnetic field, the system exhibits distinct Landau spectra. Remarkably, we observe a new type of helical zero mode, whose existence critically depends on the magnetic field’s orientation. This is in sharp contrast to the well-studied chiral zero modes in Weyl systems, whose propagation direction, but not existence, depends on the applied magnetic field’s orientation. Our Letter opens up avenues for understanding the interaction of gauge fields with band singularities that go beyond Chern class, including Berry multipoles and even-dimensional monopoles, and offers new insights for exploring topological devices.},

The engineered inhomogeneous hopping strengths not only introduce pseudomagnetic fields that quantize the nodal lines into LLs but also provide three bosonic degrees of freedom, embedding a generic SU(3) symmetry into the LLs. Using a phased array of acoustic sources, we selectively excite distinct eigenstates within the degenerate LL multiplets and visualize their 3D eigenmodes. Importantly, our approach enables the precise reconstruction of SU(3) quantum numbers directly from eigenmode correlations. Our results establish SU(3) LLs as a tractable model in artificial platforms, and pave the way for synthesizing LLs with zero dispersion and countable quantum numbers in arbitrary dimensions.},

  abstract     = {The tunability of Dirac semimetals with antiferromagnetic Mn layers is of great interest. The observed sign change of interlayer magnetic coupling between CaMnBi 2 and SrMnBi 2 suggests ionic substitution as a potential tuning mechanism. If so, novel behavior near the compensation point could be expected. To explore this, we study a mixed-cation analog, Ca 0.6 Sr 0.4 MnSb 2 , where Bi is replaced by Sb. Conventional inelastic neutron scattering is impractical due to the small crystal size ( m ≈ 0.28 g ) available for compositional studies; however, we find that using a neutron diffractometer with a wide-angle area detector we can obtain a good quality spin-wave signal, which is shaped by energy-momentum conservation and retains spectroscopic information even without direct energy analysis. Spin-wave modeling reveals an interlayer coupling quantitatively similar to SrMnSb 2 , indicating it is not directly tuned by ionic size and that the sign change in Bi-based compounds likely arises from the observed change in lattice symmetry. Beyond this key insight, our results present an efficient method for parametric and compositional studies of spin dynamics in small crystals.},

Here we show that the infinite-dimensional limit of a quantum lattice model, as described by dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT), provides a natural framework to understand this self-consistent thermalization process. Using the Fermi-Hubbard model as a working example, we demonstrate that the emergence of a self-consistent bath occurs via a sharp thermalization front, moving ballistically and separating the initial condition from the long time thermal fixed point. We characterize the full DMFT dynamics through an effective temperature for which we derive a traveling wave equation of the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov type. This equation allows for predicting the asymptotic shape of the front and its velocity, which match perfectly the full DMFT numerics. Our results provide a new angle to understand the onset of quantum thermalization in closed isolated systems.},

  abstract     = {The two-dimensional Hubbard model is widely believed to capture key ingredients of high- T c superconductivity in cuprate materials. However, compelling evidence remains elusive. In particular, various magnetic orders may emerge as strong competitors of superconducting orders. Here, we study the ground state properties of the doped two-dimensional t − t ′ Hubbard model on a square lattice via the infinite projected entangled-pair state method with U(1) or SU(2) spin symmetry. The former is compatible with antiferromagnetic orders, while the latter forbids them. Therefore, we obtain by comparison a detailed understanding of the magnetic impact on superconductivity. Moreover, an additional t ′ term accommodates the particle-hole asymmetry, which facilitates studies on the discrepancies between electron- and hole-doped systems. We demonstrate that (i) a positive t ′ / t significantly amplifies the strength of superconducting orders; (ii) at sufficiently large doping levels, the t − t ′ Hubbard model favors a uniform state with superconducting orders instead of stripe states with charge and spin modulations; and (iii) the enhancement of magnetic frustration, by increasing either the strength of next-nearest neighbor interactions or the charge doping, impairs stripe orders and helps stabilize superconductivity.},

Herein, we revisit the concept of QGT by further taking into account the spin degree of freedom. Besides the conventional QGT relating to momentum translation, we uncover a new QGT (termed Zeeman QGT) relating to momentum translation as well as spin rotation, whose imaginary (real) part gives the Zeeman Berry curvature (quantum metric). Notably, we show that these novel quantum geometric quantities can drive an intrinsic gyrotropic magnetic current (IGMC) in spin-orbit coupled materials when the electron spin is steered by an oscillating magnetic field. With symmetry analysis, we show that a wide range of materials can support the IGMC, as illustrated by model calculations.

Despite the close proximity (a few electron inertial lengths) of the four MMS spacecraft, they recorded different electron-only reconnection signatures, including differences in the magnitude and profile of the electron jet, parallel electric fields, and dissipation , indicating extremely short-scale spatial and temporal variability. Furthermore, the leading spacecraft did not detect reconnection signatures, suggesting that MMS may have witnessed the onset of electron-only reconnection. Hall magnetic field perturbations associated with an electron-scale current sheet were detected after the onset.

In this Letter, we observe both linear and nonlinear localization of light at the edges of radially cropped quasicrystal waveguide arrays, forming an aperiodic Penrose tiling. Our theoretical analysis reveals that for certain truncation radii, the system exhibits linear eigenstates localized at the edge of the truncated array, whereas for other radii, this localization does not occur, highlighting the significant influence of truncation on edge light localization. Using single-waveguide excitations, we experimentally confirm the presence of localized states in Penrose arrays inscribed by a femtosecond laser and investigate the effects of nonlinearity on these states. Our theoretical findings identify a family of edge solitons, and experimentally, we observe a transition from linear localized states to edge solitons as the power of the input pulse increases.

Chiral metasurfaces are typically created by manipulating the geometry of nanostructures, such as three-dimensional helical structures and slanted structures. However, these approaches are generally challenging to implement experimentally in optical frequency ranges. Here, we present the achievement of significant chirality on planar lithium niobate metasurfaces. We theoretically demonstrate that the birefringence of lithium niobate enables a strong coupling between two nearly degenerate resonant modes when rotating the optical axis. Despite the achiral geometric morphology of the lithium niobate structure, we show that these mixed modes exhibit chirality and can produce nearly full circular dichroism signals. Moreover, we experimentally validate our theoretical proposal using our advanced process technique for lithium niobate nanostructures and the measured circular dichroism signal reaches .

  abstract     = {Quantum state-resolved spectroscopy of the low energy thorium-229 nuclear transition was recently achieved. The five allowed transitions within the electric quadrupole structure were measured to the kilohertz level in a calcium fluoride host crystal, opening many new areas of research using nuclear clocks. Central to the performance of solid-state clock operation is an understanding of systematic shifts such as the temperature dependence of the clock transitions. In this work, we measure the four strongest transitions of thorium-229 in the same crystal at three temperature values: 150 K, 229 K, and 293 K. We find shifts of the unsplit frequency and the electric quadrupole splittings, corresponding to decreases in the electron density, electric field gradient, and field gradient asymmetry at the nucleus as temperature increases. The line shifts only 62(6) kHz over the temperature range, i.e., approximately , representing a promising candidate for a future solid-state optical clock. Achieving precision requires crystal temperature stability of .},

Here, we show that, in addition to this drag force, moving nanostructures with an anisotropic optical response experience a lateral force and a torque that substantially modify their trajectory. These phenomena emerge from the additional coupling between the electromagnetic field components polarized parallel and perpendicular to the trajectory, enabled by the anisotropic response of the nanostructure.

  abstract     = {The non-Bloch topology leads to the emergence of various counterintuitive phenomena in non-Hermitian systems under the open boundary condition, which can not find a counterpart in Hermitian systems. However, in the non-Hermitian system without chiral symmetry, being ubiquitous in nature, exploring its non-Bloch topology has so far eluded experimental effort. Here, by introducing the concept of nonchiral non-Bloch invariants, we theoretically predict and experimentally identify the non-Bloch topological phase diagram of a one-dimensional (1D) non-Hermitian system without chiral symmetry in discrete-time nonunitary quantum walks of single photons. Interestingly, we find that such topological invariants not only can distinguish topologically distinct gapped phases, but they also faithfully capture the corresponding gap closing in open-boundary spectrum at the phase boundary. Different topological regions are experimentally identified by measuring the featured discontinuities of the higher moments of the walker’s displacement, which amazingly match excellently with our defined non-Bloch invariants. Our work provides a useful platform to study the interplay among topology, symmetries, and the non-Hermiticity.},

Here we show how to move beyond the possibilities of simple geometric tailoring, demonstrating how a metallic sphere placed within a ring of parallel dipoles engineers an effective Hamiltonian that generates “guide-sliding” states within the ring system. This allows steady-state superabsorption in noisy room temperature environments, outperforming previous designs while being significantly simpler to implement. As exemplified by this showcase, our approach represents a powerful design paradigm for tailoring cooperative light-matter effects in molecular structures that extends beyond superabsorbing systems to a huge array of quantum energy transport systems.},

Based on symmetries and dynamical classification, we characterize and chart out various dynamical phases in a phase diagram. A key feature of this system is the multistability of different dynamical states, particularly the coexistence of various superradiant phases as well as limit cycles. Remarkably, this dimer system manifests self-trapping phenomena, resulting in a photon population imbalance between the cavities. Such a self-trapped state arises from a saddle-node bifurcation, which can be understood from an equivalent Landau-Ginzburg description. Additionally, we identify a unique class of oscillatory dynamics, “ self-trapped limit cycle, ” hosting self-trapping of photons. The absence of stable dynamical phases leads to the onset of chaos, which is diagnosed using the saturation value of the decorrelator dynamics. Moreover, the self-trapped states can coexist with chaotic attractor, which may have intriguing consequences in quantum dynamics. Finally, we discuss the experimental relevance of our findings, which can be tested in cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics setups.},

The absorbed momentum from the light fields can induce spin-orbit coupling and associated motional-induced (Doppler) dephasing, which may limit the coherence time available for metrology and simulation. We experimentally demonstrate the suppression of Doppler dephasing on a strontium optical clock transition by enabling atomic interactions through a shared mode in a high-finesse optical ring cavity. The interactions create a many-body energy gap that increases with atom number, suppressing motional dephasing when it surpasses the dephasing energy scale. This collective approach offers an alternative to traditional methods, like Lamb-Dicke confinement or Mössbauer spectroscopy, for advancing optical quantum sensors and simulations.},

We observe that specific initial states remain nonthermal at weak driving despite the majority of states thermalizing, which constitutes clear evidence of quantum many-body scars (QMBSs). As the driving strength increases, the experimental system undergoes a smooth transition from integrable to weakly ergodicity breaking, which supports QMBSs, and then to fully thermal. This is in agreement with the theoretical spectra, which predict towers of states dissolving with increasing driving strength.

Because the same resonances or other nuclear structure responsible for the neutron-capture cross section are reflected in the total cross section, we used these data to extract the former from the latter as a function of energy. Our data reveal a resonance at 0.171 eV and result in a thermal neutron-capture cross section of , in good agreement with the recently published value.

Under acceleration, the system resides in global thermal equilibrium. Our results indicate that even the weakest acceleration up to drastically softens the deconfinement phase transition, converting the first-order phase transition of a static system to a soft crossover for accelerating gluons. The accelerating environment can be relevant to the first moments of the early Universe and the initial glasma regime of relativistic heavy ion collisions.

  abstract     = {Nuclear medium effects on B + meson production are studied using the binary-collision scaled cross section ratio between events of different charged-particle multiplicities from proton-lead collisions. Data, collected by the CMS experiment in 2016 at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of s NN = 8.16 TeV , corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 175 nb − 1 , were used. The scaling factors in the ratio are determined using a novel approach based on the Z → μ − μ + cross sections measured in the same events. The scaled ratio for B + is consistent with unity for all event multiplicities, putting stringent constraints on nuclear modification for heavy flavor.},

  abstract     = {Recently, it was discovered that the proton structure at high energies exhibits maximal entanglement. This leads to a simple relation between the proton’s parton distributions and the entropy of hadrons produced in high-energy inelastic interactions, which has been experimentally confirmed. In this Letter, we extend this approach to the production of jets. Here, the maximal entanglement predicts a relation between the jet fragmentation function and the entropy of hadrons produced in jet fragmentation. We test this relation using the ATLAS Collaboration data on jet production at the Large Hadron Collider, and find a good agreement between the prediction based on maximal entanglement within the jet and the data. This study represents the first use of a quantum entanglement framework in an experimental study of the hadronization process, offering a new perspective on the transition from perturbative to nonperturbative QCD. Our results open the door to a more comprehensive understanding of the quantum nature of hadronization.},

Using lattice quantum chromodynamics, we postdict the defining parameters for two short-lived resonances, the and , which manifest as complex energy poles in and scattering amplitudes, respectively. The calculation proceeds by first computing the finite-volume energy spectrum of the two-hadron systems and then determining the amplitudes from the energies using the Lüscher formalism. The error budget includes a data-driven systematic error, obtained by scanning possible fit ranges and fit models to extract the spectrum from Euclidean correlators, as well as the scattering amplitudes from the latter. The final results, obtained by analytically continuing multiple parametrizations into the complex energy plane, are , and , where the subscript indicates the resonance and and stand for the mass and width, respectively, and where the first bracket indicates the statistical and the second bracket the systematic uncertainty.},

When gauged, it serves as the leading portal between the two sectors, providing an elegant, self-consistent scenario of light thermal inelastic dark matter. The inherent antisymmetrization leads to diminished annihilations at later times and suppressed direct detection. However, novel collider signatures offer tremendous prospects for discovery at Belle II.},

  abstract     = {Invisible axion models that solve the strong problem via the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) mechanism typically have a quality problem that arises from quantum gravity effects which violate all global symmetries. These models therefore require extreme fine-tuning of parameters for consistency. We present a new solution to the quality problem in a unified gauge model, where is an anomaly free axial gauge symmetry. PQ symmetry emerges as an accidental symmetry in this setup, which admits a PQ breaking scale as large as , allowing for the axion to be the cosmological dark matter. We call this a hybrid axion model due to its unique feature that it interpolates between the popular KSVZ and DFSZ axion models. Its predictions for the experimentally measurable axion couplings to the nucleon and electron are distinct from those of the usual models, a feature that can be used to test it. Furthermore, the model has no domain wall problem and it provides a realistic and predictive framework for fermion masses and mixings.},

Using a lowered energy threshold compared to the previous weakly interacting massive particle search, a blind analysis of [0.5, 5.0] keV nuclear recoil events reveals no significant signal excess over the background. XENONnT excludes spin-independent DM-nucleon cross sections at 90% confidence level for DM. In the considered mass range, the DM sensitivity approaches the “neutrino fog,” the limitation where neutrinos produce a signal that is indistinguishable from that of light DM-xenon nucleus scattering.},

  abstract     = {Light bosons, beyond the standard model and as prominent candidates for dark matter, can mediate velocity and spin dependent exotic interaction between electron spins and nucleons. At short ranges, it remains an open challenge to test this exotic interaction with high precision. Here, we present a method based on a diamagnetic-levitated force sensor to detect the exotic interaction at the millimeter scale. Improved constraints for the coupling g A e g V N are established, within the force range spanning from 0.15 to 1.5 mm. The constraint | g A e g V N | ≤ 4.39 × 10 − 26 at λ = 0.5 mm at the 95% confidence level significantly surpasses previous results by more than 3 orders of magnitude. The diamagnetic levitation force measurement system developed here can also be repurposed to probe other exotic spin dependent interactions, such as the exotic spin-spin interaction. This system provides a platform for the exploration of dark matter.},

  abstract     = {Efficiently estimating the quantum Fisher information (QFI) is pivotal in quantum information science but remains an outstanding challenge for large systems due to its high nonlinearity. In this Letter, we tackle this long-standing challenge by integrating the Krylov subspace method–a celebrated tool from applied mathematics–into the framework of shadow tomography. The integrated technique, dubbed Krylov shadow tomography, enables us to formulate a strict hierarchy of nonpolynomial lower bounds on the QFI, among which the highest one matches the QFI exactly. We show that all the bounds can be expressed as expected values of the inverses of Hankel matrices, which are accessible via shadow tomography. Our Krylov shadow tomography therefore opens up a resource-efficient and experimentally feasible avenue to estimate not only nonpolynomial lower bounds but also the QFI itself.},

  abstract     = {A quantum limit on the measurement of magnetic fields has been recently pointed out, stating that the so-called energy resolution E R is bounded to E R ≳ ℏ . This limit indeed holds true for the vast majority of existing quantum magnetometers, including superconducting quantum interference devices and solid state spin and optically pumped atomic magnetometers. However, it can be surpassed by highly correlated spin systems, as recently demonstrated with a single-domain spinor BEC. Here, we show that similar and potentially much better resolution can be achieved with a hard ferromagnet levitated above a superconductor at cryogenic temperature. We demonstrate E R = ( 0.064 ± 0.010 ) ℏ and anticipate that E R &lt; 10 − 3 ℏ is within reach with near-future improvements. This finding opens the way to new applications in condensed matter, biophysics, and fundamental science. In particular, we propose an experiment to search for axionlike dark matter and project a sensitivity that is orders of magnitude better than in previous searches.},

Under uniform lighting conditions, E. gracilis exhibits stochastic movements with nearly straight runs interrupted by abrupt directional changes. The lengths of these runs follow a long-tailed distribution typical of a Lévy walk, with scaling exponents that vary with light intensity. In gradient lighting conditions, the cells modulate their run durations—extending them upon detecting an increase in light intensity and shortening them when a decrease is detected. This adjustment effectively biases the Lévy walk, enabling the cells to ascend the spatial light gradient. This behavior mirrors well-known prokaryotic stochastic navigation strategies, such as bacterial chemotaxis, offering a eukaryotic parallel. The experimental observations under varied lighting conditions are consistently replicated through an agent-based model.},

These defects can be decomposed into squares, triangles, and an additional tile: a rhombus. In this Letter, we explore how rhombus tiles change the entropy of square-triangle 12-fold quasicrystals. We introduce a novel lattice-based Monte Carlo simulation method that uses open boundaries to allow the concentration of different tile types to fluctuate. Our simulations show that rhombus tiles significantly increase the configurational entropy of the quasicrystal phase, enhancing its stability.

In this Letter, we report the design and experiment of a self-injection locked micromechanical frequency comb that is further intrinsically immune to phase offset. We show that by tuning the pump frequency of a pair of nonlinearly coupled flexural and torsional oscillations, self-injection locking could be achieved via aligning the comb teeth from neighboring harmonic clusters, leading to decade-wide cascading of hundreds of equidistant teeth. Inside the injection locking region, the stability of the comb spacing and the phase noise are significantly improved. Moreover, the phase offset in the temporal signal also disappears because all comb lines are locked as integer multiples of the comb spacing and the first tooth is locked to the d.c. frequency due to the comb origination from harmonics. The observation of self-injection locking and zero phase offset in mechanical frequency combs greatly promotes their value for precision applications.},

We explain how values of phase-locked currents are related to soliton velocities and why collective particle dynamics synchronize with the driving for certain particle diameters only. Our analysis is based on an effective potential for the solitary wave propagation and a unit displacement law, which states that the total average shift of all particle positions per soliton period equals one wavelength of the periodic potential.},

In this Letter, we derive a rigorous quantification of the Mpemba effect based on thermomajorization theory, referred to as the thermomajorization Mpemba effect. This approach resolves all existing ambiguities and provides a unification of the conventional Mpemba effect across all monotone measures. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generality of the thermomajorization Mpemba effect for Markovian dynamics, rigorously proving that it can occur in any temperature regime with fixed energy levels.},

The emergence of altermagnets, which unify the advantages of ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, offers unprecedented opportunities for magnetoelectric coupling. However, electrically tuning altermagnets remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we demonstrate how this challenge can be overcome by using antiferroelectricity and ferroelectricity to modulate the spin splitting in altermagnets, employing a universal, symmetry-based design principle supported by an effective model. We introduce an unexplored class of multiferroics: antiferroelectric altermagnets (AFEAM), where antiferroelectricity and altermagnetism coexist in a single material. From first-principles calculations, we validate the feasibility of AFEAM in well-established van der Waals metal thio(seleno)phosphates and perovskite oxides. We reveal the design of AFEAM ranging from two-dimensional monolayers to three-dimensional bulk structures. Remarkably, even a weak electric field can effectively toggle spin polarization in the AFEAM by switching between antiferroelectric and ferroelectric states. Our findings not only enrich the understanding of magnetoelectric coupling but also pave the way for electrically controlled spintronic and multiferroic devices.},

However, the experimental observation of such quadrupolar excitations is often challenging due to the dipolar selection rules of many linear response probes, rendering them invisible. Here we show that nonlinear spectroscopy, in the form of two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS), can be used to reveal quadrupolar excitations. Considering a family of spin-1 Heisenberg ferromagnets with single-ion easy-axis anisotropy as an example, we explicitly calculate their 2DCS signature by combining exact diagonalization and generalized spin wave theory. We further demonstrate that 2DCS can provide access to the quadrupolar weight of an excitation, analogous to how linear response provides access to the dipolar weight. Our work highlights the potential of nonlinear spectroscopy as a powerful tool to diagnose multipolar excitations in quantum magnets.},

  abstract     = {We theoretically investigate nonequilibrium spin fluctuations in a ferromagnet induced by a light pulse. Using a Lindblad equation consistent with the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, we compute the autocorrelation function of magnetization. Our analysis reveals that this function comprises both thermal and nonequilibrium components. To examine the latter in detail, we introduce a Fano factor similar to nonequilibrium current noise in electronic circuits. We demonstrate that this factor encapsulates insights into the transfer of spin units to the environment. Our findings lay the groundwork for nonequilibrium spin noise spectroscopy, offering valuable insights into spin relaxation dynamics.},

Here we present low-temperature measurements of specific heat for another KSL candidate (NCTO) under field rotation within the honeycomb plane. Above the critical field of antiferromagnetic order, the field-angle dependence of exhibits minima along the bond directions, contrasting with the maxima observed in the KSL state of . Our analysis indicates nodeless, fully gapped excitations, which are inconsistent with the angle-dependent Majorana excitations with gapless nodes predicted by the Kitaev model.

However, there is currently a lack of reports on the nontrivial physics of topological degeneracy in twisted systems. In this Letter, we investigated the intrinsic physical correlation between twisting and topological degeneracy. We found that twisting not only breaks the symmetry of the system but also introduces topological degeneracy that does not exist under the original symmetric system without twisting. Furthermore, the topological degeneracy can be easily tuned through twisting. This new twist-induced topological degeneracy gives rise to a unique polarization-degenerate birefringent medium, wherein the twist angle acts as a novel degree of freedom for dispersion and polarization management of interface states. Exhibiting fascinating properties and experimental feasibilities, our Letter points to new possibilities in the research of various topological physics in twisted photonics.},

Despite a large number of candidates identified in the family of materials, an understanding of their physics from competing microscopic energy scales is still missing. We bridge this gap by reporting the first resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) measurement on a well-known series of Ru cluster magnets with a -perovskite structure ( ) comprised of Ru dimers. In addition to providing a microscopic explanation for their anomalous magnetic properties, our RIXS measurements combined with theoretical modeling uncover a new regime of molecular orbital physics where the combined effect of large hopping and small spin-orbit coupling results in highly fragile electronic states in the Ru-dimer compounds directly manifested as an abrupt change in the RIXS spectrum accompanying a tiny change in the local structure tuned by the -site ion. This unique combination of energy scales found only in the but not the cluster magnets highlights the value of these materials as a new platform for studying quantum phase transition involving molecular orbitals.},

Utilizing a parton mean-field theory describing the transition between a conventional heavy Fermi liquid and a U(1) fractionalized Fermi liquid, we find a novel intermediate phase near the transition whose emergent flux pattern spontaneously breaks both translation and time-reversal symmetries. This phase is an orbital antiferromagnet, and we derive a Landau-type theory which shows that such a phase generically emerges from a -flux spin liquid.

  abstract     = {The rise of moiré materials has led to experimental realizations of integer and fractional Chern insulators in small or vanishing magnetic fields. At the same time, a set of minimal conditions sufficient to guarantee an Abelian fractional state in a flat band were identified, namely, “ideal” or “vortexable” quantum geometry. Such vortexable bands share essential features with the lowest Landau level (LL), while excluding the need for more fine-tuned aspects such as flat Berry curvature. A natural and important generalization is to ask if such conditions can be extended to capture the quantum geometry of higher Landau levels, particularly the first LL (1LL), where non-Abelian states at ν = 1 / 2 , 2 / 5 are known to be competitive. The possibility of realizing these states at zero magnetic field, and perhaps even more exotic ones, could become a reality if we could identify the essential structure of the 1LL in Chern bands. In this work, we introduce a precise definition of 1LL quantum geometry, along with a figure of merit that measures how closely a given band approaches the 1LL. Periodically strained Bernal graphene is shown to realize such a 1LL structure even in zero magnetic field.},

In the quantum-critical region, the dynamical staggered-spin susceptibility exhibits ω / T scaling. We propose a scaling ansatz that describes this behavior and reveals Planckian dissipation for the longest-lived excitations. The current susceptibility follows the same scaling, leading to strange-metal behavior for the optical conductivity and resistivity. Importantly, this behavior is driven by strong short-ranged vertex contributions, not single-particle decay. This suggests that the KB QCP described by 2CDMFT is a novel intrinsic (i.e., disorder-free) strange-metal fixed point.

However, a direct measurement of the metric has remained elusive. In linear response functions such as electric conductivity, only the matrix elements of the metric appear convoluted with energy prefactors, but to this date no direct observable has been identified that is directly proportional to the integrated metric over the Brillouin zone. In this Letter, we propose relaxation from constrained equilibrium to directly measure the symmetric part of the quantum geometric tensor. This response implements the integral over frequencies appearing in the Souza-Wilkens-Martin sum rule by choosing the electric field appropriately. Our work shines light on other geometric properties of insulators that are absent in the frequency expansions of conductivity in insulators but can, in principle, be revealed in step response.},

Among the MGGAs, the strongly constrained and appropriately normed approximation (SCAN) greatly improves upon GGAs from the lower rung. But the over magnetized solutions of SCAN make GGAs more reliable for magnetism. Here, we provide a solution that satisfies the most pressing desiderata for a density functional approximations for ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic and noncollinear states.

Our theoretical analysis reveals that the OMR originates from the coupling of out-of-plane components of Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment with the applied magnetic field, signaling intrinsic time-reversal symmetry breaking in the system. This time-reversal symmetry breaking persists at room temperature within the CGT and bilayer graphene heterostructure despite the bulk CGT exhibiting ferromagnetic transition at 65 K.

Through numerical simulation by carefully investigating both the thermodynamic and hydrodynamic parameters of several liquids, this 3D-orbiting mode is attributed to the subtle interplay between the interfacial flow due to the thermal Marangoni effect and the bulk flow from the thermal buoyancy effect. Moreover, by developing a unified physical model to elucidate the effect of liquid properties on the motion modes, a phase diagram is constructed through a single dimensionless number ( Σ = R e S c / M a ), providing a theoretical guidance to tailor the periodic oscillation modes. These findings not only reveal the underlying intriguing physicochemical hydrodynamics, but also possibly shed light on the bubble-mediated technologies.},

  abstract     = {The dynamics of drop impact on a rigid surface strongly depends on the droplet’s velocity, its size, and its material properties. The main characteristics are the droplet’s force exerted on the surface and its maximal spreading radius. The crucial question is how do they depend on the (dimensionless) control parameters, which are the Weber number W e (nondimensionalized kinetic energy) and the Ohnesorge number O h (dimensionless viscosity). Here, we perform direct numerical simulations over the huge parameter range 1 ≤ W e ≤ 10 3 and 10 − 3 ≤ O h ≤ 10 2 and in particular develop a unifying theoretical approach, which is inspired by the Grossmann-Lohse theory for wall-bounded turbulence [Grossmann and Lohse, J. Fluid Mech. 407 , 27 (2000) ; Phys. Rev. Lett. 86 , 3316 (2001) ]. The key idea is to split the energy dissipation rate into the different phases of the impact process, in which different physical mechanisms dominate. The theory can consistently and quantitatively account for the W e and O h dependences of the maximal impact force and the maximal spreading diameter over the huge parameter space. It also clarifies why viscous dissipation plays a significant role during impact, even for low-viscosity droplets (low O h ), in contrast to what had been assumed in some prior theories.},

  abstract     = {Interfacial energy dissipation during stick-slip motion of a liquid drop on a nonconductive polymer substrate is shown to lead to an irreversible increase in electrical charge. This previously unobserved phenomenon occurs during surface wetting, in contrast to the previously reported charge separation mechanism that occurs during dewetting. Understanding this electrification mechanism will facilitate the design of energy harvesters and aid the development of risk mitigation strategies for electrostatic buildup in liquid flow across a wide range of industrial applications.},

In the supercritical domain, direct measurements of the heat flux 𝑄 as a function of the temperature difference Δ ⁢ 𝑇 are consistent with the usual scaling laws of single-phase turbulent convection. Along the liquid-vapor coexistence curve, heat fluxes are dramatically enhanced by condensation and boiling. Optical measurements are performed to document the size and velocity of the bubbles. We report 𝑄 ⁡ ( Δ ⁢ 𝑇 , 𝜀 ) in both domains, with 𝜀 the dimensionless distance to the critical point. Critical scaling laws are observed that can guide the development of theoretical models. In addition, this documents a system of diverging heat transfer coefficient, i.e., in which a significant heat flux can be achieved with an arbitrarily small temperature difference as 𝜀 → 0 .},

  abstract     = {Self-phase modulation is ubiquitous in optical systems: It provides foundational functionality to numerous photonic technologies, such as soliton generation and ultrafast pulse compression. However, it remains challenging to directly modify the coefficient of self-phase modulation, which is typically regarded as a fixed property of optical materials and structures. In this work, we overcome this limitation and demonstrate reconfigurable self-phase modulation with an integrated photonic cavity. This is achieved by introducing the engineered backaction from the reservoir photonic resonance through the cascaded second-order nonlinear coupling. The coefficient of self-phase modulation is tuned from to of its intrinsic value. With negative coefficients, we observe the anomalous self-phase modulation, where photonic resonances are shifted towards higher frequencies. With the reconfigurable self-phase modulation, we further demonstrate the control of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in the integrated photonic ring cavity.},

  abstract     = {Bound states in the continuum and exceptional points are unique singularities of non-Hermitian systems. In optical implementations, the former demonstrate strong enhancement of the electromagnetic field, while the latter exhibit high sensitivity to small perturbations. Hence, exceptional points are being actively investigated as next-generation optical sensors. However, at the nanoscale, their performance is strongly constrained by parasitic radiative losses. Here, we show that several bound states in the continuum can be merged into one exceptional point, forming a new kind of singularity. The resulting state inherits properties from both, namely, it does not radiate and shows extremely high sensitivity to perturbations, making it prospective for the realization of exceptional sensing at the nanoscale. We validate our theory with numerical simulations and demonstrate the formation of second- and third-order exceptional bound states in the continuum in stacked dielectric metasurfaces.},

While nonlocal metasurfaces with strong chiral responses to the incident light have been reported, these responses are typically limited to a narrow range of incident angles. In this study, we demonstrate a nonlocal metasurface that showcases strong chirality, characterized by circular dichroism ( ), over a wide range of incident angles . Its quality factor, circular dichroism and resonant frequency can be optimized by design. These findings pave the way to further advance the development of valley-selective optical cavities and augmented reality applications.},

  abstract     = {We predict a near-threshold (“zero energy”) peak in multiphoton ionization for a dynamical regime where the photon frequency is large compared to the binding energy of the electron. The peak position does not depend on the laser frequency but on the binding energy and the pulse duration. The effect originates from the fact that bound-continuum dipole transitions are stronger than continuum-continuum ones. To clearly observe this zero-energy photoelectric effect, the spectral width of the laser pulse should be comparable to the binding energy of the ionized orbital, and the second ionization potential should be larger than the photon energy. This suggests negative ions as ideal candidates for corresponding experiments.},

The CAD branching ratio relative to the total Auger emission of Xe 2 + 4 d − 2 states is estimated to be 2 × 10 − 2 ± 1 × 10 − 2 , surpassing the branching ratios of previously reported CAD paths by a factor of 10 or more. This amplified CAD in Xe 2 + 4 d − 2 states is primarily attributable to their near-degeneracy with intermediate configurations required to promote CAD in second-order perturbation theory. Such near degeneracy is characteristic of all double inner-shell vacancy states in medium and heavy elements, suggesting that CAD paths play a more pivotal role in the relaxation of core-excited matter than is currently understood.},

A resonant structure of spin-parity 0 + is observed in the D 0 K S 0 invariant-mass spectrum with a significance of 5.3 σ . The mass and width of the state, modeled with a Breit-Wigner line shape, are determined to be 2883 ± 11 ± 8 MeV / c 2 and 87 − 47 + 22 ± 17 MeV , respectively, where the first uncertainties are statistical and the second systematic. These properties and the quark content are consistent with those of the open-charm tetraquark candidate T c s 0 * ( 2870 ) 0 observed previously in the D + K − final state of the B − → D − D + K − decay. This result confirms the existence of the T c s 0 * ( 2870 ) 0 state in a new decay mode.

  abstract     = {A study of and decays to ( ) is performed using collision data collected by the LHCb experiment during LHC Runs 1–2, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of . The branching fractions for these decays are measured using the decay as a control channel. The decays and are observed for the first time. For decay modes with sufficient signal yields, asymmetries are measured in the full and localized regions of the final-state phase space. Evidence is found for violation in the decay, interpreted as originating primarily from an asymmetric decay amplitude. The measured asymmetries for other decays are compatible with zero.},

  abstract     = {The asymmetry and branching fraction of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa-suppressed decay are precisely measured relative to the favored decay using a sample of proton-proton collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of recorded at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV during 2016–2018. The results of the asymmetry difference and branching fraction ratio are , where the first uncertainties are statistical and the second are systematic. A combination with previous LHCb results based on data collected at 7 and 8 TeV in 2011 and 2012 yields and . The combined value deviates from zero by 3.2 standard deviations, providing the first evidence for direct violation in the amplitudes of beauty decays to charmonium final states.},

Perturbations break Weyl flatness of the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker metric, allowing conformally coupled fields—in particular, fermions studied here—to be produced even when their mass is negligible. Particle production can be computed by studying the Bogoliubov transformation induced by the stochastic background. For perturbations generated during inflation, we present a closed formula for the resulting abundance of particles that depends solely on the power spectrum of curvature perturbations at the end of inflation. This production mechanism can be dominant especially if the amplitude of curvature perturbations is enhanced for modes that exit the horizon toward the end of inflation. In the simplest scenario, the critical dark matter abundance is reproduced for .},

The method uses the baryon-to-photon ratio determined by the primordial deuterium abundance, together with big bang nucleosynthesis calculations and the present-day cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature, to determine the physical baryon density . The baryon fraction is measured using the relative amplitude of the baryonic signature in galaxy clustering measured by the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, scaling the physical baryon density to the physical matter density. The physical density is then compared with the geometrical density from Alcock-Paczynski measurements from baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and voids to give . Including type Ia supernovae and uncalibrated BAO, we measure . We find similar results when varying analysis choices, such as measuring the baryon signature from the reconstructed correlation function or excluding supernovae or voids. This measurement is currently consistent with both the distance-ladder and CMB determinations, but near-future large-scale structure surveys will obtain to tighter constraints.},

The readout is typically benchmarked by integrating the readout signal and choosing a binary threshold to extract the “readout fidelity.” We show that readout fidelity may significantly overlook readout-induced leakage errors. Such errors are detrimental for applications that rely on continuously repeated measurements, e.g., quantum error correction. We introduce a method to measure the readout-induced leakage rate by repeatedly executing a composite operation—a readout preceded by a randomized qubit flip. We apply this technique to characterize the readout of a superconducting qubit, optimized for fidelity across four different readout durations. Our technique highlights the importance of an independent leakage characterization by showing that the leakage rates vary from 0.12% to 7.76% across these readouts even though the fidelity exceeds 99.5% in all four cases.},

There is an inherent trade-off between the minimal required time and the set error probability for the convergent class.

In apparent contradiction to Arrhenius’ law, our findings reveal that the denaturation time of RNA hairpins is a nonmonotonous function of temperature for molecules longer than few persistence lengths, with an optimal temperature above the melting point, T m , at which denaturation occurs fastest. This anomaly arises from the existence of two distinct pathways: “unidirectional” unzipping, progressing from one end to the other and favored near T m , and “bidirectional” denaturation, where competing unzipping events initiate from both ends at higher temperatures. The two regimes manifest distinct scaling laws for the melting time vs length, L , and are separated by a crossover temperature T × , with ( T × − T m ) ∼ L − 1 . The results highlight the significant role of the helical structure in the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of RNA and DNA denaturation and unveil multiple surprises in a decades-old problem.},

Consequently, their behavior under confinement is complex, especially in soft confined media, leading to diverse emergent morphologies. Through computer simulations, we investigate the dynamical interplay between active Brownian particles and a binary mixture. Our results show that active particles stabilize nonequilibrium morphologies, arresting coarsening by exerting active pressure that competes with surface tension. For moderate activities, particles stabilize an active emulsion with a well-defined droplet size. At higher activities, when particles can cross the liquid domains, a dynamic emulsion with large droplet dispersion is sustained. Furthermore, active particles drive phase-separated mixtures away from equilibrium configurations, demonstrating a rich coassembly behavior due to competing energy scales in the system.},

  abstract     = {Recent experiments reveal increasing detail about the so-called slow Arrhenius process (SAP), which leads to molecular relaxation in glassy systems. The SAP operates over a temperature range that spans melt and glassy states and acts alongside the familiar α -relaxation. In this Letter, we propose a mechanistic picture for SAP relaxation wherein local amorphous packing is reshaped by molecular movements that are small in comparison to those in the α -modes. Our approach, the collective small displacements (CSD) model, captures a number of experimentally observed SAP characteristics, including its connection to rheology and shear flow. Using a statistical mechanics-based equation of state to obtain nonbonded segmental interaction energies, the CSD model predicts the SAP’s activation energies a priori , based solely on thermodynamic analysis of material properties. The other parameters are all shown to be reasonably material-independent, which means that the model is able to predict SAP relaxation rates and SAP-driven equilibration rates (e.g., adsorption) without using any data on the SAP at all.},

In ductile materials the omnipresent plasticity close to the crack tip influences the growth by history effects, which we here study in polymethylmetacrylate by various fatigue and creep protocols. We show how the crack tip local history may be encompassed in a time- and protocol-dependent length scale, which allows us to apply a statistical fracture description to the time-dependent crack growth rate, resolving the well-known paradox why fatigue cracks grow faster if the stress during a cycle is let to relax more from the peak value.

  abstract     = {Solute gradients next to an interface drive a diffusioosmotic flow, the origin of which lies in the intermolecular interactions between the solute and the interface. These flows on the surface of colloids introduce an effective slip velocity, driving their diffusiophoretic migration. In confined environments, the interplay between diffusiophoresis and diffusioosmosis governs the motion of colloids. Previous studies have indeed demonstrated the quantitative modulation of phoretic migration by the osmotic flows. Here, we show that diffusioosmotic flows can lead to qualitatively distinct outcomes, reversing the direction of colloidal focusing expected from diffusiophoresis alone. Using microfluidic experiments in a T-junction, numerical simulations, and theoretical modeling, we explain our observations to be due to an interplay between diffusiophoretic migration of colloids toward the walls and their entrainment in a diffusioosmotic vortex. We show this focusing to be persistent for a range of salt types, salt gradients, and flow rates, and establish a criterion for its emergence. Our work sheds light on how boundaries modulate the solute-mediated transport of colloids in confined environments and how the colloidal trajectories can be utilized to infer the surface properties.},

This relaxation, however, is agnostic to odd transport phenomena, in which fluxes run orthogonal to the gradients driving them. To account for odd transport, we generalize the regression hypothesis, postulating that macroscopic linear constitutive laws are, on average, obeyed by microscopic fluctuations, whether they contribute to relaxation or not. From this “flux hypothesis,” Green-Kubo and reciprocal relations follow, elucidating the separate roles of broken time-reversal and parity symmetries underlying various odd transport coefficients. As an application, we derive and verify the Green-Kubo relation for odd collective diffusion in chiral active matter, first in an analytically tractable model and subsequently through molecular dynamics simulations of concentrated active spinners.},

Here, by combining extensive numerical simulations of classical and quantum integrable isotropic spin chains with a framework developed by exact studies of the KPZ class, we characterize various two-point quantities that remain hitherto unexplored in spin chains, and find full agreement with KPZ scaling laws without adjustable parameters. This establishes the partial emergence of the KPZ class in integrable isotropic spin chains. Moreover, we reveal that the KPZ scaling laws are intact in the presence of an energy current, under the appropriate Galilean boost required by the propagation of spacetime correlation.},

  abstract     = {Continuous phase transitions where symmetry is spontaneously broken are ubiquitous in physics and often found between “Landau-compatible” phases where residual symmetries of one phase are a subset of the other. However, continuous “deconfined quantum critical” transitions between Landau-incompatible symmetry-breaking phases are known to exist in certain quantum systems, often with anomalous microscopic symmetries. In this Letter, we investigate the need for such special conditions. We show that Landau-incompatible transitions can be found in a family of well-known classical statistical mechanical models with anomaly-free symmetries, introduced by José et al. [ Phys. Rev. B 16 , 1217 (1977) .]. The models are anisotropic deformations of the classical 2D XY model labeled by a positive integer Q . For a range of temperatures, even Q models exhibit two Landau-incompatible partial symmetry-breaking phases and a direct transition between them for Q ≥ 4 . Characteristic features of deconfined quantum criticality, such as enhanced symmetries and melting of charged defects, are easily seen in a classical setting. For odd Q and corresponding temperature ranges, two regions of a single partial symmetry-breaking phase appear, split by a stable “unnecessary critical” line. We discuss experimental systems that realize these transitions and present anomaly-free quantum models that also exhibit similar phase diagrams.},

  abstract     = {The observation of negative-temperature states in the localized phase of the discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation has challenged statistical mechanics for a long time. For isolated systems, they can emerge as stationary extended states through a large-deviation mechanism occurring for finite sizes, while they are formally unstable in grand canonical setups, being associated to an unlimited growth of the condensed fraction. Here, we show that negative-temperature states in open setups are metastable and their lifetime is exponentially long with the temperature, (for ). A general expression for is obtained in the case of a simplified stochastic model of noninteracting particles. In the discrete nonlinear Schrödinger model, the presence of an adiabatic invariant makes even larger because of the resulting freezing of the breather dynamics. This mechanism, based on the existence of two conservation laws, provides a new perspective over the statistical description of condensation processes.},

  abstract     = {Using equilibrium fluctuations to understand the response of a physical system to an externally imposed perturbation is the basis for linear response theory, which is widely used to interpret experiments and shed light on microscopic dynamics. For nonequilibrium systems, perturbations cannot be interpreted simply by monitoring fluctuations in a conjugate observable and general response results rely on path ensemble averaging. These techniques do not apply to perturbations that affect the diffusion tensor in a stochastic system. Here, we introduce an “effective” physical process that represents the diffusion perturbed dynamics and enables accurate calculations of responses to a change in the diffusion. Interestingly, the effective dynamics contain an additional drift involving the instantaneous “score” of the system, and we leverage score matching algorithms to carry out nonequilibrium response calculations on systems for which the exact stationary distribution is unknown.},

  abstract     = {The lifetime of superconducting qubits is limited by dielectric loss, and a major source of dielectric loss is the native oxide present at the surface of the superconducting metal. Specifically, tantalum-based superconducting qubits have been demonstrated with record lifetimes, but a major source of loss is the presence of two-level systems in the surface tantalum oxide. Here, we demonstrate a strategy for avoiding oxide formation by encapsulating the tantalum with noble metals that do not form native oxide. By depositing a few nanometers of Au or AuPd alloy before breaking vacuum, we completely suppress tantalum oxide formation. Microwave loss measurements of superconducting resonators reveal that the noble metal is proximitized, with a superconducting gap over 80% of the bare tantalum at thicknesses where the oxide is fully suppressed. Our findings suggest that losses in resonators fabricated by subtractive etching are dominated by oxides on the sidewalls, pointing to total surface encapsulation by additive fabrication as a promising strategy for eliminating surface oxide two-level system loss in superconducting qubits.},

  abstract     = {The electronic spectra of altermagnets are a fertile ground for nontrivial topology due to the unique interplay between time-reversal and crystalline symmetries. This is reflected in the unconventional Zeeman splitting between bands of opposite spins, which emerges in the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and displays nodes along high-symmetry directions. Here, we argue that even for a small SOC, the direction of the magnetic moments in the altermagnetic state has a profound impact on the electronic spectrum, enabling novel topological phenomena to appear. By investigating microscopic models for two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) altermagnets, motivated in part by rutile materials, we demonstrate the emergence of hitherto unexplored Dirac crossings between bands of the same spin but opposite sublattices. The direction of the moments determines the fate of these crossings when the SOC is turned on. We focus on the case of out-of-plane moments, which forbid an anomalous Hall effect and thus ensure that no weak magnetization is triggered in the altermagnetic state. In the 2D model, the SOC gaps out the Dirac crossings, resulting in mirror Chern bands that enable the Quantum Spin Hall Effect and undergo a topological transition to trivial bands upon increasing the magnitude of the magnetic moment. On the other hand, in the 3D model the crossings persist even in the presence of SOC, forming Weyl nodal loops protected by mirror symmetry. Finally, we discuss possible ways to control these effects in altermagnetic material candidates.},

Almost unavoidable in these processes is Majorana wave function overlap, known as hybridization, which arises throughout the process when Majorana modes get close to each other. This breaks the ground state degeneracy, leading to qubit errors in the braiding process. This work presents a simple but precise method to predict qubit errors for dynamic hybridization which varies in space and time. This includes hybridization between four or more MZMs through topological or trivial regions or both of them. As an illustration, we characterize qubit errors for an X gate. We demonstrate how to utilize the hybridization to implement not only arbitrary one-qubit rotations but also a two-qubit controlled variable phase gate, providing a demonstration of universal quantum computing.},

When the two chains are decoupled ( t y = 0 ), HHG originates from the dynamics of coherent doublon-holon pairs because of spin-charge separation. With increasing t y , the doublon-holon pairs lose their coherence due to their interchain hopping and resultant nonlocal spin strings. Furthermore, the HHG signal from spin polarons—charges dressed by spin clouds—leads to an additional plateau in the HHG spectrum. For large t y , we identify unconventional HHG processes involving three elementary excitations—two polarons and one magnon. Our study is an essential step toward a microscopic understanding of nontrivial many-body effects on HHG in correlated materials beyond conventional semiconductors.},

We demonstrate that in the doubled Hilbert space, the partition function of the boundary is mapped to two layers of the critical Ising model with an interlayer line defect that depends on the species of the anyons causing the decoherence. The line defects associated with the tunneling of bosonic and anyons are relevant, and result in long-range correlations for either the or anyon, respectively, on the boundary in the doubled Hilbert space. In contrast, the defect of the anyon is marginal and leads to a line of fixed points with varying effective central charges, and power-law correlations having continuously varying scaling dimensions. We also demonstrate that decoherence-analogs of Majorana zero modes are localized at the spatial interface of the relevant and anyon decoherence channels, which leads to a universal logarithmic scaling of the Rényi entropy of the boundary.},

The former shows spectral weight up to the Fermi energy, as expected for a metal. The latter has a gap in its spectral weight, set by the bipolaron binding energy, although this is also a (strongly correlated) metal. This difference suggests that angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy could be used to identify liquids of pre-formed pairs. Furthermore, we show that the one-dimensional liquid of incoherent bipolarons is well approximated by a “Bose sea” of bosons that are hard-core in momentum space, occupying the momenta inside the Fermi sea but otherwise noninteracting.

  abstract     = {Using x-ray photoelectron diffraction (XPD) and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we study photoemission intensity changes related to changes in the geometric and electronic structure in the kagome metal CsV 3 Sb 5 upon transition to an unconventional charge density wave (CDW) state. The XPD patterns reveal the presence of a chiral atomic structure in the CDW phase. Furthermore, using circularly polarized x-rays, we have found a pronounced nontrivial circular dichroism in the angular distribution of the valence band photoemission in the CDW phase, indicating a chirality of the electronic structure. This observation is consistent with the proposed orbital loop current order. In view of a negligible spontaneous Kerr signal in recent magneto-optical studies, the results suggest an antiferromagnetic coupling of the orbital magnetic moments along the c axis. While the inherent structural chirality may also induce circular dichroism, the observed asymmetry values seem to be too large in the case of the weak structural distortions caused by the CDW.},

  abstract     = {The low-energy dynamics of two-dimensional topological matter hinges on its one-dimensional edge modes. Tunneling between fractional quantum Hall edge modes facilitates the study of anyonic statistics: it induces time-domain braiding that dominates signals from diluted anyon beams. We develop a framework for characterizing one-dimensional out-of-equilibrium anyonic states and define their effective potential and temperature, both arising from anyonic braiding, as well as the landscape of their excitations. Unlike fermions, the effective anyon potential depends on the type of the tunneling quasiparticles; nonequilibrium anyonic states are underlain by power-law energy distributions. This allows “hot” anyons to tunnel above the chemical potential of the source, which we capture by a measurable universal witness function. Our analysis raises the prospect of generalizing the kinetic approach to compressible anyonic matter in higher dimensions.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, surface acoustic waves (SAWs) have emerged as a novel technique for generating quasiparticle transport and band modulation in condensed matter systems. SAWs interact with adjacent materials through piezoelectric and strain fields, dragging carriers in the direction of wave propagation. Most studies on the acoustoelectric effect have focused on the collective directional motion of carriers, which generates a steady electric potential difference, while the oscillating component from dynamic spatial charge modulation has remained challenging to probe. In this Letter, we report the coherent detection of the oscillating acoustoelectric effect in graphene. This is achieved through the coherent rectification of spatial-temporal charge oscillation with electromagnetic waves emitted by interdigital transducers. We systematically investigate the frequency and gate dependence of rectified signals and quantitatively probe the carrier redistribution dynamics driven by SAWs. The observation of the oscillating acoustoelectric effect provides direct access to the dynamic spatial charge modulation induced by SAWs through transport experiments.},

This system shows clear signatures of two sets of spatially separated flat bands associated with the top and bottom twisted bilayer graphene subsystems, each independently tunable. Thermodynamic analysis reveals weak correlations between bilayers that allow the chemical potential to be measured as a function of carrier density for each constituent TBG. We find that correlated insulating states at integer number of electrons per moiré unit cell are most robust near magic angle, whereas gapped states at neutrality are more robust at larger twist angles.},

Luminescent polymers have been extensively investigated because of their potential applications in light sources and display devices. Here, we provide the first evidence that a luminescent polymer is also a strong emitter of free electrons and a source of new light. Vivid green light flashes have been observed from a red-emitting polymer junction under a large reverse bias. The junctions have a planar configuration, revealing that the green light flashes are emitted into free space, far beyond the confines of electrodes. Moreover, the green flashes can be strongly distorted by a permanent magnet placed nearby, generating a light show resembling an aurora. Like the aurora, the green light flashes are caused by charged particles. By applying a known transverse magnetic field to bend the flashes into circular arcs, a charge to mass ratio is determined for the charged particles. The auroralike green light coincides with the formation of electrical trees in the -doped region of the junction. We postulate that the green light is caused by field-emitted electrons exciting an unknown organic vapor released in the treeing process.},

We develop a semiclassical model based on these measurements that predicts a near-unity degree of spin polarization, surpassing other solid-state spin defects under ambient conditions. Building upon our model, we include the presence of nuclear spin degrees of freedom adjacent to the and perform a comprehensive set of Lindbladian numerics to investigate the hyperfine-induced polarization of the nuclear spins.

  abstract     = {We present a unified description of transport in normal and superconducting metals in the presence of generic spin-orbit coupling (SOC). The structure of the quantum kinetic theory in the diffusive regime is determined by a set of fundamental constraints—charge conjugation symmetry, the causality principle, and the crystal symmetry of a material. These symmetries uniquely fix the action of the Keldysh nonlinear model (NLSM), which at the saddle point yields the quantum kinetic Usadel-type equation, the equation that describes the main transport features of a system. Our phenomenological approach is reminiscent of the Ginzburg-Landau theory but is valid for superconductors in the whole temperature range, describes the diffusive transport in the normal state, and naturally captures the effects of superconducting fluctuations. As an application, we derive the NLSM and the corresponding quantum transport equations, which include all effects of spin-orbit coupling, allowed by the crystal symmetry, for example, the spin Hall, spin current swapping, or spin-galvanic effects. Our approach can be extended to derive transport equations in systems with broken time reversal symmetry, as well as to the description of hybrid interfaces, where the spin-charge interconversion can be enhanced due to strong interfacial SOC.},

The NBEC can be transformed into a “group conductivity,” i.e., the electron conductivity ascribed to a subset of ions. We show that for disordered metallic systems, such as warm dense matter (WDM) and hot dense plasma, the static limit of the NBEC is different from the average ionization states, but that the ionization state can be extracted from the group conductivity even in mixed systems. We demonstrate this approach using a set of archetypical examples, including cold and warm aluminium, low- and high-density WDM carbon, and a WDM carbon-beryllium-hydrogen mixture.},

Our experiments show that the shape of dissolution fingers is invariant and reveals itself over time as the fingers extend into the system. By combining reactive-transport theory and conformal mapping techniques we derive these invariant forms.

  abstract     = {Lift force of viscous origin is widespread across disciplines, from mechanics to biology. Here, we present the first direct measurement of the lift force acting on a particle moving in a viscous fluid along the liquid interface that separates two liquids. The force arises from the coupling between the viscous flow induced by the particle motion and the capillary deformation of the interface. The measurements show that the lift force increases as the distance between the sphere and the interface decreases, reaching saturation at small distances. The experimental results are in good agreement with the model and numerical calculation developed within the framework of the soft lubrication theory.},

Here, we demonstrate midinfrared energy deposition (MIRED) spectroscopy that offers both microsecond-scale temporal resolution and submicron spatial resolution. In this approach, the photothermal process is optically probed while the infrared pulses from a quantum cascade laser array are rapidly tuned. Based on Newton’s law of heating and cooling, the energy deposition is the first derivative of local temperature rise over time and gives the instantaneous absorption. By employing time-resolved measurement of transient energy deposition, the upper limit for spectrum encoding shifts to the vibrational relaxation level, which occurs on the picosecond scale. This method significantly increases the detection bandwidth while retaining the sensitivity and resolution benefits of photothermal detection.},

Using a neutron spin-echo technique and a specially designed magnetic multilayer mirror, we have measured the relative phase between the reflected up and down neutron spin states in total reflection. The relative GH shift calculated from this phase shows a strong resonant enhancement at a particular incident neutron wave vector, which is due to a waveguiding effect in one of the magnetic layers. Calculations based on the observed phase difference between the neutron states indicate a propagation distance along the waveguide layer of 0.65 mm for the spin-down state, which we identify with the magnitude of the giant GH shift. The existence of a physical GH shift is confirmed by the observation of neutron absorption in the waveguide layer. We propose ways in which our experimental method may be exploited for neutron quantum-enhanced sensing of thin magnetic layers.},

  abstract     = {Thouless pumping is an emblematic manifestation of topology in physics, referring to the ability to induce a quantized transport of charge across a system by simply varying one of its parameters periodically in time. The original concept of Thouless pumping involves a noninteracting system, and has been implemented in several platforms. One current challenge in the field is to extend this concept to interacting systems. In this Letter, we propose a Thouless pump that solely relies on nonlinear physics, within a chain of coupled Kerr resonators. Leveraging the driven-dissipative nature of the system, we modulate in space and time the on-site Kerr interaction energies, and generate -dimensional topological bands in the Bogoliubov spectrum of excitations. These bands present the same topology as the ones obtained within the Harper-Hofstadter framework, and the Wannier states associated to each band experience a net displacement and show quantized transport according to the band Chern numbers. Remarkably, we find driving configurations leading to band inversion, revealing an interaction-induced topological transition. Our numerical simulations are performed using realistic parameters inspired from exciton polaritons, which form a platform of choice for investigating driven topological phases of matter.},

This implies that the energy of the latter particle can be altered by a nonlocal quantum correlation, without enabling any form of superluminal communication. This energy alteration, however, remains to be experimentally testified. To test this phenomenon, we construct an incomplete Mach-Zehnder interferometer utilizing two quantum memories. The Stokes photon generated by the quantum memories serves as the first particle, while the atomic excitation stored within the memories acts as the second particle. Our results demonstrate that if the de Broglie–Bohm interpretation is realistic, the trajectory of the Stokes photon can be nonlocally influenced by a slight probe of the atomic excitation. Conversely, the position of the atomic excitation, as well as the energy ℏ ω hf it carries, can also be nonlocally altered by controlling the Stokes photon. These findings underscore the continued relevance of nonlocality in hidden variable theories, consistent with Bell’s theorem and recent experimental validations, while making clear that such phenomena do not violate the principles of relativity.},

The latter axially expands up to a critical length and then splits into two or more smaller fragments, recognizable as quantum droplets. We find that the number of formed droplets increases with decreasing interspecies attraction and increasing atom number. We show, by combining theory and experiment, that this behavior is consistent with capillary instability, which causes the breakup of the stretching droplet due to the surface tension.

The experimental confirmation is enabled by a unique mass-spectroscopy setup, allowing for fluorescence observation near or at the 0-0 transition without inducing heat in the ions upon photon absorption. The low-temperature conditions effectively simulate the restricted motion experienced within the protein, inhibiting internal conversion via a conical intersection along a twist motion coordinate. Fluorescence-excitation experiments at 100 K reveal an absorption-band maximum at , while the dispersed fluorescence spectrum shows maximum emission at .

The increasing low-lying octupole strength in the Gd isotopes is analyzed with five state-of-the-art theoretical models. It is found to be best reproduced by quasiparticle random phase approximation calculations, providing a good understanding of octupole collectivity in the rare-earth region.},

  abstract     = {The DeepCore subdetector of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory provides access to neutrinos with energies above approximately 5 GeV. Data taken between 2012 and 2021 (3387 days) are utilized for an atmospheric ν μ disappearance analysis that studied 150 257 neutrino-candidate events with reconstructed energies between 5 and 100 GeV. An advanced reconstruction based on a convolutional neural network is applied, providing increased signal efficiency and background suppression, resulting in a measurement with both significantly increased statistics compared to previous DeepCore oscillation results and high neutrino purity. For the normal neutrino mass ordering, the atmospheric neutrino oscillation parameters and their 1 σ errors are measured to be Δ m 32 2 = 2.40 − 0.04 + 0.05 × 10 − 3 eV 2 and sin 2 θ 23 = 0.54 − 0.03 + 0.04 .

  abstract     = {Quantum turbulence is a far-from-equilibrium process characterized by high nonlinearity. Holographic duality provides a systematic framework for simulating the decaying ( 3 + 1 )-dimensional quantum turbulence by numerically solving the dual Abelian-Higgs theory in a ( 4 + 1 )-dimensional black hole background. We reveal that different types of decay behavior of the total vortex line density L emerge depending on the initial vortex line density, ranging from L ∼ t − 1.5 to L ∼ t − 1 , similar to the experimental observation of He 3 in Bradley et al. [ Phys. Rev. Lett. 96 , 035301 (2006) ], and of He 4 in Stalp et al. [ Phys. Rev. Lett. 82 , 4831 (1999) ] and in Walmsley and Golov [ Phys. Rev. Lett. 118 , 134501 (2017) ]. Furthermore, by measuring the energy flux at the black hole horizon, we determine that the energy dissipation rate d E / d t is proportional to the square of the total vortex line density, consistent with the vortex line decay equation proposed by W. F. Vinen and also the experimental measurement in Nat. Phys. 7 , 473 (2011) .},

In particular, we give explicit expressions up to for the lightest correlator with two double-particle and two single-particle operators built out of the stress-tensor multiplet. Our derivation makes use of the general holographic prescription applied to an asymptotically geometry that describes a coherent superposition of multigraviton operators. The final result can be written in terms of a natural generalization of the standard functions and takes a compact form in Mellin space. The correlator we compute here is the simplest of a more general class of correlators where two inserted operators are multiparticles. These can be derived with the same approach, suggesting that the structure found here is general.},

  abstract     = {We present an effective field theory (EFT) approach to extract fundamental cosmological parameters from the Lyman-alpha forest flux fluctuations as an alternative to the standard simulation-based techniques. As a first application, we reanalyze the publicly available one-dimensional Lyman-alpha flux power spectrum data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Our analysis relies on informative priors on EFT parameters that we extract from a combination of public hydrodynamic simulation and emulator data. Assuming the concordance cosmological model, our one-parameter analysis yields a 2% measurement of the late time mass fluctuation amplitude σ 8 = 0.841 ± 0.017 , or equivalently, the structure growth parameter S 8 = 0.852 ± 0.017 , consistent with the standard cosmology. This result is obtained assuming that nonlinear EFT parameters are cosmology-independent functions of the linear bias parameter. When this assumption is loosened, the limit degrades by a factor of 3, suggesting that informative priors are necessary for competitive constraints. Combining our EFT likelihood with Planck + baryon acoustic oscillation data, we find a new constraint on the total neutrino mass, ∑ m ν &lt; 0.08 eV (at 95% CL). Our study defines priorities for the development of EFT methods and sets the benchmark for cosmological analyses of the Lyman-alpha forest data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument.},

  abstract     = {Expectation values of observables are routinely estimated using so-called classical shadows—the outcomes of randomized bases measurements on a repeatedly prepared quantum state. In order to trust the accuracy of shadow estimation in practice, it is crucial to understand the behavior of the estimators under realistic noise. In this Letter, we prove that any shadow estimation protocol involving Clifford unitaries is stable under gate-dependent noise for observables with bounded stabilizer norm —originally introduced in the context of simulating Clifford circuits. In contrast, we demonstrate with concrete examples that estimation of “magic” observables can lead to highly misleading results in the presence of miscalibration errors and a worst case bias scaling exponentially in the system size. We further find that so-called robust shadows , aiming at mitigating noise, can introduce a large bias in the presence of gate-dependent noise compared to unmitigated classical shadows. Nevertheless, we guarantee the functioning of robust shadows for a more general noise setting than in previous works. On a technical level, we identify average noise channels that affect shadow estimators and allow for a more fine-grained control of noise-induced biases.},

  abstract     = {We propose a Clifford noise reduction (CliNR) scheme that provides a reduction of the logical error rate of Clifford circuit with lower overhead than error correction and without the exponential sampling overhead of error mitigation. CliNR implements Clifford circuits by splitting them into subcircuits that are performed using gate teleportation. A few random stabilizer measurements are used to detect errors in the resources states consumed by the gate teleportation. This can be seen as a teleported version of the coherent parity-check scheme [1–3], with offline fault-detection making it scalable. We prove that CliNR achieves a vanishing logical error rate for families of n -qubit Clifford circuits with size s such that n s p 2 goes to 0, where p is the physical error rate, meaning that it reaches the regime n s = o ( 1 / p 2 ) , whereas the direct implementation is limited to s = o ( 1 / p ) . Moreover, CliNR uses only 3 n + 1 qubits, 2 s + o ( s ) gates and has zero rejection rate. This small overhead makes it more practical than quantum error correction in the near term and our numerical simulations show that CliNR provides a reduction of the logical error rate in relevant noise regimes.},

We define a new family of BB codes whose parity check circuits require a qubit connectivity of degree five instead of six while maintaining their numerical performance.

  abstract     = {In the relentless pursuit of quantum computational advantage, we present a significant advancement with the development of Zuchongzhi 3.0. This superconducting quantum computer prototype, comprising 105 qubits, achieves high operational fidelities, with single-qubit gates, two-qubit gates, and readout fidelity at 99.90%, 99.62%, and 99.13%, respectively. Our experiments with an 83-qubit, 32-cycle random circuit sampling on the Zuchongzhi 3.0 highlight its superior performance, achieving samples in just a few hundred seconds. This task is estimated to be infeasible on the most powerful classical supercomputers, Frontier, which would require approximately to replicate the task. This leap in processing power places the classical simulation cost 6 orders of magnitude beyond Google’s SYC-67 and SYC-70 experiments [Morvan et al. , Nature 634 , 328 (2024) ], firmly establishing a new benchmark in quantum computational advantage. Our work not only advances the frontiers of quantum computing but also lays the groundwork for a new era where quantum processors play an essential role in tackling sophisticated real-world challenges.},

  abstract     = {We experimentally study the transient dynamics of a dissipative superconducting qubit under periodic drive toward its nonequilibrium steady states. The corresponding stroboscopic evolution, given by the qubit states at times equal to integer multiples of the drive period, is determined by a (generically non-Hermitian) Floquet Liouvillian. The drive period controls both the transients across its non-Hermitian degeneracies and the resulting nonequilibrium steady states. These steady states can exhibit higher purity compared to those achieved with a constant drive. We further study the dependence of the steady states on the direction of parameter variation and relate these findings to the recent studies of dynamically encircling exceptional points. Our Letter provides a new approach to control non-Hermiticity in dissipative quantum systems and presents a new paradigm in quantum state preparation and stabilization.},

  abstract     = {Frustration, that is, the impossibility of satisfying the energetic preferences between all spin pairs simultaneously, underlies the complexity of many fundamental properties in spin systems, including the computational difficulty in determining their ground states. Coherent Ising machines (CIMs) have been proposed as a promising analog computational approach to efficiently find different degenerate ground states of large and complex Ising models. However, CIMs also face challenges in solving frustrated Ising models: frustration not only reduces the probability of finding good solutions, but it also prohibits the leveraging of quantum effects in doing so. To circumvent these detrimental effects of frustration, we show how frustrated Ising models can be mapped to frustration-free CIM configurations by including ancillary modes and modifying the coupling protocol used in current CIM designs. Such frustration elimination may empower current CIMs to benefit from quantum effects in dealing with frustrated Ising models. In addition, these ancillary modes can also enable error detection and searching for excited states.},

  abstract     = {Quantum information theory is plagued by the problem of regularizations, which require the evaluation of formidable asymptotic quantities. This makes it computationally intractable to gain a precise quantitative understanding of the ultimate efficiency of key operational tasks such as entanglement manipulation. Here, we consider the problem of computing the asymptotic entanglement cost of preparing noisy quantum states under quantum operations with positive partial transpose (PPT). By means of an analytical example, a previously claimed solution to this problem is shown to be incorrect. Building on a previous characterization of the PPT entanglement cost in terms of a regularized formula, we construct instead a hierarchy of semidefinite programs that bypasses the issue of regularization altogether, and converges to the true asymptotic value of the entanglement cost. Our main result establishes that this convergence happens exponentially fast, thus yielding an efficient algorithm that approximates the cost up to an additive error ϵ in time poly ( D , log ( 1 / ϵ ) ) , where D is the underlying Hilbert space dimension. To our knowledge, this is the first time that an asymptotic entanglement measure is shown to be efficiently computable despite no closed-form formula being available.},

  abstract     = {Device-independent randomness certification based on Bell nonlocality does not require any assumptions about the devices, thus provides adequate security. Great effort has been made to demonstrate that nonlocality is necessary for generating quantum randomness, but the minimal resource required has not been clarified. Here we prove and experimentally demonstrate that violating any two-input Bell inequality is both necessary and sufficient for certifying randomness, however, for the multiple-input cases, this sufficiency ceases to apply, leading to certain states exhibiting Bell nonlocality without the capability to certify randomness. We examine two typical classes of Bell inequalities with multiple input and multiple output, the facet inequalities and Salavrakos-Augusiak-Tura-Wittek-Acín-Pironio inequalities, in the high-dimensional photonic system, and observe that the violation of the latter one can always certify randomness which is not true for the former. The private randomness with a generation rate of 1.867 ± 0.018 bits per photon pair is obtained in the scenario of Salavrakos-Augusiak-Tura-Wittek-Acín-Pironio inequalities with 3-input and 4-output. Our Letter unravels the internal connection between randomness and nonlocality, effectively enhancing the performance of tasks such as device-independent random number generation.},
