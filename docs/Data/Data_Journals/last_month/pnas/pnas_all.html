  abstract     = {West Nile virus (WNV) and Usutu virus (USUV) are closely related mosquito-borne neurotropic flaviviruses that share common transmission cycle and can infect humans. However, while human infections by WNV are widespread, infections by USUV are comparatively less frequent, less severe, and currently limited to Africa and Europe. To identify human host factors that contribute to the pathogenic signatures of these two flaviviruses, we carried out an arrayed expression screen of over 1,300 interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Several ISGs known to target flaviviruses, including IFI6, SHFL, and RTP4 were among the strongest hits. Interestingly, we also found MITD1, an ISG with no previously reported antiviral activity, among the strongest hits. We demonstrated that the antiviral activity of MITD1 was not limited to USUV and WNV, since it also inhibited Zika and dengue virus replication. We found MITD1 to interfere with viral RNA replication by sequestering specific endosomal sorting complexes required for transport-III (ESCRT-III) proteins involved in the formation of viral replication factories. MITD1 expression was not increased by type I interferon (IFN-I) in most human cells and mouse tissues that we examined, although WNV and USUV replication was strongly inhibited by IFN-I. Strikingly, MITD1 was induced in the brain of USUV-infected mice and importantly, in human monocyte-derived microglia. Using human microglial-like cells, we confirmed that MITD1 is an essential mediator of the anti-flavivirus activity of IFN-I in these cells. We conclude that MITD1 plays a key role in the cellular defenses against neurotropic flaviviruses.},

  abstract     = {Desiccation-tolerant cyanobacteria are able to survive frequent cycles of hydration and dehydration, which are closely linked to diurnal light oscillations. Previous studies have shown that light serves as a crucial anticipatory cue, activating desert cyanobacteria to prepare for desiccation. However, the mechanisms underlying their light-coupled desiccation tolerance remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that red-light-induced photosynthetic genes are positively regulated by a LuxR family transcription factor NfSrr1. We further identified the cyanobacteriochrome NfPixJ as interacting with NfSrr1 and functioning as a red light sensor. Phenotypic analysis revealed that the red-light signaling module NfPixJ-NfSrr1 plays a key role in preparing cyanobacteria for desiccation tolerance. This module also regulates the synthesis of protective compatible solutes, suggesting that red light functions as a global regulatory signal for the broader stress response. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the presence of this red-light signaling pathway, mediated by NfPixJ-NfSrr1 module, correlates with the ability of cyanobacteria to thrive in water-deficit habitats. Overall, our findings uncover a red-light signaling pathway that enhances desiccation tolerance as desert cyanobacteria encounter red light at dawn, before water limitation. These results provide insights into the mechanisms behind light-induced anticipatory stress tolerance in photosynthetic organisms.},

  abstract     = {The co-occurrence of arsenic and uranium in groundwater has been found in many countries, posing a significant challenge to human health. Here, we have demonstrated the efficient simultaneous removal of arsenic and uranyl-carbonate complexes from groundwater using {001}-TiO 2 . Surprisingly, the presence of U(VI) greatly enhanced the adsorption of As(V) on {001}-TiO 2 , while As(V) had a negligible impact on U(VI) adsorption. Through in situ ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, we uncovered a mechanism involving the formation of a ternary surface complex [Ti–U(VI)–As(V)] on the surface of {001}-TiO 2 . This ternary surface complex formed through the substitution of CO 3 2- from uranyl coordination sites. Furthermore, the adsorbed As(V) and U(VI) can be easily recovered using a sodium hydroxide solution, and {001}-TiO 2 can be used repeatedly. Our findings offer a promising solution for the simultaneous removal of As(V) and U(VI) from groundwater and provide valuable insights into the mechanisms involved in their removal.},

  abstract     = {Peptides and proteins, essential components of living organisms, are composed of amino acids linked by peptide bonds. However, the mechanism of peptide bond formation during the prebiotic era remains unclear. In this study, advanced Born–Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) simulations were used to investigate the mechanisms and kinetics of peptide bond formation at air–water interfaces using diglycine, the simplest dipeptide, as a model molecule. The results show that peptide bonds can be rapidly formed via a unique isomerization-then-OH − -elimination pathway. In this mechanism, the diglycine initially isomerizes into its acidic form at the air–water interface, followed by a reaction that releases an OH − anion rather than the previously hypothesized H 2 O. The free-energy barriers for the interfacial pathway with the assistance of an interfacial electric field are much lower than those in the gas phase by &gt;25 kcal/mol. Further calculations suggest that this mechanism can be extended to the formation of some larger peptides, such as tetraglycine. This pathway offers insights into the origin of life and could inform the development of methods for peptide synthesis.},

  abstract     = {Meiotic recombination is a prominent force shaping genome evolution, and understanding why recombination rates vary within and between species has remained a central, though challenging, question. Variation in recombination is widely thought to influence the efficacy of selection in purging transposable elements (TEs), prevalent selfish genetic elements, leading to widely observed negative correlations between TE abundance and recombination rates across taxa. However, accumulating evidence suggests that TEs could instead be the cause rather than the consequence of this relationship. To test this prediction, we formally investigated the influence of polymorphic, putatively active TEs on recombination rates. We developed and benchmarked an approach that uses PacBio long-read sequencing to efficiently, accurately, and cost-effectively identify crossovers (COs), a key recombination product, among large numbers of pooled recombinant individuals. By applying this approach to Drosophila strains with distinct TE insertion profiles, we found that polymorphic TEs, especially RNA-based TEs and TEs with local enrichment of repressive marks, reduce the occurrence of COs. Such an effect leads to different CO frequencies between homologous sequences with and without TEs, contributing to varying CO maps between individuals. The suppressive effect of TEs on CO is further supported by two orthogonal approaches–analyzing the distributions of COs in panels of recombinant inbred lines in relation to TE polymorphism and applying marker-assisted estimations of CO frequencies to isogenic strains with and without transgenically inserted TEs. Our investigations reveal how the constantly changing TE landscape can actively modify recombination, shaping genome evolution within and between species.},

  abstract     = {Interaction of electric fields with biological cells is indispensable for many physiological processes. Thermal electrical noise in the cellular environment has long been considered as the minimum threshold for detection of electrical signals by cells. However, there is compelling experimental evidence that the minimum electric field sensed by certain cells and organisms is many orders of magnitude weaker than the thermal electrical noise limit estimated purely under equilibrium considerations. We resolve this discrepancy by proposing a nonequilibrium statistical mechanics model for active electromechanical membranes and hypothesize the role of activity in modulating the minimum electrical field that can be detected by a biological membrane. Active membranes contain proteins that use external energy sources to carry out specific functions and drive the membrane away from equilibrium. The central idea behind our model is that active mechanisms, attributed to different sources, endow the membrane with the ability to sense and respond to electric fields that are deemed undetectable based on equilibrium statistical mechanics. Our model for active membranes is capable of reproducing different experimental data available in the literature by varying the activity. Elucidating how active matter can modulate the sensitivity of cells to electric signals can open avenues for a deeper understanding of physiological and pathological processes.},

Voltage spikes measured on these electrodes display depolarization, repolarization, and hyperpolarization phases with amplitudes similar to the action potentials of neurons but with the markedly slower duration of 1 to 2 s. Some propagate distances up to hundreds of μm from the wound with a mean speed of around 10 mm s −1 . Generation and transmission of bioelectric signals are significantly influenced by the perturbation of mechanosensitive cationic ion channels. These direct measurements confirm bioelectric signaling that previous work has hypothesized to regulate epithelial cell development and may have relevance to the frequency parameter selection of bioelectric devices.},

  abstract     = {Diatoms, a highly successful group of photosynthetic algae, contribute to a quarter of global primary production. Many species are motile, despite having no appendages and a completely rigid cell body. Cells move to seek out nutrients, locate mating partners, and undergo vertical migration. To explore the natural diversity of diatom motility, we perform a comparative study across five common biofilm-forming species. Combining morphological measurements with high-resolution cell tracking, we establish how gliding movements relate to the morphology of the raphe—a specialized slit in the cell wall responsible for motility generation. Our detailed analyses reveal that cells exhibit a rich but species-dependent phenotype, switching stochastically between four stereotyped motility states. We model this behavior and use stochastic simulations to predict how heterogeneity in microscale navigation patterns leads to differences in long-time diffusivity and dispersal. In a representative species, we extend these findings to quantify diatom gliding in complex, naturalistic 3D environments, suggesting that cells may exploit these distinct motility signatures to achieve niche segregation in nature.},

  abstract     = {Protein therapeutics such as antibodies require in-depth in vivo characterization during development and consequently account for a large proportion of laboratory animal consumption in the pharmaceutical industry. Currently, antibody candidates are exhaustively tested one-by-one in animal models to determine pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) profiles. The simultaneous analysis of antibody mixtures in single animals, called cassette-dosing, could in principle overcome this bottleneck, but is currently limited to small cassette sizes. Here, we demonstrate how the use of genetically encoded peptide tags (flycodes), designed for maximal detectability in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, can allow for the simultaneous characterization of large pools of drug candidates, from single cassette–dosed mice. We demonstrate the simultaneous assessment of PK parameters for a group of &gt;20 marketed/development-stage antibodies. Biodistribution experiments in mice bearing EGFR-expressing tumors correctly identified the two pool members recognizing EGFR, while organ analysis registered liver accumulation of an antibody targeting glucagon receptor, a protein profoundly expressed in that organ. In analogy to an early-phase drug development campaign, we performed biophysical and PK analysis for a cassette of 80 unique bispecific DARPin-sybody molecules. The data shown in this study originate from only 18 cassette-dosed mice, thereby demonstrating how flycode technology efficiently advances preclinical discovery pipelines allowing a direct comparison of drug candidates under identical experimental conditions.},

  abstract     = {Photosystem II (PSII) can achieve near-unity quantum efficiency of light harvesting in ideal conditions and can dissipate excess light energy as heat to prevent the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under light stress. Understanding how this pigment–protein complex accomplishes these opposing goals is a topic of great interest that has so far been explored primarily through the lens of the system energetics. Despite PSII’s known flat energy landscape, a thorough consideration of the entropic effects on energy transfer in PSII is lacking. In this work, we aim to discern the free energetic design principles underlying the PSII energy transfer network. To accomplish this goal, we employ a structure-based rate matrix and compute the free energy terms in time following a specific initial excitation to discern how entropy and enthalpy drive ensemble system dynamics. We find that the interplay between the entropy and enthalpy components differ among each protein subunit, which allows each subunit to fulfill a unique role in the energy transfer network. This individuality ensures that PSII can accomplish efficient energy trapping in the reaction center (RC), effective nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) in the periphery, and robust energy trapping in the other-monomer RC if the same-monomer RC is closed. We also show that entropy, in particular, is a dynamically tunable feature of the PSII free energy landscape accomplished through regulation of LHCII binding. These findings help rationalize natural photosynthesis and provide design principles for more efficient solar energy harvesting technologies.},

This results in elevated corticosterone levels in response to restraint stress, leading to increased immune cell apoptosis and immune organ atrophy in male mice.

While trophoblast-specific cis-regulatory elements impacting HLA-G transcription have been described, the identity of trans-acting factors controlling HLA-G expression in EVT remains poorly understood. Utilizing a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen, we find that the WNT signaling pathway negatively regulates HLA-G expression in EVT. In addition, we identified two trophoblast-specific transcription factors, TEAD1 and TEAD3, required for HLA-G transcription in EVT in a Yes-associated protein-independent manner. Altogether, we systematically elucidated essential genes and pathways underlying HLA-G expression in EVT, shedding light on the mechanisms of maternal–fetal tolerance and potentially providing insights into controlling HLA-G expression beyond EVT to protect allogeneic cells from immune rejection.},

  abstract     = {Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) primarily infects macrophages. In vitro without antibiotics, wild-type Mtb hastens death of the macrophages, but the processes leading to rapid cell death are not well understood. Our earlier work indicated that the death of Mtb-infected mouse macrophages in vitro is markedly exacerbated by induction of interferon-β (IFN-β) [L. Zhang et al., J. Exp. Med. 18 , e20200887 (2021)]. Here, we identified a key downstream response to IFN-β in the context of Mtb infection as the massive induction of cis-aconitate decarboxylase (ACOD1), not only in its canonical subcellular localization in mitochondria but also in the cytosol, where it bound to the lysosome-stabilizing protein HSP70. ACOD1’s product, itaconate, protected Mtb-infected macrophages. However, the contrasting and predominant effect of high-level ACOD1 expression was to act in a noncatalytic manner to promote HSP70’s degradation, leading to lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP). Mtb-induced macrophage death was markedly diminished by inhibitors of cysteine proteases, consistent with lysosome-mediated cell death. Neither ACOD1 inhibitors nor cysteine protease inhibitors are suitable for potential host-directed therapy (HDT) of tuberculosis. Instead, this work directs attention to how ACOD1 acts nonenzymatically to promote the degradation of HSP70.},

  abstract     = {During mitosis, there are significant structural changes in chromosomes. We used a maximum entropy approach to invert experimental Hi-C data to generate effective energy landscapes for chromosomal structures at different stages during the cell cycle. Modeled mitotic structures show a hierarchical organization of helices of helices. High-periodicity loops span hundreds of kilobases or less, while the other low-periodicity ones are larger in genomic separation, spanning several megabases. The structural ensembles reveal a progressive decrease in compartmentalization from interphase to mitosis, accompanied by the appearance of a second diagonal in prometaphase, indicating an organized array of loops. While there is a local tendency to form chiral helices, overall, no preferential left-handed or right-handed chirality appears to develop on the time scale of the cell cycle. Chromatin thus appears to be a liquid crystal containing numerous defects that anneal rather slowly.},

  abstract     = {Transmembrane channel-like protein 1 (TMC1), a pore-forming component of the mechano-electrical transducer (MET) channel in cochlear outer hair cells, is subject to numerous mutations causing deafness and hair cell death. We studied mice harboring semidominant mutations Tmc1 p.T416K, p.M412K, and p.D569N, which all display functional MET channels at postnatal day (P)6 but become deaf by P21. Early signs of concomitant hair cell apoptosis were assayed in neonatal Tmc1 mutants by labeling with Calcein-acetomethyl ester (AM), MitoTracker, and Annexin V, the latter labeling scramblase externalization of phosphatidyl serine. Reduced labeling with Calcein-AM was correlated with reduced MitoTracker, the targeting of mitochondria being confirmed with the uncoupling agent carbonylcyanide p -trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, and use of MitoLight to monitor mitochondrial membrane potential. These markers demonstrated mitochondrial dysfunction in Tmc1 mutants, even at P6 when MET currents were still present. Acoustic brainstem responses established that Tmc1 p.D569N and Tmc1 p.M412K mice were deaf by P15 and Tmc1 p.T416K by P21. Two methods of blocking the stereociliary PMCA2 Ca 2+ pump both elicited scramblase activity, suggesting that apoptosis is promoted by elevation of hair bundle [Ca 2+ ]. Reduced PMCA2 density was found in the stereocilia of Tmc1 mutants and was correlated with a decrease in MET channel Ca 2+ permeability. Cre-Lox excision of the mutant M412K exon at P1 fully preserved hearing across all frequencies by P19 and promoted recovery to wild type of PMCA2 density. These results demonstrate that hair cells in Tmc1 mutants have embarked on apoptosis at P6 and argue for connections between stereociliary PMCA2 density, hair cell apoptosis, and deafness.},

  abstract     = {Thermally induced ripples are intrinsic features of nanometer-thick films, atomically thin materials, and cell membranes, significantly affecting their elastic properties. Despite decades of theoretical studies on the mechanics of suspended thermalized sheets, controversy still exists over the impact of these ripples, with conflicting predictions about whether elasticity is scale-dependent or scale-independent. Experimental progress has been hindered so far by the inability to have a platform capable of fully isolating and characterizing the effects of ripples. This knowledge gap limits the fundamental understanding of thin materials and their practical applications. Here, we show that thermal-like static ripples shape thin films into a class of metamaterials with scale-dependent, customizable elasticity. Utilizing a scalable semiconductor manufacturing process, we engineered nanometer-thick films with precisely controlled frozen random ripples, resembling snapshots of thermally fluctuating membranes. Resonant frequency measurements of rippled cantilevers reveal that random ripples effectively renormalize and enhance the average bending rigidity and sample-to-sample variations in a scale-dependent manner, consistent with recent theoretical estimations. The predictive power of the theoretical model, combined with the scalability of the fabrication process, was further exploited to create kirigami architectures with tailored bending rigidity and mechanical metamaterials with delayed buckling instability.},

  abstract     = {How organisms evolve under extreme environmental changes is a critical question in the face of global climate change. Genetic accommodation is an evolutionary process by which natural selection acts on novel phenotypes generated through repeated encounters with extreme environments. In this study, polyphenic and monophenic strains of the black mutant tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta , were evolved via genetic accommodation of heat stress-induced phenotypes, and the molecular differences between the two strains were explored. Transcriptomic analyses showed that epigenetic and hormonal differences underlie the differences between the two strains and their distinct responses to temperature. DNA methylation had diverged between the two strains potentially mediating genetic assimilation. Juvenile hormone (JH) signaling in the polyphenic strain was temperature sensitive, whereas in the monophenic strain, JH signaling remained low at all temperatures. Although 20-hydroxyecdysone titers were elevated under heat shock conditions in both strains, the strains did not differ in the titers. Tyrosine hydroxylase was also found to differ between the two strains at different temperatures, and its expression could be modulated by topical application of a JH analog. Finally, heat shock of unselected black mutants demonstrated that the expression of the JH-response gene, Krüppel-homolog 1 ( Kr-h1 ), increased within the first 30 min of heat shock, suggesting that JH levels respond readily to thermal stress. Our study highlights the critical role that hormones and epigenetics play during genetic accommodation and potentially in the evolution of populations in the face of climate change.},

  abstract     = {A sustained blood supply is critical for tumor growth, as it delivers the nutrients and oxygen required for development. Targeting of blood vessel formation via immunotherapies is an area of great importance. Knowing that certain embryonic genes, such as carcinoembryonic antigens (CEA) and oncofetal fibronectin, become reexpressed in malignant transformation, we hypothesized that a similar phenomenon holds true for tumor endothelial cells (TECs) as well. An approach for identification of highly selective tumor endothelial markers was conducted to develop targeted antiangiogenic immunotherapies. We first queried the transcriptome that is present during embryo development. We then performed a systematic search for genes selectively expressed in the mouse embryo at days E11 and E18, as compared to the transcriptome of the adult mouse. Subsequently, we queried for expression of these embryonic genes in sorted murine TECs. This approach identified among others the tumor endothelial antigens fibrillin-2 (Fbn2), elastin microfibril interface-located protein 2 (Emilin2) as well as the tumor endothelial antigens lysyl oxidase (Lox) and serine/cysteine protease inhibitor, clade E, member 1 (Serpine1; Pai-1). For these selected genes, functional involvement in angiogenesis was confirmed in in vitro bioassays. We subsequently used iBoost conjugate vaccine technology to develop vaccines against the selected targets. For all four targets, vaccination readily induced target-specific antibody responses in mice, resulting in inhibition of tumor growth. Access to highly specific tumor endothelial markers provides opportunities for direct targeting of the tumor vasculature with high specificity, without affecting healthy vasculature.},

  abstract     = {Simultaneous profiling of multiple molecules trafficking at a single organelle and the surrounding cytosol within a living cell is crucial for elucidating their functions, necessitating advanced techniques that provide high spatial–temporal resolution and molecule specificity. In this study, we present an electrochemical nanodevice based on a θ-nanopipette designed to coanalyze calcium ions (Ca 2+ ) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) at a single mitochondrion and its surrounding cytosol, thereby enhancing our understanding of their trafficking within the signaling pathways of cellular autophagy. Two independent nanosensors integrated within the channels of the θ-nanopipette spatially isolate a single target mitochondrion from the cytosol and simultaneously measure the release of Ca 2+ and ROS with high spatial–temporal resolution. Dynamic tracking reveals the direct trafficking of lysosomal Ca 2+ to the mitochondrion rather than to the cytosol, which triggers ROS-induced ROS release within the mitochondria. Furthermore, highly temporal and concurrent observations revealed a second burst of Ca 2+ in both the mitochondrion and the cytosol, which is not consistent with the change in ROS. These dynamic data elucidate the potential role of a beneficial feedback loop between the Ca 2+ signaling pathway and the subsequent generation of mitochondrial ROS in ML-SA-induced autophagy. More importantly, this innovative platform facilitates detailed profiling of the molecular interactions between trafficking molecules within the mitochondria and the adjacent cytosolic environment, which is hardly realized using the current superresolution optical microscopy.},

  abstract     = {Endothelial cells (ECs) are constantly exposed to hemodynamic forces, which play a crucial role in regulating EC functions. Pulsatile laminar shear stress (PS), representing atheroprotective flow, maintains the anti-inflammation and homeostatic phenotype of ECs, but the comprehensive mechanism underlying the PS-repression of inflammatory genes remains to be determined. In this study, we investigated the role of chromatin organization in mediating the effects of PS on inflammatory gene expression in ECs. We demonstrated that PS induced the expression of histone methyltransferase SUV39H1 to promote heterochromatin formation via H3K9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) enrichment, a hallmark gene repression mechanism. SUV39H1 interacts with lamin-associated proteins and facilitates the perinuclear localization of the H3K9me3-enrichment. Silencing the lamin-associated protein emerin (EMD) not only led to the reductions of cytoskeletal F-actin formation and perinuclear H3K9me3 enrichment; but also the impairment of PS-induced SUV39H1 expression, H3K9me3 enrichment at E-selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 loci to revert their PS-repressed expression. Hence, EMD acts as a hub to transmit mechanical cues from the cytoskeleton to the nucleus and recruits SUV39H1, which regulate nuclear organization, chromatin state, and gene expression. These results accentuate the critical role of nuclear architecture in mechanotransduction and EC responses to mechanical stimuli.},

We observed a widespread and relatively abundant bacterial phylum (CSP1-3) in deep soils and evaluated its phylogeny, ecology, metabolism, and evolutionary history. Genome analysis indicated that members of CSP1-3 were actively replicating in situ and were widely involved in the carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycles. We identified potential adaptive traits of CSP1-3 members for the oligotrophic deep soil environments, including a mixotrophic lifestyle, flexible energy metabolisms, and conservation pathways. The ancestor of CSP1-3 likely originated in an aquatic environment, subsequently colonizing topsoil and, later, deep soil environments, with major CSP1-3 clades adapted to each of these distinct niches. The transition into the terrestrial environment was associated with genome expansion, including the horizontal acquisition of a range of genes for carbohydrate and energy metabolism and, in one lineage, high-affinity terminal oxidases to support a microaerophilic lifestyle. Our results highlight the ecology and genome evolution of microbes in the deep Critical Zone.},

Although rich in vertebrate fossil deposits spanning the Middle and Late Miocene, associated geochronology has been limited by the lack of available volcanic materials that allow radioisotopic dating and geochemical correlation. As a result, calibrating mammalian evolution has been largely restricted to the semicircular application of paleomagnetic inferences combined with temporally ill-constrained and geographically remote biochronological deductions. For example, fossils from three Greek localities and one Anatolian locality assigned to the primate genus Ouranopithecus lack datable samples, leaving its ages poorly constrained. Chronological calibration based on the 40 Ar/ 39 Ar results reported here demonstrates how a fauna-focused, precision geochronology can enhance a better understanding of evolving species lineages and the ecosystems they comprise.},

  abstract     = {Motile cilia are organelles found on many eukaryotic cells that play critical roles in development and fertility. Human CFAP298 has been implicated in the transport/assembly of ciliary dyneins, and defects in this protein cause primary ciliary dyskinesia. However, neither the exact function nor the structure of CFAP298 have been elucidated. Here, we took advantage of Chlamydomonas , a ciliated alga, to study the structure and function of FBB18, an ortholog of CFAP298. Multiple ciliary dyneins were greatly reduced in cilia of Chlamydomonas fbb18 mutants. In addition, we found that both the stability of ciliary dynein heavy chains (HCs) and the association between HCs and intermediate/light chains (IC/LCs) are greatly reduced in fbb18 cytoplasm, strongly suggesting that FBB18 functions in the cytoplasmic assembly (the so-called “preassembly”) of dynein complexes from HC/IC/LCs. Furthermore, X-ray crystallography revealed that FBB18 forms a bilobed structure with globular domains at both ends of the molecule, connected by an α-helical bundle. Unexpectedly, one globular domain shows high similarity to ubiquitin, a small protein critical for the modification of a variety of protein complexes, and this ubiquitin-like domain is indispensable for the molecular function of FBB18. Our results demonstrate that FBB18, a specialized member of the ubiquitin-like protein family, plays a critical role in dynein preassembly, most likely by mediating diverse interactions between dynein HCs, molecular chaperone(s), and other preassembly factor(s) using the ubiquitin-like domain as well as other regions, and by facilitating the proper folding of dynein HCs.},

  abstract     = {The continuing discovery of new peptide-aminoacyl-tRNA ligases (PEARLs) has unveiled a diverse array of enzymes with the unique potential to append amino acids to the C terminus of substrate peptides in an aminoacyl-tRNA-dependent manner. To date, PEARLs have been reported that can conjugate Cys, Ala, Trp, Gly, Leu, Asn, and Thr residues, but the basis of peptide substrate and aminoacyl-tRNA recognition is not known. Cell-free expression (CFE) has emerged as a powerful tool to rapidly assay activity of substrate variants, and we used the technique in this study to investigate the peptide substrate specificity of the PEARL B h a B C T r p . This enzyme that adds Trp was discovered previously during genome mining for ribosomally synthesized and posttranslational modified peptides (RiPPs). The enzyme is remarkably tolerant of changes to the C-terminal amino acid of the peptide substrate, and truncation and replacement experiments suggest a minimal sequence requirement. An AlphaFold3 model provided insights into binding interactions of the substrate peptide BhaA-Ala to B h a B C T r p and also generated predictions for tRNA, ATP, and Mg 2+ binding modes that were tested by site-directed mutagenesis. The data suggest that several highly conserved residues in PEARLs recognize the 3′-CCA sequence present in all tRNAs. The minimal sequence required for Trp incorporation by B h a B C T r p was employed as a protein tag for C-terminal labeling of eGFP, lysozyme, and MBP with Trp and 5-Br-Trp.},

  abstract     = {Metamorphic proteins switch reversibly between two differently folded states under a variety of environmental conditions. Their identification and prediction are gaining attention, but the fundamental physicochemical basis for fold switching remains poorly understood. In this Perspective article, we address this problem by surveying the landscape of well-characterized metamorphic proteins and noting that a significant fraction of them display temperature sensitivity. We then make the case that the dependence on temperature, in particular cold-denaturation effects, is likely to be an underlying property of many metamorphic proteins regardless of their ultimate triggering mechanisms, especially those with a single domain. The argument is supported by rigorous analysis of hydrophobic effects in each well-characterized metamorphic protein pair and a description of how these parameters relate to temperature. The conclusion discusses the relevance of these insights to a better understanding of prediction, evolution, and de novo design strategies for metamorphic proteins.},

Chatterjee, J. F. Rodriguez-Nieva, E. Demler, Phys. Rev. B 99 , 104425 (2019)]. Here, we develop spin noise spectroscopy for spin liquid studies by considering Ca 10 Cr 7 O 28 , a material hypothesized to be either a quantum or a spiral spin liquid (SSL). By enhancing techniques introduced for magnetic monopole noise studies [R. Dusad et al. , Nature 571 , 234–239 (2019)], we measure the time and temperature dependence of spontaneous flux Φ ( t , T ) and thus magnetization M ( t , T ) of Ca 10 Cr 7 O 28 samples. The resulting power spectral density of magnetization noise S M ω , T reveals intense spin fluctuations with S M ω , T ∝ ω - α ( T ) and 0.84 &lt; α T &lt; 1.04 . Both the variance σ M 2 T and the correlation function C M t , T of this spin noise undergo crossovers at a temperature T ∗ ≈ 450 mK . While predictions for quantum spin liquids are inconsistent with this phenomenology, those from Monte–Carlo simulations of a two-dimensional (2D) SSL state in Ca 10 Cr 7 O 28 yield overall quantitative correspondence with the measured frequency and temperature dependences of S M ω , T , C M t , T , and σ M 2 T , thus indicating that Ca 10 Cr 7 O 28 is an SSL.},

  abstract     = {Diapause, a developmental arrest mechanism, helps animals to survive seasonal changes via endocrine regulation. While obligate diapause is genetically programmed, facultative diapause is typically triggered by environmental cues such as photoperiod. In insects, this often leads to reproductive diapause characterized by reduced juvenile hormone (JH) signaling, resulting in ovarian arrest and lipid accumulation. However, the molecular link between photoperiod and hormonal control remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the cabbage beetle Colaphellus bowringi as our model system. This species exhibits a photoperiodic response, where short-day (SD) conditions promote reproduction, whereas long-day (LD) conditions induce diapause. Our research identified the PBAP chromatin remodeling complex as a key regulator of LD-induced summer diapause entry. Through RNAi screening of 56 transcriptional regulators that were differentially expressed between SD and LD females, we identified BAP170, a PBAP-specific component, as a key mediator of diapause. Knockdown of bap170 in SD females induced reproductive diapause traits, which were reversed by treatment with methoprene, a JH analog, suggesting that the PBAP complex regulates diapause by influencing JH production. We further demonstrated that the PBAP complex modulates JH biosynthesis via SET1/COMPASS-mediated trimethylation of H3K4. Transcriptome analysis and a second RNAi screen identified calmodulin , a calcium-binding messenger protein gene, as a direct target of PBAP-SET1/COMPASS-H3K4me3 signaling in the corpora allata (CA), the primary source of JH. These findings reveal how the chromatin remodeling machinery translates photoperiod signals into endocrine responses governing seasonal adaptation.},

  abstract     = {Poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors are vital therapeutic agents that exploit synthetic lethality, particularly effective in tumors with homologous recombination (HR) defects. However, broadening their clinical utility remains a significant challenge. In this study, we conducted a high-throughput kinase inhibitor screen to identify potential targets exhibiting synthetical lethality with PARP inhibitors. Our results show that thousand and one amino acid protein kinase 1 (TAOK1) plays a pivotal role in the DNA damage response by phosphorylating ubiquitin specific peptidase 7 (USP7), thereby promoting its enzymatic activity and preventing the ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation of RAD51, a crucial protein in the filament formation of HR repair. Notably, genetic depletion or pharmacological inhibition of TAOK1, as well as blocking peptide targeting the USP7 phosphorylation site, impaired USP7 function, leading to RAD51 degradation, disruption of HR repair, and increased tumor cell and sensitivity to PARP inhibition. This study highlights TAOK1 as a critical regulator of HR repair pathway in human cancer cells and presents a therapeutic strategy overcoming resistance to PARPi inhibitors. These findings support the potential clinical application of combining PARP inhibitors with TAOK1 inhibition or peptide treatment to improve therapeutic outcomes.},

  abstract     = {During cell division in animal cells, a bipolar spindle assembles to segregate the chromosomes. Various motor proteins with different properties are essential for spindle self-organization. The minimal set of components required to organize dynamic microtubules into a bipolar network remains however unknown. Here, we use computer simulations to explore whether two types of microtubule-crosslinking motors with opposite directionality can organize dynamic microtubules into bipolar spindles in three-dimensional space around a local microtubule nucleation source. We find that two motors are indeed sufficient, provided their properties resemble the main human spindle motors kinesin-5 and dynein, revealing the core mechanism of spindle self-organization. It is based on the synergistic interplay of a slow plus-directed symmetric motor and a fast minus-directed asymmetric motor. A hypothetical symmetric minus-directed motor can also support spindle formation together with kinesin-5, but only in a limited and unphysiological parameter range. In agreement with its accessory role in human cells, a minus motor with human kinesin-14 properties does not assemble stable bipolar spindles together with kinesin-5. These results reveal fundamental principles for the self-organization of dynamic bipolar microtubule architectures and highlight how distinct molecular designs of mitotic motors are optimized for their task.},

Here, we optimize IAV inoculation to enhance replication in the nasal turbinate (NT) and study local B cell immunity. We demonstrate that URT-targeted IAV infection stimulates robust local B cell responses, including germinal center (GC) B cell formation in the NT, outside of classical nasal-associated lymphoid tissues. NT GC contributes to local tissue-resident B cell generation and enhances local antibody production. Furthermore, URT-focused immunization also induces significant GC formation in the NT. Finally, we detect steady-state GC in the NT of both mice and healthy humans, suggesting continuous immune surveillance triggered by environmental stimuli.

  abstract     = {Sponges, the basalmost members of the animal kingdom, exhibit a range of complex architectures in which microfluidic channels connect multitudes of spherical chambers lined with choanocytes, flagellated filter-feeding cells. Choanocyte chambers can possess scores or even hundreds of such cells, which drive complex flows entering through porous walls and exiting into the sponge channels. One of the mysteries of the choanocyte chamber is its spherical shape, as it seems inappropriate for inducing directional transport since many choanocyte flagella beat in opposition to such a flow. Here, we combine direct imaging of choanocyte chambers in living sponges with computational studies of many-flagella models to understand the connection between chamber architecture and directional flow. We find that those flagella that beat against the flow play a key role in raising the pressure inside the choanocyte chamber, with the result that the flow rate and mechanical pumping efficiency reach a maximum at a small outlet opening angle. Comparison between experimental observations and the results of numerical simulations reveal that the chamber diameter, flagellar wave number, and the outlet opening angle of the freshwater sponge Ephydatia muelleri , as well as several other species, are related in a manner that maximizes the mechanical pumping functions. These results indicate the subtle balances at play during morphogenesis of choanocyte chambers, and give insights into the physiology and body design of sponges.},

On large 8-leg cylinders, we demonstrate that the pure t-J model with only nearest-neighbor hoppings and superexchange interactions, for a wide range of doping ( δ = 0.1 to 0.2 ), hosts robust d-wave superconductivity possibly coexisting with weak unidirectional pair density wave. Furthermore, a small next nearest neighbor hopping t 2 suppresses pair and charge density waves, resulting in a uniform d-wave SC phase in both electron- and hole-doped cuprate model systems.

  abstract     = {Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) carries out the lipolytic processing of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) along the luminal surface of capillaries. LPL activity is regulated by the angiopoietin-like proteins (ANGPTL3, ANGPTL4, ANGPTL8), which control the delivery of TRL-derived lipid nutrients to tissues in a temporal and spatial fashion. This regulation of LPL mediates the partitioning of lipid delivery to adipose tissue and striated muscle according to nutritional status. A complex between ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL8 (ANGPTL3/8) inhibits LPL activity in oxidative tissues, but its mode of action has remained unknown. Here, we used biophysical techniques to define how ANGPTL3/8 and ANGPTL3 interact with LPL and how they drive LPL inactivation. We demonstrate, by mass photometry, that ANGPTL3/8 is a heterotrimer with a 2:1 ANGPTL3:ANGPTL8 stoichiometry and that ANGPTL3 is a homotrimer. Hydrogen–deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) studies revealed that ANGPTL3/8 and ANGPTL3 use the proximal portion of their N-terminal α-helices to interact with sequences surrounding the catalytic pocket in LPL. That binding event triggers unfolding of LPL’s α/β -hydrolase domain and irreversible loss of LPL catalytic activity. The binding of LPL to its endothelial transporter protein (GPIHBP1) or to heparan-sulfate proteoglycans protects LPL from unfolding and inactivation, particularly against the unfolding triggered by ANGPTL3. Pulse-labeling HDX-MS studies revealed that ANGPTL3/8 and ANGPTL3 catalyze LPL unfolding in an ATP-independent fashion, which categorizes these LPL inhibitors as atypical unfoldases. The catalytic nature of LPL unfolding by ANGPTL3/8 explains why low plasma concentrations of ANGPTL3/8 are effective in inhibiting a molar excess of LPL in capillaries.},

Although histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation has been reported to stabilize the genome in proliferating cells, its specific role in HSPC development remains elusive. In this study, we demonstrated that tryptophan-aspartic acid (WD) repeat protein 5 (Wdr5)-mediated H3K4 methylation is crucial for maintaining genomic stability of proliferating HSPCs in zebrafish embryos. Loss of wdr5 led to a severe reduction of HSPC pool in the caudal hematopoietic tissue, accompanied with attenuated H3K4 methylation level and evident p53 -dependent apoptosis in the HSPCs. Mechanistically, Wdr5-mediated H3K4 methylation maintains genomic stability by inhibiting the formation of abnormal R-loops in the HSPCs, whereas accumulation of R-loops exacerbates DNA damage. Moreover, the absence of H3K4 trimethylation leads to an inactivated DNA damage response (DDR) pathway, which is deleterious to DNA damage repair and genomic stability. Subsequently, we found that DDR-associated genes, mutL homolog 1 and breast and ovarian cancer interacting helicase 1 , are important to ensure HSPC survival, likely by stabilizing their genome. In summary, these findings reveal that Wdr5-mediated H3K4 methylation is essential for HSPC development through tight control of R-loop accumulation and DDR-associated program to ensure genomic stability and survival of proliferating HSPCs.},

We performed a system-level analysis of serum cytokines in a longitudinal cohort of 133 healthy individuals over 9 y. We found that cancer incidence is a major contributor to increased cytokine abundance variability. Circulating cytokines increase up to 4 y before a cancer diagnosis in subjects with age over 80 y. We also analyzed cytokine expression in 10 types of early-stage cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We found that a similar set of cytokines is upregulated in tumor tissues, specifically after the age of 80 y. Similarly, cellular senescence activity and CDKN1A/p21 expression increase with age in cancer tissues. Finally, we demonstrated that the cytokine levels in serum can be used to predict cancers among subjects age at 80+ y. Our results suggest that latent senescent cancers contribute to age-related chronic inflammation.},

  abstract     = {The mandible, also known as the lower jaw, is the only bone in the skull that can move and is essential for speaking and chewing. Meckel’s cartilage (MC) is a temporary structure that supports the formation of the mandible, but how MC is involved in the ossification of the mandible is poorly understood. Through the use of single-cell RNA sequencing and single-cell spatial transcriptomics analyses, a spatiotemporal atlas of MC in human fetuses from 7 to 15 wk postconception was established, highlighting the role of MC in the ossification of the mandible. Importantly, we revealed that two populations of MC contributed to mandibular ossification through different mechanisms. The anterior MC can differentiate into osteolineage cells, as shown in an in vivo lineage tracing mouse model. The intermediate MC facilitates intramembranous ossification through cell–cell communications, possibly through signaling ligands like BMP5 , BMP7 , SEMA3A , PDGFC , and FGF7 . This study suggests that MC plays a crucial role in mediating mandibular ossification through distinct mechanisms, providing valuable insights for understanding oral and craniofacial diseases and disorders in the future.},

  abstract     = {Platelets, known for maintaining blood balance, also participate in antimicrobial defense. Upon severeacute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, platelets become hyperactivated, releasing molecules such as cytokines, granule contents, and bioactive lipids. The key effector biolipids produced by platelets include 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) and 12-hydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (12-HETrE), produced by 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX), and prostaglandins and thromboxane, produced by cyclooxygenase-1. While prostaglandin E2 and thromboxane B2 were previously associated with lung inflammation in severe COVID-19, the role of platelet 12-LOX in SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear. Using mice deficient for platelets’ 12-LOX, we report that SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in higher lung inflammation characterized by histopathological tissue analysis, increased leukocyte infiltrates, and cytokine production relative to wild-type mice. In addition, distinct platelet and lung transcriptomic changes, including alterations in NOD-like receptor (NLR) family pyrin domain-containing 1 (NLRP1) inflammasome-related gene expression, were observed. Mass spectrometry lipidomic analysis in 12-LOX-deficient-infected mice revealed significant changes in bioactive lipid content, including reduced levels of 12-HETrE that inversely correlated with disease severity. Finally, platelet 12-LOX deficiency was associated with increased morbidity and lower survival rates relative to wild type (WT) mice. Overall, this study highlights the complex interplay between 12-LOX-related lipid metabolism and inflammatory responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The findings provide valuable insights into potential therapeutic targets aimed at mitigating severe outcomes, emphasizing the pivotal role of platelet enzymes in the host response to viral infections.},

This study explored the role of E26 transformation-specific variant 5 (ETV5) in NEPC development. Analysis of multiple prostate cancer datasets revealed that NEPC is characterized by significantly elevated ETV5 expression compared to other subtypes. ETV5 expression increased progressively under hormone therapy through epigenetic modifications. ETV5 induced neural stem–like features in prostate cancer cells and facilitated their differentiation into NEPC under hormone treatment conditions, both in vitro and in vivo. Our molecular mechanistic study identified PBX3 and TLL1 as target genes of ETV5 that contribute to ETV5 overexpression–induced castration resistance and stemness. Notably, obeticholic acid, identified as an ETV5 inhibitor in this study, exhibited promising efficacy in suppressing NEPC development. This study highlights ETV5 as a key transcription factor that facilitates NEPC development and underscores its potential as a therapeutic target for this aggressive cancer subtype.},

However, the spatial organization of functional connectivity (FC) variability across the human connectome edges and its significance in cognitive development remain unclear. Here, we identified a connectional axis in the edge-level FC variability. The variability declined continuously along this axis from within-network to between-network connections and from the edges linking association networks to those linking the sensorimotor and association networks. This connectional axis of functional variability is associated with spatial pattern of structural connectivity variability. Moreover, the connectional variability axis evolves in youth with an flatter axis slope. We also observed that the slope of the connectional variability axis was positively related to the performance in the higher-order cognition. Together, our results reveal a connectional axis in functional variability that is linked with structural connectome variability, refines during development, and is relevant to cognition.},

  abstract     = {Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) exhibit nonphotobleaching, near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence suitable for bioimaging applications. In particular, SWCNT fluorescence quenching induced by biopolymer dispersants facilitates flexible design of molecular nanosensors, yet challenges remain in analyte selectivity and lack of rational design strategies. A sought-after alternative to haphazard molecular modulation of SWCNT-based fluorescence is to couple the movement of a quencher to the SWCNT surface, enabling fluorescence energy transfer to modulate molecular recognition with high selectivity. This study presents the rational design of SWCNT-based nanosensors with fluorescence energy transfer, leveraging the unique properties of methylene blue (MB) proximity–mediated fluorescence quenching. MB-SWCNT-based nanosensors exhibit 1- stability in redox environments and 2- analyte-specific displacement-driven fluorescence modulation. By designing hybridization-induced displacement of MB-conjugated ssDNA from the SWCNT surface, we calculate that SWCNT fluorescence modulation can occur within a 6.8 nm fluorescence resonance energy transfer distance from the SWCNT surface and develop a robust and versatile platform to synthesize oligonucleotide nanosensors with tunable Δ F / F 0 of up to 150%. Building upon this strategy, we developed four distinct nanosensors capable of selectively detecting tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) viral RNA fragments, which successfully differentiated TMV-infected plants from mock controls. Finally, we demonstrate the potential expansion of our design to target a wider scope of biomolecules using the biotin-avidin system as a model. Taken together, our study presents a generalizable platform that enables rational engineering of SWCNT NIR fluorescence intensity through MB distance-dependent fluorescence energy transfer, overcoming the intrinsic selectivity challenges of current SWCNT nanosensors.},

  abstract     = {α-hydroxy acids (αHAs), simple and prebiotically plausible organic monomers, were likely present in various environments on and off Earth and could have played a role in directing the emergence of the first homochiral living systems. Some αHAs, which could have been of varying chirality, can undergo dehydration polymerization into polyesters, which could assemble into membraneless microdroplets upon rehydration; understanding these processes is critical for unraveling how simple prebiotic molecules transitioned into more complex systems capable of supporting selective chemical reactions, a key step toward the origin of life. Here, we focused on tartaric acid (TA), a prebiotically relevant αHA with multiple chiral forms, to probe plausible mechanisms by which primitive αHA and polyester-based systems could have participated in selective homochiral polymer synthesis. Enantiopure solutions of d -TA or l -TA polymerize efficiently via dehydration, while racemic dl -TA polymerization is inhibited due to stereochemical incompatibility. We found that Ca 2+ ions influence this process in two significant ways: 1) regulating TA monomer availability through selective crystallization, removing equal amounts of both enantiomers in racemic proportion and thereby enriching the enantiomeric excess of the remaining nonracemic TA solution; and 2) modulating polymerization by suppressing enantiopure TA polymerization while enabling dl -TA polymerization. These findings suggest that the differential availability of simple inorganic ions, such as Ca 2+ , could have indirectly mediated the selection of simple organic chiral monomers and the emergence of homochirality in primitive protocell-forming polymers, offering a pathway from nonliving to living matter in early Earth environments.},

The knowledge about the genetic and molecular mechanisms that govern seed size is crucial for improving crop yield. Here, we report that the Mediator subunit OsMED23 associates with the histone demethylase OsJMJ703 and the transcription factor OsWOX3A to control grain size and weight in rice. Loss of function of OsMED23 or OsJMJ703 causes narrow and light grains, while overexpression of OsMED23 or OsJMJ703 results in large and heavy grains. OsMED23 physically interacts with OsJMJ703 and the transcription factor OsWOX3A. OsMED23, OsJMJ703, and OsWOX3A associate with the common promoter regions of two key grain size genes GW2 and OsLAC and repress their transcription by influencing H3K4me3 levels. Field trials demonstrate that overexpression of OsMED23 or OsJMJ703 can significantly increase grain yield. Therefore, our findings identify a mechanism by which the transcriptional repressor complex OsJMJ703-OsMED23-OsWOX3A determines grain size and weight by regulating gene expression and influencing H3K4me3 levels in rice, suggesting that this pathway has a great potential for improving grain yield in key crops.},

  abstract     = {To understand infectious disease dynamics, we need to understand the inextricably intertwined nature of the ecology and evolution of pathogens and hosts. Epidemiological dynamics of many infectious diseases have highlighted the importance of considering the demographics of the societies in which they spread, particularly with respect to age structure. In addition, the waves of the recent COVID-19 pandemic driven by variant replacements at an unprecedented speed show that it is vital to consider the evolutionary aspects. The classic trade-off theory of virulence addresses aspects of pathogen evolution, but here we explore in more detail the possibility of society-specific evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS) during an unfolding pandemic. Theory posits the existence under some conditions of an ESS representing the evolutionary endpoint of change. By using a demographically realistic model incorporating infection rates that vary with age, we outline which evolutionary scenarios are plausible. Focusing on the rate of infection and duration of infectivity, we ask whether an ESS exists, what characterizes it, and as a result which long-term public-health consequences may be expected. We demonstrate that the ESS of an evolving pathogen depends upon the background age-dependent frailty and mortality rates. Our findings shed important light on the plausible long-term trajectories of highly evolvable novel pathogens.},

  abstract     = {Redox imbalance contributes to aberrant osteoclastogenesis and osteoporotic bone loss. In this study, we observed lower Forkhead box protein O3 (FoxO3), a transcription factor associated with cellular oxidative stress, enhanced osteoclastogenesis in osteoporosis (OP). Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis on the human femoral head indicated that FoxO3 is widely expressed in macrophages. Furthermore, Lysm-Cre;FoxO3 f/f OVX mice showed increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), enhanced osteoclastogenesis, and more bone loss than normal OVX mice. Mechanistically, we identified FoxO3 promoter methylation as a crucial factor contributing to decreased FoxO3, thereby influencing osteoclastogenesis and OC function. Intriguingly, we observed that Dnmt3a, highly expressed during osteoclastogenesis, played a pivotal role in regulating the methylation of the FoxO3 promoter. Knockdown of Dnmt3a promoted FoxO3 expression, inhibiting osteoclastogenesis and mitigating OP. Interestingly, we observed that Dnmt3a alleviated osteoclastogenesis by suppressing ROS via upregulating FoxO3 rather than inducing the dissociation of RANK and TRAF6. Collectively, this study elucidates the role and mechanism of FoxO3 in osteoclastogenesis and OP, providing a epigenetic target for the treatment of OP.},

  abstract     = {Internal states like motivation fluctuate substantially over time. However, studies of the neurocomputational mechanims of motivated behavior have failed to capture this. Here, we examined how naturalistic ups and downs in state motivation influence the subjective value of reward and effort. In a microlongitudinal design (N = 155, state timepoints = 3,344, decision-making tasks = 845), we captured fluctuations in state and effort-based decision-making using smartphone-based momentary assessments as people went about their daily lives. We found that both state and trait have independent and multiplicative effects on decision-making. State–behavior coupling was particularly pronounced in individuals with higher trait apathy, meaning that their choices were even more state dependent. Using computational modeling, we demonstrate that state motivation prospectively boosted reward sensitivity, making people more willing to exert effort in future. Our results show that day-to-day fluctuations in state and cognition are tightly linked and critical for understanding fundamental human behaviors and mental ill-health.},

Molecular dynamics simulation studies confirm and extend the cryo-EM findings. The ARF6 lattice exhibits features that are distinct from those formed by other membrane-bending proteins. We identify protein contacts critical for lattice assembly and how membrane insertion results in constricted tubules. The lattice structure also enables docking by GTPase-activating proteins (GAP) to achieve vesiculation. We have also modeled ARF1 onto the ARF6 lattice, and then pursued vesicle reconstitution by the Coat Protein I (COPI) complex to further confirm that the ARF lattice acts in vesicle fission.

The latter has potential for transferring energy and information with unprecedented efficiency. Here, we demonstrate a topological diode effect on the surface of a three-dimensional material, SmB 6 , a candidate topological Kondo insulator. The diode effect is evidenced by pronounced rectification and photogalvanic effects under electromagnetic modulation and radiation at radio frequency. Our experimental results and modeling suggest that these prominent effects are intimately tied to the spatially inhomogeneous formation of topological surface states (TSS) at the intermediate temperature. This work provides a manner of breaking the mirror symmetry (in addition to the inversion symmetry), resulting in the formation of pn -junctions between puddles of metallic TSS. This effect paves the way for efficient current rectifiers or energy-harvesting devices working down to radio frequency range at low temperature, which could be extended to high temperatures using other topological insulators with large bulk gap.},

  abstract     = {Plants produce diverse specialized metabolites with important ecological functions. It has recently become apparent that the genes for many of these pathways are not dispersed in plant genomes, but rather are arranged like beads on a string in biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Pathways encoded by BGCs are as a rule dedicated linear pathways that do not form parts of wider metabolic networks. In contrast, the genes for the biosynthesis of widely distributed more ancestral metabolites such as carotenoids and anthocyanins are not clustered. Little is known about how these more recently evolved clustered pathways interact with general plant metabolism. We recently characterized a 12-gene BGC for the biosynthesis of the antimicrobial defense compound avenacin A-1, a triterpene glycoside produced by oats. Avenacin A-1 is acylated with the fluorophore N -methyl anthranilate and confers bright blue fluorescence of oat root tips under ultraviolet light. Here, we exploit a suite of &gt;100 avenacin-deficient mutants identified by screening for reduced root fluorescence to identify genes required for the function of this paradigm BGC. Using a combination of mutant chemotyping, biochemical and molecular analysis, and genome resequencing, we identify two nonclustered genes ( Sad4 and Pal2 ) encoding enzymes that synthesize the donors required for avenacin glycosylation and acylation (recruited from the phenylpropanoid and tryptophan pathways). Our finding of these Cluster Auxiliary Enzymes (CAEs) provides insights into the interplay between general plant metabolism and a newly evolved lineage-specific BGC.},

Yet, the scarcity of long-term life-history data and limitations in classic statistical tools hinder our capacity to uncover and understand individual heterogeneity in wildlife populations. Here, we apply an underused multivariate statistical method to uncover four heterogenous life-history trajectories in wild female bighorn sheep ( Ovis canadensis ). Remarkably, these trajectories had remained unobserved in the population despite nearly five decades of monitoring. Our results indicate substantial among-trajectory heterogeneity in growth, senescence, life history trade-offs, fitness, and contributions to population growth. Some trajectories suggest the presence of life history trade-offs while others include silver spoon effects, leading to heterogenous life-history outputs. Then, we show that mother identity and year of birth are relatively good predictors of heterogeneity, indicating that individual trajectories could be largely set during early life. Critically, our results demonstrate that heterogeneity in life-history trajectories can be inconspicuous, yet substantial and structured across multiple traits within a population. Uncovering and understanding this heterogeneity in other wild populations will be key to advancing our knowledge of ecoevolutionary processes across populations and species.},

Here, integrating transcriptomic and proteomic approaches with AI-guided structure predictions, we discover a group of evolutionarily conserved leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins in velvet worm slime that readily adopt a receptor-like, protein-binding “horseshoe” structure. Our structural predictions suggest dimerization of LRR proteins and support their interactions with conserved β-sheet-rich domains of high-molecular-weight proteins, the primary building blocks of velvet worm slime fibers. This suggests that LRR proteins might be involved in reversible, receptor-based supramolecular interactions in these biofibers, providing potential avenues for fabricating fully recyclable (bio)polymeric materials.},

Individual complexes have been extensively studied in vitro, but functional co-reconstitution of several mammalian complexes into proteoliposomes, in particular, the combination of a primary pump with the ATP synthase, is less well understood. Here, we present a generic and scalable strategy to purify mammalian respiratory complexes I, III and the ATP synthase from enriched mitochondria in enzymatically fully active form, and procedures to reassemble the complexes into liposomes. A robust functionality can be shown by in situ monitoring of ATP synthesis rates and by using selected inhibitors of the respiratory chain complexes. By inclusion of cytochrome c oxidase, our procedures allowed us to reconstruct the entire mitochondrial respiratory chain (complexes I, III, IV, and V) in ubiquinone Q 10 containing liposomes, demonstrating oxidative phosphorylation by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrogen driven ATP synthesis. The system was fully coupled at all levels and was used to probe cardiolipin as an essential component to activate the mammalian respiratory chain. Structural characterization using electron cryomicroscopy allowed us to resolve apo-state complex III and complex V at high and medium resolution, respectively, using in silico particle sorting, confirming the presence of all protein subunits and cofactors in native stoichiometry and conformation.

  abstract     = {The global sulfur cycle plays a critical role in the redox evolution of Earth’s surface and upper mantle, yet the distribution and origin of sulfur in the mantle remains largely unconstrained. El Hierro is a volcanic island in the Canary archipelago that is fed by sulfur-rich magmas. To constrain the origin of sulfur in these melts, we combine in situ sulfur isotope analyses with regression modeling. We calculate that undegassed El Hierro melts have δ 34 S values of 0 ± 2‰. The average δ 34 S of undegassed El Hierro melts is 0.3‰ to 1‰ higher than magmas erupting at mid-ocean ridges. Mass balance calculations reveal that El Hierro’s mantle source contains 310 ± 120 μg/g sulfur and that on average 60% of sulfur in the source is of recycled origin. This recycled material should contain &gt;1,800 μg/g sulfur to satisfy isotopic constraints on its mass fraction in the mantle source. The sulfur and oxygen isotopic signature in serpentinites and sediments deviate significantly from the upper mantle, making them unsuitable candidates for the recycled material. An oxidized partial melt of recycled oceanic crust that retained one third of its sulfur budget after subduction zone processing can explain excess sulfur in the Canary Island mantle. Recycled oceanic crust is expected to contain sulfur as sulfide, which is not capable of oxidizing the mantle. The presence of ferric iron in the recycled component is necessary to produce metasomatic melts that are oxidizing enough to carry sufficient sulfur into the mantle source of ocean island basalts.},

We test whether explicitly expressing trust in players’ capability to maintain cooperation after the removal of sanctions, i.e., vertical communication of trust, has the potential to alleviate this drop in compliance. Four incentivized public-goods experiments ( N = 2,823) find that the vertical communication of trust maintains cooperation upon the removal of centralized (Study 1), third-party (Study 2a, 2b), and peer punishment (Study 3), and this effect extends beyond single interactions (Study 4). In all studies, vertical trust communication increases mutual trust among players, providing support to the idea that vertically communicating trust can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Extrapolating our findings to natural environments, they suggest that authorities should carefully consider how they communicate the lifting of rules and sanctions.},

Interestingly, much of this strategy carries over to the Euler equations in Euclidean space, leading to the weaker result that there exist analytic steady solutions on T 3 such that the only analytic steady Euler flows in a C 1 -neighborhood must belong to a certain linear space of dimension six. For comparison, note that in any C k -neighborhood of a shear flow, there are infinitely many linearly independent analytic shears.},

  abstract     = {Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive pathogen responsible for numerous antibiotic-resistant infections. Identifying vulnerabilities in S. aureus is crucial for developing new antibiotics to treat these infections. With this in mind, we probed the function of GdpS, a conserved Staphylococcal membrane protein containing a cytoplasmic GGDEF domain. These domains are canonically involved in cyclic-di-GMP signaling processes, but S. aureus is not known to make cyclic-di-GMP. Using a transposon screen, we found that loss of GdpS is lethal when combined with disruption in synthesis of the glycolipid anchor of a cell surface polymer called lipoteichoic acid (LTA) or with deletion of genes important in cell division. Taking advantage of a small molecule that inhibits LTA glycolipid anchor synthesis, we selected for suppressors of Δ gdpS lethality. The most prevalent suppressors were hypermorphic alleles of dgkB , which encodes a soluble diacylglycerol (DAG) kinase required to recycle DAG to phosphatidylglycerol. By following up on these suppressors, we found that the GGDEF domain of GdpS interacts directly with DgkB, orienting its active site at the membrane to promote DAG recycling. DAG kinase hypermorphs also suppressed the lethality caused by combined loss of gdpS and cell division factors, highlighting the importance of lipid homeostasis for cell division. GdpS’ positive regulation of DAG kinase function was dependent on the GGDEF domain but not its catalytic residues. As the sole conserved GGDEF-domain protein in Staphylococci, GdpS promotes an enzymatic process independent of cyclic-di-GMP signaling, revealing a new function for the ubiquitously conserved GGDEF domain.},

  abstract     = {NuA4 is the only essential acetyltransferase in yeast that can catalyze the acetylation of the histones H2A, H2A.Z, and H4, thereby affecting gene transcription. However, the acetylation process of NuA4, such as how NuA4 acetylates H4 and H2A.Z differently, remains largely elusive. Here, using cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) single particle analysis, we present seven cryo-EM structures of piccolo NuA4 (pNuA4) in complex with wild-type H2A.Z or H2A.Z-mutant-containing nucleosomes in the absence or presence of acetyl coenzyme A (Ac-CoA). We revealed that, in the absence of Ac-CoA, pNuA4 adopts multiple conformations to search for its substrates. After adding Ac-CoA, the single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) and cryo-EM data indicated that pNuA4 prefers to bind H4 and undergoes a dynamic conformational change to complete the acetylation. We also obtained previously unseen structures in states associated with the acetylation of H2A.Z. These cryo-EM structures and smFRET results suggest a complex acetylation process on H4 and H2A.Z by pNuA4. The results provide a comprehensive picture of the mechanism by which pNuA4 acetylates its substrates within an H2A.Z-containing nucleosome.},

  abstract     = {Cyanobacteria are the oldest form of photosynthetic life on Earth and contribute to primary production in nearly every habitat, from permafrost to hot springs. Despite longstanding interest in the acclimation of these microbes, it remains poorly understood and challenging to rewire. This study uses a high-density, genome-wide CRISPR interference screen to examine the influence of gene-specific transcriptional variation on the growth of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 under environmental extremes. Surprisingly, many partial knockdowns enhanced fitness under cold monochromatic conditions. Transcriptional repression of genes for core subunits of the NDH-1 complex, which are important for photosynthesis and carbon uptake, improved growth rates under both red and blue light but at distinct, color-specific optima. Most genes with fitness-improving knockdowns were distinct to each light color, and dual-target transcriptional repression produced nonadditive effects. Findings reveal diverse routes to improved acclimation in cyanobacteria (e.g., attenuation of genes involved in CO 2 uptake, light harvesting, translation, and purine metabolism) and provide an approach for using gradients in sgRNA activity to pinpoint biochemically influential transcriptional changes in cells.},

Here, we compile a unique dataset on the largest incident wave heights (0.39 to 1.44 m) ever recorded in forested wetlands, including our own measurements and literature data. Our analysis reveals that forested wetlands can significantly attenuate storm waves (35% over 3 wavelengths) except in rare near-submerged cases. Notably, 19 of the 20 existing formulations for vegetation drag coefficient, a key parameter for wave attenuation modeling, are inapplicable in storm conditions. Hence, we introduce an new approach to reliably predict wave attenuation during storms, without the need for drag coefficient determination nor modeling expertise. This approach offers coastal practitioners a new user-friendly tool to assess the effectiveness of nature-based solutions for storm hazard mitigation.},

  abstract     = {Agriculture is a cornerstone of global food production, accounting for a substantial portion of water withdrawals worldwide. As the world’s population grows, so does the demand for water in agriculture, leading to alterations in regional water–energy balances. We present an approach to identify the influence of agriculture on the water–energy balance using empirical data. We explore the departure from the Budyko curve for catchments with agricultural expansion and their associations with changes in the water–energy balance using a causal discovery algorithm. Analyzing data from 1,342 catchments across three Köppen-Geiger climate classes—temperate, snowy, and others—from 1980 to 2014, we show that temperate and snowy catchments, which account for over 90% of stations, exhibit distinct patterns. Cropland percentage (CL%) emerges as the dominant factor, explaining 47 and 37% of the variance in deviations from the Budyko curve in temperate and snowy catchments, respectively. In temperate catchments, CL% shows a strong negative correlation with precipitation-streamflow (P-Q) causal strength (Spearman ρ = − 0.75 ), suggesting that cropland exacerbates precipitation-driven deviations. A moderate negative correlation with aridity-streamflow (AR-Q) causal strength ( ρ = − 0.42 ) indicates additional influences of cropland through aridity-driven interactions. In snowy catchments, CL% is similarly influential, with a positive correlation with P-Q causal strength ( ρ = 0.51 ). However, the negative correlation with AR-Q causal strength ( ρ = − 0.45 ) underscores the role of aridity as a secondary driver. While vegetation and precipitation seasonality also contribute to the deviations, their impacts are comparatively lower. These findings underscore the need for inclusion of agricultural activities in changing water–energy balance to secure future water supplies.},

  abstract     = {The relationship between humans and pigs has changed dramatically since their domestication in southwest Asia and subsequent human-induced introduction into Europe. Introgression between incoming southwest Asian pigs and European boar resulted in the gradual replacement of southwest Asian ancestry in European pigs. However, we currently lack genomic data required to explore the regional trajectories, nature, and extent of contact between European boar and pigs that led to this turnover, and how this process was facilitated by human activity. We addressed this deficit by sequencing four Mesolithic boar and seven Neolithic pig samples from six archaeological sites in the Netherlands and Britain ranging from the Mesolithic (5500 BCE) to Neolithic (2500 BCE). Our data show that despite continuous gene flow with European boar, Neolithic European pigs show varying levels of southwest Asian ancestry. The low and varying southwest Asian ancestry in pigs from the Early Neolithic Dutch settlement Swifterbant indicates a high contribution of wild ancestry. The genetic profile, enriched δ 15 N values, on-site presence, and wide size distribution of Swifterbant Sus scrofa suggest a commensal relationship. Runs of homozygosity (ROH) imply that both closed-breeding and free-ranging management occurred in Neolithic communities, where the former showed an extreme burden of long segments of ROH. We further show selection signatures, associated with coat color and behavior, in Neolithic herds despite recurrent wild gene flow. Altogether, our results show distinct husbandry practices through space and time in Neolithic Europe, with heavy reliance on boar recruitment via the commensal pathway in northwest Europe.},

Such interactions motivate general investigations into the spatiotemporal dynamics of metabolite exchanges. Here we study by experiment and theory a model system: a coculture of the bacterium Bacillus subtilis , an obligate aerobe that is chemotactic to oxygen, and a nonmotile mutant of the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii , which photosynthetically produces oxygen when illuminated. Strikingly, when a shaft of light illuminates a thin, initially uniform suspension of the two, the chemotactic influx of bacteria to the photosynthetically active region leads to expulsion of the algae from that area. We propose that this effect arises from advection by the inhomogeneous bacterial concentration. The resulting generalization of Fick’s law has been proposed in the context of chemotaxis and is mathematically related to the “turbulent pumping” in magnetohydrodynamics.},

While this conserved architecture underpins their regulatory roles, here we uncover a structural divergence in the metazoan PAS domain–regulated kinase (PASK). By integrating evolutionary-scale domain mapping with deep learning-based structural models, we identified two PAS domains in PASK, namely PAS-B and PAS-C, in addition to the previously known PAS-A domain. Unlike canonical PAS domains, the PAS fold and PAC motif in the PAS-C domain are spatially segregated by an unstructured linker, yet a functional PAS module is assembled through intramolecular interactions. We demonstrate that this assembly is nutrient responsive and serves to remodel the quaternary structure of PASK that positions the PAS-A domain near the kinase activation loop. This nutrient-sensitive spatial arrangement stabilizes the activation loop, enabling catalytic activation of PASK. These findings revealed an alternative mode of regulatory control in PAS sensory proteins, where the structural assembly of PAS domains links environmental sensing to enzymatic activity. By demonstrating that PAS domains integrate signals through dynamic structural rearrangements, this study broadens the understanding of their functional and regulatory roles and highlights potential opportunities for targeting PAS domain–mediated pathways in therapeutic applications.},

However, the contribution of CAMs to opioid-induced rewiring of the reward circuit has not been explored. Here, we used unbiased molecular profiling to identify CAMs in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) modulated by morphine administration. We found that opioid exposure induces the expression of ELFN1, a CAM selectively expressed in cholinergic interneurons in the NAc. We determined that ELFN1 acts trans-synaptically to modulate the strength and plasticity of the glutamatergic inputs onto cholinergic neurons via the recruitment of presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptor 4 (mGlu4). Disruption of Elfn1 diminished morphine reward and intake in self-administering mice. Together, our findings identify a key molecular factor responsible for adjusting the strength of opioid effects by modulating the configuration of striatal circuitry in an experience-dependent fashion and unveil potential therapeutic target for combating opioid abuse.},

The self-bending ultrasonic beams created by acoustic metasurfaces, though inaudible, can bypass obstacles such as human heads. At their intersection behind obstacles, highly localized audible enclaves are formed due to the local nonlinear interactions. Additionally, we demonstrate the ultrabroadband capabilities of our metasurface-based implementation both numerically and experimentally, spanning from 125 Hz to 4 kHz (6 octave bands), covering the majority of the audible frequency range. The practicality of our proposed technique is underscored by its compact implementation size (0.16 m, equivalent to 0.06 wavelengths at 125 Hz), as well as its robust performance under wideband transient audio signal excitation and in a common room with reverberations. Our proposed audible enclaves hold significant potential for various applications in advanced audio engineering, including private speech communications, immersive spatial audio reproduction, and high-resolution sound/quiet zone control.},

However, more than just environment changes along these gradients—urban regions are highly managed systems with limited-to-no within species diversity. We demonstrate here that recent observations that UHI gradients underpredict leaf out response to temperature when compared to temperature gradients through time is likely because both genetics and environment are changing across rural-to-urban gradients, whereas only environment is changing through time. We tested this hypothesis using genomic, phenological, and temperature data of northern red oak ( Quercus rubra ) over several years between an urban and rural site. Across our gradient, models that included just temperature predicted moderate advancement of leaf out. However, if we account for the genetic diversity of our trees in our model, leaf out phenology is predicted to advance significantly more in response to temperature. We demonstrate that this stronger relationship between phenological timing and climate is because urban trees have reduced genetic diversity as they are planted from limited stock by humans and, moreover, are most closely related to individuals at the rural site that leaf out later on average.},

  abstract     = {Integrating the optoelectronic properties of quantum dots (QDs) with biological enzymatic systems to form microbe-semiconductor biohybrids offers promising prospects for both solar-to-chemical conversion and light-modulated biochemical processes. Developing these nano–bio hybrid systems necessitates a deep understanding of charge-transfer dynamics at the nano–bio interface. Photoexcited carrier transfer from QDs to microbes is driven by complex interactions, with emerging insights into the relevant thermodynamic and kinetic factors. The heterogeneities of both microbes and QD ensembles pose significant challenges in mechanistic understanding, which is critical for designing advanced nano–bio hybrids. We used fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy to analyze charge transfer between a CdSe QD film and Shewanella oneidensis microbes. We correlated the spatiotemporal fluorescence data with an analytical model. Our analysis revealed two distinct distributions of QD de-excitation pathways. The characteristics of these distributions: 1) a faster transfer rate ( k ¯ E T 1 = 1.5 10 9 s - 1 ), with a lower acceptor number ( N ¯ a 1 = 0.03 ) and 2) a slower transfer rate ( k ¯ E T 2 = 4.1 10 8 s - 1 ) with a higher acceptor number ( N ¯ a 2 = 0.18 ). We assign these distributions to the indirect and direct electron transfer mechanisms, respectively. Our findings demonstrate how spectroscopic imaging can uncover fundamental electron transfer mechanisms at complex interfaces, offering valuable design principles for future nano–bio hybrids.},

  abstract     = {Bacterial motility in spatially structured environments impacts a variety of natural and engineering processes. Constructing models to predict, control, and design bacterial motility for these processes remains challenging because bacteria and active swimmers have complex interactions with surfaces and because the precise environment geometry is unknown. Here, we present a method for deriving bacterial diffusion coefficients in disordered media in terms of cell and environmental parameters. The approach abstracts the dynamics in the full geometry to “surface states,” which encode how cells interact with surfaces in the environment. Then, a long-time diffusion equation can be derived analytically from the state model. Applying this method to a run-and-tumble particle in a 2D Lorentz gas environment provides analytical predictions that show good agreement with particle simulations. Like past studies, we observe that the diffusivity depends nonmonotonically on the cell’s run length. Using the analytical expressions, we derive the optimal run length, revealing an intuitive dependence on environmental length scales. Furthermore, we find that rescaling length and time by the average distance and time between trap events collapses all of the diffusivities onto a single curve, which we derive analytically. Thus, our approach extracts interpretable, macroscopic diffusive behavior from complex microscopic dynamics, and provides tools and intuitions for understanding bacterial diffusion in disordered media.},

  abstract     = {The high resource intensity of industrial beef in high-income economies has prompted growing interest in alternative, potentially lower environmental impact beef production pathways. Of those, grass feeding is promoted by some as one such alternative, but rigorous quantification of this claim is required. Motivated to bridge this knowledge gap, we integrate empirical evidence with a model based on authoritative equations governing beef cattle performance to quantify the greenhouse gas emissions of producing grass-fed beef. Because geographical specificity and dependence on agricultural intensity are key, we model widely varied herds, from extensive operations on semiarid, marginal rangelands to partially industrial, intensive ones in lusher, more accommodating settings. We find that emissions per kg protein of even the most efficient grass-fed beef are 10 to 25% higher than those of industrial US beef and 3- to over 40-fold higher than a wide range of plant and animal alternatives. Soil sequestration enhancement by rangeland grazing reduces these emissions from 280–390 to 180–290 kg CO 2eq (kg protein) −1 , still somewhat above industrial beef’s 180 to 220 kg CO 2eq (kg protein) −1 , and well above nonbeef alternatives’ 10 to 70 kg CO 2eq (kg protein) −1 . These differences prove robust across a broad set of combinations of grass-fed beef operation types, management practices, and ration qualities. Consequently, even with maximal credit for putative sequestration enhancement, grass-fed beef is still no less carbon intensive than industrial beef, and severalfold more intensive than nonbeef alternatives.},

  abstract     = {Conventional computational models of climate adaptation frameworks inadequately consider decision-makers’ capacity to learn, update, and improve decisions. Here, we investigate the potential of reinforcement learning (RL), a machine learning technique that efficaciously acquires knowledge from the environment and systematically optimizes dynamic decisions, in modeling and informing adaptive climate decision-making. We consider coastal flood risk mitigations for Manhattan, New York City, USA (NYC), illustrating the benefit of continuously incorporating observations of sea-level rise into systematic designs of adaptive strategies. We find that when designing adaptive seawalls to protect NYC, the RL-derived strategy significantly reduces the expected net cost by 6 to 36% under the moderate emissions scenario SSP2-4.5 (9 to 77% under the high emissions scenario SSP5-8.5), compared to conventional methods. When considering multiple adaptive policies, including accomodation and retreat as well as protection, the RL approach leads to a further 5% (15%) cost reduction, showing RL’s flexibility in coordinatively addressing complex policy design problems. RL also outperforms conventional methods in controlling tail risk (i.e., low probability, high impact outcomes) and in avoiding losses induced by misinformation about the climate state (e.g., deep uncertainty), demonstrating the importance of systematic learning and updating in addressing extremes and uncertainties related to climate adaptation.},

This activation, critical to wound healing and procedures such as skin grafting, increases with mechanical stimulus for cells cultured in two-dimensional but is highly variable in cells in three-dimensional (3D) tissue. Here, we show that static mechanical stretch of cells in 3D tissues can either increase or decrease fibroblast activation depending upon recursive cell–extracellular matrix (ECM) feedback and demonstrate control of this activation through integrated in vitro and mathematical models. ECM viscoelasticity, signaling dynamics, and cell mechanics combine to yield a predictable, but nonmonotonic, relationship between mechanical stretch and long-term cell activation. Results demonstrate that feedback between cells and ECM determine how cells retain memory of mechanical stretch and have direct implications for improving outcomes in skin grafting procedures.},

  abstract     = {Founder-event speciation can occur when one or more organisms colonize a distant, unoccupied area via long-distance dispersal, leading to the evolution of a new species lineage. Species radiations established by long-distance, and especially transoceanic, dispersal can cause substantial shifts in regional biodiversity. Here, we investigate the occurrence and timing of the greatest known long-distance oceanic dispersal event in the history of terrestrial vertebrates—the rafting of iguanas from North America to Fiji. Iguanas are large-bodied herbivores that are well-known overwater dispersers, including species that colonized the Caribbean and the Galápagos islands. However, the origin of Fijian iguanas had not been comprehensively tested. We estimated the phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary timescale of the iguanid lizard radiation using genome-wide exons and ultraconserved elements (UCEs). Those data indicate that the closest living relative of extant Fijian iguanas is the North American desert iguana and that the two taxa likely diverged during the late Paleogene near or after the onset of volcanism that produced the Fijian archipelago. Biogeographic models estimate North America as the most probable ancestral range of Fijian iguanas. Our analyses support the hypothesis that iguanas reached Fiji via an extraordinary oceanic dispersal event from western North America, and which spanned a fifth of the earth’s circumference (&gt;8,000 km). Overwater rafting of iguanas from North America to Fiji strengthens the importance of founder-event speciation in the diversification of iguanids and elucidates the scope of long-distance dispersal across terrestrial vertebrates.},

  abstract     = {What constitutes a language? Natural languages share features with other domains: from math, to music, to gesture. However, the brain mechanisms that process linguistic input are highly specialized, showing little response to diverse nonlinguistic tasks. Here, we examine constructed languages (conlangs) to ask whether they draw on the same neural mechanisms as natural languages or whether they instead pattern with domains like math and programming languages. Using individual-subject fMRI analyses, we show that understanding conlangs recruits the same brain areas as natural language comprehension. This result holds for Esperanto (n = 19 speakers) and four fictional conlangs [Klingon (n = 10), Na’vi (n = 9), High Valyrian (n = 3), and Dothraki (n = 3)]. These findings suggest that conlangs and natural languages share critical features that allow them to draw on the same representations and computations, implemented in the left-lateralized network of brain areas. The features of conlangs that differentiate them from natural languages—including recent creation by a single individual, often for an esoteric purpose, the small number of speakers, and the fact that these languages are typically learned in adulthood—appear to not be consequential for the reliance on the same cognitive and neural mechanisms. We argue that the critical shared feature of conlangs and natural languages is that they are symbolic systems capable of expressing an open-ended range of meanings about our outer and inner worlds.},

  abstract     = {The cytoskeleton is crucial for cell organization and movement. In Eukaryotes, it largely consists of the protein actin, that forms a double-stranded linear filamentous structure in the presence of ATP and disassemble upon ATP hydrolysis. Bacteria also possess actin homologs, that drive fundamental cellular processes, including cell division, shape maintenance, and DNA segregation. Like eukaryotic actin, bacterial actins assemble into dynamic polymers upon ATP binding, however variation in interactions between strands gives rise to striking diversity of filament architectures. Here, we report a family of bacterial actins of unknown function, conserved among the Verrucomicrobiota phylum, which assembles into a unique tubular structure in the presence of ATP. A cryo-EM structure of the filaments reveals that it consists of three strands, unlike other described bacterial actin structures. This architecture provides further insights into the organization of actin-like filaments and has implications for understanding the diversity and evolution of the bacterial cytoskeleton.},

In primates, however, the dynamics of the DA signals remain unknown since conventional methods are not necessarily appropriate in terms of the spatiotemporal resolution or chemical specificity sufficient for detecting the DA signals. In our study, fiber photometry with a fluorescent DA sensor was employed to identify reward-related DA transients in the monkey striatum. This technique, which directly monitors local DA release, reveals a reward prediction error signal in the anterior putamen originating from midbrain DA neurons. Further, DA transients in the head of the caudate nucleus exhibit a value-based response to reward-predicting stimuli. These signals have been found to arise from two separate groups of DA neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. The present results demonstrate that fluorescence DA monitoring is applicable to detect DA signals in the primate striatum for investigating their roles.},

We characterize the elastic junction near the bonding and conceptualize it as a bending boundary layer. While the size of this junction decreases with the pulling force, we observe the surprising existence of the binding angle as a macroscopic signature of the bending stiffnesses. Our results thus challenge the standard assumption of neglecting bending stiffness of thin shells at large tensile loading. In addition, we show how the rotational response of the structure exhibits a nonlinear and universal behavior regardless of the ratio of asymmetry. Leveraging the independence of the binding angle to the pulling force, we finally introduce the λ -test—a visual measurement technique to characterize membranes through simple mechanical coupling.},

To date, only two small-molecule antagonist drugs targeting CXCR4, plerixafor (AMD3100) and mavorixafor (AMD070), have been approved. Here, we present the high-resolution structures of CXCR4 complexed with AMD3100 and AMD070, as well as a small-molecule antagonist HF51116 that has very different chemical structure and binding mechanism from AMD3100 and AMD070. The interactions between these antagonists and the receptor are analyzed in details, and the mechanisms of antagonism are elucidated. Both the major and minor subpockets on CXCR4 are found to be involved in binding of these small-molecule antagonists. The distinct conformations of Trp94 2.60 observed in these structures highlight the plasticity of the binding pocket on CXCR4, offering valuable insights into the exploration and refinement of therapeutic strategies targeting this chemokine receptor.},

Using high-dimensional CO-detection by indexing, a technology for spatial imaging, this study examines the cellular microenvironment of MS lesions in secondary progressive MS and primary progressive MS. We analyzed immune, glial, neuronal, and endothelial cell interactions within MS lesions and normal-appearing white matter across two independent cohorts. Our findings show the enrichment of EBV markers, particularly EBNA1 and LMP1, within MS lesions. EBV-positive cells interact closely with reactive astrocytes, microglia, and neurons. Image analysis confirmed the presence of EBV-positive staining within neurons and glial cells, suggesting a direct role for EBV in neuronal and glial involvement in MS. Additionally, we observed altered immune cell interactions, including reduced associations with macrophages and memory T cells, and enhanced interactions with glial cells. Disruptions in blood–brain barrier integrity were also noted in regions of the MS brain. These results highlight EBV’s contribution to immune modulation, glial dysfunction, and neuronal damage in MS, particularly in progressive subtypes. The analysis of MS brain tissue suggests potential therapeutic targets, including antivirals and brain penetrant immune modulators, to address EBV’s impact on MS progression.},

  abstract     = {The transthyretin (TTR) tetramer, assembled as a dimer of dimers, transports thyroxine and retinol binding protein in blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. Aggregation of wild type (WT) or pathogenic variant TTR leads to transthyretin amyloidosis, which is associated with neurodegenerative and cardiac disease. The trigger for TTR aggregation under physiological conditions is unknown. The tetramer is extremely stable at neutral pH, but aggregation via tetramer dissociation and monomer misfolding can be induced in vitro by lowering the pH. To elucidate factors that may cause TTR aggregation at neutral pH, we examined the effect of shear forces such as those that arise from fluid flow in the vascular system. Fluid shear forces were generated by rapidly stirring TTR solutions in conical microcentrifuge tubes. Under agitation, TTR formed β-rich aggregates and fibrils at a rate that was dependent upon protein concentration. The lag time before the onset of agitation-induced aggregation increases as the total TTR concentration is increased, consistent with a mechanism in which the tetramer first dissociates to form monomer that either partially unfolds to enter the aggregation pathway or reassociates to form tetramer. NMR spectra recorded at various time points during the lag phase revealed growth of an aggregation-prone intermediate trapped as a dynamically perturbed tetramer. Enhanced conformational fluctuations in the weak dimer–dimer interface suggest loosening of critical intersubunit contacts which likely destabilizes the agitated tetramer and predisposes it toward dissociation. These studies provide insights into the mechanism of aggregation of WT human TTR under near-physiological conditions.},

  abstract     = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), which is linked to Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection, preceding the disease. The molecular mechanisms underlying this connection are only partially understood. We previously described molecular mimicry between the EBV transcription factor EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) and three human CNS proteins: anoctamin-2 (ANO2), alpha-B crystallin (CRYAB), and glial cellular adhesion molecule (GlialCAM). Here, we investigated antibody responses against EBNA1 and GlialCAM in a large cohort of 650 MS patients and 661 matched population controls and compared them to responses against CRYAB and ANO2. We confirmed that elevated IgG responses against EBNA1 and all three CNS-mimic antigens associate with increased MS risk. Blocking experiments confirmed the presence of cross-reactive antibodies and molecular mimicry between EBNA1 and GlialCAM, and accompanying antibody responses against adjacent peptide regions of GlialCAM suggest epitope spreading. Antibody responses against EBNA1, GlialCAM, CRYAB, and ANO2 are elevated in MS patients carrying the main risk allele HLA-DRB1*15:01, and combinations of HLA-DRB1*15:01 with anti-EBNA1 and anti-GlialCAM antibodies increase MS risk significantly and in an additive fashion. In addition, antibody reactivities against more than one EBNA1 peptide and more than one CNS-mimic increase the MS risk significantly but modestly. Overall, we show that molecular mimicry between EBNA1 and GlialCAM is likely an important molecular mechanism contributing to MS pathology.},

With the growth of computing power and expansion of private sector data about the population, the Census Bureau has valid concerns about confidentiality threats to public data. The current plan for fully synthetic data, however, threatens a cornerstone of the nation’s scientific infrastructure. Census microdata samples are among the most frequently used sources in social science research, and they are an essential tool for policy formation and planning from the local to the national level. Synthetic census microdata are not suitable for most research and policy applications. There have been no recent attempts to quantify disclosure risk in the ACS microdata, and the sole existing study failed to establish a credible threat for positive identification of ACS respondents by external intruders. I argue that we need new empirical research to pinpoint specific vulnerabilities that could allow an intruder to determine a particular individual’s confidential census responses. If significant vulnerabilities are uncovered, the Census Bureau in partnership with the research community should develop targeted methods for disclosure risk reduction that minimize damage to data usability.},

  abstract     = {Variability in predator–prey interactions can modulate population dynamics with impacts scalable to entire ecosystems. As notorious corallivores, crown-of-thorns sea stars (CoTS; Acanthaster spp.) have caused extensive losses of coral habitat during unexplained population outbreaks across the Indo-Pacific. While predation of adult CoTS may help to suppress their outbreaks, it does not sufficiently explain their profound boom-bust dynamics and so remains equivocal. Factors influencing early postsettlement mortality are generally more impactful on population size, thus lower trophic interactions involving juvenile CoTS may better contribute to outbreak prevention. We evaluated the impact of key predatory decapods that interact with juvenile CoTS in their coral rubble nursery before they emerge as destructive corallivores. Decapod density was influenced by habitat complexity and varied regionally, inverse to spatial trends in CoTS outbreaks on the Great Barrier Reef. Using eDNA gut content analysis, we confirmed seven species (~12% of individuals) of wild-caught decapod, collected from two reefs separated by &gt;1,000 km, as CoTS predators. Owing to spatial variation in predator abundance and community structure, we estimated potential (previous aquarium experiments) and realized (eDNA results here) rates of CoTS consumption were ~3-fold and ~1.6-fold lower, respectively, in outbreak hotspots. Through combination of field and molecular techniques, we demonstrated the appreciable impact of cryptic predators on early population success of this nuisance species, which expands our knowledge of CoTS outbreaks, pest species management, and reef conservation. Resolving predator–prey interactions at lower levels of the ecosystem can be crucial to understanding broader ecological outcomes.},

  abstract     = {The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a chloride channel whose dysfunction leads to intracellular accumulation of chloride ions, dehydration of cell surfaces, and subsequent damage to airway and ductal organs. Beyond its function as a chloride channel, interactions between CFTR, epithelium sodium channel, and solute carrier (SLC) transporter family membrane proteins and cytoplasmic proteins, including calmodulin and Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor-1 (NHERF-1), coregulate ion homeostasis. CFTR has also been observed to form mesoscale membrane clusters. However, the contributions of multivalent protein and lipid interactions to cluster formation are not well understood. Using a combination of computational modeling and biochemical reconstitution assays, we demonstrate that multivalent interactions with CFTR protein binding partners, calcium, and membrane cholesterol can induce mesoscale CFTR cluster formation on model membranes. Phosphorylation of the intracellular domains of CFTR also promotes mesoscale cluster formation in the absence of calcium, indicating that multiple mechanisms can contribute to CFTR cluster formation. Our findings reveal that coupling of multivalent protein and lipid interactions promotes CFTR cluster formation consistent with membrane-associated biological phase separation.},

  abstract     = {To ensure optimal replication and spread, viruses have evolved countermeasures to evade type 1 IFN-mediated antiviral activity. During the early viral replication cycle steps until uncoating, the HIV-1 core protects viral pathogen associated molecular patterns (viral RNA and reverse transcription products) from recognition by innate immune sensors, including cGAS. However, after capsid uncoating, unintegrated viral DNA (uvDNA) becomes accessible. Here, we show that HIV-1 uses chromatin-mediated cGAS inactivation as a mechanism to protect its uvDNA from innate immune activation.},

  abstract     = {For decades, microtubules—composed of αβ-tubulin dimers—have been primary targets for cancer chemotherapy. While eight binding sites on the tubulin dimer have been structurally characterized, this study reveals a ninth. We found that the tubulin inhibitor Tumabulin-1 (TM1, a BML284 derivative) binds simultaneously to the well-known colchicine site and a previously unknown site, designated as Tumabulin site. This site resides at the interface of α1-tubulin, β1-tubulin, and RB3 within the tubulin–RB3–tubulintyrosine ligase complex. Remarkably, two TM1 molecules bind cooperatively to this relatively large pocket, interacting with all three proteins. Crucially, this binding is dependent on RB3; it is absent when RB3 is missing or the key residue H71 is mutated (H71Q). We further designed and synthesized Tumabulin-2 (TM2) that selectively binds the Tumabulin site, excluding binding the colchicine site. TM2 acts as a molecular glue, strengthening the interaction between RB3 and the tubulin dimer and consequently enhancing RB3’s tubulin-depolymerizing activity. In conclusion, our findings confirm the existence of a ninth tubulin-binding site and offer a promising foundation for developing Tubulin–RB3 molecular glues as a next generation of anticancer therapeutics.},

  abstract     = {Understanding how ecosystems respond to ubiquitous microplastic (MP) pollution is crucial for ensuring global food security. Here, we conduct a multiecosystem meta-analysis of 3,286 data points and reveal that MP exposure leads to a global reduction in photosynthesis of 7.05 to 12.12% in terrestrial plants, marine algae, and freshwater algae. These reductions align with those estimated by a constructed machine learning model using current MP pollution levels, showing that MP exposure reduces the chlorophyll content of photoautotrophs by 10.96 to 12.84%. Model estimates based on the identified MP-photosynthesis nexus indicate annual global losses of 4.11 to 13.52% (109.73 to 360.87 MT·y −1 ) for main crops and 0.31 to 7.24% (147.52 to 3415.11 MT C·y −1 ) for global aquatic net primary productivity induced by MPs. Under scenarios of efficient plastic mitigation, e.g., a ~13% global reduction in environmental MP levels, the MP-induced photosynthesis losses are estimated to decrease by ~30%, avoiding a global loss of 22.15 to 115.73 MT·y −1 in main crop production and 0.32 to 7.39 MT·y −1 in seafood production. These findings underscore the urgency of integrating plastic mitigation into global hunger and sustainability initiatives.},

Here, we describe a generalizable selection method to enrich for GPCR ligands from a synthetic camelid antibody fragment (nanobody) library. Our strategy yielded multiple nanobody ligands for the angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R), a prototypical GPCR and important drug target. We found that nanobodies readily act as allosteric modulators, encoding selectivity for both the receptor and chemical features of GPCR ligands. We then used structure-guided design to convert two nanobodies from allosteric ligands to competitive AT1R inhibitors through simple mutations. This work demonstrates that nanobodies can encode multiple pharmacological behaviors and have great potential as evolvable scaffolds for the development of next-generation GPCR therapeutics.},

Consistent reductions in primary production were observed under acidified conditions in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre and the northern South China Sea, whereas no significant changes were found at the northern boundary of the subtropical gyre. While prokaryotic phytoplankton showed little or positive responses to high CO 2 , small (&lt;20 µm) eukaryotic phytoplankton which are primarily limited by low ambient nitrogen drove the observed decrease in community primary production. Extrapolating these results to global tropical and subtropical oceans predicts a potential decrease of about 5 Pg C y −1 in primary production in low Chl- a oligotrophic regions, which are anticipated to experience both acidification and stratification in the future.},

Contrary to the rapid lethality caused by SOS1 genetic ablation in SOS2 KO mice, SOS1 pharmacological inhibition by its specific inhibitor BI-3406 did not significantly affect animal weight/viability nor cause noteworthy systemic toxicity. Allograft assays using different KRAS mut cell lines showed that treatment with BI-3406 impaired RAS activation and RAS downstream signaling and decreased tumor burden and disease progression as a result of both tumor-intrinsic and -extrinsic therapeutic effects of the drug. Consistent with prior genetic evidence and the KRAS mut allografts assays in immunocompromised mice, our analyses using an in vivo model of KRAS G12D -driven lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) in immunocompetent mice showed that single, systemic BI-3406 treatment impaired tumor growth and downmodulated protumorigenic components of the tumor microenvironment comparably to SOS1 genetic ablation or to treatment with the specific KRAS G12D inhibitor MRTX1133. Furthermore, markedly stronger, synergistic antitumor effects were observed upon concomitant treatment with BI-3406 and MRTX1133 in the same in vivo LUAD mouse model. Our data confirm SOS1 as an actionable therapy target in RAS-dependent cancers and suggest that BI-3406 treatment may yield clinical benefit both as monotherapy or as a potential combination partner for multiple RAS-targeting strategies.},

  abstract     = {Transgenic crops that produce insecticidal toxins derived from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) are grown worldwide to manage insect pests. Western corn rootworm is a serious pest of maize in the United States and is managed with Bt maize. In the United States, the commercial cultivation of a Bt crop requires an accompanying resistance-management strategy to delay the evolution of Bt resistance. One of the primary resistance-management strategies consists of non-Bt refuges along with a Bt crop that produces two Bt toxins (i.e., a pyramid) that kill the same pest species. This approach delays resistance because individuals with resistance to one toxin are killed by the second. However, if a pest species is resistant to one toxin in a pyramid, the effectiveness of a pyramid to delay resistance is compromised, potentially leading to the evolution of resistance to both toxins. Here, we apply a meta-analysis to demonstrate the sequential evolution of resistance by western corn rootworm to Bt maize producing Cry3Bb1 followed by resistance to Gpp34/Tpp35Ab1 maize, with resistance to each Bt toxin increasing in a linear manner over time. Additionally, we show that Bt-resistant western corn rootworm imposed substantial feeding injury, in the field, to maize containing a pyramid of Gpp34/Tpp35Ab1 and Cry3Bb1. To minimize the risk of sequential evolution of resistance to multiple transgenic traits, an emphasis should be placed on developing transgenic pyramids not compromised by prior resistance, and in cases where resistance is already present, larger non-Bt refuges and more diversified pest-management approaches should be applied.},

However, the molecular mechanism by which NBS1 mutations cause clinical phenotypes of NBS, such as craniofacial dysmorphism, is still unclear. Here, we show that NBS1 localizes at the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) loci in nucleoli and interacts with ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription machinery including RNA polymerase I (Pol I) and TCOF1. Loss of NBS1 impairs Pol I-dependent transcription of pre-rRNA and induces nucleolar stress. In particular, lacking Nbs1 in mouse neural crest cells not only leads to the reduction of ribosome biogenesis but also craniofacial abnormalities during prenatal development. Moreover, the C-terminus of NBS1 is associated with pre-rRNA and a number of pre-rRNA processing factors, which may also facilitate pre-rRNA maturation. Taken together, our study reveals the functions of NBS1 in rRNA biogenesis.},

In situ control and manipulation to achieve diversity in emulsion droplets for emerging applications is challenging. In a liquid crystal-based emulsion, the surface anchoring of the molecules at the isotropic fluid-liquid crystal interface introduces elastic distortions that result in anisotropic interparticle interactions, similar to electrostatic interactions between multipoles, which also lends a naming analogy as elastic dipoles, quadrupoles, and higher. However, controlling the anchoring condition at the interface at will is rarely achieved. Here, we present an emulsion system in which silicone oil droplets in a nematic liquid crystal spontaneously induce conic surface anchoring, forming elastic hexadecapoles without any surfactant. The conic degenerate surface anchoring shows continuous reversible anchoring transition to tangential and homeotropic below and above the ambient temperature, respectively. We introduce a physical design principle and in situ control to achieve three-phase compound droplets with diverse morphologies and topologies by fusing elastic hexadecapoles of oil droplets with elastic dipoles of glycerol droplets. The surrounding director field and the resulting defect structure of the compound droplets are analyzed by numerical simulations. Our approach to forming compound droplets will allow the on-demand design of building blocks for engineered emulsions for reconfigurable composite materials.},

Although populations of big trees are concentrated along the west coast, populations of medium trees are more evenly distributed across the nation. In the western United States, trees &gt;50 cm DBH comprise ~75% of the total carbon stored in live trees, while in the eastern United States they comprise ~20%. Plot remeasurement data indicate that populations of big trees are increasing at an annual rate of 0.49% in the west and 2.9% in the east, and populations of medium trees are increasing at an annual rate of 0.5% in the west and 2.4% in the east. One exception is the Sierra Nevada region, where big trees are declining. Additionally, we observed declines for several individual species. While the overall population trend for large-diameter trees is positive, declines in these species could have localized impacts for the environments in which they occur.},

The human endometrium is receptive to a blastocyst for a brief period, the window of implantation. Critical knowledge underpinning biological processes leading to RIF, essential for effective treatment, is lacking. We employed spatial transcriptomics to define region- and cell-type-specific differences in endometrial gene expression in luteinizing hormone timed biopsies between women with RIF (n = 8) and fertile controls (FC) (n = 8). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified when comparing endometrial regions between FC and RIF (685 luminal epithelium, 293 glandular epithelium, 419 subluminal stroma, 264 functionalis stroma, 1,125 subluminal stromal CD45 + leukocytes, and 1,049 functionalis stromal CD56 + leukocytes). Only 57 DEGs were common to all subregions and cell types, which highlights that multiple DEGs are lost when the endometrium is examined as a single entity. When RIF-specific DEGs were leveraged against knowledge from mouse genetic models, genes associated with aberrant embryo implantation phenotypes were observed, mostly in immune cell populations. Dysregulated pathways in specific endometrial regions included the “WNT signaling pathway,” altered in the functionalis and subluminal stroma. “Response to estradiol” and “ovulation cycle” pathways were dysregulated in the subluminal stroma. In silico drug screening identified potential compounds that can reverse the RIF gene expression profile (e.g., raloxifene, bisoprolol). Our findings, in a well-characterized cohort, highly endorse consideration of each endometrial region and cell type as separate entities. Ignoring individual regions and composite cell populations will overlook important aberrations, forego potential treatment targets, and lead to research waste pursuing clinically irrelevant treatment options.},

  abstract     = {Adults tend to view men (more so than women) as default people , with numerous real-world consequences for gender equity. In the United States, the tendency to center men in concepts of people develops across middle childhood, yet the specific mechanisms that contribute to it remain unknown. Here, we investigate one subtle but potentially powerful social mechanism: the category labels that parents use to describe boys/men and girls/women in conversations with their children. Across two studies ( N = 822 parent–child dyads, predominantly from the United States), parents used gender-neutral labels like “kid” or “person” more often to describe boys/men than girls/women and, conversely, used gender-specific labels (e.g., “girl”) more often to describe girls/women than boys/men. These patterns emerged when parents were shown gender-stereotypical girls/women and boys/men (e.g., a girl painting her nails, a boy digging for worms); when parents viewed counterstereotypical stimuli (e.g., a boy painting his nails, a girl digging for worms), the patterns reversed. Our findings illuminate parents’ category label usage as a critical social mechanism that may undergird the development of a male default in a US cultural context, informing efforts to intervene on this process.},

  abstract     = {Rapid and accurate detection of DNA from disease-causing pathogens is essential for controlling the spread of infections and administering timely treatments. While traditional molecular diagnostics techniques like PCR are highly sensitive, they include nucleic acid amplification and many need to be performed in centralized laboratories, limiting their utility in point-of-care settings. Recent advances in CRISPR-based diagnostics (CRISPR-Dx) have demonstrated the potential for highly specific molecular detection, but the sensitivity is often constrained by the slow trans-cleavage activity of Cas enzymes, necessitating preamplification of target nucleic acids. In this study, we present a CRISPR-Cascade assay that overcomes these limitations by integrating a positive feedback loop that enables nucleic acid amplification-free detection of pathogenic DNA at atto-molar levels and achieves a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 1.3 within just 10 min. The versatility of the assay is demonstrated through the detection of bloodstream infection pathogens, including Methicillin-Sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli , and Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) spiked in whole blood samples. Additionally, we introduce a multiplexing OR-function logic gate, further enhancing the potential of the CRISPR-Cascade assay for rapid and accurate diagnostics in clinical settings. Our findings highlight the ability of the CRISPR-Cascade assay to provide highly sensitive and specific molecular detection, paving the way for advanced applications in point-of-care diagnostics and beyond.},

  abstract     = {Chronic infections with hepatitis E virus (HEV), especially those of genotype 3 (G3), frequently lead to liver fibrosis and cirrhosis in patients. However, the causation and mechanism of liver fibrosis triggered by chronic HEV infection remain poorly understood. Here, we found that the viral multiple-domain replicase (ORF1) undergoes unique ubiquitin–proteasomal processing leading to formation of the H EV- D erived S MAD A ctivator (HDSA), a viral polypeptide lacking putative helicase and RNA polymerase domains. The HDSA is stable, non-HSP90-bound, localizes to the nucleus, and is abundant in G3 HEV-infected hepatocytes of various origins. Markedly, the HDSA in hepatocytes potentiates the fibrogenic TGF-β/SMAD pathway by forming compact complexes with SMAD3 to facilitate its promoter binding and coactivator recruitment, leading to significant fibrosis in HEV-susceptible gerbils. Virus infection–induced liver fibrosis in HEV-susceptible gerbils could be prevented by mutating the residues P989C, A990C, and A991C (PAA-3C) within ORF1, which are required for proteasomal processing. Thus, we have identified a viral protein derived from host proteasomal processing, defined its notable role in liver fibrosis and highlighted the nature of an unanticipated host–HEV interaction that facilitates hepatitis E pathogenesis.},

  abstract     = {Nonlinear plasma physics problems are usually simulated through comprehensive modeling of phase space. The extreme computational cost of such simulations has motivated the development of multi-moment fluid models. However, a major challenge has been finding a suitable fluid closure for these fluid models. Recent developments in physics-informed machine learning have led to a renewed interest in constructing accurate fluid closure terms. In this study, we take an approach that integrates kinetic physics from the first-principles Vlasov simulations into a fluid model (through the heat flux closure term) using the Fourier neural operator—a neural network architecture. Without resolving the phase space dynamics, this new fluid model is capable of capturing the nonlinear evolution of the Landau damping process that exactly matches the Vlasov simulation results. This machine learning–assisted new approach provides a computationally affordable framework that surpasses previous fluid models in accurately modeling the kinetic evolution of complex plasma systems.},

  abstract     = {The importance of macrophages in kidney diseases has been well established; however, the mechanisms underlying the infiltration of macrophages into injured kidneys are not well understood. RGMb is a member of the repulsive guidance molecule (RGM) family. RGMb can be expressed on the cell surface but a large portion of RGMb is localized intracellularly. Among various immune cell types, macrophages express the highest levels of RGMb, but the biological functions of RGMb in macrophages remain largely unknown. We find that RGMb promoted macrophage migration in vitro and that in vivo, RGMb enhanced infiltration of macrophages into injured kidneys and aggravated kidney inflammation and injury in mice. Mechanistically, RGMb bound to TAB1 inside the cell and facilitated the interaction between TRAF6 ubiquitin ligase and TAB1, thereby promoting TRAF6-mediated K63-linked polyubiquitination and phosphorylation of TAK1, followed by increased αTAT1 phosphorylation and α-tubulin acetylation. The resulting changes in the cytoskeleton promoted macrophage migration in vitro and in vivo. Deletion of Rgmb in macrophages markedly reduced TAK1 phosphorylation, αTAT1 phosphorylation, and α-tubulin acetylation and attenuated macrophage infiltration, renal inflammation, tubular injury, and interstitial fibrosis during kidney injury. Our results suggest that macrophage RGMb promotes kidney disease by increasing macrophage infiltration via the TRAF6-TAB1-TAK1/αTAT1/α-tubulin cascade.},

  abstract     = {Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by synovial inflammation, pannus formation, and progressive joint destruction. The inflammatory milieu in RA drives endothelial cell activation and upregulation of adhesion molecules, thus facilitating leukocyte infiltration into the synovium. Reelin, a circulating glycoprotein previously implicated in endothelial activation and leukocyte recruitment in diseases such as atherosclerosis and multiple sclerosis, has emerged as a potential upstream regulator of these processes. However, its role in RA pathogenesis remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that Reelin levels are markedly elevated in the plasma of both RA patients and mouse models of arthritis, with higher concentrations correlating with greater disease severity. Genetic deletion of the Reelin receptor Apoer2 conferred significant protection against serum transfer arthritis (STA), underscoring the relevance of this pathway in disease progression. Furthermore, therapeutic inhibition of Reelin using the CR-50 antibody yielded robust anti-inflammatory effects in multiple preclinical arthritis models, including STA, K/BxN, and collagen-induced arthritis. Notably, CR-50 treatment not only reduced leukocyte infiltration and synovial inflammation but also mitigated pannus formation. Importantly, these benefits were achieved without the gastrointestinal side effects commonly associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like diclofenac. Our findings position Reelin as a proinflammatory endothelial biomarker and therapeutic target in RA. By modulating endothelial activation and leukocyte recruitment, anti-Reelin strategies offer an alternative approach to attenuate synovial inflammation and joint damage. These results provide a compelling rationale for further exploration of Reelin-targeted therapies as alternatives to conventional immunosuppressive treatments in RA and other chronic inflammatory diseases.},

Traditional approaches combining conventional immune checkpoint inhibitors with neoantigen vaccines have shown some promise in treating PDAC but are often compromised by intratumoral T lymphocyte exhaustion and systemic toxicity. Hence, novel approaches are needed to address these challenges. Herein, we demonstrate that mRNA polymeric nanoparticles encoding anti-PD-1 antibodies in situ at the tumor site enhance the therapeutic efficacy of neoantigen-based mRNA vaccine for PDAC. This mRNA-based, in situ anti-PD-1 antibody production strategy also protects tumor-infiltrating T cells from PD-1 inhibition, potentially reducing the toxicities induced by systemic checkpoint inhibition. Our study may provide an innovative dual mRNA nanoparticle strategy for effective tumor neoantigen immunotherapy, as well as an mRNA cancer combination therapy strategy with other clinically approved drugs (e.g., β-elemene).},

Glaucoma is comorbid with other neurodegenerative diseases, but how it might impact the environment of the full central nervous system to increase neurodegenerative vulnerability is unknown. Two neurodegenerative events occur early in the optic nerve, the structural link between the retina and brain: loss of anterograde transport in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons and early alterations in astrocyte structure and function. Here, we used whole-mount tissue clearing of full mouse brains to image RGC anterograde transport function and astrocyte responses across retinorecipient regions early in a unilateral microbead occlusion model of glaucoma. Using light sheet imaging, we found that RGC projections terminating specifically in the accessory optic tract are the first to lose transport function. Although degeneration was induced in one retina, astrocytes in both brain hemispheres responded to transport loss in a retinotopic pattern that mirrored the degenerating RGCs. A subpopulation of these astrocytes in contact with large descending blood vessels were immunopositive for LCN2, a marker associated with astrocyte reactivity. Together, these data suggest that even early stages of unilateral glaucoma have broad impacts on the health of astrocytes across both hemispheres of the brain, implying a glial mechanism behind neurodegenerative comorbidity in glaucoma.},

  abstract     = {Mixed-species plantations are increasingly recognized for their potential to maintain forest biodiversity and soil health; however, a comprehensive assessment of their global effectiveness is lacking. To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted a meta-analysis of 7,045 paired observations between mixed-species and monoculture plantations, derived from 311 studies across diverse forest ecosystems worldwide. Our results show that mixed-species plantations significantly increased understory plant biomass, cover, and species richness by 32.6%, 55.4%, and 32.2%, respectively, compared to monocultures. Furthermore, the Shannon and Pielou diversity indices increased by 28.2% and 8.6%, respectively, and the Simpson index increased by 9.6%. When understory shrub and herbaceous species were considered separately, species mixing had significantly positive effects on shrub diversity but had no effect on herbaceous diversity. Moreover, mixed-species plantations markedly improved soil physical and chemical properties compared to monocultures. These improvements include increases in soil nutrient content (9.6 to 17.8%) and nutrient availability (14.7 to 33.5%), soil microbial biomass (17.2 to 28.8%), and soil carbon sequestration (7.2 to 19.9%). These enhancements were particularly pronounced in plantations that included legumes. Our findings reveal that the benefits of species mixing are influenced by climatic conditions, geographic location, and stand age, with the most substantial effects observed in temperate regions and mature stands.

  abstract     = {CRISPR-Cas9 systems have revolutionized biotechnology, creating diverse new opportunities for biomedical research and therapeutic genome and epigenome editing. Despite the abundance of bacterial CRISPR-Cas9 systems, relatively few are effective in human cells, limiting the overall potential of CRISPR technology. To expand the CRISPR-Cas toolbox, we characterized a set of type II CRISPR-Cas9 systems from select bacterial genera and species encoding diverse Cas9s. Four systems demonstrated robust and specific gene repression in human cells when used as nuclease-null dCas9s fused with a KRAB domain and were also highly active nucleases in human cells. These systems have distinct protospacer adjacent motifs (PAMs), including AT-rich motifs and sgRNA features orthogonal to the commonly used Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9s. Additionally, we assessed gene activation when fused with the p300 catalytic domain. Notably, S. uberis Cas9 performed competitively against benchmarks with promising repression, activation, nuclease, and base editing activity. This study expands the CRISPR-Cas9 repertoire, enabling effective genome and epigenome editing for diverse applications.},

  abstract     = {Restriction factors are dominant proteins that target different essential steps of the viral life cycle; thus, these proteins provide an early line of defense against viruses. Here, we found that the internalization of DR5, an important receptor of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, initiates apoptosis to inhibit Kaposi sarcoma–associated herpesvirus (KSHV) lytic replication. An evolutionary analysis of the DR5 sequence demonstrated that three amino acids underwent positive selection in primates. Notably, one of these positive selection sites, A62, is essential for the antiviral function of DR5 and is important for the binding of DR5 to its ligand, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand. Moreover, DR5 exhibits broad antiviral activity against and inhibits various herpesviruses, including Epstein–Barr virus, herpes simplex virus type 1, and herpes simplex virus type 2. As a countermeasure, the KSHV K5 protein interacts with DR5 and promotes DR5 degradation through the lysosomal and proteasomal degradation pathways; lysine 245 of DR5 is essential for K5-induced DR5 degradation. These findings demonstrate that DR5 is a restriction factor for human herpesviruses.},

Trimethylation of histone H3 at Lys27 (H3K27me3) plays a crucial role in governing gene expression and controlling the response of plants to environmental changes. However, how dynamic H3K27me3 mediates plant response to R light is poorly understood. Here, we report that RELATIVE OF EARLY FLOWERING 6 (REF6), an H3K27me3 demethylase, promotes hypocotyl elongation under R light in Arabidopsis . Upon exposure to R light, REF6 preferentially interacts with the active Pfr form of phyB. Consequently, phyB enhances REF6 accumulation and its binding ability, which are necessary for inducing cell-elongation-related genes from open chromatin, ensuring normal plant growth under prolonged light exposure. Moreover, REF6 acts together with the phyB-PIF4 module to mediate light regulation of hypocotyl growth. These findings provide insights into the understanding of how phytochromes, epigenetic factors, and transcription factors coordinately control plant growth in response to changing light environment.},

  abstract     = {Some viruses counter host-cell efforts to digest invading viral RNA by using special structures resistant to host RNases, known as exoribonuclease-resistant RNAs (xrRNAs). xrRNAs typically form an unusual fold with the 5′-end threaded through a ring consisting of a multihelix junction closed by a pseudoknot. By using single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS), we previously showed that a Zika virus xrRNA is extremely rigid mechanically, withstanding very high forces, and that this mechanical resistance—not simply the knot-like fold topology—is essential for RNase resistance. Here, we have determined which interactions are most important for generating mechanical rigidity in the Zika virus xrRNA, by systematically mutating tertiary contacts. We found that removing any of the tertiary contacts involving the threaded 5′ end was sufficient to abrogate mechanical resistance. In contrast, breaking a single pseudoknot base pair was not sufficient to do so: Two broken pairs were needed. This hierarchy of interaction importance for mechanical rigidity was supported by simulations mapping how mechanical tension was distributed within the xrRNA. For all mutants, RNase resistance varied in lock-step with mechanical resistance, confirming the primary role of mechanical rigidity in xrRNA function. This work reveals which interactions are most important for Zika xrRNA function, with implications for targeting the xrRNA therapeutically.},

Furthermore, high-quality satellite radiometer observations of the most recent solar cycle, 24, systematically differ from estimates that rely on TSI proxies for reasons that have been unclear. Using a Bayesian Kalman filtering approach to estimate TSI from both satellite-based observations and proxies gives two complementary explanations: recent satellite-based observations of TSI contain unaccounted-for positive linear drifts, and regression-based reconstructions are affected by commonly used solar magnetic proxies becoming less sensitive to TSI variations at low values. After accounting for satellite instrument drifts and reduced sensitivity, direct and proxy observations come into agreement and together indicate a linear trend in overall TSI of −0.15 W/m 2 per decade with a 95% CI of −0.17 to −0.13 W/m 2 per decade between 1980 and 2023.},

  abstract     = {A key feature of biological and artificial neural networks is the progressive refinement of their neural representations with experience. In neuroscience, this fact has inspired several recent studies in sensory and motor systems. However, less is known about how higher associational cortical areas, such as the hippocampus, modify representations throughout the learning of complex tasks. Here, we focus on associative learning, a process that requires forming a connection between the representations of different variables for appropriate behavioral response. We trained rats in a space-context associative task and monitored hippocampal neural activity throughout the entire learning period, over several days. This allowed us to assess changes in the representations of context, movement direction, and position, as well as their relationship to behavior. We identified a hierarchical representational structure in the encoding of these three task variables that was preserved throughout learning. Nevertheless, we also observed changes at the lower levels of the hierarchy where context was encoded. These changes were local in neural activity space and restricted to physical positions where context identification was necessary for correct decision-making, supporting better context decoding and contextual code compression. Our results demonstrate that the hippocampal code not only accommodates hierarchical relationships between different variables but also enables efficient learning through minimal changes in neural activity space. Beyond the hippocampus, our work reveals a representation learning mechanism that might be implemented in other biological and artificial networks performing similar tasks.},

However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this condition remain unclear. Transient receptor potential canonical 3 (TRPC3), a TRP channel that is activated by downstream of the Gq-phospholipase C (PLC) axis, is expressed in the somatosensory system. Therefore, the present study investigated its pathophysiological role in neuropathic pain following peripheral nerve injury. Here, partial sciatic nerve ligation (pSNL) elicited mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity in wild-type mice, which was suppressed in TRPC3-KO mice. In situ hybridization revealed that TRPC3 is predominantly expressed in neurons in the spinal dorsal horn. Furthermore, spinal dorsal horn neuron-specific downregulation using miRNA attenuated pSNL-induced mechanical hypersensitivity. Spinal TRPC3 activation elicited acute mechanical hypersensitivity. Moreover, its genetic ablation reduced the mechanical hypersensitivity caused by spinal NK 1 R or PLC activation. These findings demonstrate that TRPC3 in spinal dorsal horn neurons facilitates the development of neuropathic pain. Therefore, TRPC3 may be a promising therapeutic target for neuropathic pain caused by peripheral nerve injury.},

Here, we introduce an algorithm to systematically uncover these excitations up to the activation energy scale relevant to structural relaxation. We use it in a model system to measure the density of states on a scale never achieved before, confirming that this quantity shifts to higher energy under cooling, precisely as the activation energy does. Second, we show that the excitations’ energetic and spatial features allow one to predict with great accuracy the dynamic propensity, i.e., the location of future relaxation dynamics. Finally, we find that excitations have a primary field whose properties, including the displacement of the most mobile particle, scale as a power-law of their activation energy and are independent of temperature. Additionally, they exhibit an outer deformation field that depends on the material’s stability and, therefore, on temperature. We build a scaling description of these findings. Overall, our analysis supports that excitations play a crucial role in regulating relaxation dynamics near the glass transition, effectively suppressing the transition to dynamical arrest predicted by mean-field theories while also being strongly influenced by it.},

Considered unique to vertebrates, NCC are transiently generated within the dorsolateral region of the neural plate or neural tube during neurulation. Their delamination and migration are crucial for embryo development as NCC differentiation is influenced by their final resting locations. Previous work in avian and aquatic species revealed that NCC delaminate via an epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), which transforms these progenitor cells from static polarized epithelial cells into migratory mesenchymal cells with fluid front and back polarity. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms facilitating NCC delamination in mammals are poorly understood. Through time-lapse imaging of NCC delamination in mouse embryos, we identified a subset of cells that exit the neuroepithelium as isolated round cells, which then halt for a short period prior to acquiring the mesenchymal migratory morphology classically associated with delaminating NCC. High-magnification imaging and protein localization analyses of the cytoskeleton, together with measurements of pressure and tension of delaminating NCC and neighboring neuroepithelial cells, revealed that round NCC are extruded from the neuroepithelium prior to completion of EMT. Furthermore, cranial NCC are extruded through activation of the mechanosensitive ion channel, PIEZO1. Our results support a model in which cell density, pressure, and tension in the neuroepithelium result in activation of the live cell extrusion pathway and delamination of a subpopulation of NCC in parallel with EMT, which has implications for cell delamination in development and disease.},

  abstract     = {Pain independent of disease activity is frequently reported by rheumatoid arthritis patients and remains undertreated. Preclinical evidence suggests that imbalance of neuroimmune proresolving interactions within dorsal root ganglia (DRG) rather than at the site of inflammation plays mechanistic roles in persistent arthritis pain. Here, we inhibited production of proresolving lipid mediators by silencing 12/15-lipoxygenase expression in CX3CR1 + monocyte/macrophages conditional knockout (cKO) mice. In an arthritis model, hind paw mechanical hypersensitivity is exacerbated in male and female cKO mice in association with DRG infiltration of neutrophils, which migrate in response to leukotriene B 4 released by macrophages through 5-lipoxygenase conversion of arachidonic acid provided by neuron-derived vesicles. Neutrophils apoptosis promotes primary macrophage efferocytosis which is defective in cKO macrophages. In wild-type (WT) and cKO mice, intrathecal injection of MerTK activating antibody, attenuates persistent hypersensitivity and polarizes DRG macrophages toward a proresolving phenotype with production of antinociceptive lipoxin A 4 . Thus, we delineate a neuron–macrophage–neutrophil bidirectional circuit that can be exploited to reduce persistent arthritis pain.},

  abstract     = {Muscle contraction is driven by myosin motors from the thick filaments pulling on the actin-containing thin filaments of the sarcomere, and it is regulated by structural changes in both filaments. Thin filaments are activated by an increase in intracellular calcium concentration [Ca 2+ ] i and by myosin binding to actin. Thick filaments are activated by direct sensing of the filament load. However, these mechanisms cannot explain muscle relaxation when [Ca 2+ ] i decreases at high load and myosin motors are attached to actin. There is, therefore, a fundamental gap in our understanding of muscle relaxation, despite its importance for muscle function in vivo, for example, for rapid eye movements or, on slower timescales, for the efficient control of posture. Here, we used time-resolved small-angle X-ray diffraction (SAXD) to determine how muscle thin and thick filaments switch OFF in extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles of the mouse in response to decreases in either [Ca 2+ ] i or muscle load and to describe the distribution of muscle sarcomere lengths (SLs) during relaxation. We show that reducing load at high [Ca 2+ ] i is more effective in switching OFF both the thick and thin filaments than reducing [Ca 2+ ] i at high load in normal relaxation. In the latter case, the thick filaments initially remain fully ON, although the number of myosin motors bound to actin decreases and the force per attached motor increases. That initial slow phase of relaxation is abruptly terminated by yielding of one population of sarcomeres, triggering a redistribution of SLs that leads to the rapid completion of mechanical relaxation.},

  abstract     = {Genetic assimilation is a process by which a trait originally driven by the environment becomes independent of the initial cue and is expressed constitutively in a population. More than seven decades have passed since Waddington’s pioneering demonstration of the acquisition of morphological traits through genetic assimilation, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Here, we address this gap by performing combined genomic analyses of Waddington’s genetic assimilation experiments using the ectopic veins (EV) phenocopy in Drosophila as a model. Our study reveals the assimilation of EV in both outbred and inbred fly natural populations, despite their limited genetic diversity. We identified key changes in the expression of developmental genes and pinpointed selected alleles involved in EV assimilation. The assimilation of EV is mainly driven by the selection of regulatory alleles already present in the ancestral populations, including the downregulation of the receptor tyrosine kinase gene Cad96Ca by the insertion of a transposable element in its 3′ untranslated region. The genetic variation at this locus in the inbred population is maintained by a large chromosomal inversion. In outbred populations, the evolution of EV results from a polygenic response shaped by the selective environment. Our results support a model in which selection for multiple preexisting alleles in the ancestral population, rather than stress-induced genetic or epigenetic variation, drives the evolution of EV in natural fly populations.},

  abstract     = {The tumor suppressor p53 can trigger tumor resistance to chemotherapy by facilitating DNA damage repair and maintaining genomic integrity. Here, we report that a p53-induced circular RNA circASCC3 promotes chemotherapeutic resistance by resolving R-loops. Our results reveal that p53 directly activates the transcription of ASCC3 , the host gene of circASCC3. In addition, the RNA-binding protein SFPQ is identified to inhibit the formation of circASCC3 by associating with its flanking regions. Importantly, p53 facilitates the formation of circASCC3 by repressing the expression of SFPQ. CircASCC3 has a marginal effect on the survival and growth of cancer cells under normal growing conditions but surprisingly boosts their survival and growth in response to DNA damage stress. Mechanistic analysis reveals that circASCC3 binds to the DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX5 to inhibit its proteasomal degradation. This results in the prevention of R-loop accumulation due to DNA damage, thereby conferring tumor resistance to chemotherapy. Together, our study uncovers that p53 activates circASCC3 to promote R-loop resolution, which maintains genomic stability and potentially contributes to chemoresistance.},

Here, we show that plants contain molecular signals, termed effectostimulins, that activate the first identified regulator of plant-parasitic nematode effectors. SUGR-1 directly binds effector promoters, and is central to a transcriptional network that activates 58 effector genes. Importantly, we demonstrate that downregulation of sugr-1 inhibits parasitism, underlining SUGR-1 signaling as a valuable target for crop protection and food security. This, in the wider context of nematodes as parasites of humans and other animals, has scope for potentially broader impact: Disrupting effector production could, in principle, be applied to any pathogen that secrets effectors.},

  abstract     = {Inflammation is among the known causes of cisplatin-induced hearing loss (CIHL), but its exact pathophysiological mechanisms remain unclear. Herein, we demonstrated that pyroptosis—a recently identified inflammatory type of regulated cell death dependent on gasdermin D (GSDMD)—was activated in the cochleae of cisplatin-treated mice, causing CIHL. Meanwhile, treatment with the GSDMD inhibitor necrosulfonamide alleviated CIHL in these mice. To further examine the role of GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis in CIHL, we conducted experiments in Gsdmd- deficient mice . Gsdmd −/− mice demonstrated significantly lower cisplatin-induced cochlear damage than control mice and appeared to be invulnerable to CIHL. Furthermore, GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis in the stria vascularis (SV), but not in the hair cells (HCs), played a dominant role in CIHL. In marginal cells (MCs) of SV, cisplatin induced caspase-dependent GSDMD cleavage, and the pore-forming N-terminal of GSDMD rapidly localized to the mitochondria, leading to abnormal mitochondrial aggregation and oxidative stress. The consequent mitochondrial dysfunction in MCs might result in the severe progression of inflammation, SV damage, and HC loss. Notably, the pharmacological inhibition of pyroptosis using the FDA-approved drug disulfiram effectively alleviated the symptoms of CIHL. Collectively, these findings offer a broad avenue for inhibiting pyroptosis-induced cisplatin ototoxicity and provide valuable theoretical insights for the clinical management of CIHL.},

  abstract     = {Resting brain activity, in the absence of explicit tasks, appears as distributed spatiotemporal patterns that reflect structural connectivity and correlate with behavioral traits. However, its role in shaping behavior remains unclear. Recent evidence shows that resting-state spatial patterns not only align with task-evoked topographies but also encode distinct visual (e.g., lines, contours, faces, places) and motor (e.g., hand postures) features, suggesting mechanisms for long-term storage and predictive coding. While prior research focused on static, time-averaged task activations, we examine whether dynamic, time-varying motor states seen during active hand movements are also present at rest. Three distinct motor activation states, engaging the motor cortex alongside sensory and association areas, were identified. These states appeared both at rest and during task execution but underwent temporal reorganization from rest to task. Thus, resting-state dynamics serve as strong spatiotemporal priors for task-based activation. Critically, resting-state patterns more closely resembled those associated with frequent ecological hand movements than with an unfamiliar movement, indicating a structured repertoire of movement patterns that is replayed at rest and reorganized during action. This suggests that spontaneous neural activity provides priors for future movements and contributes to long-term memory storage, reinforcing the functional interplay between resting and task-driven brain activity.},

We examined color qualia structures in children (3 to 12-y-old in Japan and 6 to 8-y-old in China) and compared these with those of Japanese adults. Approximately half of the assessed 3-y-old children completed the experiment via our touch panel device version of the task and had reliable responses. Despite known developmental and/or cultural effects of color term usage, we found that color qualia structures were quite similar across the age groups and cultures. Our finding supports the view that color qualia structures emerge early.

  abstract     = {Microsporidia are divergent fungal pathogens that employ a unique harpoon-like apparatus called the polar tube (PT) to invade host cells. The long PT is fired out of the microsporidian spore over the course of just a few hundred milliseconds. Once fired, the PT is thought to pierce the plasma membrane of a target cell and act as a conduit for the transfer of the parasite into the host cell, which initiates infection. The PT architecture and its association with neighboring organelles within the parasite cell remain poorly understood. Here, we use cryoelectron tomography to investigate the structural cell biology of the PT in dormant spores from the human-infecting microsporidian species, Encephalitozoon intestinalis . Segmentation and subtomogram averaging of the PT reveal at least four layers: two protein-based layers surrounded by a membrane layer and filled with a dense core. Regularly spaced protein filaments form the structural skeleton of the PT. Combining cryoelectron tomography with cellular modeling, we propose a model for the three-dimensional organization of the polaroplast, an organelle that surrounds the PT and is continuous with the outermost, membranous layer of the PT. Our results reveal the ultrastructure of the microsporidian invasion apparatus in situ, laying the foundation for understanding infection mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {Although a growing literature has investigated the effects of various types of civil war violence on political behavior, no study has examined the impact of assassinations targeting politicians. This is a critical omission, as violence against local politicians is prevalent across civil war contexts and may be the most consequential form of violence for political participation by affecting both candidate supply and voter demand. Using an original dataset of nearly 2,000 killings of Colombian local politicians between 1980 and 2023, we estimate the impact of this violence on voter turnout. Taking municipalities where assassination attempts failed as a comparison group, we find that political assassinations significantly decrease voter turnout in both the short and medium terms, with effects persisting in various elections even after the signing of a peace agreement. These findings contrast with many studies suggesting that other forms of civil war violence enhance political participation during the postconflict period or after a truce or peace agreement. Our results suggest that different forms of violence can have distinct effects on political behavior, underscoring the need to theorize how the targeting, nature, and context of violence condition its effects. This echoes calls for more nuanced studies on the behavioral impacts of violence. Our findings also have implications for understanding democracy amid rising violence against political leaders in countries affected by organized crime, such as Mexico and Brazil; polarized contexts, such as the United States; and weakly institutionalized democracies, such as South Africa, Indonesia, and the Philippines.},

  abstract     = {Central emotion theories assume that during threatening and dangerous events the human face signals a prototypical, distinct, and universally recognized expression of fear which can be accurately decoded by conspecific perceivers. Due to the importance of fear expressions, an unusually large body of research has been dedicated to exploring their evolutionary origins, neurobiological mechanisms, and clinical significance. However, these studies typically utilize highly recognizable posed actor portrayals presumed to closely resemble the diagnostic physical appearance of real-life fearful faces. Here, we challenge this diagnosticity assumption. Following context-dependent frameworks (Barrett, 2017), we hypothesized that extrafacial context (e.g., situational information, body posture, etc.) plays a far greater role in fear communication than the signal of the isolated face. In 12 preregistered experiments (N = 4,180), we examined the perception of authentic, real-life videos documenting a diverse range of intense fear-inducing situations (e.g., height jumping, physical attacks, exposure to phobia triggers). Participants viewed the face alone, the context with no face, or the full video while various response methods of emotion perception were tested (forced choice, open-ended, multiple emotion scales, valence-arousal ratings). Across experiments, videos of the faces alone failed to communicate fear in a reliable manner. In sharp contrast, context with no faces, and faces with context were clearly and robustly perceived as fearful, with medium to large effect sizes. These findings suggest that despite the undisputed importance of perceiving fear reactions, facial expressions alone bear minimal diagnostic value, while context plays a critical role in real-life fear perception.},

  abstract     = {As infants grow, they develop greater attentional control during interactions with others, shifting from patterns of attention primarily driven by caregivers (exogenous) to those that are also self-directed (endogenous). The ability to endogenously control attention during infancy is thought to reflect ongoing brain development and is influenced by patterns of joint attention between infant and caregiver. However, whether measures of infant attentional control and caregiver behavior during infant–caregiver interactions relate to patterns of infant brain activity is unknown and key for informing developmental models of attentional control. Using data from 43 infant–caregiver dyads, we quantified patterns of visual attention with dyadic, head-mounted eye tracking during infant–caregiver play and associated them with the duration of infant EEG microstate D/4 measured during rest. Importantly, microstate D/4 is a scalp potential topography thought to reflect the organization and function of attention-related brain networks. We found that microstate D/4 associated positively with infant-led joint attention rate but did not associate with caregiver-led joint attention rate, suggesting that infant-led coordination of joint attention during play may be critical for the neurobiological development of attentional control, or vice versa. Further, we found that microstate D/4 associated negatively with infant attention shift rate and positively with infant sustained attention duration, suggesting that increased stability of microstate D/4 may reflect maturation of attentional control and its underlying neural substrates. Together, our findings provide insights into how infant attentional control abilities and infant–caregiver visual behavior during play are associated with the spatial and temporal dynamics of infant brain activity.},

  abstract     = {The flagellum is the most complex macromolecular structure known in bacteria and is composed of around two dozen distinct proteins. The main building block of the long, external flagellar filament, flagellin, is secreted through the flagellar type-III secretion system at a remarkable rate of several tens of thousands of amino acids per second, significantly surpassing the rates achieved by other pore-based protein secretion systems. The evolutionary implications and potential benefits of this high secretion rate for flagellum assembly and function, however, have remained elusive. In this study, we provide both experimental and theoretical evidence that the flagellar secretion rate has been evolutionarily optimized to facilitate rapid and efficient construction of a functional flagellum. By synchronizing flagellar assembly, we found that a minimal filament length of 2.5 μm was required for swimming motility. Biophysical modeling revealed that this minimal filament length threshold resulted from an elasto-hydrodynamic instability of the whole swimming cell, dependent on the filament length. Furthermore, we developed a stepwise filament labeling method combined with electron microscopy visualization to validate predicted flagellin secretion rates of up to 10,000 amino acids per second. A biophysical model of flagellum growth demonstrates that the observed high flagellin secretion rate efficiently balances filament elongation and energy consumption, thereby enabling motility in the shortest amount of time. Taken together, these insights underscore the evolutionary pressures that have shaped the development and optimization of the flagellum and type-III secretion system, illuminating the intricate interplay and cost-benefit tradeoff between functionality and efficiency in assembly of large macromolecular structures.},

  abstract     = {The hippocampus and entorhinal cortex encode spaces by spatially local and hexagonal grid activity patterns (place cells and grid cells), respectively. In addition, the same brain regions also implicate neural representations for nonspatial, semantic concepts (concept cells). These observations suggest that neurocomputational mechanisms for spatial knowledge and semantic concepts are related in the brain. However, the exact relationship remains to be understood. Here, we show a mathematical correspondence between a value function for goal-directed spatial navigation and an information measure for word embedding models in natural language processing. Based on this relationship, we integrate spatial and semantic computations into a neural representation model called “disentangled successor information” (DSI). DSI generates biologically plausible neural representations: spatial representations like place cells and grid cells, and concept-specific word representations which resemble concept cells. Furthermore, with DSI representations, we can perform inferences of spatial contexts and words by a common computational framework based on simple arithmetic operations. This computation can be biologically interpreted by partial modulations of cell assemblies of nongrid cells and concept cells. Our model offers a theoretical connection of spatial and semantic computations and suggests possible computational roles of hippocampal and entorhinal neural representations.},

  abstract     = {Currently, most cell or tissue transplantations using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are anticipated to involve allogeneic iPSCs. However, the immunological properties of iPSCs in an allogeneic setting are not well understood. We previously established a mouse transplantation model of MHC-compatible/minor antigen-mismatched combinations, assuming a hypoimmunogenic iPSC-setting. Here, we found that iPSCs subcutaneously inoculated into MHC-compatible allogeneic host mice resisted rejection and formed teratomas without immunosuppressant administration. Notably, when skin grafts were transplanted onto hosts more than 40 d after the initial iPSCs inoculation, only the skin of the same strain as the initial iPSCs was engrafted. Therefore, donor-specific immune tolerance was induced by a single iPSC inoculation. Diverse analyses, including single-cell RNA-sequencing after transplantation, revealed an increase in regulatory T cell (Treg) population, particularly CD25 + CD103 + effector Tregs within the teratoma and skin grafts. The removal of CD25 + or Foxp3 + cells suppressed the increase in effector Tregs and disrupted graft acceptance, indicating the importance of these cells in the establishment of immune tolerance. Within the teratoma, we observed an increase in TGF-β2 levels, suggesting an association with the increase in effector Tregs. Our results provide important insights for future applications of allogeneic iPSC-based cell or tissue transplantation.},

  abstract     = {Microbial communities vary across space, time, and individual hosts, generating a need for statistical methods capable of quantifying variability across multiple microbiome samples at once. To understand heterogeneity across microbiome samples from different host individuals, sampling times, spatial locations, or experimental replicates, we present FAVA ( F ST -based Assessment of Variability across vectors of relative Abundances), a framework for characterizing compositional variability across two or more microbiome samples. FAVA quantifies variability across many samples of taxonomic or functional relative abundances in a single index ranging between 0 and 1, equaling 0 when all samples are identical and 1 when each sample is entirely composed of a single taxon (and at least two distinct taxa are present across samples). Its definition relies on the population-genetic statistic F ST , with samples playing the role of “populations” and taxa playing the role of “alleles.” Its mathematical properties allow users to compare datasets with different numbers of samples and taxonomic categories. We introduce extensions that incorporate phylogenetic similarity among taxa and spatial or temporal distances between samples. We demonstrate FAVA in two examples. First, we use FAVA to measure how the taxonomic and functional variability of gastrointestinal microbiomes across individuals from seven ruminant species changes along the gastrointestinal tract. Second, we use FAVA to quantify the increase in temporal variability of gut microbiomes in healthy humans following an antibiotic course and to measure the duration of the antibiotic’s influence on temporal microbiome variability. We have implemented this tool in an R package, FAVA , for use in pipelines for the analysis of microbial relative abundances.},

  abstract     = {Topologically associating domains (TADs) are sub-Megabase regions in vertebrate genomes with enriched intradomain interactions that restrict enhancer–promoter contacts across their boundaries. However, the mechanisms that separate TADs remain incompletely understood. Most boundaries between TADs contain CTCF binding sites (CBSs), which individually contribute to the blocking of Cohesin-mediated loop extrusion. Using genome-wide classification, here we show that the width of TAD boundaries forms a continuum from narrow to highly extended and correlates with CBSs distribution, chromatin features, and gene regulatory elements. To investigate how these boundary widths emerge, we modified the random crosslinker polymer model to incorporate specific boundary configurations, enabling us to evaluate the differential impact of boundary composition on TAD insulation. Our analysis, using three generic boundary categories, identifies differential influence on TAD insulation, with varying local and distal effects on neighboring domains. Notably, we find that increasing boundary width reduces long-range inter-TAD contacts, as confirmed by Hi-C data. While blocking loop extrusion at boundaries indirectly promotes spurious intermingling of neighboring TADs, extended boundaries counteract this effect, emphasizing their role in establishing genome organization. In conclusion, TAD boundary width not only enhances the efficiency of loop extrusion blocking but may also modulate enhancer–promoter contacts over long distances across TAD boundaries, providing a further mechanism for transcriptional regulation.},

  abstract     = {Stem cells possess inherent properties of self-renewal and differentiation, and thus hold significant promise for regenerating damaged tissues or replacing lost cells. Unless their therapeutic effects are solely mediated by paracrine, transplanted stem cells need to be highly plastic to adapt to the host tissue environment and differentiate into constituent tissue-specific cells for tissue repair. Stem cells used in current cell-based therapies either have limited differentiation potential or are pluripotent but must be strictly restricted to avoid tumorigenicity risk in vivo. Here, we describe the derivation of human adult high-plasticity stem cells, which we call guide-integrated adult stem cells (giaSCs), from the interaction of blood-derived guide cells and umbilical cord tissue–derived mesenchymal stromal cells (UC-MSCs). The guide cells are a cell population derived from the peripheral blood of human adults. Unidirectional transfer through nanotube-like structures of granular substances from the guide cells into the recipient UC-MSCs gave rise to giaSCs. Topical application of human giaSCs into full-layer excisional wounds of wild-type mice led to reconstitution of skin tissue. Systemically administered human giaSCs migrated to and reside in mouse small intestinal tissue damaged by lipopolysaccharides and then differentiated into small intestinal epithelial cells for tissue repair. These transplantation experiments demonstrated that giaSCs have in vivo high plasticity. Additional in vivo and in vitro data showed that giaSCs have low immunogenicity and are nontumorigenic. These data indicate that giaSCs offer a highly promising approach to stem cell therapy.},

We apply this model to Posidonia oceanica meadows, where positive and negative feedbacks are well documented, and there is empirical evidence of the role of sulfide accumulation, toxic for the plant, in driving complex spatiotemporal dynamics. We describe a progressive transition from homogeneous meadows to extinction through dynamical regimes that allow the ecosystem to avoid the typical ecological tipping points of homogeneous vegetation covers. A predictable sequence of distinct dynamical regimes is observed as mortality is continuously increased: turbulent regimes, formation of spirals and wave trains, and isolated traveling pulses or expanding rings, the latter being a harbinger of ecosystem collapse, however far beyond the tipping point of the homogeneous cover. The model used in this paper is general, and the results can be applied to other plant–soil spatially extended systems, regardless of the mechanisms behind negative and positive feedbacks.},

  abstract     = {Sinorhizobium meliloti is a soil bacterium that establishes a nitrogen-fixing symbiosis within root nodules of legumes. In this symbiosis, S. meliloti undergoes a drastic cellular change leading to a terminally differentiated form, called bacteroid, characterized by genome endoreduplication, increased cell size, and high membrane permeability. Bacterial cell cycle (mis)regulation is at the heart of this differentiation process. In free-living cells, the master regulator CtrA ensures the progression of cell cycle by activating cell division (controlled by FtsZ) and inhibiting DNA replication, while on the other hand the so far poorly unknown downregulation of CtrA and FtsZ is essential for bacteroid differentiation. Here, we combine cell biology, biochemistry, and bacterial genetics to understand the functions of FcrX, a factor that controls both CtrA and FtsZ in free-living growth and in symbiosis. Depletion of the essential gene fcrX led to abnormally high levels of FtsZ and CtrA and minicell formation. Using multiple complementary techniques, we showed that FcrX may interact with FtsZ and CtrA. Moreover, fcrX transcription is directly controlled by CtrA itself and the FcrX protein displays a cell cycle-dependent pattern. We showed further that FcrX also binds the degradosome complex ClpXP and its adaptors CpdR1 and RcdA, and that CtrA degradation efficiency depends on FcrX. We further showed that, despite weak homology with FliJ-like proteins, only FcrX proteins from closely related species are able to complement S. meliloti fcrX function. Finally, deregulation of FcrX showed abnormal symbiotic behaviors in plants suggesting a putative role of this factor during bacteroid differentiation.},

We present evidence from a field experiment ( N = 1,128) conducted in Australia on a major gig economy platform that allows users to outsource everyday tasks. By manipulating both the sexual orientation of job posters (gay vs. straight male) and physical proximity requirements of tasks (inside vs. outside the home), we identify discrimination against gay profiles and demonstrate a specific mechanism for its emergence: physical proximity. Gay profiles received fewer offers and less engagement, and attracted workers with significantly lower quality ratings, but only for tasks requiring close physical proximity. Additional exploratory analysis further suggests that the results are driven by an anti-gay bias rather than an anti-men or pro-women bias and that discrimination is stronger for tasks with a higher degree of interaction between worker and job poster. Our findings demonstrate how digital labor platforms can perpetuate traditional forms of discrimination, while shedding light on physical proximity as one important mechanism. These results have important implications for users of the gig economy, a sector of increasing importance due to its rapid growth and comparatively lax regulatory frameworks.},

In the present study, we identified the m 6 A methylation of the viral RNA of different IAV subtypes and confirmed that m 6 A modification promotes the polymerase activity and replication of IAV. By mutating m 6 A motifs on the multiple viral RNAs (vRNAs) of IAV, we revealed that m 6 A deficiency in vRNA suppresses the expression of viral genes and the replication of the virus in vitro. In addition, m 6 A deficiency in vRNA reduced the pathogenicity of IAV in a mouse model. Mechanistically, m 6 A deficiency in vRNA suppresses the assembly of the viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complex by impairing the interaction between vRNA and vRNP proteins in an m 6 A methyltransferase-dependent manner, but not the m 6 A reader proteins. Together, our findings reveal an important role for m 6 A on viral RNAs in facilitating the activity of the polymerase complex and the replication and pathogenicity of IAV, which provides insights for the development of novel anti-influenza strategies.},

  abstract     = {While vegetation brings positive benefits for climate mitigation and adaptation, the impact of ongoing global greening remains controversial due to its uncertain effects on hydrological cycle. Here, we quantitatively assess the impact of vegetation dynamics on global water availability by proposing a comprehensive framework to quantify the terrestrial water sink and source scores associated with vegetation dynamics. These scores serve as indicators of whether large alterations in water resources have occurred in the lands due to either the greening or degradation of surface vegetation. We use multisource datasets from climate model projections, remote sensing, and local measurements to examine the impact of vegetation dynamics on water availability over the periods of 1982 to 2019 and 2015 to 2100. During historical observation periods, regions such as India and northern China experienced large depletion of water resources as a result of vegetation greening, leading to water scarcity. In the future, a shift is projected for India and northern China, transforming them into regions capable of meeting water demands arising from vegetation greening. This transition is largely attributed to wetting and warming climates. It indicates that trade-off effects between climate and underlying vegetation dynamics may result in strengthening regional hydrological resilience and ensuring the stable status of local water resources. Furthermore, tropical rainforests (except for the Amazon Rainforest) are experiencing greening with minimal impact on local water resources consistently. These insights are valuable for globally identifying optimal locations to implement ecological restoration, facilitating the balance of sustainable water resources and vegetation greening.},

  abstract     = {Transmissibility of respiratory viruses is a complex viral trait that is intricately linked to tropism. Several highly transmissible viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and Influenza viruses, specifically target multiciliated cells in the upper respiratory tract to facilitate efficient human-to-human transmission. In contrast, the zoonotic Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) generally transmits poorly between humans, which is largely attributed to the absence of its receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) in the upper respiratory tract. At the same time, MERS-CoV epidemiology is characterized by occasional superspreading events, suggesting that some individuals can disseminate this virus effectively. Here, we utilized well-differentiated human pulmonary and nasal airway organoid-derived cultures to further delineate the respiratory tropism of MERS-CoV. We find that MERS-CoV replicated to high titers in both pulmonary and nasal airway cultures. Using single-cell messenger-RNA sequencing, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry, we show that MERS-CoV preferentially targeted multiciliated cells, leading to loss of ciliary coverage. MERS-CoV cellular tropism was dependent on the differentiation of the organoid-derived cultures, and replication efficiency varied considerably between donors. Similarly, variable and focal expression of DPP4 was revealed in human nose tissues. This study indicates that the upper respiratory tract tropism of MERS-CoV may vary between individuals due to differences in DPP4 expression, providing an explanation for the unpredictable transmission pattern of MERS-CoV.},

  abstract     = {Infiltrating macrophages contribute to muscle dystrophic changes in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). In a DMD mouse model, mdx 5cv mice, CC chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) deficiency diminishes Ly6C hi macrophage infiltration by blocking blood Ly6C hi inflammatory monocyte recruitment. This is accompanied by transient improvement of muscle damage, fibrosis, and regeneration. The benefit, however, is lost after the expansion of intramuscular Ly6C lo macrophages. To address the mechanisms underlying the Ly6C lo macrophage expansion, we compared mdx 5cv /Nur77 −/− and mdx 5cv /Ccr2 −/− /Nur7 −/− mice with mdx 5cv and mdx 5cv /Ccr2 −/− mice, respectively, and found no evidence to suggest Ly6C lo monocyte recruitment by dystrophic muscles. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis and Flt3 cre /Rosa26 LSL-YFP -based lineage tracing of macrophage origins demonstrated the expansion and pathogenic activation of muscle resident macrophages in CCR2-deficient mdx 5cv mice. The expansion was associated with increased cell proliferation, which appeared induced by colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) derived from fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs). Our study establishes a pathogenic role for skeletal muscle resident macrophages and supports a regulatory role of FAPs in stimulating the expansion of resident macrophages in the DMD mouse model when the inflammatory macrophage infiltration is inhibited.},

  abstract     = {Autocratic governments around the world use clandestine propaganda campaigns to influence the media. We document a decade-long trend in China toward the planting of government-authored articles in party and commercial newspapers. To examine this phenomenon, we develop an approach to identifying scripted propaganda—the coerced reprinting of lightly adapted government-authored articles in newspapers—that leverages the footprints left by the government when making media interventions. We show that in China, scripted propaganda is a daily phenomenon—on 90% of days from 2012 to 2022, the vast majority of party newspapers include at least some scripted propaganda at the direction of a central directive. On particular sensitive days, the amount of scripted propaganda can spike to 30% of the articles appearing in major newspapers. We show that scripted propaganda has strengthened under President Xi Jinping. In the last decade, the front page of party newspapers has evolved from 5% scripted articles to approximately 20% scripted. This government-authored content throughout the paper is increasingly homogeneous—fewer and fewer adaptations are done by individual newspapers. In contrast to popular speculation, we show that scripted content is not only on ideological topics (although it is increasingly ideological) and is also very prevalent in commercial papers. Using a case study of domestic coverage of COVID-19, we demonstrate how the regime uses scripting to shape, constrain, and delay information during crises. Our findings reveal the wide-ranging influence of government-authored propaganda in China’s media ecosystem.},

  abstract     = {NASA’s Kepler mission identified over 4,000 extrasolar planets that transit (cross in front of) their host stars. This sample has revealed detailed features in the demographics of planet sizes and orbital spacings. However, knowledge of their orbital shapes—a key tracer of planetary formation and evolution—remains far more limited. We present measurements of eccentricities for 1,646 Kepler planets, 92% of which are smaller than Neptune. For all planet sizes, the eccentricity distribution peaks at e = 0 and falls monotonically toward zero at e = 1. As planet size increases, mean population eccentricity rises from ⟨ e ⟩ = 0.05 ± 0.01 for small planets to ⟨ e ⟩ = 0.20 ± 0.03 for planets larger than ∼3.5 Earth-radii R ⊕ . The overall planet occurrence rate and planet-metallicity correlation also change abruptly at this size. Taken together, these patterns indicate distinct formation channels for planets above and below ∼3.5 R ⊕ . We also find size-dependent associations between eccentricity, host star metallicity, and orbital period. While smaller planets generally have low eccentricities, there are hints of a noteworthy exception: eccentricities are slightly elevated in the “radius valley,” a narrow band of low occurrence rate density which separates rocky “super-Earths” (1.0 to 1.5 R ⊕ ) from gas-rich “sub-Neptunes” (2.0 to 3.0 R ⊕ ). We detect this feature at 2.1σ significance. Planets in single- and multitransiting systems exhibit the same size–eccentricity relationship, suggesting they are drawn from the same parent population.},

  abstract     = {Positive selection at the 2q21.3 enhancer region for lactase gene ( LCT ) expression in Europeans and Africans has long been attributed to selection for lactase persistence (LP), the capacity of adults to digest lactose in milk, presumably because of the benefits associated with milk consumption. While considered a classic example of gene–culture coevolution, recently doubts have been raised about the link between selection at 2q21.3 and LP. Analysis of additional populations could shed further light; here, we demonstrate that a haplotype spanning ~467 kb at the 2q21.3 locus has risen to high frequency in East Asians (~25%) but is absent from Africans and Europeans. This haplotype likely derived from Neanderthals and has been under positive selection in East Asians. The East Asian–specific haplotype is associated with alterations in LCT expression and promoter methylation in certain cell types, similar to what is observed with LP-associated haplotypes in Europeans. Moreover, its frequency is comparable to that of LP in East Asians, suggesting a potential association with LP in East Asians. However, it is highly unlikely that selection in East Asians was related to milk-drinking habits. We find that this haplotype impacts the expression of UBXN4 , DARS1, and DARS1-AS1 in immune cells and is associated with neutrophil and white blood cell counts. Hence, the selection might be linked to certain aspects of immune function. This implies that selection on 2q21.3 has thus either occurred for different reasons in different populations or the selection observed in other populations is also not due to LP.},

  abstract     = {Regulation of mitochondrial Ca 2+ uptake is critical in cardiac adaptation to chronic stressors. Abnormalities in Ca 2+ handling, including mitochondrial uptake mechanisms, have been implicated in pathological heart hypertrophy. Enhancing mitochondrial Ca 2+ uniporter (MCU) expression has been suggested to interfere with maladaptive development of heart failure. Here, we addressed whether MCU modulation affects the cardiac response to pressure overload. MCU content was quantified in human and murine hearts at different phases of myocardial hypertrophy. Cardiac function/structure were analyzed after Transverse Aortic Constriction (TAC) in mice undergone viral-assisted overexpression or downregulation of MCU. In vitro and ex vivo assays determined the effect of MCU modulation on mitochondrial Ca 2+ uptake, cellular phenotype and hypertrophic signaling. In human and murine hearts MCU levels increased in the adaptive phase of myocardial hypertrophy and declined in the failing stage. Consistently, modulation of MCU had a cell-autonomous effect in cardiomyocyte/heart adaptation to chronic overload. Indeed, upon TAC MCU-downregulation accelerated development of contractile dysfunction, interstitial fibrosis and heart failure. Conversely, MCU-overexpression prolonged the adaptive phase of hypertrophic response, as, in advanced stages upon TAC, hearts showed preserved contractility, absence of fibrosis and intact vascularization. In vitro and ex vivo analyses indicated that enhancement in mitochondrial Ca 2+ uptake in cardiomyocytes entails “mitochondrion-to-cytoplasm” signals leading to ROS-mediated activation of Akt, which may explain the protective effects towards heart response to TAC. Enhanced mitochondrial Ca 2+ uptake affects the compensatory response to pressure overload via retrograde mitochondrial-Ca 2+ /ROS/Akt signaling, thus uncovering a potentially targetable mechanism against maladaptive myocardial hypertrophy.},

  abstract     = {The long-term success of introduced populations depends on both their initial size and ability to compete against existing residents, but it remains unclear how these factors collectively shape colonization dynamics. Here, we investigate how initial population (propagule) size shapes the outcome of community coalescence by systematically mixing eight pairs of in vitro microbial communities at ratios that vary over six orders of magnitude, and we compare our results to neutral ecological theory. Although the composition of the resulting cocultures deviated substantially from neutral expectations, each coculture contained species whose relative abundance depended on propagule size even after ~40 generations of growth. Using a consumer–resource model, we show that this dose-dependent colonization can arise when resident and introduced species have high niche overlap and consume shared resources at similar rates. Strain isolates displayed longer-lasting dose dependence when introduced into diverse communities than in pairwise cocultures, consistent with our model’s prediction that propagule size should have larger, more persistent effects in diverse communities. Our model also successfully predicted that species with similar resource-utilization profiles, as inferred from growth in spent media and untargeted metabolomics, would show stronger dose dependence in pairwise coculture. This work demonstrates that transient, dose-dependent colonization dynamics can emerge from resource competition and exert long-term effects on the outcomes of community coalescence.},

  abstract     = {Cells respond to adhesive ligands such as arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD) through integrins, which regulates cellular activities via influencing cytoskeleton assembly. Herein, we report that the nanoscale distribution of active ligands on biomaterials regulates cells through not only cytoplasmic tension but also nuclear tension. This is particularly related to translocation of actin into nucleus and highlighted in our interpretation of an “abnormal” phenomenon that large RGD nanospacing (&gt;70 nm) disassembles integrin clusters, inhibits cell adhesion, but promotes osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. Our studies reveal that the unstable adhesion at the 150 nm RGD distance increases actin dynamics, resulting in the nuclear translocation of globular (G) actin. The compartment polymerization of more G-actins to filamentous actins in nucleus increases nuclear tension, facilitating transcription activity and releasing calcium ions from the endoplasmic reticulum. This noncanonical mechanotransduction process sheds insight into mechanotransduction pertinent to cell–material interactions.},

Despite their utility, these sensors are “black boxes”: Very little is known about the structures of their low- and high-fluorescence states or what features are required to transition between them. We used LiLac, a lactate biosensor with a quantitative fluorescence-lifetime readout, as a model system to address these questions. X-ray crystal structures and engineered high-affinity metal bridges demonstrate that LiLac exhibits a large interdomain twist motion that pulls the fluorescent protein away from a “sealed,” high-lifetime state in the absence of lactate to a “cracked,” low-lifetime state in its presence. Understanding the structures and dynamics of LiLac will help to think about and engineer other fluorescent biosensors.},

To begin to understand how Mtb survives aerosolization, we mimicked liquid and atmospheric conditions experienced by Mtb before and after exhalation using a model aerosol fluid (MAF) based on the water-soluble, lipidic, and cellular constituents of necrotic tuberculosis lesions. MAF induced drug tolerance in Mtb, remodeled its transcriptome, and protected Mtb from dying in microdroplets desiccating in air. Yet survival was not passive: Mtb appeared to rely on hundreds of genes to survive conditions associated with transmission. Essential genes subserving proteostasis offered most protection. A large number of conventionally nonessential genes appeared to contribute as well, including genes encoding proteins that resemble antidesiccants. The candidate transmission survival genome of Mtb may offer opportunities to reduce transmission of tuberculosis.},

  abstract     = {Sperm IZUMO1 binds to egg JUNO, and this interaction is essential for mammalian fertilization. Isolated from a female mouse immunized with syngeneic sperm, the antisperm antibody OBF13 recognizes IZUMO1 and inhibits murine fertilization. How OBF13 interferes with sperm–egg interactions was unknown. Here, we present the X-ray crystal structure of IZUMO1 in complex with OBF13. OBF13 binds to the apex of the four-helix domain of IZUMO1, distant from the JUNO-binding site. Our crystal structure of OBF13-bound IZUMO1 resembles apo-IZUMO1 and differs from the structure of IZUMO1 in complex with JUNO. We identify that OBF13 carries a low level of somatic hypermutation, and through deep mutational scanning, we engineer an affinity-enhanced OBF13 variant. This OBF13 variant single-chain fragment variable decreases the apparent affinity of IZUMO1 for membrane-bound murine JUNO and blocks the binding of acrosome-reacted sperm to eggs, thereby preventing fertilization. We propose allostery between the OBF13 epitope and the JUNO-binding site. OBF13 inhibits a conformational change in IZUMO1, preventing fusion-competent sperm from adhering to murine eggs during fertilization. Surprisingly, murine IZUMO1 binds to hamster JUNO with an affinity ~20-fold higher than to murine JUNO. The decreased affinity caused by OBF13 of murine IZUMO1 for hamster JUNO is sufficient for murine sperm to bind to and fuse with hamster eggs. Our studies provide a structural and mechanistic framework for species-specific, allosteric inhibition of IZUMO1 by a naturally occurring antisperm antibody and offer insights into the development of immunocontraceptives.},

  abstract     = {Optimal activation of CD8+ T cells is crucial for immunity-mediated destruction of cancer, requiring a substantial amount of proteins involved in metabolism, proliferation, and effector function. Despite extensive studies emphasizing the role of transcriptional regulation in this process, paired transcriptomic and proteomic analyses reveal that the RNA profile is poorly correlated with protein levels. This discrepancy underscores the importance of post-translational modifications (PTMs) in controlling protein abundance during activation. However, the impact of PTMs on the CD8+ T cell protein dynamic remains underexplored. We identify that neddylation, a recently discovered PTM, is activated in response to T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation and enriched in effector CD8+ T cells from colon cancer patients. Mechanistically, we found the rate-limiting enzyme of neddylation, neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated protein 8 activating enzyme E1 (NAE1), is induced by the NFATc1, a critical transcription factor downstream of TCR signaling. Our observation revealed that genetic ablation of NAE1 significantly disturbed the proteomic landscape related to activation and mitochondrial function. As a result, CD8+ T cells lacking NAE1 exhibited severely compromised activation, proliferation, and survival, which was accompanied by impaired mitochondrial function. Consistently, deletion of NAE1 in CD8+ T cells abolished their antitumor function and promoted tumor progression. By contrast, the overexpression of NAE1 significantly improved the function of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells. Overall, we uncovered neddylation, a previously underappreciated PTM, as a proteomic checkpoint for CD8+ T cell activation. Enforced expression of NAE1 offers promising therapeutic potential for boosting the antitumor CD8+ T cell responses.},

  abstract     = {Recent physical binding screens suggest that protein–metabolite interactions are more extensive than previously recognized. To elucidate the functional relevance of these interactions, we developed a mass spectrometry–based screening method for higher throughput in vitro enzyme assays. By systematically quantifying the effects of 79 metabolites on the activity of 20 central Escherichia coli enzymes, we not only assess functional relevance but also gauge the depth of the current understanding of regulatory interactions within one of the best-characterized networks. Our identification of 50 inhibitors and 14 activators not only expands the range of known input signals but also uncovers novel regulatory logic. For instance, we observed that AMP inhibits malic enzyme to safeguard the cyclic operation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and erythrose-4-phosphate inhibits 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase to redirect flux from the pentose phosphate pathway into the Entner–Doudoroff pathway. Discrepancies between our standardized assays and existing database entries suggest that many previously reported interactions might occur only under specific, often nonphysiological conditions. Our dataset represents a systematically determined functional protein–metabolite interaction network, establishing a baseline for allosteric regulation in central metabolism. These results enhance our understanding of the regulatory logic governing metabolic processes and underscore its significance in cellular adaptation and growth.},

The triscatechol siderophores trivanchrobactin and ruckerbactin, produced by Vibrio campbellii DS40M4 and Yersinia ruckeri YRB, respectively, are naturally occurring diastereomers that form chiral ferric complexes in opposing enantiomeric configurations. Chiral recognition is a hallmark of specificity in biological systems, yet the biological consequences of chiral coordination compounds are relatively unexplored. We demonstrate stereoselective discrimination of microbial growth and iron uptake by chiral Fe(III)–siderophores. The siderophore utilization pathway in V. campbellii DS40M4 is stereoselective for Λ-Fe(III)–trivanchrobactin, but not the mismatched Δ-Fe(III)–ruckerbactin diastereomer. Chiral recognition is likely conferred by the stereospecificity of both the outer membrane receptor (OMR) protein FvtA and the periplasmic binding protein (PBP) FvtB, both of which must interact preferentially with the Λ-configured Fe(III)-coordination complexes.},

  abstract     = {Differential isotope effects are an emerging tool for discovering possible nontrivial quantum mechanical effects within biological systems. However, it is often nearly impossible to elucidate the exact mechanisms by which a biological isotope effect manifests due to the complexity of these systems. As such, one proposed in vitro system of study for a quantum isotope effect is calcium phosphate aggregation, where symmetric calcium phosphate molecular species, known as Posner molecules, have been theorized to have phosphorus nuclear spin–dependent self-binding rates, which could be differently modulated by doping with stable lithium isotopes. Here, we present in vitro evidence for such a differential lithium isotope effect on the formation and aggregation of amorphous calcium phosphate from solution under certain conditions. Experiments confirm that lithium incorporates into amorphous calcium phosphate, with 7 Li found to promote a greater abundance of observable calcium phosphate particles than 6 Li under identical solution preparations. These in vitro results offer a potential explanation for in vivo biological studies that have shown differential lithium isotope effects. Given the importance of calcium phosphate in biological systems—ranging from mitochondrial signaling pathways to key biomineralization processes, as well as the proposed role of Posner molecules as a “neural qutrit”—these results present an important step in understanding calcium phosphate nucleation as well as the potential role of calcium phosphate for quantum biology and processing.},

  abstract     = {Photosynthesis converts solar energy to chemical energy by splitting water molecules and carbon dioxide to produce oxygen and carbohydrates with an efficiency that engineers working on solar energy device can only dream of. Photosystem II (PSII) is the enzyme that catalyzes the light-driven oxidation of water that occurs during photosynthesis. This oxygen-producing reaction occurs in the Mn 4 Ca cluster found inside the enzyme’s oxygen-evolving center (OEC). Even though the structure and mechanism of action of the OEC have been intensively investigated for many decades, questions still remain about both. The Mn 4 Ca cluster stores the high-energy oxidizing equivalents required for water oxidation so that its own oxidation state depends on its chemical composition, i.e., the number of its oxygen ligands. The issue addressed here is the number of oxygen ligands associated with the Mn 4 Ca cluster after PSII has been exposed to two of the four flashes of light necessary for it to produce an oxygen molecule, PSII 2F. Comparisons of recently published cryo-EM maps and crystallographic OEC-omit maps described here reveal the OEC structure of PSII 2F contains only five internal oxygen ligands, and that the sixth O ligand identified earlier in PSII 2F crystal structures is an artifact caused by model bias. This finding should have a significant impact on our understanding of the mechanism of water oxidation that is catalyzed by PSII because it is incompatible with prevailing high valence paradigm (HVP) models for this process.},

  abstract     = {Androgen and estrogen, key sex hormones, were long thought to be exclusively produced by vertebrates. The O 2 -dependent aromatase that converts androgen to estrogen (estrogenesis) has never been identified in any prokaryotes. Here, we report the finding of anaerobic estrogenesis in a Peptococcaceae bacterium ( Phosphitispora sp. strain TUW77) isolated from the gut of the great blue-spotted mudskipper ( Boleophthalmus pectinirostris ). This strain exhibits testosterone fermentation pathways, transforming testosterone into estrogens and androstanediol under anaerobic conditions. Physiological experiments revealed that strain TUW77 grows exclusively on testosterone, utilizing the androgenic C-19 methyl group as both the carbon source and electron donor. The genomic analysis identified three copies of a polycistronic gene cluster, abeABC (anaerobic bacterial estrogenesis), encoding components of a classic cobalamin-dependent methyltransferase system. These genes, highly expressed under testosterone-fed conditions, show up to 57% protein identity to the characterized EmtAB from denitrifying Denitratisoma spp., known for methylating estrogen into androgen (the reverse reaction). Tiered transcriptomic and proteomic analyses suggest that the removed C-19 methyl group is completely oxidized to CO 2 via the oxidative Wood–Ljungdahl pathway (WLP), while the reducing equivalents (NADH) fully reduce remaining testosterone to androstanediol. Consistently, the addition of anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate, an extracellular electron acceptor, to testosterone-fed TUW77 cultures enabled complete testosterone conversion into estrogen without androstanediol accumulation (anaerobic testosterone oxidation). This finding of aromatase-independent estrogenesis in anaerobic bacteria suggests that the ancient WLP may have contributed to the emergence of estrogens in the early biosphere.},

  abstract     = {In the polar regions, which are vulnerable receptors of mercury pollution, atmospheric mercury depletion events (AMDEs) efficiently convert elemental mercury (Hg(0)) into oxidized mercury (Hg(II)) via bromine oxidation. Hg(II) subsequently deposits onto snow and sea ice. While field observations have shown that a large percentage of deposited mercury is re-emitted from the ice to the atmosphere by a photoinduced process, the fundamental photochemistry that drives the re-emission process remains unknown. Here, using multiconfigurational quantum chemistry, we find that the photoreduction of HgBr 2 , HgBr 3 − , and HgBr 4 2− in ice is more efficient than in the gas phase. This results from the influence of water molecules on the molecular geometry and electronic structure of mercuric bromides in ice, which enhances the absorption intensities at wavelengths relevant in the troposphere (λ &gt; 290 nm), as compared to gas phase. Kinetic modeling shows that ~30 to 60% of deposited mercury in AMDEs can be reemitted due to the photoreduction of mercuric bromides in ice, in agreement with field observations. Our results reveal a photoreduction mechanism of sunlight-induced excited state chemistry of mercuric bromides on ice. These findings strongly suggest that this chemistry should be incorporated into atmospheric models to account for ice-atmosphere mercury cycling in the polar environments, currently not considered.},

  abstract     = {UvrD-family helicases are superfamily 1A motor proteins that function during DNA replication, recombination, repair, and transcription. UvrD family monomers translocate along single-stranded (ss) DNA but need to be activated by dimerization to unwind DNA in the absence of force or accessory factors. However, prior structural studies have only revealed monomeric complexes. Here, we report the first structures of a dimeric UvrD-family helicase, Mycobacterium tuberculosis UvrD1, both free and bound to a DNA junction. In each structure, the dimer interface occurs between the 2B subdomains of each subunit. The apo UvrD1 dimer is observed in symmetric compact and extended forms indicating substantial flexibility. This symmetry is broken in the DNA-bound dimer complex with leading and trailing subunits adopting distinct conformations. Biochemical experiments reveal that the Escherichia coli UvrD dimer shares the same 2B–2B interface. In contrast to the dimeric structures, an inactive, autoinhibited UvrD1 DNA-bound monomer structure reveals 2B subdomain–DNA contacts that are likely inhibitory. The major reorientation of the 2B subdomains that occurs upon UvrD1 dimerization prevents these duplex DNA interactions, thus relieving the autoinhibition. These structures reveal that the 2B subdomain serves a major regulatory role rather than participating directly in DNA unwinding.},

  abstract     = {Bdelloid rotifers are well known for their abilities to survive long periods of freezing as well as acquire foreign genes. Recently sequenced genomes of some bdelloid rotifers in England were found to encode several proteins similar to ice-binding proteins (IBPs) that are usually associated with freeze–thaw tolerance. Here, I describe bdelloid rotifers inhabiting an algal patch in Antarctica that have multiple homologs of these genes. Structures of the proteins predicted by AlphaFold show that they are well designed for ice-binding and a recombinant protein made for one of them showed strong ice-binding activity. The existence of multiple copies of these proteins is another characteristic of IBPs. Furthermore, multiple bdelloid rotifers in the algal patch were revived in less than an hour after storage at −25 °C for 24 y, an apparent record for laboratory-controlled studies. Several characteristics of these genes point to bacteria as their source: sequence homology, absence of introns, and a structural peculiarity so far found only in bacteria. The remarkable freezing tolerance of bdelloid rotifers can thus be at least partially attributed to horizontally acquired bacterial genes encoding IBPs.},

Intriguingly, those genes are duplicated and clustered in the genome during evolution, including Dux cluster, Obox, and Zscan4 family members in mice. However, the contribution and biological significance of the totipotency-related gene duplication events in early embryo development remain poorly understood. Here, we focus on Dux cluster, the master regulator of ZGA that is necessary and sufficient for the induction of 2C-like cells and activation of totipotency-related genes in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). By reducing Dux gene copies from 31 to 0 or 1 through CRISPR-Cas9 technology, we generate Dux -KO and Dux (n = 1) mESC lines, respectively. We uncover that the totipotency-related gene transcriptional profile is awakened to a much lesser extent in Dux (n = 1) mESCs compared to wild type mESCs following global DNA demethylation reprogramming or induction of DNA damage, mimicking the intrinsic events in preimplantation development. Together, Dux cluster duplication is critically required for full activation of ZGA transcripts.},

Our model shows that random cell pulsation fluidizes solid epithelial tissues into a hyperuniform fluid state, while pulsation synchronization inhibits the fluidity and causes a reverse solidification. Our results indicate this solidification is a Berezinskii–Kosterlitz–Thouless-type transition, characterized by strong density/dynamic heterogeneity arising from the annihilation of topological defects in the pulsating phase space. The magnitude and length scale of density heterogeneity diverge with the pulsating period, resulting in an opposite giant density fluctuation or anti-hyperuniformity. We propose a fluctuating hydrodynamic theory that can unify the two opposite anomalous fluctuation phenomena.

Additionally, associations between air pollutants and the risk of COVID-19 severity (hospitalization and death) were evaluated in a COVID-19 infection cohort (n = 110,216). Furthermore, this study investigated the role of host genetic susceptibility in the relationships between exposure to air pollutants and the development of COVID-19-related outcomes. Long-term exposure to air pollutants was significantly associated with an increased risk of COVID-19-related outcomes in the COVID-19 naive cohort. Similarly, in COVID-19 infection cohort, hazard ratios (HRs) for COVID-19 hospital admission were 1.23 (1.19, 1.27) for PM 2.5 and 1.22 (1.17, 1.26) for PM 10 , whereas HRs for COVID-19 death were 1.28 (1.18, 1.39) for PM 2.5 and 1.25 (1.16, 1.36) for PM 10 . Notably, significant interactions were found between PM 2.5 /PM 10 and genetic susceptibility in COVID-19 death. In COVID-19 infection cohort, participants with both high genetic risk and high air pollutants exposure had 1.86- to 1.97-fold and 1.91- to 2.14-fold higher risk of COVID-19 hospitalization and death compared to those with both low genetic risk and low air pollutants exposure.

Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations showed that binding the CA motif of the nucleation-promoting factor Neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein (N-WASp) to inactive, splayed Arp2/3 complex shifts it toward the short-pitch active conformation and opens a binding site for an actin monomer on Arp3.

We show that serotypes AAV8, AAV9, and AAVPHP.eB are suitable viral vectors to infect both excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations of the axolotl brain. We further use AAV9 to trace retrograde and anterograde projections between the retina and the brain and identify a cell population projecting from the brain to the retina. Together, our work establishes AAVs as a powerful tool to interrogate neuronal organization in the axolotl.},

  abstract     = {Viruses have evolved unique strategies to circumvent host control of protein synthesis and enable viral protein synthesis in the face of the host response. Defining the factors that regulate viral messenger RNA (mRNA) translation is thus critical to understand how viruses replicate and cause disease. To identify factors that might regulate viral mRNA translation, we developed a technique for identifying proteins associated with a native RNA expressed from its endogenous promoter and genomic locus. This approach uses a guide RNA to target dCas13b fused to a biotin ligase domain to a specific RNA, where it covalently labels proteins in close proximity. Using this approach, we identified multiple proteins associated with transcripts encoding the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) IE1 and IE2 proteins and found that several associated proteins positively or negatively regulate HCMV replication. We confirmed that one such protein, the cellular Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX1), binds to HCMV immediate early mRNAs and is required for efficient viral protein expression and virus replication. Ablating YBX1 expression reduced the association of HCMV immediate early mRNAs with polysomes, demonstrating a role for YBX1 as a positive regulator of viral RNA translation. These results provide a powerful tool for unraveling RNA–protein interactions that can be used in a wide range of biological processes and reveal a role for YBX1 as a critical regulator of HCMV immediate early gene expression.},

Among them, Bi 2 O 2 NCN-derived catalyst possesses optimum performance of electrochemical CO 2 -to-formate, exhibiting an upsurge of Faradaic efficiency to 98.3% at –0.6 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrodes. In-situ infrared and electrochemical impedance spectra trace and interpret the superior performance.

Concurrently, theoretical insights garnered from multiscale/multilevel computational analyses harmoniously corroborate the experimental findings.

  abstract     = {Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy is a key clinical predictor of heart failure. High-throughput and AI-driven screens have the potential to identify drugs and downstream pathways that modulate cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Here, we developed LogiRx, a logic-based mechanistic machine learning method that predicts drug-induced pathways. We applied LogiRx to discover how drugs discovered in a previous compound screen attenuate cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. We experimentally validated LogiRx predictions in neonatal cardiomyocytes, adult mice, and two patient databases. Using LogiRx, we predicted antihypertrophic pathways for seven drugs currently used to treat noncardiac disease. We experimentally validated that escitalopram (Lexapro) and mifepristone inhibit hypertrophy of cultured cardiomyocytes in two contexts. The LogiRx model predicted that escitalopram prevents hypertrophy through an “off-target” serotonin receptor/PI3Kγ pathway, mechanistically validated using additional investigational drugs. Further, escitalopram reduced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in a mouse model of hypertrophy and fibrosis. Finally, mining of both FDA and University of Virginia databases showed that patients with depression on escitalopram have a lower incidence of cardiac hypertrophy than those prescribed other serotonin reuptake inhibitors that do not target the serotonin receptor. Mechanistic machine learning by LogiRx discovers drug pathways that perturb cell states, which may enable repurposing of escitalopram and other drugs to limit cardiac remodeling through off-target pathways.},

  abstract     = {The retina is responsible for converting light into electrical signals that, when transmitted to the brain, create the sensation of vision. The mammalian retina is epigenetically unique since the differentiation of retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) into retinal cells is accompanied by a decrease in DNA methylation in the promoters of many genes important for retinal development and function. However, the pathway responsible for DNA demethylation and its role in retinal development and function were unknown. We hypothesized that the Ten-Eleven Translocation (TET) family of dioxygenases plays a key role in this pathway. To this end, we knocked out the TET family in RPCs and characterized the TET-deficient and control retinas using various approaches including electron microscopy, electroretinogram tests, TUNEL, RNA-seq, WGBS, and 5hmC-Seal. We found that while the TET-dependent DNA demethylation pathway contributes to the development of many retinal cell types, it is the most significant contributor to rod and cone photoreceptor development and function. We found that genetic ablation of TET enzymes in RPCs prevents demethylation and the activity of genes essential for rod specification and for rod and cone maturation. Reduced activity of genes responsible for rod specification results in the TET-deficient retina being depleted of these neurons. Meanwhile, reduced activity of genes responsible for rod and cone maturation leads to the underdevelopment or complete absence of outer segments and synaptic termini in the TET-deficient photoreceptors, which results in loss of their function and leads to blindness. These function-deprived, underdeveloped photoreceptors die over time, leading to retinal dystrophy.},

  abstract     = {Variants with large effect contribute to congenital heart disease (CHD). To date, recessive genotypes (RGs) have commonly been implicated through anecdotal ascertainment of consanguineous families and candidate gene-based analysis; the recessive contribution to the broad range of CHD phenotypes has been limited. We analyzed whole exome sequences of 5,424 CHD probands. Rare damaging RGs were estimated to contribute to at least 2.2% of CHD, with greater enrichment among laterality phenotypes (5.4%) versus other subsets (1.4%). Among 108 curated human recessive CHD genes, there were 66 RGs, with 54 in 11 genes with &gt;1 RG, 12 genes with 1 RG, and 85 genes with zero. RGs were more prevalent among offspring of consanguineous union (4.7%, 32/675) than among nonconsanguineous probands (0.7%, 34/4749). Founder variants in GDF1 and PLD1 accounted for 74% of the contribution of RGs among 410 Ashkenazi Jewish probands. We identified genome-wide significant enrichment of RGs in C1orf127 , encoding a likely secreted protein expressed in embryonic mouse notochord and associated with laterality defects. Single-cell transcriptomes from gastrulation-stage mouse embryos revealed enrichment of RGs in genes highly expressed in the cardiomyocyte lineage, including contractility-related genes MYH6, UNC45B , MYO18B , and MYBPC3 in probands with left-sided CHD, consistent with abnormal contractile function contributing to these malformations. Genes with significant RG burden account for 1.3% of probands, more than half the inferred total. These results reveal the recessive contribution to CHD, and indicate that many genes remain to be discovered, with each likely accounting for a very small fraction of the total.},

Here, we elucidate the molecular mechanism of HeE1-2Tyr-mediated SARS-CoV-2 RdRp inhibition. Biochemical assays confirm that HeE1-2Tyr inhibits RdRp with an IC 50 of 5 µM and show that it competes with RNA binding to RdRp in vitro. Structural analysis using cryo-EM reveals that a stack of three HeE1-2Tyr molecules binds to the RNA binding site of RdRp.

We have mapped the causal contribution of different brain parts to grasping behavior by studying the kinematic parameters of 33 patients with brain tumors, engaged in actions directed toward objects of different sizes. Using motion capture techniques, we analyzed the dynamics of grip aperture and wrist transport. Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping analysis was applied to correlate lesion volumes with specific behavioral deficits. Results showed that lesions in the anterior and lateral bank of the intraparietal sulcus produced impaired finger scaling related to object size. Conversely, impaired velocity of finger aperture was associated with lesions in the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd). Grip aperture deficits following dominant hemisphere lesions were bilateral and were unilateral when following nondominant hemisphere lesions. Impaired wrist transport during reaching was associated with lesions in the first segment of the superior longitudinal fasciculus. Our work highlights an architecture of the grasping network in humans, with unique species-specific features. We hypothesize a model of human neural architecture in which object geometry for hand preshaping is first coded in the left anterior intraparietal cortex and then shared with the right hemisphere. Execution of the motor program of hand preshaping is then performed by the PMd on the corresponding side.},

Structural studies of secreted mucins are complicated by the enormous sizes, flexibility, and complex supramolecular assembly modes of these glycoproteins. The two major respiratory mucins are MUC5AC and MUC5B. Here, we present structures of a large amino-terminal segment of MUC5AC in the form of helical filaments. These filaments differ from filamentous and tubular structures observed previously for the intestinal mucin MUC2 and the partial mucin homolog VWF. Nevertheless, the MUC5AC helical filaments support the proposed mechanism, based on MUC2 and VWF, for how noncovalent interactions between mucin monomers guide disulfide crosslinking to form polymers. The high-resolution MUC5AC structures show how local and limited changes in amino acid sequence can profoundly affect higher-order assembly while preserving the overall folds and polymerization activity of mucin glycoproteins. Differences in supramolecular assembly are likely to be functionally significant considering the divergence of mechanical properties and physiological requirements between respiratory and intestinal mucins. Determining the high-resolution structures of respiratory mucins provides a foundation for understanding the mechanisms by which they clean and protect the lungs. Moreover, the MUC5AC structure enables visualization of the sites of human amino acid sequence variation and disease-associated mutations.},

  abstract     = {Molecular-level understanding of the early stage of crystallization remains a significant challenge. For a wide range of fundamental research and applications, it is of great importance to understand the mechanism of crystal polymorph selections in different solvents or in the presence of additives. We studied glycine crystallization in aqueous solution with or without the addition of sodium chloride (NaCl), one crystal nucleation at a time, using the recently developed single-crystal nucleation spectroscopy (SCNS). It has been reported that glycine forms γ-glycine when salt is added to aqueous solution, and the mechanism has been considered as a classical nucleation where γ-glycine forms directly as a crystal nucleus. Our study shows that metastable polymorph β-glycine forms first in aqueous solution both with or without NaCl through a nonclassical nucleation pathway. NaCl can stabilize the metastable β-glycine over several hours and also prevent it from converting to α-glycine. Eventually γ-glycine nucleates on the surface of β-glycine and then grows while dissolving the mother β-glycine. The crystal habit of β-glycine suggests that the stabilization by NaCl occurs at its polar face. SCNS provides crucial information to accelerate the investigation of the early stage of crystallization toward the rational control of polymorphisms.},

All (+)RNA viruses reorganize cellular membranes from organelles to establish replication compartments (RCs). These RCs are thought to form a platform for membrane-associated replicases, in addition to protecting the viral RNAs from cytosolic innate immune signaling and RNA-degradation machinery. Previous work demonstrated that three families of (+)RNA viruses, namely Bromoviridae , Picornaviridae , and Flaviviridae , commonly induce the accumulation of phosphatidylcholine (PC) at their RCs. This phenomenon suggests a potential avenue for a broad-spectrum antiviral strategy targeting PC metabolism. Our study elucidates three key observations: i) hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection prompts the relocalization of CCTα, the rate-limiting enzyme in PC synthesis, to the RCs; ii) the enhancement of PC synthesis is contingent upon the protease activity of the NS3/4A protein; and iii) utilizing click chemistry, we demonstrate that HCV infection stimulates de novo PC synthesis at the viral replication site through the Kennedy pathway. These findings provide significant insights into the manipulation of lipid metabolism by HCV during RC formation, a mechanism likely conserved across various (+)RNA virus families.},

EndoU functions as an immune antagonist by limiting the accumulation of viral replication intermediates that would otherwise be sensed by the host. Despite being a promising antiviral target, it has been difficult to develop small-molecule inhibitors that target the EndoU active site. We generated nsp15 mutants of the coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-A59 and identified conserved residues within the amino-terminal domain that are required for EndoU activity. Loss of EndoU activity caused the activation of host sensors, which limited viral replication in interferon-responsive cells and attenuated disease in MHV-infected mice. Using transcriptional profiling, we found that MHV EndoU mutant viruses upregulate multiple host sensors, including Z-form nucleic acid-binding protein 1 (ZBP1). We found that nsp15 mutants induced early, robust ZBP1-mediated necroptosis. EndoU mutant viruses also induced ZBP1-independent apoptosis and pyroptosis pathways, causing early, robust cell death that limits virus replication and pathogenesis. Overall, we document the importance of the amino-terminal domain for EndoU function. We also highlight the importance of nsp15/EndoU activity for evading host sensors, delaying cell death, and promoting pathogenesis.},

  abstract     = {Recent scanning-tunneling microscopy on hole-doped Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8 , one of the materials of the cuprate family, finds a long-range ordered spontaneous splitting of the energy levels of oxygen orbitals inside the CuO 2 unit cells [S. Wang et al ., Nat. Mat. 23, 492–498 (2024)]. This spontaneous intra-unit-cell orbital ordering, also known as electronic nematicity, breaks C 4 symmetry and is thought to arise from the Coulomb interaction (denoted by V pp ) between oxygen p x and p y electrons. In this work, we study the spontaneous emergence of electronic nematicity within the three-band Hubbard [aka the Emery-VSA (Varma-Schmitt-Rink-Abrahams) model], using cluster dynamical mean-field theory. This method incorporates short-range electronic correlations and gives us access to the density of states, a quantity that is directly probed in experiments. We argue that there is a delicate competition between V pp and V pd (the latter being the Coulomb interaction between copper d x 2 − y 2 and oxygen p x , y electrons) that must be taken into account in order to find a Zhang-Rice singlet band well-resolved from the upper Hubbard band, and a splitting of the charge-transfer band (one of the signatures of charge nematicity) by roughly 50 meV, as observed recently.},

  abstract     = {The progression of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from its onset due to disease or trauma to either recovery or death is poorly understood. Currently, there are no generally accepted treatments aside from supportive care using mechanical ventilation. However, this can lead to ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), which contributes to a 30 to 40% mortality rate. In this study, we develop and demonstrate a technique to quantify forms of energy transport and dissipation during mechanical ventilation to directly evaluate their relationship to VILI. A porcine ARDS model was used, with ventilation parameters independently controlling lung overdistension and alveolar/airway recruitment/derecruitment (RD). Hourly measurements of airflow, tracheal and esophageal pressures, respiratory system impedance, and oxygen transport were taken for six hours following lung injury to track energy transfer and lung function. The final degree of injury was assessed histologically. Total and dissipated energies were quantified from lung pressure–volume relationships and subdivided into contributions from airflow, tissue viscoelasticity, and RD. Only RD correlated with physiologic recovery. Despite accounting for a very small fraction (2 to 5%) of the total energy dissipation, RD is damaging because it occurs quickly over a very small area. We estimate power intensity of RD energy dissipation to be 100 W/m 2 , equivalent to 10% of the Sun’s luminance at the Earth’s surface. Minimizing repetitive RD events may thus be crucial for mitigating VILI.},

Dominant mutations in DNM2 , encoding the large GTPase dynamin 2, result in CMT without any suggested therapeutic strategy. Different dominant mutations in DNM2 also cause centronuclear myopathy (CNM), and increasing BIN1 (amphiphysin 2), an endogenous modulator of DNM2, rescued CNM in mice. Here, we found that increasing BIN1 level exacerbated the phenotypes of the Dnm2 K562E/+ mouse carrying the most common DNM2 -CMT mutation. Conversely, whole-body reduction of Bin1 expression level, through the generation of Dnm2 K562E/+ mice with heterozygous loss of BIN1, restored motor performance and ameliorated muscle organization and structural defects of peripheral nerves. The rescue of motor defects was maintained at least up to 1 y of age. BIN1 inhibited the GTPase activity of DNM2, and the rescue was driven by an increased activity of the K562E DNM2 -CMT mutant, and a normalization of integrin localization in muscle. Overall, this study highlights BIN1 as a modifier of DNM2 -CMT, and its reduction as a potential therapeutic strategy. It also revealed an opposite pathological mechanism and inverse therapeutic concepts for DNM2 -CMT peripheral neuropathy versus DNM2 -CNM myopathy.},

  abstract     = {Changing a circuit dynamically, without actually changing the hardware itself, is called reconfiguration, and is of great importance due to its manifold technological applications. Circuit reconfiguration appears to be a feature of the cerebral cortex, so understanding the dynamical principles underlying self-reconfiguration may prove of import to elucidate brain function. We present a very simple example of dynamical reconfiguration: a family of networks whose signal pathways can be switched on the fly, only through use of their inputs, with no changes to their synaptic weights. These are single-layer convolutional recurrent network with local unitary synaptic weights and a smooth sigmoidal activation function. We generate traveling waves using the high spatiotemporal frequencies of the input, and we use the low spatiotemporal frequencies of the input to landscape the ongoing activity, channeling said traveling waves through an input-specified spatial pattern. This mechanism uses inherent properties of marginally stable, dynamically critical systems, which are a direct consequence of their unitary convolution kernels: every network in the family can do this. We show these networks solve the classical connectedness detection problem, by allowing signal propagation only along the regions to be evaluated for connectedness, and forbidding it elsewhere.},

In this paper, we report that vimentin forms liquid condensates which appear to enable rapid filament growth. Given the transient nature of these droplets, we focus on properties of vimentin-Y117L, which has a point mutation that leads to formation of condensates but not IFs, enabling us to study these droplets in detail. The droplets dissolve under 1,6-Hexanediol treatment and under decreasing concentration, confirming that they are liquid, and phase separated. These condensates extensively wet actin stress fibers, rendering them resistant to actin-binding drugs and protecting them from depolymerization. We show similar behavior occurs in wild-type vimentin during its assembly into filaments.},

  abstract     = {Despite the growing number of G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) structures being resolved, the dynamic process of how GPCRs transit from the inactive toward the active state remains unclear. In this study, comprehensive molecular dynamics simulations were performed to explore how ligand binding modulates the conformational dynamics of the M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M2R). We observed a sequential occurrence of structural changes in the inactive-to-active transition of M2R induced by a superagonist iperoxo, which includes the orthosteric binding site contraction, the TM6 opening into an intermediate conformation, and a further structural change toward full activation upon binding to G protein or a G protein mimetic nanobody. Two activation intermediates were identified, which show structural features different from those reported for apo-GPCRs. Moreover, our results suggest that stabilization of a specific W400 6.48 conformation and enhanced F396 6.44 dynamics are crucial for activation, whereas distinct side-chain rotamer equilibriums of Y206 5.58 in the cytoplasmic cavity are correlated with agonist efficacies. Our work provides atomic-level structural insights into the agonist-induced M2R activation pathway and highlights a mechanism by which ligand efficacy can be encoded and transduced in the form of aromatic ring dynamics.},

  abstract     = {To accurately describe the energetics of transition metal systems, density functional approximations (DFAs) must provide a balanced description of s- and d- electrons. One measure of this is the sd transfer error, which has previously been defined as E ( 3 d n − 1 4 s 1 ) − E ( 3 d n − 2 4 s 2 ) . Theoretical concerns have been raised about this definition due to its evaluation of excited-state energies using ground-state DFAs. A more serious concern appears to be strong correlation in the 4s 2 configuration. Here, we define a ground-state measure of the sd energy imbalance, based on the errors of s- and d-electron second ionization energies of the 3d atoms, that effectively circumvents the aforementioned problems. We find an improved performance as we move from the local spin density approximation (LSDA) to the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA) to the regularized and restored Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed (r 2 SCAN) meta-GGA for first-row transition metal atoms. However, we find large (∼2 eV) ground-state sd energy imbalances when applying a Perdew–Zunger 1981 self-interaction correction. This is attributed to an “energy penalty” associated with the noded 3d orbitals. A local scaling of the self-interaction correction to LSDA results in a balance of s- and d-errors.},

TEX38 interacts and colocalizes with ZDHHC19, a testis-enriched acyltransferase catalyzing protein S-palmitoylation, at the plasma membrane of spermatids. ZDHHC19 and TEX38 are each downregulated in mouse testes lacking the other protein. TEX38 stabilizes and localizes ZDHHC19 to the plasma membrane of cultured cells and vice versa, consolidating their interdependence. Mice deficient in ZDHHC19 or harboring a C142S mutation that disables the palmitoyltransferase activity of ZDHHC19 display phenotypes resembling those of Tex38 KO mice. Strikingly, ZDHHC19 palmitoylates ARRDC5, an arrestin family protein regulating sperm differentiation.

  abstract     = {The continued emergence of antimalarial drug resistance highlights the need to develop new antimalarial therapies. Unfortunately, new drug development is often hampered by undesirable drug-like properties of lead compounds. Prodrug approaches temporarily mask undesirable compound features, improving bioavailability and target penetration. We have found that lipophilic diester prodrugs of phosphonic acid antibiotics, such as fosmidomycin (Fsm), exhibit significantly higher antimalarial potency than their parent compounds [R.L. Edwards et al. , Sci. Rep. 7 , 8400 (2017)]. However, the activating enzymes for these prodrugs were unknown. Here, we show that an erythrocyte enzyme, acylpeptide hydrolase (APEH), is the major activating enzyme of multiple lipophilic ester prodrugs. Surprisingly, this enzyme is taken up by the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum , where it localizes to the parasite cytoplasm and retains enzymatic activity. Using a fluorogenic ester library, we characterize the structure–activity relationship of APEH and compare it to that of P. falciparum esterases. We show that parasite-internalized APEH plays an important role in the activation of substrates with branching at the alpha carbon, in keeping with its exopeptidase activity. Our findings highlight a mechanism for antimicrobial prodrug activation, relying on a host-derived enzyme to yield activation at a microbial target. Mutations in prodrug-activating enzymes are a common mechanism for antimicrobial drug resistance [E. S. Istvan et al. , Nat. Commun. 8 , 14240 (2017); K. M. V. Sindhe et al. , mBio 11 , e02640-19 (2020); J. H. Butler et al. , Acs Infect Dis. 6 , 2994–3003 (2020)].

  abstract     = {Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) are the most abundant cell type in the artery’s media layer and regulate vascular tone and lesion remodeling during atherogenesis. Like monocyte-derived macrophages, VSMCs accumulate excess lipids and contribute to the total intimal foam cell population in human coronary plaques and mouse aortic atheroma. While there are extensive studies characterizing the contribution of lipid metabolism in macrophage immunometabolic responses in atherosclerotic plaques, the role of VSMC lipid metabolism in regulating vascular function and lesion remodeling in vivo remains poorly understood. Here, we report that the liver X receptor (LXR) signaling pathway in VSMC is continuously activated during atherogenesis. Notably, we found that LXR deficiency in SMCs under hypercholesterolemic conditions influenced lesion remodeling by altering the fate of dedifferentiated SMCs and promoting the accumulation of VSMC-derived transitional cells. This phenotypic switching was accompanied by reduced indices of plaque stability, characterized by a larger necrotic core area and reduced fibrous cap thickness. Moreover, SMC-specific LXR deficiency impaired vascular function and caused visceral myopathy characterized by maladaptive bladder remodeling and gut lipid malabsorption. Mechanistically, we found that the expression of several genes involved in cholesterol efflux and FA synthesis including Abca1 , Srebf1 , Scd1 , Scd2 , Acsl3, and Mid1ip1 was downregulated in mice lacking LXRαβ in SMCs, likely contributing to the phenotypic switching of VSMC in the atherosclerotic lesions.},

  abstract     = {Visually categorizing and comparing materials is crucial for everyday behavior, but what organizational principles underlie our mental representation of materials? Here, we used a large-scale data-driven approach to uncover core latent dimensions of material representations from behavior. First, we created an image dataset of 200 systematically sampled materials and 600 photographs (STUFF dataset, https://osf.io/myutc/ ). Using these images, we next collected 1.87 million triplet similarity judgments and used a computational model to derive a set of sparse, positive dimensions underlying these judgments. The resulting multidimensional embedding space predicted independent material similarity judgments and the similarity matrix of all images close to the human intersubject consistency. We found that representations of individual images were captured by a combination of 36 material dimensions that were highly reproducible and interpretable, comprising perceptual (e.g., grainy, blue) as well as conceptual (e.g., mineral, viscous) dimensions. These results provide the foundation for a comprehensive understanding of how humans make sense of materials.},

  abstract     = {When placed on an inclined plane, a perfect 2D disk or 3D sphere simply rolls down in a straight line under gravity. But how is the rolling affected if these shapes are irregular or random? Treating the terminal rolling speed as an order parameter, we show that there are qualitative transitions in the speed as a function of the dimension of the state space and inertia. We calculate the scaling exponents and the macroscopic lag time associated with the presence of first- and second-order transitions and describe the regimes of coexistence of stable states and the accompanying hysteresis. Experiments with rolling cylinders corroborate our theoretical results on the scaling of the lag time. Experiments with spheres reveal closed orbits and their period-doubling in the overdamped and inertial limits, respectively, providing visible manifestations of the hairy ball theorem and the doubly connected nature of S O ( 3 ) , the space of 3D rotations. Going beyond simple curiosity, our study might shed light on a number of natural and artificial systems that involve the rolling of irregular objects, ranging from nanoscale cellular transport to robotics.},

  abstract     = {Molecular research suggests that avocados ( Persea americana Mill.) were domesticated multiple times in the Americas. Seed exchange, hybridization, and cloning have played an essential role across their wild distribution from Mexico to South America to create the modern varieties of today. Archaeological sites with well-preserved and directly radiocarbon-dated botanical assemblages are rare, however, so we know very little about the complexities of the domestication process. Here, we define an early locus of avocado domestication using well-dated desiccated and carbonized avocado remains from El Gigante rockshelter in western Honduras spanning the last 11,000 y. Measurements of avocado seeds and rinds show evidence for long-term management resulting in selection for larger, more robust fruits through time that culminated by 2,250 to 2,080 calendar B.P. (cal. B.P.). However, human-directed selection for larger fruits with thicker rinds is evident as early as 7,565 to 7,265 cal. B.P. Seed morphology is similar to P. americana var. guatemalensis and is congruent with genetic data for the development of this variety in both the highlands of Guatemala and Honduras. Increases in seed size and rind thickness through time are consistent with genetic evidence for the enrichment of putative candidate genes for fruit development and ripening in this variety.},

However, a fluidic memristor with ion selectivity as that of natural ion channels remains a key challenge. Herein, inspired by the structure of natural biomembranes, we developed an ion-shuttling memristor (ISM) by utilizing organic solvents and artificial carriers to emulate ion channels embedded in biomembranes, which exhibited both neuromorphic functions and ion selectivity. Pinched hysteresis I-V loop curve, scan rate dependency, and distinctive impedance spectra confirmed the memristive characteristics of the as-prepared device. Moreover, the memory mechanism was discussed theoretically and validated by finite-element modeling. The ISM features multiple neuromorphic functions, such as paired-pulse facilitation, paired-pulse depression, and learning–experience behavior. More importantly, the ion selectivity of the ISM was observed, which allowed further emulation of ion-selective neural functions like resting membrane potential. Benefiting from the structural similarity to membrane-embedded ion channels, the ISM opens the door for ion-based neuromorphic computing and sophisticated chemical regulation by manipulating multifarious ions with neuromorphic functions.},

  abstract     = {Bifacial cambium, which produces xylem and phloem, and monopodial architecture, characterized by apical dominance and lateral branching from axillary buds, are key developmental features of seed plants, consisting of angiosperms and gymnosperms. These allow seed plants to adapt to diverse environments by optimizing resource allocation and structural integrity. In seed plants, SUPPRESSOR OF MAX2-LIKE ( SMXL ) family members function in phloem development and strigolactone-induced inhibition of axillary bud outgrowth. Although strigolactone signaling regulates most SMXL family members, the only known regulator of SMXL4 and SMXL5 is the RNA-binding protein JULGI. We demonstrate that in angiosperms, by directly regulating SMXL4/5 expression, JULGI uncouples SMXL4/5 activity from strigolactone signaling. JULGI and ancestral SMXL s from seedless vascular plants or SMXL4/5 from seed plants are coexpressed in the phloem tissues of vascular plants, from lycophytes to angiosperms. Core angiosperm SMXL4/5 mRNAs contain a G-rich element in the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) that serves as a target sequence for JULGI to negatively regulate SMXL4/5 expression. Heterologous expression of JULGI s from various angiosperms rescued the Arabidopsis jul1 jul2 mutant. Expressing SMXL4/5 s from seed plants and ancestral SMXL s rescued Arabidopsis smxl4 smxl5 . Angiosperm SMXL4/5s lack an RGKT motif for proteasomal degradation. Indeed, treatment with the synthetic strigolactone analog rac -GR24 induced proteasomal degradation of SMXL from ferns and SMXL5a from gymnosperms, but not SMXL4/5 from angiosperms. These findings suggest that in ancestral angiosperms, the 5′ UTR of SMXL4/5 gained G-rich elements, creating a regulatory module with JULGI that allows the phloem development pathway to act independently of strigolactone signaling.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the key drivers of brain aging is essential for effective prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we integrate human brain and physiological data to investigate underlying mechanisms. Functional MRI analyses across four large datasets (totaling 19,300 participants) show that brain networks not only destabilize throughout the lifetime but do so along a nonlinear trajectory, with consistent temporal “landmarks” of brain aging starting in midlife (40s). Comparison of metabolic, vascular, and inflammatory biomarkers implicate dysregulated glucose homeostasis as the driver mechanism for these transitions. Correlation between the brain’s regionally heterogeneous patterns of aging and gene expression further supports these findings, selectively implicating GLUT4 (insulin-dependent glucose transporter) and APOE (lipid transport protein). Notably, MCT2 (a neuronal, but not glial, ketone transporter) emerges as a potential counteracting factor by facilitating neurons’ energy uptake independently of insulin. Consistent with these results, an interventional study of 101 participants shows that ketones exhibit robust effects in restabilizing brain networks, maximized from ages 40 to 60, suggesting a midlife “critical window” for early metabolic intervention.},

  abstract     = {Removing glutamate from the synaptic cleft is vital for proper function of the brain. Excitatory amino acid transporters mediate this process by uptaking the neurotransmitter from the synaptic cleft back to the cell after its release. The archaeal homolog, Glt Ph , an aspartate transporter from Pyrococcus horikoshii , presents the best structurally characterized model for this family of transporters. In order to transport, Glt Ph undergoes elevator-like conformational changes between inward-facing (IF) and outward-facing (OF) states. Here, we characterize, at an atomic level, the OF⇌IF transition of Glt Ph in different apo /bound states using a combination of ensemble-based enhanced sampling techniques, employing more than two thousand of coupled simulation replicas of membrane-embedded Glt Ph . The resulting free-energy profiles portray the transition of apo /bound states as a complex four-stage process, while sodium binding alone locks the structure in one of its states. Along the transition, the transport domain (TD) disengages from the scaffold domain (SD), allowing it to move as a piston sliding vertically with respect to the membrane during the elevator-like motion of TD. Lipid interactions with residues comprising the SD–TD interface directly influence the large-scale conformational changes and, consequently, the energetics of transport. Structural intermediates formed during the transition leak water molecules and may correlate to the uncoupled Cl − ion conductance observed experimentally in both prokaryotic and mammalian glutamate transporters. Mechanistic insights obtained from our study provide a structural framework for better development of therapeutic for neurological disorders.},

Despite the fallibility of the benchmark and outcome tests individually, here we prove a surprisingly strong statistical guarantee: Under a common nonparametric assumption, at least one of the two tests must be correct; consequently, when both tests agree, they are guaranteed to yield correct conclusions. We present empirical evidence that the underlying assumption holds approximately in several important domains, including lending, education, and criminal justice—and that our hybrid test is robust to the moderate violations of the assumption that we observe in practice. Applying this approach to 2.8 million police stops across California, we find evidence of widespread racial discrimination.},

In this study, we first identified a biomimetic solvent to generate triclinic monohydrate crystals, while avoiding the formation of nonphysiological solvates and enabling crystallization at rates where the dynamics of surface growth could be captured in real time. Using a binary mixture of water and isopropanol, with the latter serving as a surrogate for lipids in physiological environments, we show that cholesterol monohydrate crystals grow classically by the nucleation and spreading of crystal layers. Time-resolved imaging confirms that layers are generated by dislocations and monomers incorporate into advancing steps after diffusion along the crystal surface and not directly from the solution. In situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) and microfluidics measurements concertedly reveal abundant macrosteps, which engender a self-inhibition mechanism that reduces the rate of crystal growth. This finding stands in contrast to numerous other systems, in which classical mechanisms lead to unhindered growth by spreading of single layers.},

  abstract     = {Pathogen-derived nuclear localization signals (NLSs) enable vigorous nuclear invasion in the host by the virulence proteins harboring them. Herein, inspired by the robust nuclear import mechanism, we show that NLSs originating from the plant infection–associated Agrobacterium proteins VirD2 and VirE2 can be incorporated into the Cas9 system as efficient nuclear delivery enhancers, thereby improving the low gene-editing frequency in a model microalga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii , caused by poor nuclear localization of the bulky nuclease. Prior to evaluation of the NLSs, IPA1 (Cre04.g215850) was first defined in the alga as the nuclear import-related importin alpha (Impα) that serves as a counterpart adaptor protein of the NLSs, based on extensive in silico analyses considering the protein’s sequence, tertiary folding behavior, and structural basis when interacting with a well-studied SV40TAg NLS. Through precursive affinity explorations, we reproducibly found that the NLSs mediated the binding between the Cas9 and Impα with nM affinities and visually confirmed that the fusion of the NLSs strictly localized the peptide-bearing cargoes in the microalgal nucleus without compensating for their cleavage ability. When employed in a real-world application, the VirD2 NLS increases the mutation frequency (~1.12 × 10 −5 ) over 2.4-fold compared to an archetypal SV40TAg NLS (~0.46 × 10 −5 ) when fused with Cas9. We demonstrate the cross-species versatility of the Impα-dependent strategy by successfully applying it to an industrial alga, Chlorella Sp. HS2. This work, focused on affinity augmentation, provides insights into increasing the frequency of gene editing, which can be advantageously used in programmable mutagenesis with broad applicability.},

  abstract     = {Graphene-based nanostructures hold immense potential as strong and lightweight materials, however, their mechanical properties such as modulus and strength are difficult to fully exploit due to challenges in atomic-scale engineering. This study presents a database of over 2,000 pristine and defective nanoscale CNT bundles and other graphitic assemblies, inspired by microscopy, with associated stress–strain curves from reactive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the reactive INTERFACE force field (IFF-R). These 3D structures, containing up to 80,000 atoms, enable detailed analyses of structure-stiffness-failure relationships. By leveraging the database and physics- and chemistry-informed machine learning (ML), accurate predictions of elastic moduli and tensile strength are demonstrated at speeds 1,000 to 10,000 times faster than efficient MD simulations. Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks with Spatial Information (HS-GNNs) are introduced, which integrate chemistry knowledge. HS-GNNs as well as extreme gradient boosted trees (XGBoost) achieve forecasts of mechanical properties of arbitrary carbon nanostructures with only 3 to 6% mean relative error. The reliability equals experimental accuracy and is up to 20 times higher than other ML methods. Predictions maintain 8 to 18% accuracy for large CNT bundles, CNT junctions, and carbon fiber cross-sections outside the training distribution. The physics- and chemistry-informed HS-GNN works remarkably well for data outside the training range while XGBoost works well with limited training data inside the training range. The carbon nanostructure database is designed for integration with multimodal experimental and simulation data, scalable beyond 100 nm size, and extendable to chemically similar compounds and broader property ranges. The ML approaches have potential for applications in structural materials, nanoelectronics, and carbon-based catalysts.},

  abstract     = {Water usually contains dissolved gases, and because freezing is a purifying process these gases must be expelled for ice to form. Bubbles appear at the freezing front and are then trapped in ice, making pores. These pores come in a range of sizes from microns to millimeters and their shapes are peculiar; never spherical but elongated, and usually fore-aft asymmetric. We show that these remarkable shapes result of a delicate balance between freezing, capillarity, and mass diffusion. A nonlinear ordinary differential equation suffices to describe the bubbles, which features two nondimensional numbers representing the supersaturation and the freezing rate, and two additional parameters representing simultaneous freezing and nucleation treated as the initial condition. Our experiments provide us with a large variety of pictures of bubble shapes. We show that all of these bubbles have their rounded tip well described by an asymptotic regime of the differential equation and that most bubbles can have their full shape quantitatively matched by a full solution. This method enables the measurement of the freezing conditions of ice samples, and the design of freeze-cast porous materials. Furthermore, the equation exhibits a bifurcation that explains why some bubbles grow indefinitely and make long cylindrical “ice worms,” well known to glaciologists.},

  abstract     = {The binding of photoswitchable molecules to partners forms the basis of many naturally occurring light-dependent signaling pathways and various photopharmacological and optogenetic tools. A critical parameter affecting the function of these molecules is the thermal half-life of the light state. Reports in the literature indicate that, in some cases, a binding partner can significantly influence the thermal half-life, while in other cases it has no effect. Here, we present a unifying framework for quantitatively analyzing the effects of binding partners on thermal reversion rates. We focus on photoswitchable protein/binder interactions involving LOV domains, photoactive yellow protein, and CBCR GAF domains with partners that bind either the light or the dark state of the photoswitchable domain. We show that the effect of a binding partner depends on the extent to which the transition state for reversion resembles the dark state or the light state. We quantify this resemblance with a ϕ switching value, where ϕ switching = 1 if the conformation of the part of the photoswitchable molecule that interacts with the binding partner closely resembles its dark state conformation and ϕ switching = 0 if it resembles its light state. In addition to providing information on the transition state for switching, this analysis can guide the design of photoswitchable systems that retain useful thermal half-lives in practice. The analysis also provides a basis for the use of simple kinetic measurements to determine effective changes in affinity even in complex milieu.},

  abstract     = {The outer membrane (OM) of gram-negative bacteria is a robust, impermeable barrier that excludes many classes of antibiotics. Contrary to the classical model of an asymmetric lipid bilayer, recent evidence suggests the OM is predominantly an asymmetric proteolipid membrane (APLM). Outer leaflet lipopolysaccharides (LPS) that surround integral β-barrel outer membrane proteins (OMPs) are shared with other OMPs to form a supramolecular network in which the levels of OMPs approach those of LPS. Some of the most abundant OMPs in the Escherichia coli OM are trimeric porins. How porins and LPS are incorporated into the OM of growing bacteria is poorly understood. Here, we use live-cell imaging and microfluidics to investigate how LPS, labeled using click chemistry, and the porin OmpF, labeled using the bacteriocin colicin N, are incorporated into the E. coli OM. Diffraction-limited fluorescence microscopy shows OmpF and LPS to be uniformly distributed and immobile. However, clustering of both macromolecules becomes evident by superresolution microscopy, which is also the case for their biogenesis proteins, BamA and LptD, respectively. Notwithstanding these common organizational features, OmpF insertion into the OM is cell-cycle-dependent leading to binary partitioning and strong polar accumulation of old OmpF. Old LPS on the other hand is diluted ~50% at each division cycle by new LPS, resulting in only mild polar accumulation of preexisting LPS. We conclude that although LPS and OMPs are destined to form the APLM their insertion dynamics are fundamentally different, which has major implications for understanding how the OM is assembled.},

The spatial component of the density of states for these special polarons is determined by the length scale of spatial modulation of electronegativity caused by a separate set of standalone topological defects. The latter length scale is fixed by the cooperativity size for structural relaxation; the size is largely independent of temperature in the glass but above melting, it decreases with temperature. Thus we predict that the temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity should exhibit a jump in the slope near the glass transition; the size of the jump is predicted to increase with the fragility of the melt. The predicted values of the jump and of the conductivity itself are consistent with experiment.},

  abstract     = {B cell responses to membrane-presented antigens appear to be strongly favored over soluble antigens in vivo suggesting that vaccines that mimic membrane-presented antigens may be highly efficacious. We recently demonstrated that human B cell responses to membrane-associated but not to soluble antigens in vitro depended on the expression and activity of the plasma membrane mechanosensitive ion channel, Piezo1. Here, we provide evidence that the efficacy of the current human papillomavirus virus-like particle (HPV VLP) vaccines may be due in part to their inherent ability to mimic Piezo1-dependent membrane presentation of antigens to B cells. We compared HPV-specific human B cell responses to HPV VLPs versus soluble HPV pentameric capsomeres and showed that although both induced calcium responses, only HPV VLP-induced responses were blocked by Piezo1 inhibitors. The kinetics of internalization of HPV-VLP and capsomeres into HPV-specific B cells were similar and neither required Piezo1 function as shown by small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of Piezo. However, trafficking of HPV-VLPs into intracellular major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, lysosomal associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) + antigen-processing compartments was Piezo1-dependent, whereas trafficking of capsomeres was not. In addition, a time course of intracellular trafficking suggested that colocalization of HPV-VLP with MHC classII was more stable over time as compared to capsomeres. Taken together these findings suggest that the ability of HPV-VLP vaccines to mimic Piezo1-dependent membrane antigen presentation may be exploited in the design of highly effective human vaccines.},

Therefore, we profiled the stool microbiome of people with MS (PwMS) and healthy controls (HC) using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. PwMS showed a distinct microbiome compared to HC, with Prevotella copri ( PC ) and Blautia species as drivers of microbial communities in HC and PwMS, respectively. Administration of MS-driving Blautia species ( Blautia wexlerae; BW ) to mice resulted in increased levels of gut inflammatory markers and altered microbiota with increased capacity to induce proinflammatory cytokines. Utilizing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS, we identified a lower gut Bifidobacterium to Akkermansia ratio as a hallmark of the disease. BW -administered mice also showed a lower Bifidobacterium to Akkermansia ratio pre-EAE induction which correlated with increased disease severity post-EAE induction. The importance of the Bifidobacterium to Akkermansia ratio at the species level, lower Bifidobacterium adolescentis to Akkermansia muciniphila ( BA:AM ), was validated in our MS cohort and a large International Multiple Sclerosis Microbiome Study. Thus, our findings highlight the BA:AM ratio as a potential gut microbial marker in PwMS, opening avenues for microbiome-based diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy in MS.},

  abstract     = {Adaptation is a critical determinant of the diversification, persistence, and geographic range limits of species. Yet the genetic basis of adaptation is often unknown and potentially underpinned by a wide range of mutational types—from single nucleotide changes to large-scale alterations of chromosome structure. Copy number variation (CNV) is thought to be an important source of adaptive genetic variation, as indicated by decades of candidate gene studies that point to CNVs underlying rapid adaptation to strong selective pressures. Nevertheless, population-genomic studies of CNVs face unique logistical challenges not encountered by other forms of genetic variation. Consequently, few studies have systematically investigated the contributions of CNVs to adaptation at a genome-wide scale. We present a genome-wide analysis of CNV contributing to the adaptation of an invasive weed, Ambrosia artemisiifolia . CNVs show clear signatures of parallel local adaptation between North American (native) and European (invaded) ranges, implying widespread reuse of CNVs during adaptation to shared heterogeneous patterns of selection. We used a local principal component analysis (PCA) to genotype CNV regions in whole-genome sequences of samples collected over the last two centuries. We identified 16 large CNV regions of up to 11.85 megabases in length, eight of which show signals of rapid evolutionary change, with pronounced frequency shifts between historic and modern populations. Our results provide compelling genome-wide evidence that CNV underlies rapid adaptation over contemporary timescales of natural populations.},

We then deploy these messages in a large-scale randomized survey experiment ( N = 25,982) to estimate the persuasive capability of each model. Our findings are twofold. First, we find evidence that model persuasiveness is characterized by sharply diminishing returns, such that current frontier models are only slightly more persuasive than models smaller in size by an order of magnitude or more. Second, we find that the association between language model size and persuasiveness shrinks toward zero and is no longer statistically significant once we adjust for mere task completion (coherence, staying on topic), a pattern that highlights task completion as a potential mediator of larger models’ persuasive advantage. Given that current frontier models are already at ceiling on this task completion metric in our setting, taken together, our results suggest that further scaling model size may not much increase the persuasiveness of static LLM-generated political messages.},

  abstract     = {Brain age (BA), distinct from chronological age (CA), can be estimated from MRIs to evaluate neuroanatomic aging in cognitively normal (CN) individuals. BA, however, is a cross-sectional measure that summarizes cumulative neuroanatomic aging since birth. Thus, it conveys poorly recent or contemporaneous aging trends, which can be better quantified by the (temporal) pace P of brain aging. Many approaches to map P , however, rely on quantifying DNA methylation in whole-blood cells, which the blood–brain barrier separates from neural brain cells. We introduce a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) to estimate P noninvasively from longitudinal MRI. Our longitudinal model (LM) is trained on MRIs from 2,055 CN adults, validated in 1,304 CN adults, and further applied to an independent cohort of 104 CN adults and 140 patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In its test set, the LM computes P with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.16 y (7% mean error). This significantly outperforms the most accurate cross-sectional model, whose MAE of 1.85 y has 83% error. By synergizing the LM with an interpretable CNN saliency approach, we map anatomic variations in regional brain aging rates that differ according to sex, decade of life, and neurocognitive status. LM estimates of P are significantly associated with changes in cognitive functioning across domains. This underscores the LM’s ability to estimate P in a way that captures the relationship between neuroanatomic and neurocognitive aging. This research complements existing strategies for AD risk assessment that estimate individuals’ rates of adverse cognitive change with age.},

  abstract     = {Sea otters are an iconic keystone predator that can maintain kelp forests by preying on grazing invertebrates such as sea urchins. However, the effects of sea otters on kelp forests vary over their geographic range. Here, we analyze two 30-y datasets on kelp forest communities during the reintroduction of sea otters along the west coast of Vancouver Island, BC, Canada, and around San Nicolas Island, CA. We developed a community model to estimate species interactions as dynamic rates, varying with community state. We find evidence of a classic trophic cascade off Vancouver Island; the arrival of otters quickly led to depletion of urchins and recovery of kelp. However, this cascade was muted around San Nicolas Island, with otters, urchins, and kelp all coexisting at intermediate densities for multiple years. Our models show that this difference came from a pulse of strong otter impacts on urchins following recolonization off Vancouver Island, but not off San Nicolas Island. The mean effects of otters on urchins and urchins on kelp were not stronger in the north, indicating that interaction dynamics and not average interaction strength are key to explaining differences in community trajectories. We also find stronger multistep interaction chains in the south, arising from competitive interactions that indirectly buffered otter effects. These findings shed light on long-standing hypotheses about how interspecific interactions can alter the function of keystone species across community contexts. More broadly, we show how community change can be more accurately predicted by considering dynamic interaction strengths.},

  abstract     = {Calcifying foraminifera from the orders Rotaliida and Miliolida are widely used as geochemical proxies for recording paleoceanographic conditions, while agglutinated foraminifera are often overlooked since their tests are mostly composed of foreign particles. This study investigated the geochemical properties of Textularia agglutinans, a cosmopolitan agglutinated benthic species from the order Textulariida which has an exceptional inner calcareous test and is evolutionarily basal to Rotaliida. This study confirms the evolutionary link between textulariids and rotaliids based on their geochemistry and establishes T. agglutinans as a geochemical recorder of marine environments. Specimens from the Mediterranean coast of Israel were analyzed using laser ablation ICP-MS and compared to whole-test ICP-MS measurements of rotaliid and miliolid taxa from the same location. An Mg/Ca temperature calibration was established by LA-ICP-MS analyses of cultured specimens at 15, 17, 20, and 25 °C. Results show that T. agglutinans is a mid-Mg species (~19 to ~60 mmol/mol), with an Mg/Ca temperature correlation similar to high-Mg species. Its Pb, Zn, and Mn/Ca ratios are variable, generally overlapping with rotaliids and significantly lower than miliolids. Notably, T. agglutinans exhibits significantly higher Sr/Ca ratios (3.2 to 4.7 mmol/mol) compared to most foraminifera. Raman analyses reveal that the inner wall comprises a mix of aragonite and calcite, explaining these elevated Sr/Ca ratios. Rotaliida are the most prolific group of calcifying foraminifera. Our findings suggest that rotaliid tests evolved from an agglutinated textulariid ancestor with an inner aragonitic wall, a hypothesis that is further supported by the close phylogenetic relationship of the two groups.},

  abstract     = {Planets are often covered with thin cracked shells. From mud films to lithospheres of rock or ice, fracture networks form two-dimensional (2D) tessellations of convex polygons whose geometry encodes their genesis. Here, we chart the geometry of 2D fracture mosaics across the solar system, and decode their formative conditions using a new dynamical crack model. We show that mosaics can be projected onto a Symbolic Ternary Diagram, where the relative proportions of “T,” “X,” and “Y” junctions are uniquely related to contributions from distinct modes of fracture. Most planetary mosaics cluster in a region associated with hierarchical fracture networks, where sequential cracking favors formation of T junctions. Exceptions to this rule may betray the presence of water. Europa’s fracture networks stand apart due to the predominance of X junctions; this is a special feature of ice, where healing of cracks by refreezing of water allows new fractures to overprint older ones. Several fracture networks on Mars appear as outliers due to the high proportion of Y junctions. These patterns—previously interpreted as ancient mudcracks and frozen polar terrain, based on geological evidence—are consistent with the twisting of crack junctions by cyclic volume change. Our findings suggest that counting cracks could aid in the identification of other water-influenced planetary environments.},

  abstract     = {The Mpox virus (MPXV) is an orthopoxvirus that caused a global outbreak in 2022. The poxvirus DNA polymerase complex is responsible for the replication and integrity of the viral genome; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying DNA replication fidelity are still unclear. In this study, we determined the cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the MPXV F8–A22–E4 polymerase holoenzyme in its editing state, in complex with mismatched primer–template DNA and DNA containing uracil deoxynucleotide. We showed that the MPXV polymerase has a similar replication-to-edit transition mechanism to proofread the mismatched nucleotides like the B-family DNA polymerases of other species. The unique processivity cofactor A22–E4 undergoes conformational changes in different working states and might affect the proofreading process. Moreover, we elucidated the base excision repair (BER) function of E4 as a uracil-DNA glycosylase and the coupling mechanism of genome replication and BER, characteristic of poxviruses. Our findings greatly enhance our molecular understanding of DNA replication fidelity of orthopoxviruses and will stimulate the development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs.},

  abstract     = {Contacts between particles in dense, sheared suspensions are believed to underpin much of their rheology. Roughness and adhesion are known to constrain the relative motion of particles, and thus globally affect the shear response, but an experimental description of how they microscopically influence the transmission of forces and relative displacements within contacts is lacking. Here, we show that an innovative colloidal-probe atomic force microscopy technique allows the simultaneous measurement of normal and tangential forces exchanged between tailored surfaces and microparticles while tracking their relative sliding and rolling, unlocking the direct measurement of coefficients of rolling friction, as well as of sliding friction. We demonstrate that, in the presence of sufficient traction, particles spontaneously roll, reducing dissipation and promoting longer-lasting contacts. Conversely, when rolling is prevented, friction is greatly enhanced for rough and adhesive surfaces, while smooth particles coated by polymer brushes maintain well-lubricated contacts. We find that surface roughness induces rolling due to load-dependent asperity interlocking, leading to large off-axis particle rotations. In contrast, smooth, adhesive surfaces promote rolling along the principal axis of motion. Our results offer direct values of friction coefficients for numerical studies and an interpretation of the onset of discontinuous shear thickening based on them, opening up ways to tailor rheology via contact engineering.},

  abstract     = {Plants are subject to attack by diverse pests and pathogens. Few genes conferring broad-spectrum resistance to both insects and pathogens have been identified. Because of the growth–defense tradeoff, it is often challenging to balance biotic stress resistance and yield for crops. Here, we report that OsWRKY36 suppresses the resistance to insects and pathogens via transcriptional repression of Phenylalanine Ammonia Lyases ( PALs ), a key enzyme in phenylpropanoid pathway in rice. Knocking out OsWRKY36 causes elevated lignin biosynthesis and increased sclerenchyma thickness of leaf sheath, leading to enhanced resistance to multiple pests and pathogens. Additionally, loss of OsWRKY36 also derepresses the transcription of Ideal Plant Architecture 1 ( IPA1 ) and MONOCULM2 ( MOC2 ), resulting in increased spikelet number per panicle and tiller number. These findings provide mechanistic insights into biotic stress tolerance in rice and offer a promising strategy to breed rice cultivars with broad-spectrum resistance to insects and pathogens while maintaining stable yield.},

  abstract     = {Our intuition suggests that when a movie is played in reverse, our perception of motion at each location in the reversed movie will be perfectly inverted compared to the original. This intuition is also reflected in classical theoretical and practical models of motion estimation, in which velocity flow fields invert when inputs are reversed in time. However, here we report that this symmetry of motion perception upon time reversal is broken in real visual systems. We designed a set of visual stimuli to investigate time reversal symmetry breaking in the fruit fly Drosophila ’s well-studied optomotor rotation behavior. We identified a suite of stimuli with a wide variety of properties that can uncover broken time reversal symmetry in fly behavioral responses. We then trained neural network models to predict the velocity of scenes with both natural and artificial contrast distributions. Training with naturalistic contrast distributions yielded models that broke time reversal symmetry, even when the training data themselves were time reversal symmetric. We show analytically and numerically that the breaking of time reversal symmetry in the model responses can arise from contrast asymmetry in the training data, but can also arise from other features of the contrast distribution. Furthermore, shallower neural network models can exhibit stronger symmetry breaking than deeper ones, suggesting that less flexible neural networks may be more prone to time reversal symmetry breaking. Overall, these results reveal a surprising feature of biological motion detectors and suggest that it could arise from constrained optimization in natural environments.},

Here, we generated a toolkit to visualize and quantify signaling in entire cell populations of the periderm, the outermost layer of the epidermis, in live developing zebrafish. We find that oriented cell divisions facilitate growth of the early periderm during axial elongation rather than cell addition from the basal layer. Activity levels of Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), a downstream effector of the MAPK pathway, gauged by a live biosensor, predict cell cycle entry, and optogenetic ERK activation regulates cell cycling dynamics. As development proceeds, rates of peridermal cell proliferation decrease, and ERK activity becomes more pulsatile and functionally transitions to promote hypertrophic cell growth. Targeted genetic blockade of cell division generates animals with oversized periderm cells, yet, unexpectedly, development to adulthood is not impaired. Our findings reveal stage-dependent differential responsiveness to ERK signaling and marked developmental robustness in growing teleost skin.},

They promise the annihilation of distance but obstruct pedestrian mobility, thus playing a key role in limiting social interactions locally. Although this limiting role is widely acknowledged in urban studies, the quantitative relationship between urban highways and social ties is barely tested. Here, we define a Barrier Score that relates massive, geolocated online social network data to highways in the 50 largest US cities. At the granularity of individual social ties, we show that urban highways are associated with decreased social connectivity. This barrier effect is especially strong for short distances and consistent with historical cases of highways that were built to purposefully disrupt or isolate Black neighborhoods. By combining spatial infrastructure with social tie data, our method adds a dimension to demographic studies of social segregation. Our study can inform reparative planning for an evidence-based reduction of spatial inequality, and more generally, support a better integration of the social fabric in urban planning.},

  abstract     = {Information processing in the human brain can be modeled as a complex dynamical system operating out of equilibrium with multiple regions interacting nonlinearly. Yet, despite extensive study of the global level of nonequilibrium in the brain, quantifying the irreversibility of interactions among brain regions at multiple levels remains an unresolved challenge. Here, we present the Directed Multiplex Visibility Graph Irreversibility framework, a method for analyzing neural recordings using network analysis of time-series. Our approach constructs directed multilayer graphs from multivariate time-series where information about irreversibility can be decoded from the marginal degree distributions across the layers, which each represents a variable. This framework is able to quantify the irreversibility of every interaction in the complex system. Applying the method to magnetoencephalography recordings during a long-term memory recognition task, we quantify the multivariate irreversibility of interactions between brain regions and identify the combinations of regions which showed higher levels of nonequilibrium in their interactions. For individual regions, we find higher irreversibility in cognitive versus sensorial brain regions while for pairs, strong relationships are uncovered between cognitive and sensorial pairs in the same hemisphere. For triplets and quadruplets, the most nonequilibrium interactions are between cognitive–sensorial pairs alongside medial regions. Combining these results, we show that multilevel irreversibility offers unique insights into the higher-order, hierarchical organization of neural dynamics from the perspective of brain network dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Oscillations of conductance observed in strong magnetic fields are a striking manifestation of the quantum dynamics of charge carriers in solids. The large charge carrier density in typical metals sets the scale of oscillations in both electrical and thermal conductivity, which characterize the Fermi surface. In semimetals, thermal transport at low-charge carrier density is expected to be phonon dominated, yet several experiments observe giant quantum oscillations in thermal transport. This raises the question of whether there is an overarching mechanism leading to sizable oscillations that survives in phonon-dominated semimetals. In this work, we show that such a mechanism exists. It relies on the peculiar phase-space allowed for phonon scattering by electrons when only a few Landau levels are filled. Our measurements on the Dirac semimetal ZrTe 5 support this counterintuitive mechanism through observation of pronounced thermal quantum oscillations, since they occur in similar magnitude and phase in directions parallel and transverse to the magnetic field. Our phase-space argument applies to all low-density semimetals, topological or not, including graphene and bismuth. Our work illustrates that phonon absorption can be leveraged to reveal degrees of freedom through their imprint on longitudinal thermal transport.},

  abstract     = {Drainage divide migration alters the geometry of drainage basins, influencing the distribution of water, erosion, sediments, and ecosystems across Earth’s surface. The rate of divide migration is governed by differences in erosion rates across the divide and is thus sensitive to spatiotemporal variations in tectonics and climate. However, established approaches for quantifying divide migration rates offer only indirect evidence for the motion of the divide and provide only migration rate averages. Consequently, transience in divide migration cannot be resolved, hindering the ability to explore environmental changes that drive the dynamics of such potential transience. Here, we study a set of datable terraces identified as markers of paleo-divide locations, which provide direct evidence for the paleo motion of the divide. The location and age of the terraces reveal intermittent divide migration at timescales of 10 4 to 10 5 y, with phases of rapid migration—at rates more than twice the average—which coincide with documented regional paleoclimate fluctuations. These findings highlight the intermittent nature of divide migration dynamics over geomorphic timescales and its potential sensitivity to climate changes, underscoring the impact of such changes on the planform evolution of drainage basins.},

Efforts to bring learning to a more local scale indeed lead to valuable insights, however, a general constructive approach to describe local learning goals that is both interpretable and adaptable across diverse tasks is still missing. We have previously formulated a local information processing goal that is highly adaptable and interpretable for a model neuron with compartmental structure. Building on recent advances in Partial Information Decomposition (PID), we here derive a corresponding parametric local learning rule, which allows us to introduce “infomorphic” neural networks. We demonstrate the versatility of these networks to perform tasks from supervised, unsupervised, and memory learning. By leveraging the interpretable nature of the PID framework, infomorphic networks represent a valuable tool to advance our understanding of the intricate structure of local learning.},

  abstract     = {Recent research, focused mostly on the United States and Western Europe, shows that marginalized communities often face greater environmental degradation. However, the ethnoracial categories used in these studies may not fully capture environmental inequality in the Global South. Moving beyond conventional ethnoracial variables, this study presents findings exploring the link between skin tone and fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) exposure in Colombia. By matching household geolocations from a large-scale longitudinal survey with satellite-based PM 2.5 estimates, we find that skin tone predicts both initial pollution exposure levels and their changes over time. Although average exposure levels remained stable during our study period, the environmental justice (EJ) landscape in Colombia contemporaneously underwent a complete transformation. In 2010, lighter-skinned individuals faced higher PM 2.5 exposure, but darker-skinned individuals experienced steeper increases in the following years. By 2016, the EJ gap had reversed, with people with the darkest skin tones exposed to PM 2.5 levels nearly one SD higher than those faced by people with the lightest skin tones. These patterns remain robust when controlling for a comprehensive set of theoretically relevant covariates, including ethnoracial self-identification and income. Disproportionate exposure to pollution from fires partially explains the observed disparities. Decomposition analysis shows that this variable, local collective action, and economic marginalization account for a sizeable share of the EJ gap. However, one-third of the gap remains unexplained by observable characteristics. With climate change intensifying fire incidence, the disproportionate disease burdens that vulnerable groups face might deepen unless policy measures are taken to reverse this trend.},

  abstract     = {The recently identified histone modification lysine lactylation can be stimulated by L-lactate and glycolysis. Although the chemical group added upon lysine lactylation was originally proposed to be the L-enantiomer of lactate (K L-la ), two isomeric modifications, lysine D-lactylation (K D-la ) and N-ε-(carboxyethyl) lysine (K ce ), also exist in cells, with their precursors being metabolites of glycolysis. The dynamic regulation and differences among these three modifications in response to hypoxia remain poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that intracellular K L-la , but not K D-la or K ce , is up-regulated in response to hypoxia. Depletion of glyoxalase enzymes, GLO1 and GLO2, had minimal impact on K D-la , K ce , or hypoxia-induced K L-la . Conversely, blocking glycolytic flux to L-lactate under hypoxic conditions by knocking out lactate dehydrogenase A/B completely abolished the induction of K L-la but increased K D-la and K ce . We further observed a correlation between the level of K L-la and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) expression under hypoxic conditions and when small molecules were used to stabilize HIF-1α in the normoxia condition. Our result demonstrated that there is a strong correlation between HIF-1α and K L-la in lung cancer tissues and that patient samples with higher grade tend to have higher K L-la levels. Using a proteomics approach, we quantified 66 K L-la sites that were up-regulated by hypoxia and demonstrated that p300/CBP contributes to hypoxia-induced K L-la . Collectively, our study demonstrates that K L-la , rather than K D-la or K ce , is the prevailing lysine lactylation in response to hypoxia. Our results therefore demonstrate a link between K L-la and the hypoxia-induced adaptation of tumor cells.},

  abstract     = {The tuberculosis-causing agent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) establishes its niche inside macrophages by secretion of several virulence factors and engaging many host factors. Mycobacterial infection of macrophages results in a proinflammatory trigger–mediated secretion of TNFα. Protein kinase G (PknG), a Serine/Threonine kinase, is essential for mycobacterial survival within the macrophage. Pathogenic mycobacteria, upon infection, can trigger the secretion of proinflammatory cytokine TNFα, but whether secreted PknG plays any role in TNFα secretion at early stages of infection remains undeciphered. Moreover, at early infection stages, prevention of macrophage apoptosis is vital to successful mycobacterial pathogenesis. Our studies show that mycobacteria-secreted PknG can dampen the expression and concomitant secretion of proinflammatory TNFα. During early infection, M.tb infection–induced generation of reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNI) leads to S-nitrosylation of PknG on Cys109, thereby enabling its secretion into macrophages. Upon M.tb infection, secreted S-nitrosylated PknG phosphorylates macrophage Silencer of Death Domains (SODD) at Thr405, as identified through our phosphoproteomic studies. Thereafter, phosphorylated SODD, through an irreversible binding with the TNFR1 death domain, prevents Caspase8 activation and concomitant extrinsic apoptotic trigger. Moreover, alveolar macrophages from mice infected with PknG-knockout M.tb also exhibited SODD phosphorylation and hindered Caspase8 activation to prevent extrinsic macrophage apoptosis. Therefore, this work exhibits S-nitrosylation-mediated secretion of PknG to induce phosphorylation of macrophage SODD, which, through irreversible interaction with TNFR1, prevented extrinsic macrophage apoptosis at the early stages of infection.},

  abstract     = {Neural circuits comprise multiple interconnected regions, each with complex dynamics. The interplay between local and global activity is thought to underlie computational flexibility, yet the structure of multiregion neural activity and its origins in synaptic connectivity remain poorly understood. We investigate recurrent neural networks with multiple regions, each containing neurons with random and structured connections. Inspired by experimental evidence of communication subspaces, we use low-rank connectivity between regions to enable selective activity routing. These networks exhibit high-dimensional fluctuations within regions and low-dimensional signal transmission between them. Using dynamical mean-field theory, with cross-region currents as order parameters, we show that regions act as both generators and transmitters of activity—roles that are often in tension. Taming within-region activity can be crucial for effective signal routing. Unlike previous models that suppressed neural activity to control signal flow, our model achieves routing by exciting different high-dimensional activity patterns through connectivity structure and nonlinear dynamics. Our analysis of this disordered system offers insights into multiregion neural data and trained neural networks.},

  abstract     = {Protein aggregation is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases, which connects these neuropathologies by a common phenotype. Various proteins and peptides form aggregates that are poorly degraded, and their ensuing pathological accumulation underlies these neurodegenerative diseases. Similarities may exist in the mechanisms responsible for the buildup of these aggregates. Therefore, therapeutics designed to treat one neurodegenerative disease may be beneficial to others. In ALS models, the compound NU-9 was previously shown to block neurodegeneration produced by aggregation-inducing mutations of SOD-1 and TDP-43 [B. Genç et al., Clin. Transl. Med. 11 , e336 (2021)]. Here, we report that NU-9 also prevents the accumulation of amyloid beta oligomers (AβOs), small peptide aggregates that are instigators of Alzheimer’s disease neurodegeneration [M. Tolar et al., Int. J. Mol. Sci. 22 , 6355 (2021)]. AβO buildup was measured by immunofluorescence imaging of cultured hippocampal neurons exposed to exogenous monomeric Aβ. In this model, AβO buildup occurs via cathepsin L- and dynamin-dependent trafficking. This is prevented by NU-9 through a cellular mechanism that is cathepsin B- and lysosome-dependent, suggesting that NU-9 enhances the ability of endolysosomal trafficking to protect against AβO buildup. This possibility is strongly supported by a quantitative assay for autophagosomes that shows robust stimulation by NU-9. These results contribute additional understanding to the mechanisms of protein aggregation and suggest that multiple neurodegenerative diseases might be treatable by targeting common pathogenic mechanisms responsible for protein aggregation.},

  abstract     = {Forest canopy height is a fundamental ecosystem property—influencing patterns of forest carbon storage and forest ecosystem responses to climate variability and change. Previous studies have analyzed environmental drivers influencing spatial variation in canopy height at landscape-to-regional scales; however, far less is known about the environmental determinants underlying regional and global scale variation in forest canopy height. Using the canopy height metrics products from Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), a space-borne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) instrument specifically designed to characterize forest structure, we analyze the environmental correlates of spatial variation of global tropical forest canopy height. Our study demonstrates that climate, topography, and soil properties account for 75% of the variation in tropical forest canopy height. Elevation, dry season length, and solar radiation are the most important drivers in determining canopy height both locally and regionally. These results emphasize the vulnerability of tropical forest structure to ongoing changes in the earth’s climate and provide a valuable empirical baseline for tropical forest management.},

  abstract     = {To meet decarbonization targets, nations around the globe have made ambitious commitments to expand forested land. Operationalizing these commitments requires choosing a planting strategy: How many trees should be planted, of which species, and where? Given those choices must be made now but have long-term consequences, such decisions are plagued by uncertainty. For example, species that are well suited to present conditions may perform poorly under future climates, yet those future climates are themselves highly uncertain. Using the exemplar of the United Kingdom, a nation committed to achieving net zero emissions by midcentury, we quantify key uncertainties pertaining to coevolving climate and economic conditions and examine how modern methods of decision-making under uncertainty can advise on planting choices. Our analysis reveals that the best planting strategy assuming a “high-emissions” future is radically different to that for a future that remains on a “near-historic” path. Planting for the former while experiencing the latter results in substantial net costs to UK society. Assimilating uncertainty into decision-making identifies planting strategies that diversify risk and significantly reduce the probability of high-cost outcomes. Importantly, our research reveals that the scope for mitigating risk through choice of planting strategy is relatively limited. Despite this persistent risk, we find that tree planting remains a highly cost-effective carbon removal solution when compared to alternative technologies, even when those alternatives are assumed to be riskless.},

  abstract     = {Nucleotide sequence data are being harnessed to identify species, even in cases in which organisms themselves are neither in hand nor witnessed. But how genome-wide sequence divergence maps to species status is far from clear. While gene sequence divergence is commonly used to delineate bacterial species, its correspondence to established species boundaries has yet to be explored across eukaryotic taxa. Because the processes underlying gene flow differ fundamentally between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, these domains are likely to differ in the relationship between reproductive isolation and genome-wide sequence divergence. In prokaryotes, homologous recombination, the basis of gene flow, depends directly on the degree of genomic sequence divergence, whereas in sexually reproducing eukaryotes, reproductive incompatibility can stem from changes in very few genes. Guided by measures of genome-wide sequence divergence in bacteria, we gauge how genomic criteria correspond to species boundaries in eukaryotes. In recognized species of eukaryotes, levels of gene sequence divergence within species are typically very small, averaging &lt;1% across protein-coding regions in most animals, plants, and fungi. There are even instances in which divergence between sister species is the same or less than that among conspecifics. In contrast, bacterial species, defined as populations exchanging homologous genes, show levels of divergence both within and between species that are considerably higher. Although no single threshold delineates species, eukaryotic populations with &gt;1% genome-wide sequence divergence are likely separate species, whereas prokaryotic populations with 1% divergence are still able to recombine and thus can be considered the same species.},

  abstract     = {A key limitation of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) therapy is their reduced efficacy toward cancers with a low tumor mutational burden (TMB). Since low-TMB tumors express fewer neoantigens, they are less responsive to ICI therapy like anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4. In preclinical immunocompetent mouse models of low-TMB melanoma, we recently demonstrated that exposure to 6-thioguanine (6TG) significantly improved tumor control by increasing TMB and creating a proinflammatory tumor microenvironment. The combination of 6TG with anti-PD-1 further improved tumor control, although it did not fully inhibit tumor growth. We here investigated additional ICI combinations, assessing anti-CTLA-4 with anti-PD-1 to improve efficacy. ICI eliminated tumors in 6TG-exposed mice when ICI treatment was initiated at tumor volumes of 20 mm 3 , stopped tumor growth at volumes of 120 mm 3 , and had no effect at volumes of 300 mm 3 . Finally, we showed that mice achieving complete tumor regression with 6TG and ICI treatment exhibited lasting immune memory, which effectively suppressed tumor growth at relapse upon re-exposure to tumor cells. These findings may pave the way to effective application of ICI to low-TMB cancers, when initiated at low tumor volume.},

  abstract     = {The escalating demand for rare earth elements (REEs) highlights the necessity for their sustainable recovery from waste streams and secondary resources. However, this process requires materials with exceptional selectivity and capacity for REEs due to their low concentration and high presence of interfering ions. Herein, we synthesized zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) and subsequently modified it with tributyl phosphate (TBP) to enhance its affinity and selectivity for the recovery of REEs. The distribution coefficients ( K d ) of ZIF-8-TBP for REEs (neodymium, Nd, and dysprosium, Dy) were orders of magnitude higher than the K d of main interfering ions (e.g., Mg, Ni Al, and Fe). Particularly, the maximum sorption capacities ( q m ) for Nd and Dy were 475 and 529 mg g −1 , respectively. In addition, the separation factor between Dy (a representative of heavy REE) and Nd (a representative of light REE) reached 24, greatly exceeding the figures reported previously. Importantly, the outstanding ability of ZIF-8-TBP for selective separation and recovery of REEs was demonstrated via its application to real samples including mining wastewater, and leaching solutions from REE filter cakes and discarded NdFeB magnets. Multiscale simulations reveal that ZIF-8-TBP possessed a stronger binding strength and greater sorption energy for REE ions. These results indicate that ZIF-8-TBP could effectively harvest REEs from wastes and offers an efficient alternative for industrial applications in REE recovery.},

  abstract     = {Larger, longer-lived species are expected to have a higher cancer prevalence compared to smaller, shorter-lived species owing to the greater number of cell divisions that occur during their lifespan. Yet, to date, no evidence has been found to support this expectation, and no association has been found between cancer prevalence and body size across species—a phenomenon known as Peto’s paradox. Specifically, while anticancer mechanisms have been identified for individual species, wider phylogenetic evidence has remained elusive. Here, we show that there is no evidence for Peto’s paradox across amphibians, birds, mammals, and squamate reptiles: Larger species do in fact have a higher cancer prevalence compared to smaller species. Moreover, we demonstrate that the accumulation of repeated instances of accelerated body size evolution in mammals and birds is associated with a reduction in the prevalence of neoplasia and malignancy, suggesting that increased rates of body size evolution are associated with the evolution of improved cellular growth control. These results represent empirical evidence showing that larger body size is related to higher cancer prevalence, thus rejecting Peto’s paradox, and demonstrating the importance of heterogenous routes of body size evolution in shaping anticancer defenses.},

  abstract     = {Many insect migrants rely on favorable seasonal winds to carry out long-range latitudinal migrations. In East China, the annual advance and retreat of the East Asian summer monsoon produces ideal conditions for seasonal range expansion and contraction of many migratory crop pests. However, climate-induced changes in the strength, timing, and location of the monsoon are impacting wind systems which may, in turn, affect migration patterns. We investigated these questions in the rice leafroller (RLR) moth, a severe pest of rice that annually invades the Lower Yangtze River Valley (LYRV) of China from winter-breeding areas further south. Using a 24-y dataset of RLR population dynamics from 31 monitoring stations across Southeast China, we investigated the impact of changes in monsoon wind regimes on fall migration patterns of the pest. Historically, RLR emigrated from the LYRV to South China on the favorably directed winds produced by the retreat of the monsoon at the end of the outbreak season (from mid-August onward). We show that in the recent 12-y period, prevailing late-season winds remain northward for longer than previously, preventing locally produced moths from emigrating southward. Additionally, winds now facilitate mass late-season immigrations into the LYRV, creating an ecological trap, as immigrants do not have time to produce another generation. As a consequence of the changing wind patterns, pest pressure is declining, and climate-induced changes to the East Asian summer monsoon result in seasonal migration becoming a riskier strategy. Such changes in insect migration patterns have severe implications for the population dynamics of windborne migrants, ecosystem functioning, and pest management strategies.},

  abstract     = {The northern lowlands of early Mars could have contained a significant quantity of liquid water. However, the ocean hypothesis remains controversial due to the lack of conclusive evidence from the Martian subsurface. We use data from the Zhurong Rover Penetrating Radar on the southern Utopia Planitia to identify subsurface dipping reflectors indicative of an ancient prograding shoreline. The reflectors dip unidirectionally with inclinations in the range 6° to 20° and are imaged to a thickness of 10 to 35 m along an uninterrupted 1.3 km northward shoreline-perpendicular traverse. The consistent dip inclinations, absence of dissection by fluvial channels along the extended traverse, and low permittivity of the sediments are consistent with terrestrial coastal deposits—and discount fluvial, aeolian, or magmatic origins favored elsewhere on Mars. The structure, thickness, and length of the section support voluminous supply of onshore sediments into a large body of water, rather than a merely localized and short-lived melt event. Our findings not only provide support for the existence of an ancient Martian ocean in the northern plains but also offer crucial insights into the evolution of the ancient Martian environment.},

Noncovalent coupling strategies using viral RNA binding proteins such as MS2/MCP have been widely applied but are limited by tag size, sensitivity, and dissociation over time. We took inspiration from a sequence-specific, covalent protein–DNA conjugation method based on the Rep nickase of a porcine circovirus called “HUH tag”. Though wild-type HUH protein has no detectable activity toward an RNA probe, we engineered an RNA-reactive variant, called “rHUH”, through 7 generations of yeast display–based directed evolution. Our 13.4 kD rHUH has 12 mutations relative to HUH and forms a covalent tyrosine-phosphate ester linkage with a 10-nucleotide RNA recognition sequence (“rRS”) within minutes. We engineered the sensitivity down to 1 nM of target RNA, shifted the metal ion requirement from Mn 2+ toward Mg 2+ , and demonstrated efficient labeling in mammalian cell lysate. This work paves the way toward a potentially powerful methodology for sequence-specific covalent protein–RNA conjugation in biological systems.},

Despite potentially producing multiple steroid hormones, detailed cellular mechanisms in APA remain insufficiently studied. Our multiomics analysis focusing on APA with KCNJ5 mutations, which represent the most common genetic form, revealed marked cellular heterogeneity. Tumor cell reprogramming initiated from stress-responsive cells to aldosterone-producing or cortisol-producing cells, with the latter progressing to proliferative stromal-like cells. These cell subtypes showed spatial segregation, and APA exhibited genomic intratumor heterogeneity. Among the nonparenchymal cells, lipid-associated macrophages, which were abundant in APA, might promote the progression of cortisol-producing and stromal-like cells, suggesting their role in the tumor microenvironment. Intratumor cortisol synthesis was correlated with increased blood cortisol levels, which were associated with the development of vertebral fractures, a hallmark of osteoporosis. This study unveils the complex cellular ecosystem with clinical relevance in APA with KCNJ5 mutations, providing insights into tumor biology that could inform future clinical approaches.},

  abstract     = {Processivity clamps mediate polymerase switching for translesion synthesis (TLS). All three Escherichia coli TLS polymerases interact with the β 2 processivity clamp through a conserved clamp-binding motif (CBM), which is indispensable for TLS. Notably, Pol IV also interacts weakly with the rim of the clamp through non-CBM residues. Ablating this “rim contact” in cells results in selective sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, raising the question how the rim contact contributes to TLS. Here, we show that the rim contact is critical for TLS past a strong replication block but barely necessary for a weak blocking lesion. Within the in vitro reconstituted E. coli replisome, the rim mutation compromises Pol IV-mediated TLS past 3-deaza-methyl dA, a strong block, whereas barely affecting TLS past N 2 -furfuryl dG, a weak block. Similar observations are also made in E. coli cells bearing a single copy of these lesions in the genome. At lesion-stalled replication forks, single-stranded DNA binding protein locally enriches Pol IV, enabling it to bind the low-affinity rim site. This interaction poises Pol IV to better compete with Pol III, the replicative polymerase, which competitively inhibits Pol IV from interacting with the clamp through its CBM. We propose that this bipartite clamp interaction enables Pol IV to rapidly resolve lesion-stalled replication at a strong block through TLS, which reduces damage-induced mutagenesis.},

  abstract     = {Scaffold proteins are key players in many signaling pathways where they ensure spatial and temporal control of molecular interactions by simultaneous tethering of multiple signaling components. The protein JIP1 acts as a scaffold within the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway by assembling three kinases, MLK3, MKK7, and JNK, into a macromolecular complex that enables their specific activation. The recruitment of these kinases depends on the 450-amino acid intrinsically disordered tail of JIP1, however, the structural details of this tail and the molecular mechanisms by which it binds kinases have remained elusive. Here, we provide an atomic resolution structural description of the JIP1 tail, and we study its interaction with the kinase JNK1. Using NMR spectroscopy, we show that JNK1 not only engages with the well-known docking site motif (D-motif) of JIP1, but also interacts with a noncanonical F-motif. We determine the crystal structure of the JIP1–JNK1 complex at 2.35 Å resolution revealing a bipartite binding mode of JIP1. Our work provides insights into the sequence determinants of F-motifs suggesting that these motifs may be more prevalent in JNK substrates than previously recognized. More broadly, our study highlights the power of NMR spectroscopy in uncovering kinase interaction motifs within disordered scaffold proteins, and it paves the way for atomic-resolution interaction studies of JIP1 with its multitude of interaction partners.},

To identify molecular defects that take place in the dorsolateral frontal cortex of patients with C9orf72 ALS/FTD, we compared healthy controls with C9orf72 ALS/FTD donor samples staged based on the levels of cortical phosphorylated TAR DNA binding protein (pTDP-43), a neuropathological hallmark of disease progression. We identified distinct molecular changes in different cell types that take place during FTD development. Loss of neurosurveillance microglia and activation of the complement cascade take place early, when pTDP-43 aggregates are absent or very low, and become more pronounced in late stages, suggesting an initial involvement of microglia in disease progression. Reduction of layer 2-3 cortical projection neurons with high expression of CUX2/LAMP5 also occurs early, and the reduction becomes more pronounced as pTDP-43 accumulates. Several unique features were observed only in samples with high levels of pTDP-43, including global alteration of chromatin accessibility in oligodendrocytes, microglia, and astrocytes; higher ratios of premature oligodendrocytes; increased levels of the noncoding RNA NEAT1 in astrocytes and neurons, and higher amount of phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6. Our findings reveal progressive functional changes in major cell types found in the prefrontal cortex of C9orf72 ALS/FTD patients that shed light on the mechanisms underlying the pathology of this disease.},

In this paper, we propose a powerful method that first quantifies the strength of regional associations at each single nucleotide polymorphism and converts these measures into time series data before using a change point detection algorithm to identify significant regions. In our extensive simulation study, the proposed method consistently demonstrates greater power than existing alternatives, achieving a relative increase of over 20% in challenging scenarios where true causal variants are sparse and multiple association regions exist at the same time, while maintaining a lower false positive rate.},

  abstract     = {A weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) has been found to be globally beneficial by economic assessments. This result emerges because AMOC weakening would cool the Northern Hemisphere, thereby reducing expected climate damages and decreasing estimates of the global social cost of carbon dioxide (SCC). There are, however, many other impacts of AMOC weakening that are not yet taken into account. Here, we add a second impact channel by quantifying the effects of AMOC weakening on ocean carbon uptake, using biogeochemically-only coupled freshwater hosing simulations in the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model. Our simulations reveal an approximately linear relationship between AMOC strength and carbon uptake reductions, constituting a carbon cycle feedback that leads to higher atmospheric CO 2 concentrations and stronger global warming. This AMOC carbon feedback, when incorporated into an integrated climate-economy model, leads to additional economic damages of several trillion US dollars and raises the SCC by about 1%. The SCC increase is similar in magnitude, but of opposite sign, to the SCC effect of Northern Hemisphere cooling. While there are many other potentially relevant economic impact channels, the AMOC carbon feedback alone could thus flip the consequences of AMOC weakening into a net cost to society.},

  abstract     = {Proteins and the complexes they form are central to nearly all cellular processes. Their flexibility, expressed through a continuum of states, provides a window into their biological functions. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is an ideal tool to study these dynamic states as it captures specimens in noncrystalline conditions and enables high-resolution reconstructions. However, analyzing the heterogeneous distributions of conformations from cryo-EM data is challenging. We present RECOVAR, a method for analyzing these distributions based on principal component analysis (PCA) computed using a REgularized COVARiance estimator. RECOVAR is fast, robust, interpretable, expressive, and competitive with state-of-the-art neural network methods on heterogeneous cryo-EM datasets. The regularized covariance method efficiently computes a large number of high-resolution principal components that can encode rich heterogeneous distributions of conformations and does so robustly thanks to an automatic regularization scheme. The reconstruction method based on adaptive kernel regression resolves conformational states to a higher resolution than all other tested methods on extensive independent benchmarks while remaining highly interpretable. Additionally, we exploit favorable properties of the PCA embedding to estimate the conformational density accurately. This density allows for better interpretability of the latent space by identifying stable states and low free-energy motions. Finally, we present a scheme to navigate the high-dimensional latent space by automatically identifying these low free-energy trajectories.

The microdome patterns are easily fabricated by ordinary printing techniques and have inhomogeneous spatial distributions of full polarization states and customizable colors. Our chiral-structural-color microdomes (CSCMs) provide a promising roadmap for high-capacity information encryption and high-security anti-counterfeiting.

Here, we determined the spatial localization, protein carriers, and cellular function of O-GalNAc glycans in the mouse brain. We observed striking spatial enrichment of O-GalNAc glycans in neuronal tracts, and specifically at nodes of Ranvier, specialized structures involved in signal propagation in the brain. Glycoproteomic analysis revealed that more than half of the identified O-GalNAc glycans were present on chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans termed lecticans, and display both domain enrichment and regional heterogeneity. Inhibition of O-GalNAc synthesis in neurons reduced binding of Siglec-4, a known regulator of neurite growth, and shortened the length of nodes of Ranvier. This work establishes a function of O-GalNAc glycans in the brain and will inform future studies on their role in development and disease.},

  abstract     = {High-profile incidents of police violence against Black citizens over the past decade have spawned contentious debates in the United States on the role of police. This debate has played out prominently in the news media, leading to a perception that media outlets have become more critical of the police. There is currently, however, little empirical evidence supporting this perceived shift. We construct a large dataset of local news reporting on the police from 2013 to 2023 in 10 politically diverse U.S. cities. Leveraging advanced language models, we measure criticism by analyzing whether reporting supports or is critical of two contentions: 1) that the police protect citizens and 2) that the police are racist. To validate this approach, we collect labels from members of different political parties. We find that contrary to public perceptions, local media criticism of the police has remained relatively stable along these two dimensions over the past decade. While criticism spiked in the aftermath of high-profile police killings, such as George Floyd’s murder, these events did not produce sustained increases in negative police news. In fact, reporting supportive of police effectiveness has increased slightly since Floyd’s death. We find only small differences in coverage trends in more conservative and more liberal cities, undermining the idea that local outlets cater to the politics of their audiences. Last, although Republicans are more likely to view a piece of news as supportive of the police than Democrats, readers across parties see reporting as no more critical than it was a decade ago.},

  abstract     = {The Huns appeared in Europe in the 370s, establishing an Empire that reshaped West Eurasian history. Yet until today their origins remain a matter of extensive debate. Traditional theories link them to the Xiongnu, the founders of the first nomadic empire of the Mongolian steppe. The Xiongnu empire dissolved, however, ~300 y before the Huns appeared in Europe, and there is little archaeological and historical evidence of Huns in the steppe during this time gap. Furthermore, despite the rich 5th to 6th centuries current era (CE) archaeological record of the Carpathian Basin, the cultural elements of connections with the steppe are limited to few findings and even fewer solitary eastern-type burials. In this study, we coanalyze archaeological evidence with 35 newly sequenced and published genomic data for a total of 370 individuals—from 5th to 6th century CE contexts in the Carpathian Basin including 10 Hun-period eastern-type burials, 2nd to 5th century sites across Central Asia and 2nd c. before current era (BCE) to 1st c. CE Xiongnu period sites across the Mongolian steppe. We find no evidence for the presence of a large eastern/steppe descent community among the Hun- and post-Hun-period Carpathian Basin population. We also observe a high genetic diversity among the eastern-type burials that recapitulates the variability observed across the Eurasian Steppe. This suggests a mixed origin of the incoming steppe conquerors. Nevertheless, long-shared genomic tracts provide compelling evidence of genetic lineages directly connecting some individuals of the highest Xiongnu-period elite with 5th to 6th century CE Carpathian Basin individuals, showing that some European Huns descended from them.},

  abstract     = {DNA is heterogeneously packaged into chromatin, which is further organized into topologically associating domains (TADs) with sharp boundaries. These boundary locations are critical for genome regulation. Here, we explore how the distribution of DNA-packing density across chromatin affects the TAD boundary locations. We develop a polymer-physics-based model that utilizes DNA accessibility data to parameterize DNA-packing density along chromosomes, treating them as heteropolymers, and simulates the stochastic folding of these heteropolymers within a nucleus to yield a conformation ensemble. Such an ensemble reproduces a subset (over 60%) of TAD boundaries across the human genome, as confirmed by Hi-C data. Additionally, it reproduces the spatial distance matrices of 2-Mb genomic regions provided by FISH experiments. Furthermore, our model suggests that utilizing DNA accessibility data alone as input is sufficient to predict the emergence and disappearance of key TADs during early T cell differentiation. We show that stochastic folding of heteropolymers in a confined space can replicate both the prevalence of chromatin domain structures and the cell-to-cell variation in domain boundary positions observed in single-cell experiments. Furthermore, regions of lower DNA-packing density preferentially form domain boundaries, and this preference drives the emergence of TAD boundaries observed in ensemble-averaged Hi-C maps. The enrichment of TAD boundaries at CTCF binding sites can be attributed to the influence of CTCF binding on local DNA-packing density in our model. Collectively, our findings establish a strong link between TAD boundaries and regions of lower DNA-packing density, providing insights into the mechanisms underlying TAD formation.},

  abstract     = {Semiconductor quantum dots (QD) promise unique electronic, optical, and chemical properties, which can be exquisitely tuned by controlling the composition, size, and morphology. Semiconductor QDs have been synthesized primarily via two approaches, namely, epitaxial growth and wet-chemical synthesis. However, the properties of epitaxial QDs (eQDs) are susceptible to wetting layer formation and substrate dislocations, while colloidal QDs (cQDs) face fluorescence intermittency issues. Here, we report on the synthesis of a class of QDs that can overcome the fundamental limitations of eQDs and cQDs. By exploiting the sp 2 bonding of layered hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), we show that GaN QDs can be epitaxially grown through a weak van der Waals (vdW) interaction without two-dimensional wetting layer formation. The photoluminescence intensity of GaN van der Waals quantum dots (vQDs) is more than six times stronger than that of conventional GaN eQDs and no optical blinking was observed from vQDs. We show that the interadatom bond strength is about one order of magnitude stronger compared with that between the adatoms and the hBN substrate. This work shows that vQDs have unique properties that are difficult to achieve using existing QDs synthesis methods and thus can potentially enable new classes of high-performance optoelectronic and quantum devices.},

  abstract     = {Advances in sequencing technology have unveiled examples of nucleus-encoded polycistrons, once considered rare. Exclusively polycistronic transcripts are prevalent in green algae, although the mechanism by which multiple polypeptides are translated from a single transcript is unknown. Here, we used bioinformatic and in vivo mutational analyses to evaluate competing mechanistic models for translation of bicistronic mRNAs in green algae. High-confidence manually curated datasets of bicistronic loci from two divergent green algae, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Auxenochlorella protothecoides , revealed a preference for weak Kozak-like sequences for ORF 1 and an underrepresentation of potential initiation codons before the ORF 2 start codon, which are suitable conditions for leaky ribosome scanning to allow ORF 2 translation. We used mutational analysis in A. protothecoides to test the mechanism. In vivo manipulation of the ORF 1 Kozak-like sequence and start codon altered reporter expression at ORF 2, with a weaker Kozak-like sequence enhancing expression and a stronger one diminishing it. A synthetic bicistronic dual reporter demonstrated inversely adjustable activity of green fluorescent protein expressed from ORF 1 and luciferase from ORF 2, depending on the strength of the ORF 1 Kozak-like sequence. Our findings demonstrate that translation of multiple ORFs in green algal bicistronic transcripts is consistent with episodic leaky scanning of ORF 1 to allow translation at ORF 2. This work has implications for the potential functionality of upstream open reading frames (uORFs) found across eukaryotic genomes and for transgene expression in synthetic biology applications.},

  abstract     = {Successful tuberculosis therapy requires treatment with an unwieldy multidrug combination for several months. Thus, there is a growing need to identify novel genetic vulnerabilities that can be leveraged to develop new, more effective antitubercular drugs. Consequently, recent efforts to optimize tuberculosis (TB) therapy have exploited Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) chemical genetics to identify pathways influencing antibiotic efficacy, novel mechanisms of antibiotic action, and new targets for TB drug discovery. However, the influence of the complex host environment on these interactions remains largely unknown, leaving the therapeutic potential of the identified targets unclear. In this study, we leveraged a library of conditional mutants targeting 467 essential Mtb genes to characterize the chemical–genetic interactions (CGIs) with TB drugs directly in the mouse infection model. We found that these in vivo CGIs differ significantly from those identified in vitro. Both drug-specific and drug-agnostic effects were identified, and many were preserved during treatment with a multidrug combination, suggesting numerous strategies for enhancing therapy. This work also elucidated the complex effects of pyrazinamide (PZA), a drug that relies on aspects of the infection environment for efficacy. Specifically, our work supports the importance of coenzyme A synthesis- inhibition during infection, as well as the antagonistic effect of iron limitation on PZA activity. In addition, we found that inhibition of thiamine and purine synthesis increases PZA efficacy, suggesting additional therapeutically exploitable metabolic dependencies. Our findings present a map of the unique in vivo CGIs, characterizing the mechanism of PZA activity in vivo and identifying potential targets for TB drug development.},

Despite major advancements in the field of metabolic modeling in recent years, prediction of genetic modifications for increased production remains challenging. Here, we present a computational pipeline that leverages the concept of protein limitations in metabolism for prediction of optimal combinations of gene engineering targets for enhanced chemical bioproduction. We used our pipeline for prediction of engineering targets for 103 different chemicals using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a host. Furthermore, we identified sets of gene targets predicted for groups of multiple chemicals, suggesting the possibility of rational model-driven design of platform strains for diversified chemical production.},

  abstract     = {Conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) are potent antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that integrate signals from their environment allowing them to direct situation-adapted immunity. Thereby they harbor great potential for being targeted in vaccination, autoimmunity, and cancer. Here, we use fate mapping, functional analyses, and comparative cross-species transcriptomics to show that RORγt + DCs are a conserved, functionally versatile, and transcriptionally distinct type of DCs. RORγt + DCs entail various populations described in different contexts including Janus cells/RORγt-expressing extrathymic Aire-expressing cells (eTACs), subtypes of Thetis cells, RORγt + -DC (R-DC) like cells, cDC2C and ACY3 + DCs. We show that in response to inflammatory triggers, RORγt + DCs can migrate to lymph nodes and in the spleen can activate naïve CD4 + T cells. These findings expand the functional repertoire of RORγt + DCs beyond the known role of eTACs and Thetis cells in inducing T cell tolerance to self-antigens and intestinal microbes in mice. We further show that RORγt + DCs with proinflammatory features accumulate in autoimmune neuroinflammation in mice and men. Thus, our work establishes RORγt + DCs as immune sentinel cells that exhibit a broad functional spectrum ranging from inducing peripheral T cell tolerance to T cell activation depending on signals they integrate from their environment.},

  abstract     = {During cortical development, radial glial cells (neural stem cells) initially are neurogenic, generating intermediate progenitor cells that exclusively produce glutamatergic pyramidal neurons. Next, radial glial cells generate tripotential intermediate progenitor cells (Tri-IPCs) that give rise to cortical astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, and olfactory bulb interneurons. The molecular mechanisms underlying the transition from cortical neurogenesis to gliogenesis, and the subsequent fate determination of cortical astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and olfactory bulb interneurons, remain unclear. Here, we report that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling plays a fundamental role in promoting cortical gliogenesis and the generation of Tri-IPCs. Additionally, sonic hedgehog-smoothened-glioma-associated oncogene homolog (SHH-SMO-GLI) activator signaling has an auxiliary function to ERK during these processes. We further demonstrate that, from Tri-IPCs, NOTCH signaling is crucial for the fate determination of astrocytes, while ERK signaling plays a prominent role in oligodendrocyte fate specification, and SHH signaling is required for the fate determination of olfactory bulb interneurons. We provide evidence suggesting that this mechanism is conserved in both mice and humans. Finally, we propose a unifying principle of mammalian cortical gliogenesis.},

  abstract     = {Chromatin architecture facilitates accurate transcription at a number of loci, but it remains unclear how much chromatin architecture is involved in global transcriptional regulation. Previous work has shown that rapid depletion of the architectural protein CTCF in cell culture alters global chromatin organization but results in surprisingly limited gene expression changes. This discrepancy has also been observed when other architectural proteins are depleted, and one possible explanation is that full transcriptional changes are masked by cellular heterogeneity. We tested this idea by performing multiomics analyses with sorted juvenile postmitotic mouse rods, which undergo synchronized development, and we identified CTCF-dependent regulation of global chromatin accessibility and gene expression. CTCF depletion leads to dysregulation of ~20% of the entire transcriptome (&gt;3,000 genes) and ~41% of genome accessibility (&gt;27,000 sites) before any prominent cellular or physiological phenotypes arise. Importantly, these changes are highly enriched for CTCF occupancy at euchromatin, suggesting direct CTCF binding and transcriptional regulation at these active loci. CTCF mainly promotes chromatin accessibility and frequently inhibits expression of these direct binding targets, which are enriched for binding motifs of transcription repressors. These findings provide different and sometimes opposite conclusions from previous studies, emphasizing the need to consider cellular heterogeneity and cell-type specificity when performing multiomics analyses. CTCF knockout rods undergo complete degeneration by adulthood, indicating an essential role for their viability. We conclude that the architectural protein CTCF binds chromatin and regulates global chromatin accessibility and transcription during rod development.},

However, observed increases in algal biomass do not consistently correlate with air temperature or precipitation, and evidence is lacking for a causal effect of climate or the nonlinear dynamics needed to demonstrate regime shifts. We modeled the causal effects of climate on annual lake chlorophyll (a measure of algal biomass) over 34 y for 24,452 lakes across broad ecoclimatic zones of the United States and evaluated the potential for regime shifts. We found that algal biomass was causally related to climate in 34% of lakes. In these cases, 71% exhibited abrupt but mostly temporary shifts as opposed to persistent changes, 13% had the potential for regime shifts. Climate was causally related to algal biomass in lakes experiencing all levels of human disturbance, but with different likelihood. Climate causality was most likely to be observed in lakes with minimal human disturbance and cooler summer temperatures that have increased over the 34 y studied. Climate causality was variable in lakes with low to moderate human disturbance, and least likely in lakes with high human disturbance, which may mask climate causality. Our results explain some of the previously observed heterogeneous climate responses of lake algal biomass globally and they can be used to predict future climate effects on lakes.},

  abstract     = {Analyzing cardiac pulse waveforms offers valuable insights into heart health and cardiovascular disease risk, although obtaining the more informative measurements from the central aorta remains challenging due to their invasive nature and limited noninvasive options. To address this, we employed a laboratory-developed cuff device for high-resolution pulse waveform acquisition and constructed a spectral machine learning model to nonlinearly map the brachial wave components to the aortic site. Simultaneous invasive aortic catheter and brachial cuff waveforms were acquired in 115 subjects to evaluate the clinical performance of the developed wave-based approach. Magnitude, shape, and pulse waveform analysis on the measured and reconstructed aortic waveforms were correlated on a beat-to-beat basis. The proposed cuff-based method reconstructed aortic waveform contours with high fidelity (mean normalized-RMS error = 11.3%). Furthermore, continuous signal reconstruction captured dynamic aortic systolic blood pressure (BP) oscillations (r = 0.76, P &lt; 0.05). Method-derived central pressures showed strong correlation with the independent invasive measurement for systolic BP (R 2 = 0.83; B [LOA] = −0.3 [−17.0, 16.4] mmHg) and diastolic BP (R 2 = 0.58; B [LOA] = −0.7 [−13.1, 11.6] mmHg). Shape-based features are effectively captured by the spectral machine learning method, showing strong correlations and no systemic bias for systolic pressure–time integral (r = 0.91, P &lt; 0.05), diastolic pressure–time integral (r = 0.95, P &lt; 0.05), and subendocardial viability ratio (r = 0.86, P &lt; 0.05). These results suggest that the nonlinear transformation of wave components from the distal to the central site predicts the morphological waveform changes resulting from complex wave propagation and reflection within the cardiovascular network. The proposed wave-based approach holds promise for future applications of noninvasive devices in clinical cardiology.},

Our systems biology approach identified RNA binding protein, mRNA processing factor ( RBPMS ) as a conserved, VSMC-specific gene associated with VSMC modulation in atherosclerosis. RBPMS gene expression positively correlates with VSMC contractile markers in human and murine atherosclerotic arteries as well as in two vascular injury models during the postinjury intimal hyperplasia phase. RBPMS promotes contractile VSMC differentiation, reduces plaque cap development in high-fat diet-fed apolipoprotein E-null ( ApoE −/− ) murine atherosclerotic arteries, and inhibits intimal hyperplasia. Mechanistically, the RBPMS protein interacts with the myocardin ( MYOCD ) pre-mRNA and enhances MYOCD_v3 / MYOCD_v1 transcript balance through alternative exon 2a splicing. RBPMS promotes the VSMC contractile phenotype and reduces their fibroproliferative activity in a MYOCD_v3a-dependent manner. RBPMS enhances Myocd_v3 / Myocd_v1 transcript balance in both atherosclerotic and injured vessels. RBPMS may inhibit VSMC-driven plaque cap development and intervention-induced restenosis.},

While surgery followed by chemoradiotherapy delays disease progression, these treatments do not lead to tumor control, and targeted therapies or biologics have failed to further improve survival. Utilizing a transient radiation-induced state of multipotency, we used the adenylcyclase activator forskolin to alter the fate of irradiated glioma cells. The effects of the combined treatment on neuronal marker expression, cell cycle distribution, and proliferation were studied. Gene expression profiling was conducted using bulk RNA-seq. Changes in cell populations were investigated using single-cell RNA-seq. Effects on glioma stem cells (GSCs) were studied in extreme limiting dilution assays, and the effects on median survival were studied in both syngeneic and PDOX mouse models of GBM. The combined treatment induced the expression of neuronal markers in glioma cells, reduced proliferation, and led to a distinct gene expression profile. scRNA-seq revealed that the combined treatment forced glioma cells into a microglia- and neuron-like phenotype. In vivo, this treatment led to a loss of GSCs and prolonged median survival. Collectively, our data suggest that revisiting a differentiation therapy with forskolin in combination with radiation could lead to clinical benefit.},

  abstract     = {The most common chemotherapeutics induce DNA damage to eradicate cancer cells, yet defective DNA repair can propagate mutations, instigating therapy resistance and secondary malignancies. Structural variants (SVs), arising from copy-number-imbalanced and -balanced DNA rearrangements, are a major driver of tumor evolution, yet understudied posttherapy. Here, we adapted single-cell template-strand sequencing (Strand-seq) to a HER2+ breast cancer model to investigate the formation of doxorubicin-induced de novo SVs. We coupled this approach with nucleosome occupancy (NO) measurements obtained from the same single cell to enable simultaneous SV detection and cell-type classification. Using organoids from TetO-CMYC/TetO-Neu/MMTV-rtTA mice modeling HER2+ breast cancer, we generated 459 Strand-seq libraries spanning various tumorigenesis stages, identifying a 7.4-fold increase in large chromosomal alterations post-doxorubicin. Complex DNA rearrangements, deletions, and duplications were prevalent across basal, luminal progenitor (LP), and mature luminal (ML) cells, indicating uniform susceptibility of these cell types to SV formation. Doxorubicin further elevated sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs), indicative of genomic stress persisting posttreatment. Altered nucleosome occupancy levels on distinct cancer-related genes further underscore the broad genomic impact of doxorubicin. The organoid-based system for single-cell multiomics established in this study paves the way for unraveling the most important therapy-associated SV mutational signatures, enabling systematic studies of the effect of therapy on cancer evolution.},

Here, we draw attention to the underappreciated concept of timeliness—i.e., system elements being available at the right place at the right time—that has been ubiquitously and integrally adopted as a quality standard in the modus operandi of sociotechnical systems. We point out that a variety of incentives, often reinforced by competitive pressures, prompt system operators to myopically optimize for efficiencies, running the risk of inadvertently taking timeliness to the limit of its operational performance, correspondingly making the system critically fragile to perturbations by pushing the entire system toward the proverbial “edge of a cliff.” Invoking a stylized model for operational delays, we identify the limiting operational performance of timeliness, as a true critical point, where the smallest of perturbations can lead to a systemic collapse. Specifically for firm-to-firm production networks, we suggest that the proximity to critical fragility is an important ingredient for understanding the fundamental “excess volatility puzzle” in economics. Further, in generality for optimizing sociotechnical systems, we propose that critical fragility is a crucial aspect in managing the trade-off between efficiency and robustness.},

  abstract     = {Building differences between genetically equivalent units is a fundamental challenge for all multicellular organisms and superorganisms. In ants, reproductive or worker fate is typically determined during the larval stage, through feeding regimes managed by adult caretakers. However, the feeding care provided to larvae varies significantly across ants, as does phenotypic divergence between queen and worker castes. Here, we employed comparative phylogenetic methods and causal inference to investigate the relationships between larval feeding care, caste size dimorphism, and social complexity across ant diversity. We digitized the life’s work of George and Jeanette Wheeler, cataloging the larval morphology of over 700 species, and we compiled data on species diets and larval feeding behaviors from the literature and our own observations. We measured queen–worker size dimorphism in 392 species and gathered data for colony size, worker polymorphism, and worker reproduction. Our analyses revealed that ancestral active-feeding larvae evolved passive morphologies when adults began feeding them individually, typically with processed material and often following a shift to nonpredatory diets. Greater queen–worker size dimorphism coevolved with larval passiveness, alongside traits indicative of increased social complexity, including larger colony sizes, worker subcastes, and a reduction in workers’ reproductive potential. Likelihood comparisons of causal phylogenetic models support that extended alloparental care facilitated stronger caste dimorphism, which, in turn and along with increased colony sizes, promoted higher social complexity. Our results suggest that enhanced adult control over larval development enabled greater phenotypic specialization within colonies, with profound implications for social evolution.},

  abstract     = {The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in acidic media suffers from sluggish kinetics, primarily due to the spin-dependent electron transfer involved. The direct generation of spin-polarized electrons at catalytic surfaces remains elusive, and the underlying mechanisms are still controversial due to the lack of intrinsically chiral catalysts. To address this challenge, we investigate topological homochiral PdGa (TH PdGa) crystals with intrinsically chiral catalytic surfaces for ORR. Through spin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and theoretical simulations, we show that both structural chirality and spin–orbit coupling are critical for inducing spin polarization at the surface of TH PdGa. As a result, TH PdGa achieves a kinetic current density over 100 times higher than the achiral PdGa (AC PdGa) at 0.85 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. This work underscores the pivotal role of spin polarization in enhancing acidic ORR activity and lays the groundwork for the rational design of chiral catalysts for spin-dependent catalysis.},

  abstract     = {The conservation of biodiversity represents a global challenge as the world experiences its sixth mass extinction. Understanding how conservation efforts are allocated is paramount to effectively protect threatened species. We analyzed ~14,600 conservation projects over a 25-y period, revealing substantial taxonomic biases in funding. When matched with formal assessments of species’ threat status, several highly threatened groups such as amphibians receive little and ever-decreasing support. Within particular groups (e.g., Mammalia, Reptilia), funding is directed to a very narrow selection of taxa, leaving the majority of their threatened species with limited or no support. More attention is urgently needed to assess the extinction risks of neglected taxa, especially smaller species. Paradoxically, while approximately 6% of species identified as threatened were supported by conservation funds, 29% of the funding was allocated to species of “least concern”. A more holistic distribution of conservation funding is, therefore, urgently needed if we are to protect biodiversity efficiently. We suggest avenues and mechanisms for a more balanced coverage of threatened species within conservation programs and highlight some of the benefits that could be derived from such an approach.},

  abstract     = {Modern ecosystems display complex associations of plants–insects that underwent a long evolutionary process since the appearance of mid-Paleozoic vascular plants. Although several major hypotheses explain the evolution of these plant–insect associations, the initial pattern of modern insect herbivory is poorly understood. To understand the antiquity of modern patterns of terrestrial arthropod herbivory, functional feeding group–damage type (FFG-DT) data were used to analyze a 305 My interval from Late Pennsylvanian to present, in which 134 plant assemblages were used to assess turnover (replacement of some species by other species between sites) and nestedness (difference in composition when no species are replaced between sites) in pairwise comparisons of DTs. Results of beta diversity analyses indicate that the prototype pattern for modern insect herbivory was established on gymnosperm-dominated plant assemblages by late Middle Jurassic, antedating angiosperm dominance by 60 My. Turnover among plant groups and FFGs declined in earlier late Paleozoic, whereas during the later Cenozoic, nestedness generally increased. Insect feeding on gymnosperms showed one pattern of change with low turnover and high nestedness, whereas a bimodal pattern characterized angiosperms. Ferns and angiosperms exhibited less DT functional breadth (host-plant “specificity” by herbivores) than gymnosperms, reflecting major differences in links between insect herbivores and their host plants. This fundamental trophic shift is consistent with the Mid-Mesozoic Parasitoid Revolution, implying top–down control of herbivores by their consumers rather than bottom–up regulation of food sources that shaped the modern herbivory pattern. These findings provide a data-rich account of the ecological origins of modern herbivory.},

  abstract     = {Female mosquitoes are vectors of many devastating human diseases because they require blood feeding to initiate reproduction. Thus, elucidation of molecular mechanisms managing female mosquito reproduction is essential. Although the regulation of gene expression during the mosquito gonadotrophic cycle has been studied in detail, how this process is controlled at the chromatin level remains unclear. Chromatin must be accessible for transcription factors (TFs) governing gene expression. A specialized class of TFs, called pioneer factors (PFs), binds and remodels closed chromatin, permitting other TFs to bind DNA and activate the gene expression. Here, we identified a homolog of the vertebrate PF FoxA in the mosquito Aedes aegypti and used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to generate mosquitoes deficient in AaFoxA . We found that ovary development was severely retarded in mutant females. Multiomics and molecular biology analyses have shown that AaFoxA increased histone acetylation and decreased methylation of H3K27 by controlling the chromatin accessibility of histone modification enzymes and chromatin remodelers. AaFoxA is bound to the loci of chromatin remodelers, changing their chromatin accessibility and modulating their temporal expression patterns. AaFoxA increased the accessibility of the ecdysone receptor (EcR) and E74 loci, indicating the important role of AaFoxA in the hormonal regulation of mosquito reproductive events. Further, the CUT&amp;RUN and ATAC-seq analyses revealed that AaFoxA temporarily bound closed chromatin, making it differentially accessible during the mosquito gonadotrophic cycle. Hence, this study demonstrates that AaFoxA modulates chromatin dynamics throughout female mosquito reproduction.},

  abstract     = {The experience of human parenthood is near ubiquitous and can profoundly alter one’s body, mind, and environment. However, we know very little about the long-term neural effects of parenthood for parents themselves, or the implications of pregnancy and caregiving experience on the aging adult brain. Here, we investigate the link between the number of children parented and age on brain function in 19,964 females and 17,607 males from the UK Biobank. In both females and males, parenthood was positively correlated with functional connectivity, such that higher number of children parented was associated with higher connectivity, particularly within the somato/motor network. Critically, the spatial topography of parenthood-linked effects was inversely correlated with the impact of age on functional connectivity across the brain for both females and males, such that the connections that were positively correlated with number of children were negatively correlated with age. This result suggests that a higher number of children is associated with patterns of brain function in the opposite direction to age-related alterations. Overall, these results indicate that the changes accompanying parenthood may confer benefits to brain health across the lifespan, altering aging trajectories, consistent with animal models of parenthood and preliminary findings of “younger-looking” brain structure in human parents. Observing this effect in both females and males implicates the caregiving environment, rather than pregnancy alone, and highlights the importance of future work to disentangle the underlying mechanisms related to the direct impact of caregiving, the indirect impact of the environment, and the result of covarying sociodemographic factors.},

  abstract     = {Neural activity in sensory cortex is modulated by behavioral and cognitive factors, and this modulation is thought to contribute to the selection of specific sensory information needed to achieve behavioral goals. In contrast, more abstract behavioral variables that are independent of stimulus selection, such as stimulus–response mapping, are thought to be encoded by neurons outside of sensory cortex. We show that information about such mapping is robustly encoded in the responses of neurons in primate visual cortex. Monkeys were trained to alternate between two tasks that differed in the rule governing the mapping of a remembered visual cue onto an eye movement response. During the memory-delay period, neurons in area V4 reliably signaled the remembered cue location in both tasks. However, the encoding of cue location depended critically on the stimulus–response mapping rule. Thus, V4 delay activity encoded the mapping rule and signaled the preparation of the appropriate motor response rather than spatial working memory per se, contrary to previous assumptions. In addition, we probed the origins of motor-related delay activity and found that it was reduced during local inactivation of the frontal eye field (FEF). The results demonstrate that behavioral modulation of visual cortical activity is not solely related to the selection of sensory stimuli but instead reflects a distinct mechanism for sensory-guided motor output.},

This behavior suggests the enhancement of in-gap electronic excitations below 65 K and the emergence of a new phase of matter. Consequently, the intriguing quantum state leads to a crossover.

  abstract     = {The mechanotransduction (MT) channel expressed in cochlear and vestibular hair cells converts the mechanical stimulation of sound and head movements into electrochemical signals. Recently, TMC1 and TMC2 (TMC1/2) have been recognized as the pore-forming subunit of the MT channel, but TMC1/2 functional expression in heterologous cells—which is critical for unequivocally identifying them as the bona fide pore-forming subunit of the MT channel—has not been achieved because ectopic TMC1/2 become trapped in the ER. Here, we report that adding a Fyn lipidation tag to mouse TMC1/2 (mTMC1/2) drove their cell-surface expression, and, importantly, full-length mTMC1/2 expressed alone functioned as mechanosensitive channels, underscoring the view that TMC1/2 constitute the sole pore-forming subunit of the MT channel. Moreover, mouse transmembrane inner ear (TMIE) (mTMIE) protein robustly stimulated TMC1/2 channel activity by modulating their gating. Intriguingly, the N-terminal 27 residues of mTMIE were dispensable for regulating TMC1/2 in our in vitro functional assay, whereas, in striking contrast, mutating mTMIE C76C77, the predicted palmitoylation sites, eliminated mTMIE stimulation of mTMC1/2, indicating a crucial role of the palmitoyl group in regulating TMC1/2 gating. mTMC1/2+mTMIE form 18 pS and 24 pS single channels, respectively. mTMC1/2+mTMIE single channels showed biophysical and pharmacological properties similar to those of the MT channel. Our findings provide insights into several fundamental and debated aspects of the function of TMC1/2 and TMIE, and our functional assay of TMC1/2 and TMIE in heterologous cells will facilitate further functional and structural characterization of these proteins and other MT-complex components.},
