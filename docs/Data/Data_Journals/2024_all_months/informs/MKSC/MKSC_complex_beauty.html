  abstract     = {This paper examines whether and under what conditions one should expect equilibrium inequality in markets where agents in each of two populations look for an optimal alternative from the other population through a costly sequential search. It shows that a unique stable equilibrium may involve inequality between ex ante identical populations, especially if search costs are low. A consequence is that a one-time intervention to correct inequality in a repeated game may not achieve a lasting equality outcome. In addition, in such markets, a search cost reduction may increase inequality by increasing expected payoffs in one population and reducing them in the other. Even worse, a search cost reduction may reduce the sum of all payoffs, that is, reduce the social welfare. Furthermore, allowing individual agents to offer monetary payments to facilitate acceptance by the counterparty may increase inequality and make the disadvantaged population even more worse off.

  abstract     = {Studies have shown that agencies in online advertising can exercise their market power over publishers to extract surplus. This may happen in the form of bid coordination where the agencies hold out some ad candidates from publishers’ auctions to soften competition, ultimately reducing the publishers’ ad revenue. This paper examines the publishers’ information disclosure strategies to neutralize agency market power. We show that the publisher’s withholding targeting information from agencies is an effective strategic lever to blunt the efficacy of bid coordination, and hence prevent some advertisers from using agencies. Withholding information, however, may also hurt publishers by lowering allocation efficiency. Thus, the publishers’ central tradeoff is that disclosing information increases total value created but risks conceding a large share of the value to the agency. We find that for low value of information, publishers “compete” against agencies by withholding information to induce advertisers not to use the agency. If the value of information is high, withholding information becomes too costly for publishers, and they “cooperate” with agencies by disclosing information.

  abstract     = {Price negotiations are often characterized by either the buyer or the seller introducing delays and interruptions. In the bargaining literature, time delays are considered costly and could lower the consumer’s incentives to engage in bargaining and also reduce the available surplus if the buyer and the seller engage in bargaining. In this paper, we explore the possibility that unanticipated delays from the seller can change the consumer’s willingness to pay (WTP) for the product. In a set of laboratory experiments, we find evidence that, relative to fixed pricing, bargaining can result in an increase in WTP and, consequently, in purchase likelihood. In particular, we find that the increase in WTP exists only when the seller delays the response in an unanticipated manner. Based on the recovered distributions of WTP, we find that the increase in profits under bargaining because of the increase in WTP can be sizable as compared with the gains from pure price discrimination. The results provide evidence that a seller can potentially benefit from manipulating response time but only when such manipulation is not anticipated by the consumer. We provide preliminary evidence of the underlying mechanisms and discuss the implications of these findings for researchers as well as practitioners. History: K. Sudhir served as the senior editor.

  abstract     = {A loot box is a probabilistic allocation of virtual products, the exact outcome of which is known to consumers only after purchase. Consumers sometimes purchase these goods multiple times until their preferred products are obtained. As loot boxes have been gaining enormous popularity in recent years, they are often criticized as exploitative and socially wasteful. In this study, we develop a stylized model to study the optimal design of loot boxes and its impact on profits and social welfare. We find that firms may assign asymmetric probabilities to ex ante symmetric products. Firms could use loot boxes to offer products at low prices to users who would not buy these products under the traditional pricing strategy. Loot boxes enable firms to earn higher profits because of better price discrimination and market expansion. Contrary to the widespread criticism of loot boxes as socially harmful, our analysis reveals that the loot box strategy can improve social welfare. Some platforms promise that consumers can obtain their preferred products with no more than a certain number of purchases. Contrary to conventional wisdom, our analysis reveals that such a strategy can increase firm’s profits while reducing consumer welfare. History: Anthony Dukes served as the senior editor.

We show that competition induces firms to strategically choose simpler algorithms that involve more bias but lower variance.

  abstract     = {When a firm releases its product later than its competitor, the firm loses sales because many consumers prefer to buy the competitor’s product rather than wait for the firm’s product release. Therefore, in the absence of any late-mover advantages, conventional wisdom suggests that competing firms will release their products as soon as possible to avoid losing customers if they were to enter later. However, when the market evolves over time and consumers are forward-looking, we demonstrate that this intuition fails and propose a new explanation for why a firm may strategically release its product later than its competitor. Namely, a firm’s late entry can help alleviate price competition due to some consumers’ decisions to wait for the firm’s product release instead of buying a currently available product. We show that in markets where the growth rate is sufficiently high and differentiation between firms is not too low, the firm’s profit gain from alleviated price competition dominates its profit loss from reduced sales, making the firm better off by releasing its product later than the competitor. Surprisingly, when the fraction of consumers who enter the market relatively early increases, the firm may have even greater incentives to release its product late. Finally, we consider markets where firms are differentiated both horizontally and vertically, with one firm having a higher quality (or stronger brand image) than its competitor. We find that high level of vertical differentiation will induce both high- and low-quality firms to rush to the market, releasing their products in the early period. However, when vertical differentiation is moderately high, the high-quality firm may choose to release late, whereas the low-quality firm will prefer to release its product early.

  abstract     = {A digital platform operates the marketplace that connects third-party merchants to consumers and simultaneously participates in its marketplace by selling its own product directly to consumers. This dual role raises the concern that the platform may be self-preferencing, leading to unfair competition and harming both merchants and consumers. We develop a game-theoretical model to investigate the implication of dual role on the platform’s product featuring strategy, the seller’s pricing strategy, and the consumer’s welfare. We show that the platform presents an “intermediary bias” such that it may not feature the best possible product to consumers, regardless of whether the platform is under dual role or sole marketplace mode. Surprisingly, dual role, in some scenarios, may mitigate the intermediary bias and intensify price competition in its marketplace. Consequently, prohibiting the platform from selling directly to consumers may not always be welfare-improving to consumers. Furthermore, banning the platform’s perfect product imitation can harm consumers when dual role is still allowed. History: Anthony Dukes served as the senior editor for this article.

We develop a model in which customers read an influencer’s sponsored post for a mix of entertainment and product information, and those who purchase the product can leave comments for future customers. We derive conditions in which a large celebrity influencer endorses all products, whereas a microinfluencer adopts a policy of endorsing only high-quality products. In equilibrium, the microinfluencer screens for high-quality products so his followers do not waste time reading informative comments about low-quality products. By contrast, the celebrity influencer attracts so many uninformative comments his followers do not use his comments as a source of product information, and the value of his endorsement arises solely from generating product awareness.

With expanded interest and belief in how social norms and spillovers might be leveraged to combat climate change, it is critical to understand how campaigns designed to leverage such peer effects can be best designed. In this paper, we study the role of campaign duration in solar photovoltaic adoption using a large-scale field experiment in which we randomly assign communities to campaigns with shorter durations, increasing the marketing intensity to maintain the same total resources per campaign. We find that the longer campaigns generate more WOM and lead to more adoption postcampaign despite a comparable number of installations during the campaigns. The shorter campaigns led to 22.6 fewer installations per town in the two years after the campaigns concluded, leading to a cost per acquisition of $4,367 versus $2,029 in the longer campaigns, the latter being lower than installers’ self-reported acquisition costs and the former being substantially higher.

This article provides a large-scale empirical study on such brand “transgressions” in the context of acquisition of local breweries by large conglomerates. Our analysis covering 40 brand acquisitions shows a strong negative reaction to acquisitions on social media. Analysis of transaction data shows that this adverse sentiment results in a 15% drop in baseline demand in the local market following the acquisition. This represents a significant negative shock to the acquired brand, as the local region accounts for more than one-fifth of brand sales on average, even in the long run. The decline begins immediately following the acquisition and manifests in both sales and product ratings. Our findings indicate a more pronounced reaction to acquisitions by “big business” and provide evidence of demand spillover in the home market to competing brands that remain locally owned. The theoretical and managerial implications of our findings are discussed. History: Catherine Tucker served as the senior editor.

  abstract     = {Abstract . Peer-to-peer (P2P) markets have become a critical aspect of the modern economy. We consider a P2P market in which a time-sensitive service is provided through a platform that matches providers of varying qualities to customers of varying costs. The P2P platform features bilateral ratings, which distinguish it from a traditional market: ratings of a provider reveal the provider’s service quality and ratings of a customer reveal the customer’s service cost. The existence of a cost measure in the P2P market leads to novel pricing considerations: a provider can attract low-cost customers by charging a low price, leading to an endogenous composition effect. As a result, equilibrium prices may decrease as customers become more costly to serve or as the platform’s commission rate gets higher. Under certain conditions, high-quality providers may even charge a lower equilibrium price than low-quality providers in order to cherry-pick low-cost customers. Exploratory analysis reveals that, compared with unilateral ratings, bilateral ratings may soften provider competition and raise equilibrium prices as the providers target customers in different cost segments.

In contrast with these paradigms, we find that consumers are selective about the product attributes they inspect, that they revisit items to acquire additional information, and that they often convert without collecting all available data about the selected alternatives. Our substantive motivation is the problem of providing information to consumers in a market with differentiated products. We propose a new model of gradual consumer search based on simulated beliefs and “in-tandem” decision tree and likelihood computation that allows us to characterize the full search problem in contexts with moderate numbers of alternatives. We find that the seller’s incentives to engage in search design activities tend to match the consumers’ incentives. History: Tat Chan served as the senior editor.

  abstract     = {Advertising, disseminated through media, undergoes continual transformation with evolving media technologies over time. We present a model to shed light on this evolution, elucidating the role of media format in advertising. The model features media’s steering of consumer attention over time. Consumers can decide where to direct their attention, given the media’s allocation of advertising and media content. Media technologies can constrain the allocation capability, resulting in three distinct advertising formats: static, sequential, and interactive. We analyze how different formats grapple with two fundamental problems in media advertising: incentive misalignment between consumers and media, and media’s limited ability to observe consumer ad processing. We illustrate how the interactive format strikes a balance between two extremes of attention control. For highly informative ads, the interactive medium can grant consumers full control over their attention, akin to the static format. Conversely, for moderately informative ads, it is optimal for the medium to tighten up the control just like the sequential format. These insights have broad implications for media design of advertising formats, advertiser selection of media, and the externalities of media advertising on consumers.

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of setting the optimal prices and promotions for a multi product category when the firm lacks demand information. At each time, a customer arrives and chooses a product based on a discrete choice model where each product’s utility depends on product features, its price and promotion, and the customer’s features. Using a Thompson Sampling approach, we develop a regret-minimizing or alternatively, profit-maximizing algorithm for the retailer. We provide the first adaptive algorithm that simultaneously incorporates pricing and promotions into a discrete choice model. To make our algorithm computationally feasible over an infinite space of prices and promotions, we provide a novel method for learning the optimal price and promotion given a set of demand parameters. We also provide theoretical justification for our results and improve upon existing regret guarantees. Using simulations based on real-life grocery store data, we show that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches. In addition, we extend our methodology to a contextual setting, which allows for consumer heterogeneity and personalized pricing and promotion. Compared with existing works, our approach is agnostic to the parametric specification of the utility model and needs no assumptions on the underlying distribution of customer features.

We then conduct a preregistered and incentive-compatible experiment in which we randomly expose store visitors to display ads, randomizing both advertising exposures and content. We find that ad content plays a major role in shaping advertising effects. Ads that reveal a book’s low price consistently increase demand for the advertised book relative to ads that do not reveal price. By contrast, ads that reveal the book’s genre induce some consumers to search and buy the book but lead others to reject it without search. We show these polarized responses can increase or decrease the total number of searches and purchases of the advertised book depending on the share of consumers who favor the revealed genre. Our findings suggest that advertisers should carefully choose which product attributes to reveal in their ad copies. We also show that revealing product attributes in ads does not change the total amount of search. Taken together, our results suggest the primary role of ad content is to affect consumers’ beliefs about the advertised book rather than to alter the perceived benefits from search.

The experiment provides a user-level information treatment by indicating the lower bound on the number of men and women near the user’s location. I find that, on average, an increase in market size deters users from participating in the market. Conditional on participating, market and competition size influence matching decisions.

Our model is based on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model that incorporates treatment and outcome variables. Treatment variables can affect topic composition in the text data, with topic probabilities used to predict outcomes via a logistic regression model. Lexical priors are introduced to seed topics that researchers consider relevant to an analysis, whereas non-seeded topics allow researchers to find other potential mediation paths. The resulting analysis of mediation replaces the use of rating scales with text that more flexibly reflects the reasons for respondent choices. The assessment of stimuli’s effect on topic probabilities provides information on which aspects of stimuli contribute to the change in respondents’ choices of words and their latent meanings behind these words.

  abstract     = {Traditionally, e-commerce marketplaces have enabled third-party sellers to sell to potential consumers and have earned commission from the sales. In recent years, e-commerce platforms have begun to leverage private label and sponsored advertising to generate additional revenue. Using a game-theoretic model, we examine when and why a platform may seek to give preference to its private label in sponsored advertising, and its impact on consumers and third-party sellers. Our analysis shows that self-preferencing hurts consumers even though in equilibrium the platform offers the private label at a price lower than the price of third-party sellers. Furthermore, such self-preferencing by the platform can improve the profits of some third-party sellers. We also find that it is not always optimal for the platform to self-preference its private label in sponsored advertising, particularly when advertising significantly increases demand. Moreover, the private label and sponsored advertising function as complements improving the platform’s profits. History: Anthony Dukes served as the senior editor for this article.

In this commentary, I highlight how the implications of this paper depend in part on our understanding of the potential mechanisms underlying the benefits of same-gender mentoring relationships for women. I posit that these benefits stem from differences not only in mentors’ provision of psychosocial support but also in their coaching and sponsorship behaviors. By considering these different mechanisms, I propose an alternative implication that involves training mentors to engage in more appropriate coaching and sponsorship behaviors. Thus, I expand the implications of this article from mentor matching to mentor training . I propose that, by learning how effective mentors coach and sponsor women, mentors in cross-gender relationships can be better equipped to help their mentees.

  abstract     = {Incrementality experiments compare customers exposed to a marketing action designed to increase sales with those randomly assigned to a control group. These experiments suffer from noisy responses, which make precise estimation of the average treatment effect (ATE) and marketing return difficult. We develop a model that improves the precision by estimating separate treatment effects for three latent strata defined by potential outcomes in the experiment—customers who would buy regardless of ad exposure, those who would buy only if exposed to ads, and those who would not buy regardless. The overall ATE is estimated by averaging the strata-level effects, and this produces a more precise estimator of the ATE over a wide range of conditions typical of marketing experiments. Analytical results and simulations show that the method decreases the sampling variance of the ATE most when (1) there are large differences in the treatment effect between latent strata and (2) the model used to estimate the strata-level effects is well identified. Applying the procedure to five catalog experiments shows a reduction of 30%–60% in the variance of the overall ATE. This leads to a substantial decrease in decision errors when the estimator is used to determine whether ads should be continued or discontinued. History: Olivier Toubia served as the senior editor.

  abstract     = {Censorship is widely observed in both developed and developing countries across the globe. Many policy makers and platforms filter out certain sensitive content to reduce its consumption and the corresponding social damage. However, censorship cannot perfectly eliminate all sensitive content, and content creators have various information transmission channels to circumvent censorship systems. In this paper, we construct a game-theoretic model to study the creation, consumption, and control of sensitive content. Our paper seeks to answer whether policy interventions, such as strengthening censorship, can help a social planner reduce social harm caused by the consumption of sensitive content. First, when censorship strength is at a low or high level, tightening censorship limits the spread of sensitive content; however, when censorship strength is at an intermediate level, strengthening censorship can lead to higher social harm. This is because stricter censorship can motivate creators to choose a more harmful, secret channel rather than a less harmful, open channel to transmit messages. The larger consumption volume of sensitive content in the secret channel can generate greater social damage. Our first result implies that regulators who seek to minimize social damage may take a loose censorship strategy. Second, our paper reveals that raising creators’ content creation cost can result in higher damage for the society. Third, when creators need to incur a higher cost upon being censored out, social harm can increase. History: Anthony Dukes served as the senior editor.

  abstract     = {Firms are increasingly interested in developing targeted interventions for customers with the best response. This requires identifying differences in customer sensitivity, typically through the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) estimation. In theory, to optimize long-term business performance, firms should design targeting policies based on CATE models constructed using long-term outcomes. However, we show theoretically and empirically that this method can fail to improve long-term results, particularly when the desired outcome is the cumulative result of recurring customer actions , like repeated purchases, due to the accumulation of unexplained individual differences over time. To address this challenge, we propose using a surrogate index that leverages short-term outcomes for long-term CATE estimation and policy learning. Moreover, for the creation of this index, we propose the separate imputation strategy, designed to reduce the additional variance caused by the inseparable nature of customer churn and purchase intensity, prevalent in marketing contexts. This involves constructing two distinct surrogate models, one for the observed last purchase time and the other for the observed purchase intensity. Our simulation and real-world application show that (i) using short-term signals instead of the actual long-term outcome significantly improves long-run targeting performance, and (ii) the separate imputation technique outperforms existing imputation approaches.

We consider advertising as a problem of Bayesian persuasion with costly information processing, where the type of communication messenger is costless to observe and determines the information structure consumers will face, thereby affecting their attention decisions. Messengers are classified as high type or low type based on their likelihood of generating positive signals about product match. Our findings highlight that the optimal choice of messengers depends on their signal elasticities and the firm’s decision on whether to induce consumer attention. In particular, we find that when it is crucial to raise prices and high-type messengers overshadow the product match value by providing generally positive signals, a low-type messenger can effectively capture consumer attention and persuade them to pay a higher premium. This holds true even if high-type messengers can better grab consumers’ attention by providing additional entertainment value or when some consumers are naive in belief updating.

Our large-scale field study on a mobile app with experimental and natural variation finds that consumers prefer organic listings in the top-ranked positions to sponsored listings of the same product/position. Consumers become indifferent between sponsored and organic listings in the lower-ranked positions. A mechanism check suggests that top-ranked organic listings are perceived as more credible than seller-subsidized sponsored listings. Despite consumers’ preference for organic listings, a simulation analysis shows that an advertising seller may benefit financially if a lower-ranked organic listing can be replaced with a top-ranked sponsored listing.

  abstract     = {We demonstrate how to obtain the distribution of consumer willingness to pay (WTP) for digital subscription products, where consumers pay a fixed price each period for potentially unlimited usage, for example, music streaming like Spotify. Typically, in such applications, usage data are observed and is critically valuable for the method here. We demonstrate how variation in usage and subscription choice together can identify the WTP distribution in the absence of price variation. Our framework accommodates and builds upon a range of utility specifications for usage, which is related to subscription decisions. We provide the conditions required on exogenous variation impacting usage, and prove how these lead to identification of the WTP distribution. We also investigate the conditions under which usage variation is not equivalent to price variation. We apply our method to an empirical application using the data from a music streaming service. Using the estimated WTP distribution, we obtain the revenue maximizing prices for different consumer segments. History: Tat Chan served as the senior editor for this article.

  abstract     = {Merchants are wary of a platform’s competitive entry reducing sales and margins. Profit-maximizing platforms seek to provide credible quality information to gain consumer trust and confidence. Can a platform enter so that resulting multisender prices alleviate consumers’ uncertainty by signaling quality? Can merchants also benefit from platform entry? We provide answers by analyzing strategic platform and merchant pricing under quality uncertainty. A modeling innovation is a leader-follower framework for platform-merchant competition. Consumers resolve uncertainty using both platform and merchant prices. Using what we label perfect Bayes-consistent beliefs, we identify perfect Bayesian equilibrium that satisfies the intuitive criterion, and also out-of-equilibrium beliefs that are unprejudiced. A substantive finding is that platform entry can raise merchant profits when the quality is high by moving the equilibrium from pooling to separating, and supporting higher prices. Another strategic consequence of platform entry could be a separating equilibrium with incomplete market coverage due to price distortion moving to one of complete market coverage due to seller competition. Indeed, conditions exist in our model for an equilibrium outcome identical to complete information. Finally, facing entry cost, a platform may choose to enter only with high quality but quality revelation remains price dependent and not based on mere entry.

  abstract     = {We study how consumers choose among perishable items with different expiration dates and the effects of these choices on retail food waste. We use a novel data set that tracks choices at the expiration-date level. Our data include a field experiment with dynamic discounts for oldest-vintage items and retailer-driven shelf rotations. We develop a theoretical framework with consumers who may be uninformed due to choice frictions (costly search) or mental gaps (ignoring expiration dates), and we derive testable predictions related to consumer information, dynamic pricing, and shelf organization. Our empirical analyses lead to four main findings. First, consumers make uninformed choices: In almost half of purchases, consumers choose an older item when an equally priced, fresher one is available, and simply rotating the oldest vintage forward increases its choice share by 24 percentage points. Second, both mental gaps and choice frictions cause consumers to make uninformed choices. Third, dynamic discounts encourage consumers to purchase the oldest vintage by discouraging search for fresher items. By discouraging search, discounts have an unexpected spillover effect of keeping the shelf organized after shelf rotations, which affects future consumers’ choices. Fourth, we quantify the waste implications of this spillover using counterfactual simulations. Dynamic pricing and shelf rotation alone reduce waste by 6% and 15%, respectively, but combined, these policies reduce waste 30%—much more than the sum of their individual effects. Our findings suggest that relatively simple changes in pricing and display strategies can substantially reduce waste in perishables.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the interplay between advertising and decentralized content creation on digital content platforms, such as YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram. Unlike traditional media, content on these platforms is produced by numerous creators competing for viewer attention. This study addresses how a platform’s advertising policy (specifically, the level of advertising embedded in organic content) and various market factors, including viewers’ satiation rates and their distaste for ads, influence decentralized content creation, exploring the ensuing implications for the platform’s advertising and revenue-sharing policy design. Using a game-theoretical model, the research reveals that the level of advertising, viewers’ satiation rates, and their distaste for ads can have a nonmonotonic impact on the equilibrium content quality. Contrary to conventional wisdom, a low level of advertising could be advantageous for platforms when viewers are inclined to consume high volumes of content, factoring in the strategic influence on content creation. Additionally, revenue sharing with creators depends on factors such as the viewers’ satiation rates and the creators’ creative costs. This study offers content platforms strategic guidance on refining their advertising and revenue-sharing policies in the creator economy. History: Anthony Dukes served as the senior editor.

  abstract     = {Advertising bans typically target products that deceive consumers in ways that can threaten their physical and mental health. An alternative policy objective might seek environmental protection through a ban on print advertising. Such measures would profoundly affect grocery retailers relying on printed leaflets to communicate weekly promotions. We measure the causal effect of banning advertising on retail performance by studying a temporary advertising ban implemented in a German federal state during the COVID-19 pandemic. The ban resulted in the suspension of all print advertising by grocery retailers, and the exogenous variation in advertising created by this natural experiment serves as our identification strategy. We apply difference-in-differences regressions to data from a national grocery retailer and find that the ban resulted in a 6% sales decrease in the treated state compared with an adjacent state. GfK Household Panel data reveal no effect of the advertising ban on the market level but a negative impact on retailers offering and advertising weekly promotional product assortments. We study the sensitivity of these results to the COVID pandemic and find that neither changes in COVID-19 incidence, vaccination rates, nor customers’ mobility moderate the ad ban effect. The findings offer practical insights for regulators and retailers regarding the impact of ad bans and the value of advertising.

  abstract     = {We explore the viability of large language models (LLMs), specifically OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, in emulating human survey respondents and eliciting preferences, with a focus on intertemporal choices. Leveraging the extensive literature on intertemporal discounting for benchmarking, we examine responses from LLMs across various languages and compare them with human responses, exploring preferences between smaller, sooner and larger, later rewards. Our findings reveal that both generative pretrained transformer (GPT) models demonstrate less patience than humans, with GPT-3.5 exhibiting a lexicographic preference for earlier rewards unlike human decision makers. Although GPT-4 does not display lexicographic preferences, its measured discount rates are still considerably larger than those found in humans. Interestingly, GPT models show greater patience in languages with weak future tense references, such as German and Mandarin, aligning with the existing literature that suggests a correlation between language structure and intertemporal preferences. We demonstrate how prompting GPT to explain its decisions, a procedure we term “chain-of-thought conjoint,” can mitigate, but does not eliminate, discrepancies between LLM and human responses. Although directly eliciting preferences using LLMs may yield misleading results, combining chain-of-thought conjoint with topic modeling aids in hypothesis generation, enabling researchers to explore the underpinnings of preferences. Chain-of-thought conjoint provides a structured framework for marketers to use LLMs to identify potential attributes or factors that can explain preference heterogeneity across different customers and contexts.

  abstract     = {When users share multidimensional data about themselves with a firm, the firm learns about the correlations between different dimensions of user data. We incorporate this type of learning into a model of a data market in which a firm acquires data from users with privacy concerns. Each user can share no data, only nonsensitive data, or their full data with the firm. As the firm collects more data and becomes better at drawing inferences about a user’s privacy-sensitive data from their nonsensitive data, the share of new users who share no data (“digital hermits”) grows. This growth of digital hermits occurs even though the firm offers higher compensation for a user’s nonsensitive data and a user’s full data as its ability to draw inferences improves. At the same time, the share of new users who share their full data also grows. The model thus predicts a polarization of users’ data-sharing choices away from nonsensitive data sharing to no sharing and full sharing. Our model suggests that recent privacy policies, which are focused on control of data rather than inferences, may be misplaced. History: Anthony Dukes served as the senior editor.

To illustrate this new approach, we apply it to Prosper, which is a peer-to-peer lending platform. We develop a structural model, in which Prosper uses an adaptive learning algorithm to continuously update its predictive models about borrowers’ and lenders’ behavior as more data become available and uses these updated models to help assign loan ratings over time. To infer which adaptive learning algorithm Prosper may adopt, we consider a set of algorithms motivated by the machine learning literature. For each algorithm, we use observed Prosper loan-rating decisions to estimate the structural parameters of Prosper’s objective function. By comparing the goodness-of-fit of these algorithm-specific models, we find that Prosper most likely uses an ensemble algorithm, which selects past observations based on their economic conditions. We conduct counterfactual experiments to shed light on: (i) How does an exclusive focus on either accurately reporting loan risk or expected current revenue influence Prosper’s decision making? (ii) What is the value of adaptive learning for Prosper? (iii) Is there any potential for Prosper to improve its current adaptive learning algorithm? History: Tat Chan served as the senior editor.

  abstract     = {This paper studies the impact of international business coaching via virtual collaboration technology on the strategies and sales of emerging market entrepreneurs. It sheds light on three novel research questions. (1) What is the effect of virtual business coaching on firm sales? (2) What is the mechanism through which this effect occurs? Specifically, does virtual coaching stimulate shifts in marketing strategy? (3) Do entrepreneurs benefit more from virtual coaching when they are less strategic in their decision making? We conducted a randomized controlled field experiment with 930 entrepreneurs in Uganda to examine the impact of a virtual coaching intervention that connects management professionals in primarily advanced markets and entrepreneurs in emerging markets with the aim of improving business performance. The analysis finds a positive and significant main effect on firm sales; treatment entrepreneurs increase monthly sales by 27.6% on average. In addition, entrepreneurs who receive virtual coaching are 52.8% more likely to have shifted their marketing strategy in a new direction. Moreover, consistent with this mechanism of inducing strategic business changes, the results show that entrepreneurs who receive virtual coaching tend to do better when they (ex ante) lack strategic focus. These results have important implications for the development of marketing strategies by entrepreneurs and multinational managers, as well as for policy makers interested in improving the performance of small firms in emerging markets and beyond.

  abstract     = {We study the problem faced by an online retail platform choosing product rankings in order to maximize two distinct goals: consumer surplus and revenues/profits. To this end, we specify a version of the Weitzman sequential search model in which search reveals a consumer’s idiosyncratic taste for the product as well as vertical dimensions of its quality, and we derive convenient expressions for consumer surplus and revenues. To optimize consumer surplus, platforms should facilitate product discovery by promoting “diamonds in the rough,” that is, products with a large gap between the utility they deliver and what consumers expect based on the presearch information. By contrast, to maximize static revenues, the platform should favor high-margin products, potentially creating a tension between the two objectives. We develop computationally tractable algorithms for estimating consumer preferences and optimizing rankings, and we provide approximate optimality guarantees in the latter case. When we apply our approach to data from Expedia, our suggested consumer surplus–optimizing ranking achieves both higher consumer surplus and higher revenues relative to the Expedia ranking—delivering a Pareto improvement—and also dominates ranking the products in order of utility, which is intuitive but fails to leverage information on what consumers know presearch.

  abstract     = {Online marketplaces use ranking algorithms to determine the rank-ordering of items sold on their websites. The standard practice is to determine the optimal algorithm using A/B tests. We present a theoretical framework to characterize the total average treatment effect (TATE) of a ranking algorithm in an A/B test and show that naive TATE estimates can be biased because of interference. We propose a bias-correction approach that can recover the TATE of a ranking algorithm based on past A/B tests even if those tests suffer from a combination of interference issues. Our solution leverages data across multiple experiments and identifies observations in partial equilibrium in each experiment, that is, items close to their positions under the true counterfactual equilibrium of interest. We apply our framework to data from a travel website and present comprehensive evidence for interference bias in this setting. Next, we use our solution concept to build a customized deep learning model to predict the true TATE of the main algorithm of interest in our data. Counterfactual estimates from our model show that naive TATE estimates of click and booking rates can be biased by as much as 15% and 29%, respectively.

  abstract     = {Public health regulators in the United States are currently advocating for a ban on menthol-flavored cigarettes because they are believed to be more dangerous than traditional nonmenthol cigarettes. However, these bans will have limited benefits if consumers are able to circumvent them. We examine this issue by evaluating the effects of a statewide menthol ban that was instituted by Massachusetts in 2020. An examination of store-level retail sales data from Massachusetts indicates that some demand shifted from menthols to nonmenthols after the ban was instituted, thereby supporting the goals of the ban. However, broadening our analysis to neighboring states shows a sharp increase in menthol sales in areas just outside the Massachusetts border, thereby suggesting that many Massachusetts residents were able to get around the ban by engaging in cross-state shopping for menthol cigarettes. This cross-state shopping is damaging because it reduces the tax revenue for Massachusetts while also not yielding any positive public health benefits among its population. To provide policy makers with guidance regarding the benefits of alternative policies, we develop and estimate a structural model that accounts for heterogeneity in (i) prices across states, (ii) distances from state borders, and (iii) menthol shares across Massachusetts. We show that a statewide menthol tax might be preferable over either a statewide menthol ban or a national ban because it yields sizable reductions in smoking activity while also generating up to 14% in additional tax revenue.

  abstract     = {Advertising theory offers competing perspectives on how advertising might affect life satisfaction. For instance, advertising may have some negative effects by increasing materialism, or it may have some positive effects by reducing marketplace uncertainty. Yet research investigating these connections remains limited. We compile a data set of per capita advertising expenditure to investigate advertising’s relationship with life satisfaction within 76 countries from 2006 to 2019. We deal with several sources of endogeneity and account for other determinants of life satisfaction (e.g., gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, social support) in our analysis. Results from a within-country fixed-effect model indicate that per capita advertising expenditure is positively related to national average life satisfaction. Moderation analyses of this aggregate secondary data and two individual-level experiments provide mechanistic evidence that this occurs because of advertising’s ability to reduce marketplace uncertainty. However, supplemental analyses and an additional experiment indicate that this positive relationship is attenuated through a materialism pathway in certain situations (e.g., related to cultural, income, and subjective inequality factors) and can become negative. As such, we provide the first nuanced and multifaceted view of advertising’s complex relationship with life satisfaction in the marketing literature.

The paper shows that, given the existence of these two signals for an outcome, the expected value function of the outcome exhibits diminishing sensitivities both above and below the reference point. Furthermore, in the examples considered, loss aversion occurs if the reference point is not too high. The paper shows how the informativeness of each signal affects the declining sensitivities and loss aversion effects and how the model reduces to risk-neutral decision making when the continuous signal on the value of the outcome is perfectly informative. The loss aversion effects occur for low reference points because the reference point is below the expected value of the outcome and because of the greater likelihood of receiving the signal that the outcome is above the reference point. The paper obtains the same result in a rational inattention framework because the individual may pay greater attention to the less likely low outcomes.

We apply unsupervised machine learning algorithms agnostic to the shopping channel to identify what constitutes a typical food shopping trip for each household. We find that food shopping basket variety is significantly lower for online shopping trips as measured by the number of unique food categories and items purchased. Within a given household, the Instacart baskets are more similar to each other as compared with offline baskets with twice as many overlapping items between successive trips to the same retailer. These results suggest a potential link between online grocery shopping environments and heightened consumer inertia, which may lead to stronger brand loyalty and pose challenges for new entrants in establishing a customer base. Furthermore, Instacart baskets have 13% fewer fresh vegetables and 5%–7% fewer impulse purchases, such as candy, bakery desserts, and savory snacks, which are not compensated for by alternative or additional shopping trips. We discuss the implications of these systematic shopping basket differences for competition, product management, retailers, consumers, and online platforms.

  abstract     = {Media platforms generate revenue by bringing consumers and advertisers together. Although advertisers like to promote their services and products to consumers, consumers dislike advertisements to varying levels. Given heterogeneity in consumers’ dislike for ads, platforms could adopt either a uniform pricing strategy or a tiered pricing strategy for consumers. In this paper, we examine competing media platforms’ equilibrium pricing strategies in the presence of cross-side externalities between consumers and advertisers and their endogenous homing decisions. We find that symmetric platforms may adopt asymmetric pricing strategies in an attempt to focus on different sides of the market and soften interplatform competition if the incremental value that consumers derive from multihoming is large. However, they pursue only symmetric pricing strategies if this value is small. Counter to the intuition based on one-sided markets, our analysis shows that tiered pricing strategies need not improve the profits of platforms competing in a media market. In fact, when the incremental value that consumers derive from multihoming is large, competing platforms may earn lower profits from tiered pricing and yet pursue it (Prisoner’s dilemma). In contrast to standard results on tiered prices, we find that high-type consumers may not pay as much as their full willingness-to-pay for ad avoidance, implying that the incentive-compatibility constraint of high-type consumers may not be binding. Finally, we extend the model to allow for heterogeneous advertisers, vary the decision sequence, permit platforms to compete on ad capacity (rather than ad price), entertain an alternative formulation of transportation cost, and consider correlated advertising reach.

  abstract     = {E-cigarette use, or vaping, is a public health concern, with particular worries about underage use. The U.S. government is expected to introduce federal taxation on vaping. The potential deterrent effect of such a tax on underage users is understudied because of the absence of underage use data. To cut through this data fog, we use Instagram images from 2016 to 2018 to estimate whether a tax change in California affected vaping-related posting by underage users. This posting behavior is a potential proxy for consumption behavior. We use image analysis (residual neural networks) and latent factor models for causal inference of tax effects. Compared with counterfactuals, we find a relative decline in the incidence of underage users (in effect a slower increase in postings) in vaping-related images in California for about six months, with no effects after. There is gender and race heterogeneity in these effects. Our proposed approach of using near real-time social media images can be helpful to regulators and managers, especially in the rapidly changing landscape expected in the coming months.

  abstract     = {Short-form video-sharing platforms have seen phenomenal growth in recent years. One type of video that often goes viral on such platforms is the condensed clips derived from existing full-length video content. The traditional entertainment industry has strongly criticized this new form of user-generated derivative content owing to the potential for infringement on copyright owners’ exclusive rights and de facto theft of viewers from original works. However, little is known of the actual impact of condensed clips on the demand for corresponding original works. In this study, we seek to identify such impact with the help of an exogenous boycott event in April 2021 that forced Chinese TikTok to remove condensed clips more proactively. Our results indicate that their removal had reduced the demand for corresponding full-length original works on a major video streaming platform by approximately 3%. In other words, condensed clips serve as friends, rather than foes, of streaming services. Further analyses suggested that positive spillover effects resulted from the fact that condensed clips could enhance the visibility of original works, and such effects were stronger if the original work was of higher quality or had a more fascinating storyline. Our results offer rich managerial and policy insights. History: Catherine Tucker served as the senior editor for this article.

  abstract     = {As the quantity and value of data increase, so do the severity of data breaches and customer privacy invasions. Although firms typically publicize their post hoc protective actions, little is known about the aftereffects of major breaches on users’ behaviors; do they alter their interactions with the firm, continue “business as usual,” or do something more subtle? We explore these questions in the context of a severe data breach to a matchmaking website for those seeking an (extramarital) affair. A challenge to measuring “treatment effects” for a massive and highly publicized breach is the lack of an obvious control group. To resolve this problem, we propose Temporal Causal Inference (TCI); each group of users who joined during a given time window is matched with an appropriate (control) group of users who had joined prior to it, helping to account for “usage trajectories” in both individual and temporal site behavior. Following the creation of the control groups, we adapt Causal Forests ( Athey et al. 2019 ) into Temporal Causal Forests (TCF). TCF allows for insights regarding both average and individual-level treatment (data breach) effects as well as both demographic and usage-based covariates that align with them. Our analyses reveal a decrease in the probability of searching and messaging on the website and a notable increase in the probability of deleting photos, the primary avenue for avoiding further personal identification. Moreover, these effects are broadly robust to a variety of causal inference methodologies, both with and without TCI or Causal Forests. Intriguingly, these initially negative reaction(s) did not persist; by the third week after the announcement, there were hints of “life returns to normal.” Despite the specificity of the setting, our analysis suggests both managerial and policy imperatives to help protect customers’ privacy.

  abstract     = {Testing email marketing effectiveness is an active research area because email remains an important channel for customer acquisition and retention. Email open rates are a key measure of campaign effectiveness. Scholars identify three predictors of open rates: recipients’ characteristics, headline characteristics, and sending time. The industry-favored A/B testing has three drawbacks: it takes hours, depletes lists available for main campaigns, and limits testable email versions because of sample size and power requirements. These limitations continue to motivate researchers to build and improve open rate prediction models. Although they reduce testing time, models developed in marketing use only recipients’ past open rates as predictors. By contrast, models in computer science typically use only email headline characteristics as predictors. Consequently, current models’ open rate prediction errors are high. The authors address the limitations of both literature streams and use all three predictors and machine learning to build an email open rate predictor (EMOP) based on their universal emotion detector (UED). They test EMOP on data from four brands and set state-of-the-art prediction results. Experimental validation shows that EMOP can pick the best headline from a set of professionally generated headlines. Also, UED ranked second at the SemEval 2018 Task 1 E-c competition as of January 5, 2023. History: Olivier Toubia served as the senior editor for this article.

  abstract     = {Retargeted advertising is a popular form of digital advertising that algorithmically delivers ads to users who previously visited an advertiser’s website. We empirically investigate the challenge of estimating individual-level advertising response when the data stem from a field experiment randomized at the cookie level. Such experiments are common in the industry. We investigate how cookie-level randomization manifests itself at the individual level and the role it plays in measuring retargeted advertising effectiveness. We show that cookie-based analyses to assess retargeted advertising effectiveness are flawed. Cookie randomization breaks down because of the presence of individuals who have both treatment and control cookies—these individuals are more engaged and spend more. Because of the cookie propagation effect we uncover, individual assignment to the treatment and control groups is not random. Individual-level analyses, in conjunction with first-party data, paint a more complete picture of the impact of retargeted advertising. We detect an increase in offline sales that cookie-based analyses fail to capture.

  abstract     = {Sharing about charity online or in personal conversations can help raise awareness and bolster fundraising efforts for good causes. However, when deciding whether to tell others about their charitable giving, donors may focus more on possible risks to their reputation (e.g., of seeming braggy, inauthentic) than on potential word-of-mouth benefits for the charity. In a large, preregistered field experiment, we tested a post-donation intervention designed to encourage word-of-mouth by reorienting donors to the idea that sharing about charity means doing more good; 77,485 donors received either a control or treatment message asking them to share a link to the cause via social media, text, or email. Compared with the organization’s standard solicitation (“Please share your donation…”), our intervention emphasized consequences of sharing for the cause (“Your donation can start a chain reaction…”). This brief message increased click-through by 5.1% and likelihood of recruiting at least one later donation via word-of-mouth by 12.4%. Exploratory follow-up analyses suggest that these effects are most pronounced among larger-gift donors; the more donors gave, the more responsive they were to the intervention. Whereas many field experiments aim to increase giving directly, we test an intervention designed to boost word-of-mouth for worthy causes. We discuss approaches for encouraging sharing in the domain of charity and beyond. History: Olivier Toubia served as the senior editor for this article.

  abstract     = {Randomized controlled trials generate experimental variation that can credibly identify causal effects, but often suffer from limited scale, whereas observational data sets are large, but often violate desired identification assumptions. To improve estimation efficiency, I propose a method that leverages imperfect instruments—pretreatment covariates that satisfy the relevance condition, but may violate the exclusion restriction. I show that these imperfect instruments can be used to derive moment restrictions that, in combination with the experimental data, improve estimation efficiency. I outline estimators for implementing this strategy and show that my methods can reduce variance by up to 50%; therefore, only half of the experimental sample is required to attain the same statistical precision. I apply my method to a search-listing data set from Expedia that studies the causal effect of search rankings on clicks and show that the method can substantially improve the precision.

This paper evaluates the role of advertising in providing information to the platform regarding new product quality so as to solve this “cold start” problem and to engineer higher quality organic listings. Using a large-scale experiment implemented at JD.com —a large e-commerce platform in China—we show that using ad propensity information for ranking new products benefits both the platform and consumers. Our findings showcase a new channel by which advertising can potentially improve outcomes for consumers and platforms in e-commerce through its ability to reveal information that can be used by platforms to improve search ranking algorithms.

  abstract     = {Intermediary agents play a crucial role in connecting sellers and buyers across various markets. However, the emergence of digital platforms has provided more affordable channels for direct transactions, challenging the dominance of agents. In this study, we examine the impact of a for-sale-by-owner (FSBO) platform on real estate agents’ listing prices. By using a natural experiment in China, we find that the introduction of the FSBO platform leads to a 2.8% decrease in listing prices, a percentage comparable to the commission rate typically charged by agents. The cost advantage provided by the FSBO platform appears to be the primary driver behind this price drop rather than selection bias in listings. Furthermore, the impact of reduced listing prices extends to the final sales price of the properties. These findings carry important policy implications for competition regulation of intermediaries.

We design a model of an online retail marketplace with a platform that manipulates sellers’ product attractiveness and sellers’ organic ranking order, and the sellers decide product prices and bid for sponsored advertising space on the platform. We find that the platform may manipulate an inferior seller’s product to appear more attractive to intensify sellers’ competition to bid for advertising and also manipulate a superior seller’s organic placement to either compensate or penalize the superior seller. We show that public policies, such as banning fake sales and fake reviews only by third-party sellers, may not necessarily eradicate manipulation on the platform if they ignore the platform’s incentive for manipulation in the first place.

I use a structural econometric model with sales, perishability, and marginal cost data from a grocery chain’s artisanal bread category. My analysis of these counterfactuals shows that dynamic pricing Pareto-dominates an organic waste ban: Dynamic pricing reduces waste by 21% while increasing the chain’s gross margins and consumer surplus by 3% and 0.3%, respectively. In contrast, an organic waste ban, simulated by a ten-fold increase in disposal costs, reduces waste by only 4% and decreases profits and consumer surplus. Therefore, if regulators want to reduce grocery-store waste, they should incentivize chains to adopt dynamic pricing over imposing organic waste bans. History: K.

  abstract     = {Consumers worldwide have been struggling to keep up with rising costs of living. Although many firms have (directly) increased their prices, others have engaged in the practice of product downsizing—decreasing the size or quantity of the product without changing its price. In this research, I investigate consumers’ beliefs about the fairness of product downsizing compared with equivalent price increases (i.e., holding the price per unit of product constant). Five preregistered experiments demonstrate that, whereas the vast majority of people judge price increases in response to cost increases as fair, this pattern is attenuated—or even reversed—for product downsizing. Consequently, the proportion of consumers who view product downsizing as unfair is greater than the proportion who view an equivalent price increase as unfair. This phenomenon, referred to as “shrinkflation aversion,” is predominantly driven by consumers’ beliefs that product downsizing (versus price increases) is a deceptive practice. Importantly, I provide empirical evidence for two key moderators of the phenomenon: (1) the transparency of the product change and (2) the presence (versus absence) of increases in the firm’s costs.

  abstract     = {The difference-in-differences (DID) method is the most widely used tool to answer causal questions from quasiexperimental data in marketing and the broader social sciences. Because assignment to treatment in quasiexperiments is not random, the selection of proper control units is critically important for estimating the causal effect. DID requires that the treatment unit’s outcomes would have been parallel to the average of the control units’ outcomes in the absence of treatment. However, this DID parallel trends assumption is likely to be violated when assignment to the treatment and control groups is not random. We propose a simple forward difference-in-differences (Forward DID) method that uses a forward selection algorithm to flexibly select a relevant subset of control units. The Forward DID has several advantages. First, it can be widely applied and suitable even when DID is too restrictive. Second, Forward DID can accommodate any number of control units. Third, there are no overfitting concerns because Forward DID only needs to estimate one parameter after identifying a subset of control units. Fourth, Forward DID has computational advantages over algorithms that consider all possible subsets of control units. Finally, we establish consistency and develop inference theory, which is applicable to both stationary and nonstationary data. We demonstrate the usefulness of the Forward DID method and compare it with the alternative methods using simulations and an application to store openings.

  abstract     = {This paper explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) to substitute for human participants in market research. Such LLMs can be used to generate text given a prompt. We argue that perceptual analysis is a particularly promising use case for such automated market research for certain product categories. The proposed new method generates outputs that closely match those generated from human surveys: agreement rates between human- and LLM- generated data sets reach over 75%. Moreover, this applies for perceptual analysis based on both brand similarity measures and product attribute ratings. The paper demonstrates that, for some categories, this new method of fully or partially automated market research will increase the efficiency of market research by meaningfully speeding up the process and potentially reducing the cost. Further results also suggest that with an ever larger training corpus applied to large language models, LLM-based market research will be applicable to answer more nuanced questions based on demographic variables or contextual variation that would be prohibitively expensive or infeasible with human respondents.

  abstract     = {Among the millions of entrepreneurs in developing economies, few are able to earn a decent livelihood. To help these entrepreneurs succeed, governmental and nongovernmental organizations invest billions of dollars every year in providing training programs. Many of these programs involve providing entrepreneurs with mentors. Unfortunately, the effects of these programs are often muted, or even null, for woman-owned firms. Against this backdrop, we tested whether gender matching, where female entrepreneurs are randomly paired with a female mentor, could help address the gender gap. Findings from a randomized controlled field experiment with 930 Ugandan entrepreneurs show that mentor gender has a powerful impact on female entrepreneurs. Firm sales and profits of female entrepreneurs guided by a female mentor increased by, on average, 32% and 31% compared with the control group, and these estimates are even larger for female entrepreneurs with high aspirations. In contrast, female entrepreneurs guided by a male mentor did not significantly improve performance compared with the control group. We provide suggestive mechanism evidence that female mentor-mentee arrangements were characterized by more positive engagements.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we build a two-member, two-period model to show that, when a group of people with different preferences conducts a search and makes a decision using the majority voting rule, they can benefit from making a commitment on the number of products to search ex ante (i.e., conducting a fixed-sample search) when the search cost is small enough or relatively large. The underlying mechanism is that, because of the preference inconsistency between group members, they tend to search fewer products and, thus, have lower expected utility in group search than in single-agent search, and making a commitment on the number of products to search helps mitigate the preference inconsistency problem in group search, especially when the search cost is small enough or relatively large. We further show that, under alternative voting rules, there also exist ranges of search cost in which fixed-sample search works better than sequential search as long as the voting rule is exogenously determined. If the group can endogenously choose the voting rule that maximizes their expected utility, then sequential search is always preferable to fixed-sample search. We also consider several extensions to show the robustness of our finding. History: Ganesh Iyer served as the senior editor.

  abstract     = {We study how the history of foreign invasion affects consumers’ country-of-origin choices in the context of the Chinese automotive market. Our research design exploits two natural experiments: (i) the Imperial Japanese Army’s Continental Cross-Through Operation in 1944 in China, which created local variations in war losses and casualties, and (ii) the China–Japan conflict over the sovereignty disputes in 2012 that renewed the salience of the history of the Japanese invasion. Using a discrete choice model, we find that, after the 2012 conflict, the history of invasion has a negative effect on the brand preference of Japanese cars and a positive effect on Chinese cars. The effects translate to a 6.8% decline and 5.3% increase in the sales of Japanese and Chinese cars in invaded counties compared with neighboring noninvaded counties despite similar pretrends. Both effects persisted for more than 24 months. The heterogeneous effects show rich managerial implications: the history effects are stronger for higher priced and larger cars as well as more recognizably Japanese or Chinese cars. Creating local independent brands helps foreign brands to take advantage of the history effect. We also explore the mechanism and find supporting evidence for memory transmission as well as the role of local protests as a mediator of the history effect. History: K.

  abstract     = {Rebates have long been recognized as a price discrimination mechanism. When firms offer an extensive product line, an important managerial question concerns the choice of which products to promote. This paper finds that a multiproduct firm leverages rebates to screen consumers on the basis of their redemption costs, which enables it to exercise price discrimination via the product line more effectively. In particular, because consumers who use rebates tend to have lower valuations, the classic cannibalization concern is less severe in the product line offered to rebate users. Therefore, the lowest-quality product that is promoted with a rebate is of higher quality than the lowest-quality product that is offered without rebate. Hence, the firm does not promote its lowest-quality products. Instead, by promoting some products with rebates, the firm drives some low-valuation consumers to trade up to higher-quality products. Notably, it is found that, contrary to the commonly held view, rebates can serve a price discrimination role even when redeemed by all consumers. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel price discrimination explanation for large rebates, sometimes in the order of several hundreds of dollars, that are frequently used in industries such as consumer electronics and household appliances.

  abstract     = {Digital content platforms increasingly implement paywalls to generate subscription revenue, but putting content behind paywalls can reduce consumption and advertising revenue. We analyze optimal paywall design when consumers are heterogenous in their valuation for and satiation with content and endogenously determine their consumption. We find that, under moderate ad rates, a metered paywall offering a limited amount of free content is optimal when consumers display sufficient heterogeneity in satiation. When ad rates increase, one might expect platforms to offer more free content to generate higher ad revenue. Instead, we find that sometimes offering less free content and lowering the subscription price is optimal to attract new subscribers. Further, depending on ad rates, the optimal amount of free content may increase or decrease in consumers’ valuation for content. As valuation increases, consumers’ willingness to pay for subscription and desire for content consumption increases. The former effect dominates under low ad rates and incentivizes the platform to provide less free content, but the opposite is true under high ad rates. Counterintuitively, we also find that total content consumption can increase with the proportion of users who become satiated relatively faster because the platform may strategically raise its meter limit to increase ad revenues from nonsubscribers. We also explore the impact of a more appealing outside option for consumers, competition between media platforms, and correlation between valuation and satiation on the optimality of paywalls.

  abstract     = {We propose a human-machine hybrid approach to automating decision making in high human-interaction environments and apply it in the business-to-business (B2B) retail context. Using sales transactions data from a B2B aluminum retailer, we create an automated version of each salesperson, which learns and automatically reapplies the salesperson’s pricing policy. In a field experiment with the B2B retailer, we provide salespeople with their own model’s price recommendations in real time. We find that, despite the loss of private salesperson information, reducing intertemporal behavioral biases by providing the model’s price to the salesperson increases profits for treated quotes by 11% relative to a control condition. Using counterfactual analyses, we show that although the model’s pricing leads to higher profitability in most cases, salespeople generate higher profits when pricing out-of-the-ordinary or complex quotes. Accordingly, we propose a machine learning hybrid pricing strategy with two levels of automation. First, a random forest model automatically allocates quotes to either the model or the salesperson based on its prediction of whose pricing would generate higher profits. Then, if the quote is allocated to the model, the model determines the price. The hybrid strategy generates profits significantly higher than either the model or the salespeople. History: K.

  abstract     = {Industry practitioners often emphasize the importance of manufacturer–retailer relationships in product distribution. In this paper, I formalize the industry’s notion of a relationship with a repeated game framework and study its impact in the heavily regulated hard cider market. I present evidence that retailers and leading manufacturers coordinate with and offer preferential treatment to each other when setting assortments and wholesale prices. Based on this evidence, I develop a repeated game–based model to estimate each pair’s coordination, which is linked to the manufacturer’s performance at the retailer in the broader beer market. The results show the relationships increase new cider availability by 17.5% and 5.1%, respectively, for Anheuser-Busch InBev and MillerCoors, the two leading brewers. The relationship’s effect is determined jointly by the degree of assortment distortion and the reduction in double marginalization. Although these relationships could improve welfare, they imply that current regulations in the alcoholic beverage industry fail to generate a level playing field for every manufacturer.

  abstract     = {Many online retailers offer personalized recommendations to help consumers make their choices. Although standard recommendation algorithms are designed to guide consumers to the most relevant items, retailers can instead choose to steer consumers toward profitable options. We ask whether such strategic behavior arises in practice and to what extent it reduces consumers’ benefits from personalized recommendations. Using data from a large-scale randomized experiment in which a large online retailer introduced personalized rankings, we show that personalization makes consumers search more and generates more purchases relative to uniform bestseller-based rankings. We then estimate a model of search and rankings and use it to reverse-engineer the retailer’s objectives and to assess the effect of personalized rankings on consumer welfare. Our results reveal that although the current algorithm does put positive weight on profitability, personalized rankings still substantially increase consumer surplus. This case study suggests that online retailers may have incentives to adopt consumer-centric personalization algorithms as a way to retain consumers and maximize long-term growth.

However, there is a mismatch between the spending power of overlooked consumers and the dearth of products for which companies have invested in inclusive product design. This paper develops an analytical model to examine how company culture and bias in the research process influence the investment in inclusive product design and the product’s expected profitability. Interestingly, the results show that under specific company cultures, a research bias against finding the need for inclusive product design can actually increase the probability of investment in inclusive product design, relative to when there is no research bias. The results of the model define the conditions for when each direction of research bias (in favor or against) can lead to more investment or less investment in inclusive product design. The findings have implications for companies that are able to influence the research bias or the company culture in which the researcher works.

Using a data set of 21 crowdsourcing contests that include 4,191 ideas, we test how artificial intelligence can assist experts in screening ideas. The authors have three major findings. First, whereas even the best previously published theory-based models cannot mimic human experts in choosing the best ideas, a simple model using the least average shrinkage and selection operator can efficiently screen out ideas considered bad by experts. In an additional 22nd hold-out contest with internal and external experts, the simple model does better than external experts in predicting the ideas selected by internal experts. Second, the authors develop an idea screening efficiency curve that trades off the false negative rate against the total ideas screened. Managers can choose the desired point on this curve given their loss function. The best model specification can screen out 44% of ideas, sacrificing only 14% of good ideas. Alternatively, for those unwilling to lose any winners, a novel two-step approach screens out 21% of ideas without sacrificing a single first place winner. Third, a new predictor, word atypicality, is simple and efficient in screening. Theoretically, this predictor screens out atypical ideas and keeps inclusive and rich ideas.

We study the incentives of an intermediary to disclose consumer information to advertisers when auctioning ad impressions. In turn, we study how disclosure affects the incentives of publishers to outsource the sale of their ads to an intermediary and relate these incentives to the extent of consumer multihoming, the competitiveness of advertising markets, and the ability of platforms to profile consumers. We show that disclosing information that enables advertisers to optimize the allocation of ads on multihoming consumers is profitable to the intermediary only if advertising markets are sufficiently thick. When markets are thin, retaining information on consumers’ type is superior to retaining information on exposure to ads. Even though consumers multihome, the publishers may be worse off by outsourcing to the intermediary, in particular if they operate in thin advertising markets. Finally, we study how the intermediary responds to policies designed to enhance transparency and consumer privacy, and the implications of these policies for the online advertising market.

  abstract     = {Most car buyers are unaware that dealers can mark up interest rates for auto loans, the third most prevalent U.S. consumer debt category, beyond the rate dictated by lenders. Dealers can set their markups without considering buyer risk profiles, potentially leading to discrimination. Using individual transaction-level data from a 20% random sample of U.S. car dealers between 2004 and 2015, this paper shows that women and minorities pay a statistically significant 0.6% and 2.6% greater interest rate markup than men and nonminorities, respectively. The racial and gender gaps in dealer markups largely attenuate over time. Additionally, the premia for minorities and women are larger for those buyers in census block groups with lower education levels, those not trading in a car, and those in markets with fewer financial institutions. Although we find no heterogeneity in the racial gap by age and political inclination, the gender gap increases for women who are relatively older and is significant only in majority Republican-voting counties. Our analyses do not provide a precise estimate of the interaction effect between race and gender. Based on the buyer characteristics considered, the most vulnerable group of women (minorities), accounting for 4.7% (8.5%) of car buyers, pay 7.6% (27.9%) more compared with men (nonminorities). The findings inform policymakers and consumers of the gender and racial gaps in auto financing, their underlying mechanisms, and situations most susceptible to unfair lending.

Tushnet’s thoughtful commentary centers around the scope of legal protection that UGC platforms enjoy, and whether the situation examined in Wlömert et al. qualifies as a “legal safe harbor.” In our rejoinder, we clarify the study’s relevance for questions concerning platform regulation, highlight the implications of these regulatory aspects for platforms’ strong bargaining power, as reflected in comparatively low payouts to rightsholders, and discuss how the sampling versus cannibalization effects that we study impact market outcomes for different stakeholders under these market conditions.

  abstract     = {This useful article about the effects of music on YouTube on consumption of the same music elsewhere should be understood for what it is: An empirical investigation of YouTube’s effects. It allows no conclusions about “safe harbors” both because YouTube was not relying on the safe harbor regime either before or after the relevant policy change and because, as YouTube’s lack of reliance shows, the safe harbor regime primarily protects thousands of websites that don’t behave like YouTube. Under the European Union’s new Article 17, sites like YouTube are now required to negotiate with copyright owners to license works uploaded by users who do not own the copyright thereto. YouTube, however, was already doing this. The article [ Wlömert N, Papies D, Clement M, Spann M (2023) Frontiers: The interplay of user-generated content, content industry revenues, and platform regulation: Quasi-experimental evidence from YouTube. Marketing Sci . 43(1):1–12] has implications for what music companies should ask for in these negotiations. However, it would be a mistake to generalize from YouTube to the Internet as a whole.

  abstract     = {An ongoing debate among firms, rightsholders, particularly in the music industry, and policymakers in the United States and the European Union concerns potential changes to the regulation of user-generated content (UGC) video streaming platforms (e.g., YouTube). Currently, safe harbor provisions protect platforms from liability for copyright-infringing content uploaded by users, and requirements for compensating rightsholders for UGC are weak, resulting in comparatively low payouts. At the same time, it is unclear how a change in these regulations would affect consumer demand for this content on other platforms with higher payouts (e.g., Spotify), that is, whether UGC platforms stimulate or displace demand on other platforms. We study a quasi-experiment that occurred when numerous songs became available as UGC on YouTube after an agreement between YouTube and the German royalty collecting society. Our analysis of an unprecedented data set covering 600,000 songs by 38,000 artists reveals an intriguing finding: Although UGC availability stimulates demand in other streaming channels for most songs, cannibalization occurs for recent releases and hit releases, turning the overall revenue effect negative. We discuss how policymakers can use these findings to understand the implications of changes in regulation, and how labels and artists can decide which content to block or allow on UGC platforms.
