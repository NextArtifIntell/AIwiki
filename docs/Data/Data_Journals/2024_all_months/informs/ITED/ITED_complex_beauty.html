The case provides an opportunity to explore the qualitative and quantitative aspects of three-dimensional (3D) printing versus traditional manufacturing, specifically in terms of operational cost. Furthermore, this case facilitates discussions on the potential impact of 3D printing on supply chains. It is suitable for use in graduate and undergraduate courses, as it introduces key concepts such as manufacturing and inventory policies, queueing theory, and life cycle analysis. Ultimately, the case is designed to promote a deeper understanding of the challenges and opportunities that manufacturers face in today’s rapidly evolving technological landscape.

We then discuss using LoR for classifications while adjusting its decision boundary (DB), demonstrating how to convert assigned likelihoods into classification using the DB; impact classification outcome by varying DBs; designate predictions as true positive, true negative, false positive, or false negative; and determine the classification accuracy. We use a variety of performance measures, including sensitivity, specificity, precision, negative predictive value, F 1 and F 2 scores, the receiver operating characteristics curve, and lift/decile charts. These measures are dynamically adjusted when the DB changes. We also reiterate the usage of these measures in the context of crossvalidation and imbalanced data sets. We provide a case study that implements LoR and an option for teaching the details behind MLE. We discuss the pedagogical aspects of this spreadsheet based on a survey of the 2022 student cohort in the Master of Management Analytics Program at the Rotman School of Management.},

In this paper, we describe the adaptation of an operations management undergraduate core module, taught to first-year students, from face-to-face delivery to emergency online delivery. In our online version, we used a mix of traditional and flipped classroom techniques. We adopted a “live” online lecture, where students were encouraged to interact with their instructors and ask questions, and flipped live online tutorials, where students and instructors discussed case studies. In addition, we used a web-based simulation game as a learning and assessment tool. After the simulation game was complete, we assessed our students using a reflective group presentation regarding the decisions they made throughout the game. Based on student feedback, the curriculum design and the module adaptations that we adopted for its emergency online delivery can be considered successful. In particular, students were satisfied with the module quality and structure. Following our experience from adapting our face-to-face module for emergency online delivery, we provide a framework for switching to emergency online teaching along with some useful insights and recommendations to operations management educators.},

In this case article, we update that case in three specific areas. First, we explore using the relatively new MS Excel Geography Data Type that, in theory at least, eliminates the need to use the zip code database by accessing required information about each zip code directly from the web. Second, we show how to apply the MS Excel Maps feature to this data. Third, although the original article uses approximate straight-line distances, we show how to extract driving distances between two zip codes using public maps and an application programming interface with MS Excel’s =WEBSERVICE() function. Two of these updates are not as straightforward as one might hope: The Geography Data Type returns a significant number of errors and, although driving distances can be determined, there is no “easy” way to do so yet. We discuss these issues in the case teaching note.

By increasing the number of overtaking customers, one at a time, the simulation model is extended to the “multiovertaking” case. These simplifying assumptions make such spreadsheet simulations (of more complex queuing networks) accessible to students, and so the paper includes teaching and learning strategies for the classroom.

The scenario focuses on an individual investor who is purchasing LEGO sets from retailers with the goal of selling them for a higher price on the aftermarket in a few years once they retire from shelves. Students must create visualizations to generate insights from the data and develop a regression model to identify sets that represent value investment opportunities. In the extension case they must take their estimated values and optimize the decisions of which sets to purchase to meet the decision maker’s investment goals using an integer program. Students also have the opportunity to develop soft skills in problem solving and communicating results and dealing with missing data points in a data set that is larger than standard textbook data sets but is still a manageable size for introductory students.

To solve a learning assignment, students virtually immerse themselves in the factory using the app on their smartphones with virtual reality headsets, tablets, or computers. The authors developed the SVVR app together with an industrial partner, implemented it in a graduate-level course on production and operations management, and evaluated it by drawing on app user data, assignment grade scores, and an evaluation survey. The results show that students reported an overall positive learning experience and that students who engaged more in the SVVR app performed better on the assignment. This paper contributes to the literature on SVVR with evidence of the learning effects of SVVR in an operations management curriculum.

  abstract     = {Scholarly interests in developing personalized learning analytics dashboards (LADs) in universities have been increasing. LADs are data visualization tools for both teachers and learners that allow them to support student success and improve teaching and learning. In most LADs, however, a teacher-centric, institutional view drives their designs, treating students only as passive end-users, which results in LADs being less useful to students. To address this limitation, we used a card-sorting technique and asked 42 students at a university in Northern Ireland to construct dashboards that reflect their priorities. Using a situated theory of learning as a lens and with the help of multiple qualitative methods, we collected data on what constitutes useful dashboards. Findings suggest that situated learning data sets, such as information on how students learn by talking and listening to others in their communities, need to be integrated into LADs. Students preferred to see the inclusion of qualitative narratives, self-directed learning data and financial information (money spent versus resources utilized) in LADs. As well as raising new questions on how such LADs could be designed, this study challenges institutional overreliance on measurable digital footprints as proxies for academic success. We call for recognizing the wider social learning that happens in landscapes of practice so that LADs become more useful to students.},

  abstract     = {The COVID-19 pandemic has forced the rapid adoption of remote teaching modalities including “hyflex” where students attend some class sessions in person and some online. Managing the hyflex course requires faculty to quickly generate several reports and to update these reports rapidly when the authorities adjust the rules, students add/drop, or the number of course sessions is changed. The creation of these reports is tedious and error-prone, so they need to be automated. However, the nature of the task precludes traditional Excel programming approaches. We use Excel’s new “dynamic array” capabilities (which are available only in Excel 365) to automate the creation and updating of the reports needed to manage the hyflex course. We show how to program the reports, and we discuss the importance of taking an iterative approach to creating effective, error-free cell formulas. To help the reader acquire genuine access to the dynamic array functions, we provide a practical tutorial on the principles and new concepts of dynamic arrays, explain how they relate to legacy array functions, and present selected dynamic array functions including SEQUENCE, FILTER, and XLOOKUP.},

  abstract     = {Because of the limitations on problem size with the built-in optimization solver in Microsoft Excel, other software applications are required to illustrate the power of integer linear programming in spreadsheets. The built-in linear optimization solver in LibreOffice Calc allows much larger problems. In this paper, we build a spreadsheet in LibreOffice Calc to solve sudoku problems and a simple generalization that further illustrates the power of integer linear programming in spreadsheets. The generalization we consider, n-doku, also introduces an interesting puzzle that includes, as a special case, a union of multiple sudoku puzzles. Besides further demonstrating the power of integer linear programming in spreadsheets, we use the n-doku solutions to develop optimization intuition and to, more generally, foster critical thinking. We use this spreadsheet in the classroom to transition from continuous to categorical decisions, emphasizing the idea of one-hot encoding. We also illustrate multiple optima and add preferences to sudoku puzzles as a way introduce multiobjective optimization.

  abstract     = {This paper describes the blockchain-enabled token trading game for supply chain management, a web-based supply chain simulation. The game uses blockchain technology’s concepts to create virtual markets for supplier capacity trading among retailers, in which participants take on the role of a retailer, have different valuations for products, and submit an order before knowing their demand; after demand realization, participants trade tokens (claims on the supplier’s capacity) among themselves using virtual markets to maximize their profits. The game provides participants with firsthand experience with how blockchain technology can be used in practice, thus serving as an interactive pedagogical tool. More generally, the game is intended to help supply chain management and blockchain technology students and executives understand the challenges of serving uncertain customer demand and the role of virtual markets in providing an effective remedy for reconciling supply and demand, thus improving supply chain performance.

  abstract     = {Motivated by the problem of lineup optimization in wheelchair rugby (WCR), this case study covers descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics. The case is presented from the perspective of a new assistant coach of Canada’s national WCR team, who has been tasked by the head coach to use various analytics techniques to improve their lineups. Whereas the data and actors are fictitious, they are based on real data and discussions with the national team coach and sport scientists. To solve the case, students must conduct data analysis, regression modeling, and optimization modeling. These three steps are tightly linked, as the data analysis is needed to prepare the data for regression, and the regression outputs are used as parameters in the optimization. As such, students build proficiency in developing an end-to-end solution approach for a complex real-world problem. The primary learning objectives for the students are to understand the differences between descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics, to build proficiency in implementing the models using appropriate software, and to identify how these techniques can be applied to solve problems in other sports or other application areas.

  abstract     = {Managers are increasingly being tasked with overseeing data-driven projects that incorporate prescriptive and predictive models. Furthermore, basic knowledge of the data analytics pipeline is a fundamental requirement in many modern organizations. Given the central importance of analytics in today’s business environment, there is a growing demand for educational pedagogies that give students the opportunity to learn the fundamentals while also familiarizing them with how such tools are applied. However, a tension exists between the introduction of real-world problems that students can analyze and extract insight from and the need for prerequisite knowledge of mathematical concepts and programming languages such as Python/R. As a consequence, this paper describes an application-focused course that uses Microsoft Excel and mathematical programming to introduce MBA students with nontechnical backgrounds to tools from both prescriptive and predictive analytics. While students’ gain proficiency in managing data and creating optimization and machine learning models, they are also exposed to broader business concepts. Teaching evaluations indicate that the course has helped students further develop their practical skills in Microsoft Excel, gain an appreciation of the real-world impact of data analytics, and has introduced them to a discipline they originally believed was best suited for more technically focused professionals.

  abstract     = {Although some studies have incorporated poetry into engineering courses, no studies exist that explore the use of writing poetry about technical topics to develop creative thinking skills in undergraduate engineering education. This study explores engineering students’ perceptions of incorporating poetry writing within an upper-level discipline-specific engineering course. Two research questions are considered: (RQ1) Do students think that the poetry assignments will be beneficial to their careers? (RQ2) What beneficial gain, if any, do students report from the poetry assignments? Sixty-one students from an industrial and systems engineering course at the University of Florida completed a four-question, open-ended survey. Data were qualitatively coded and analyzed. For RQ1, 63.3% of participants considered the assignment beneficial to their future engineering careers, 13.3% did not see it as beneficial, and 23.3% were uncertain. For RQ2, 11 code categories and four themes emerged; three themes addressed benefits related to professional skills (creative thinking, problem-solving, communication) and one theme suggested the enhancement of technical skills via deepened conceptual knowledge acquisition. Poetry writing on technical topics has the potential to cultivate creative thinking skills in upper-level discipline-specific courses in undergraduate engineering education. Additional research is warranted.

  abstract     = {Industrial-scale models require considerable setup time; hence, once built, they are used in myriad ways to consider closely related cases. In practice, the code for these models frequently evolves without appropriate notational choices, largely as a result of the lengthy development time of, and the number of individuals contributing to, their formulation. This leads to inefficiencies and obfuscates model structures that might be leveraged to expedite solutions. In this paper, we advocate for an emerging literature on model formulation “best practices” and present the reformulation of a widely used industrial-scale linear program. The efficient mathematical expression of this linear program, used to plan capacity expansion in the energy sector, allows for greater transparency of model structures and enhanced ability to identify computational performance improvements, as well as a lucid interpretation of its solutions. This type of formulation is employed in several mathematical programming courses at our university as an example of the advantages of best practices; the model more broadly is used widely to inform policy in the U.S. energy sector.
