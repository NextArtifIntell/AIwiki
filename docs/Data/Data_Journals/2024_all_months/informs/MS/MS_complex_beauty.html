  abstract     = {Since the launch of ChatGPT in December 2022, large language models (LLMs) have been rapidly adopted by businesses to assist users in a wide range of open-ended tasks, including creative work. Although the versatility of LLM has unlocked new ways of human-artificial intelligence collaboration, it remains uncertain how LLMs should be used to enhance business outcomes. To examine the effects of human-LLM collaboration on business outcomes, we conducted an experiment where we tasked expert and nonexpert users to write an ad copy with and without the assistance of LLMs. Here, we investigate and compare two ways of working with LLMs: (1) using LLMs as “ghostwriters,” which assume the main role of the content generation task, and (2) using LLMs as “sounding boards” to provide feedback on human-created content. We measure the quality of the ads using the number of clicks generated by the created ads on major social media platforms. Our results show that different collaboration modalities can result in very different outcomes for different user types. Using LLMs as sounding boards enhances the quality of the resultant ad copies for nonexperts. However, using LLMs as ghostwriters did not provide significant benefits and is, in fact, detrimental to expert users. We rely on textual analyses to understand the mechanisms, and we learned that using LLMs as ghostwriters produces an anchoring effect, which leads to lower-quality ads. On the other hand, using LLMs as sounding boards helped nonexperts achieve ad content with low semantic divergence to content produced by experts, thereby closing the gap between the two types of users.

  abstract     = {Smartphones have enabled the delivery of life-improving information services to base-of-the-pyramid (BOP) consumers. However, little is known about how the poor interact with the digital world. Through a novel app we developed to investigate real-time smartphone usage, we identify an unnoticed barrier to digital information access by the poor—data shortages. By analyzing over 9.4 million minutes of smartphone usage data from 929 residents of a Mumbai settlement, we find that entertainment consumes 61% of their phone time. Our data reveal that under universally adopted monthly data plans, low-income individuals binge on YouTube and social media, resulting in data shortages and information isolation in the late-plan period. We offer a practical operational solution to this problem—shorter data-replenishment cycles—which serve as a commitment device to curb binge usage. We randomly assign participants to a “capped plan”—with daily data usage caps—or a standard (monthly) plan. Assignment to the capped plan increases late-plan access of invites to health camps sent via WhatsApp, increases attendance at these in-person camps by 27%, and reduces social media binge usage. Most participants (particularly those with low self-control and high fear of missing out) prefer the capped plan, even when costlier—clearly signaling demand. Because capped plans are inherently cheaper to provide, offering them could enable providers to increase BOP customer value and expand access. Our results suggest an opportunity to amplify the impact of life-improving services targeted at the poor by leveraging users’ interactions with smartphone technology.

  abstract     = {In recent years, there has been an increasing trend in supply chains to employ a “control tower” approach to improve supply chain performance. One such strategy is customer-managed inventory (CMI) in which the customer (the downstream party) controls the inventory of the supplier (the upstream party). However, the optimal design of the inventory control policy and the required incentive structure for CMI has not been fully explored in the related literature. In this paper, we develop a two-echelon model consisting of a supplier and a customer that captures the interaction between both decision makers. Analysis of this model indicates that achieving the potential benefits of CMI requires suitable incentive mechanisms to be put in place. The two-echelon inventory system model, however, does not give closed-form solutions, which are required to generate an optimal solution to the inventory control and incentive problem. To address this challenge, we propose an approximate model, which decouples the two-echelon model into two newsvendor-type models with each party operating a single-echelon system. This approximate model requires the introduction of additional cost parameters so that the decoupled model captures the cost implications of supplier shortages in the original two-echelon model. By developing appropriate values for these cost parameters, the approximate model yields near optimal results. Analysis of the solution reveals important operational factors that determine which environments are conducive for CMI and conditions for Pareto improvement of all stakeholders.

  abstract     = {We use the spread of COVID-19 in Italy, the first Western country hit by the pandemic, to investigate the role of structured management practices in responding to a large shock. We exploit a survey eliciting expected sales growth for 2020 to set up a difference-in-difference analysis with repeated cross sections, leveraging the fact that the data collection began prior to the pandemic and continued throughout its spread. We find a sizable effect of such practices on firm performance: a one-standard-deviation increase in the management score increases expected sales growth by 2.3%, against an average drop of 8.3%. Results are confirmed with actual sales growth. Firms with more structured practices were more likely to implement a comprehensive set of changes, including a more intense use of remote work.

In this paper, we propose a new method based on kernel ridge regression to exploit the smoothness of the conditional expectation as a function of the multidimensional conditioning variable. Asymptotic analysis shows that the proposed method can effectively alleviate the curse of dimensionality on the convergence rate as the simulation budget increases, provided that the conditional expectation is sufficiently smooth. The smoothness bridges the gap between the cubic root convergence rate (that is, the optimal rate for the standard nested simulation) and the square root convergence rate (that is, the canonical rate for the standard Monte Carlo simulation). We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method via numerical examples from portfolio risk management and input uncertainty quantification.

  abstract     = {Standard models of decision making under risk and uncertainty are deterministic. Inconsistencies in choices are accommodated by separate error models. The combination of decision model and error model, however, is arbitrary. Here, I derive a model of decision making under uncertainty in which choice options are mentally encoded by noisy signals, which are optimally decoded by Bayesian combination with preexisting information. The model predicts diminishing sensitivity toward both likelihoods and rewards, thus providing cognitive microfoundations for the patterns documented in the prospect theory literature. The model is, however, inherently stochastic, so that choices and noise are determined by the same underlying parameters. This results in several novel predictions, which I test on one existing data set and in two new experiments. This paper was accepted by Manel Baucells, behavioral economics and decision analysis.

We study four families of sparse graph designs (namely, clusters, rings, chains, and Erdős–Rényi graphs) and show both theoretically and numerically that their performance is close to the optimal one achieved by a complete graph. Our interest in the stochastic sparse graph design problem is primarily motivated by a collaboration with a leading e-commerce retailer in the context of its middle-mile delivery operations. We test our theoretical results using real data from our industry partner and conclude that adding a little flexibility to the routing network can significantly reduce transportation costs.

  abstract     = {How much can we learn finance directly from text data? This paper presents a new framework for learning textual data based on the factor augmentation model and sparsity regularization, called the factor-augmented regularized model for prediction (FarmPredict), to let machines learn financial returns directly from news. FarmPredict allows the model itself to extract information directly from articles without predefined information, such as dictionaries or pretrained models as in most studies. Using unsupervised learned factors to augment the predictors would benefit our method with a “double-robust” feature: that the machine would learn to balance between individual words or text factors/topics. It also avoids the information loss of factor regression in dimensionality reduction. We apply our model to the Chinese stock market with a large proportion of retail investors by using Chinese news data to predict financial returns. We show that positive sentiments scored by our FarmPredict approach from news generate on average 83 basic points (bps) stock daily excess returns, and negative news has an adverse impact of 26 bps on the days of news announcements, where both effects can last for a few days. This asymmetric effect aligns well with the short-sale constraints in the Chinese equity market. The result shows that the machine-learned prediction does provide sizeable predictive power with an annualized return of 54% at most with a simple investment strategy. Compared with other statistical and machine learning methods, FarmPredict significantly outperforms them on model prediction and portfolio performance. Our study demonstrates the far-reaching potential of using machines to learn text data. This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.

  abstract     = {Do pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) reduce spending on prescription drugs? Reduced-form evidence suggests that PBMs enforce a tradeoff between net-of-rebate prices and access to drugs within each market. However, net-of-rebate prices grow consistently over time and appear unresponsive to competitor entry. We argue that inertia in drug demand can reconcile these facts. To formally analyze the roles played by PBMs and demand inertia, we build a dynamic structural model of drug pricing and estimate it using net-of-rebate prices of three major statins from 1996 to 2013. Counterfactuals suggest that, relative to a market with price-setting by drug manufacturers and patients who face coinsurance, PBMs reduce overall spending by 28%, without greatly limiting patient access. Without demand inertia, the presence of PBMs would cause prices to fall significantly as competitors enter. This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.

  abstract     = {Exploration is often necessary in online learning to maximize long-term rewards, but it comes at the cost of short-term “regret.” We study how this cost of exploration is shared across multiple groups. For example, in a clinical trial setting, patients who are assigned a suboptimal treatment effectively incur the cost of exploration. When patients are associated with natural groups on the basis of, say, race or age, it is natural to ask whether the cost of exploration borne by any single group is “fair.” So motivated, we introduce the “grouped” bandit model. We leverage the theory of axiomatic bargaining, and the Nash bargaining solution in particular, to formalize what might constitute a fair division of the cost of exploration across groups. On one hand, we show that any regret-optimal policy strikingly results in the least fair outcome: such policies will perversely leverage the most “disadvantaged” groups when they can. More constructively, we derive policies that are optimally fair and simultaneously enjoy a small “price of fairness.” We illustrate the relative merits of our algorithmic framework with a case study on contextual bandits for warfarin dosing where we are concerned with the cost of exploration across multiple races and age groups.

  abstract     = {In several applications of the stochastic multiarmed bandit problem, the traditional objective of maximizing the expected total reward can be inappropriate. In this paper, we study a new objective in the classic setup. Given K arms, instead of maximizing the expected total reward from T pulls (the traditional “sum” objective), we consider the vector of total rewards earned from each of the K arms at the end of T pulls and aim to maximize the expected highest total reward across arms (the “max” objective). For this objective, we show that any policy must incur an instance-dependent asymptotic regret of Ω ( log T ) (with a higher instance-dependent constant compared with the traditional objective) and a worst case regret of Ω ( K 1 / 3 T 2 / 3 ) . We then design an adaptive explore-then-commit policy featuring exploration based on appropriately tuned confidence bounds on the mean reward and an adaptive stopping criterion, which adapts to the problem difficulty and simultaneously achieves these bounds (up to logarithmic factors). We then generalize our algorithmic insights to the problem of maximizing the expected value of the average total reward of the top m arms with the highest total rewards. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our policies compared with several natural alternatives in practical parameter regimes. We discuss applications of these new objectives to the problem of conditioning an adequate supply of value-providing market entities (workers/sellers/service providers) in online platforms and marketplaces.

  abstract     = {This study tests the rationality of the decisions to purchase information, the informational efficiency of prices, and the optimality of the resulting allocations in decentralized markets with a series of laboratory experiments. The theory predicts that markets with dispersed information and natural buyers and sellers converge to a fully revealing equilibrium. It is profitable to pay for information, and as such, the Grossman-Stiglitz paradox does not emerge. Statistically significant improvements in both price efficiency and allocative efficiency are documented across trading periods. In contrast to the theory, which predicts that the higher the number of informed agents, the stronger the individual incentives to invest in information, the and the more data present the opposite result. The price of information is higher when there are fewer informed agents. The result can be explained by boundedly rational decision making.

In an effort to alleviate the consequences of fraudulent reviews, platforms have been using machine-learning algorithms for fraudulent review detection. However, the current business practice of simply removing fraudulent reviews might not be sufficient, as even their temporary presence might forge spillover effects propagating through other shopping tools. In particular, we examine and discover the persistence of long-lasting significant adverse impact of fraudulent reviews through their propagation to recommender systems, even long after successfully detecting and removing all fraud incidents. We conduct additional analyses further examining the intensity and evolution of the spillover effect over time across different dimensions, such as the cost of the fraudulent activity, the effectiveness and timeliness of the detection algorithms, and the quality of products. The results illustrate the gravity of the identified effect and highlight that the current business practice of just removing the fraudulent reviews is insufficient in the presence of recommender systems, albeit potentially sufficient in their absence in the long run. Such findings are timely as they might inform current regulatory and policy discussions. Finally, we also design a simple remedy that can be easily introduced to collaborative filtering algorithms to debias the recommender systems and demonstrate its effectiveness in alleviating the impact of the identified spillover effect.

They capture shareholders’ distinct perspectives on compensating top managers: the Individual Model , in which managers in a firm unilaterally shirk, and the Team Model , in which managers choose effort jointly. The Team Model rationalizes observed compensation better than the Individual Model , underlining the importance of managerial coordination and team-based incentives. This paper also offers novel estimates of agency friction in a team production setting. Risk premium explains a large portion of the pay differential across and within firms. Firm value would have dropped between 4% and 15% if managers shirked. Additional counterfactual estimation suggests that shareholders could reduce the total compensation by up to $17 million if they were to switch from the individual perspective to the team perspective.

  abstract     = {Using a real-effort experiment, we show that people project their current tastes onto others when forecasting others’ behavior, even when their tastes are exogenously manipulated and transparently different. In the first part of our experiment, “workers” stated their willingness to continue working on a tedious task. We varied how many initial tasks workers completed before eliciting their willingness to work (WTW); some were relatively fresh when stating their WTW, whereas others were relatively tired. Later, a separate group of “predictors”—who also worked on the task—guessed the WTW of workers in each state. We find: (i) tired workers were less willing to work than fresh workers; (ii) predictors (in aggregate) accurately guessed the WTW of workers when they were in the same state as the workers about whom they were predicting; but (iii) when fresh predictors were guessing about tired workers, they substantially overestimated their WTW; and (iv) when tired predictors were guessing about fresh workers, they underestimated their WTW. Using an additional treatment, we find that workers also mispredicted their own future WTW, and we compare the magnitudes of intrapersonal and interpersonal projection bias.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we examine the usefulness of time commitment as a voting resource for decentralized governance when the identity of voters cannot be verified. In order to do so, we take a closer look at two issues that confront token-based voting systems used by blockchain communities and organizations: voter fraud through the creation of multiple identities (Sybil attack) and concentration of voting power in the hands of the wealthy (plutocracy). Our contribution is threefold: first, we lay analytical foundations for the formal modeling of the necessary and sufficient conditions for a voting system to be resistant to a Sybil attack; second, we show that tokens as the only instrument for weighting votes cannot simultaneously achieve resistance to both Sybil attacks and a plutocracy in the voting process; and third, we design a voting mechanism, bond voting, that is Sybil resistant and offers a second instrument (time commitment) that is effective for countering plutocracy when large token holders also have a relatively high opportunity cost of locking tokens for a vote.

  abstract     = {Do consumers search the brands they know more or less frequently than the brands with which they are unfamiliar? In this paper, we attempt to answer this question using data from an experiment with two novel features: (i) survey information on consumers’ prior brand ownership, familiarity with each brand, and prior experience using different product features and (ii) eye-tracking data capturing search behavior at a very granular level. We find that consumers are generally more likely to search and buy brands they own and with which they are familiar, highlighting the importance of accounting for prior information. For this reason, we develop a search model in which both the information obtained during the search process and the information possessed by consumers prior to search are allowed to influence search and purchase decisions. Our model contributes to prior work by modeling search at the brand and attribute levels within a Bayesian learning framework. Using this model, we then quantify the impact of prior information on consumer choices as well as document the estimation bias arising when prior information is absent from the model. Finally, through a series of counterfactuals, we explore the managerial value of prior information data. This paper was accepted by Matt Shum, marketing. Funding: Q.

  abstract     = {The success of digital content platforms, such as YouTube, relies on both the creativity of independent content creators and the efficiency of content distribution. By sharing advertising revenue with content creators, these platforms can motivate creators to exert greater effort. Most platforms use recommendation systems to deliver personalized content recommendations to each consumer. As creators’ revenues are contingent on their demand, the demand allocation criteria inherent in the recommendation system can influence their content creation behavior. In this paper, we investigate the influence of a platform’s recommendation system on revenue-sharing plans, content creation, profits, and welfare. Our results show that a platform could benefit by biasing recommendations, that is, recommending content that is not an ideal match to a consumer’s preference, to incentivize creators to produce better-quality content. We refer to this as a biased recommendation strategy. Interestingly, we find that such a biased recommendation strategy may lead to a win-win in which the platform, consumers, and content creators can benefit. Our study also shows that consumers may be worse off when they are more knowledgeable and less dependent on the recommendation system. In addition, the platform, consumers, and creators can benefit when the platform has more accurate information on consumer preferences. This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.

  abstract     = {Workers in knowledge-intensive industries often complain of having too many meetings, but organizations still give little thought to deciding when or how often to meet. We investigate the efficiency and robustness of various coordination scheduling rules. We consider workers who are engaged in a common activity (e.g., software programming) that can be divided into largely independent, parallel production tasks, but that necessitates periodic coordination. Coordination enables workers to address issues they have encountered in their independent work but takes time away from production. Using a stylized game-theoretic model, we show that small teams allow a more fluid, that is, worker-driven, approach to scheduling coordination, such as preemptive coordination (or production), under which any worker can impose coordination (or production). In larger teams this becomes inefficient. Several approaches can mitigate this effect. One option is to allocate the decision rights to produce or coordinate to the most productive worker. A more general version is to implement a voting-based scheme, where a minimum number of workers from a predetermined subset choose to coordinate. A third approach is to modify the preemptive coordination and production rules by adding time-based controls, to reserve some minimal amount of productive time or to enforce coordination after some point. Finally, a fixed-interval meeting schedule works well for very large teams. Our research helps formalize the tension between meeting (coordinating) and producing and indicates how to adapt team coordination scheduling rules to the degree of worker heterogeneity and team size.

  abstract     = {We consider a stochastic lost-sales inventory control system with lead time L over a planning horizon T . Supply is uncertain, and it is a function of the order quantity (because of random yield/capacity, etc.). We aim to minimize the T -period cost, a problem that is known to be computationally intractable even under known distributions of demand and supply. In this paper, we assume that both the demand and supply distributions are unknown and develop a computationally efficient online learning algorithm. We show that our algorithm achieves a regret (i.e., the performance gap between the cost of our algorithm and that of an optimal policy over T periods) of O ˜ ( L + T ) when L ≥ Ω ( log T ) . We do so by (1) showing that our algorithm’s cost is higher by at most O ˜ ( L + T ) for any L ≥ 0 compared with an optimal constant-order policy under complete information (a widely used algorithm) and (2) leveraging the latter’s known performance guarantee from the existing literature. To the best of our knowledge, a finite sample O ˜ ( T ) (and polynomial in L ) regret bound when benchmarked against an optimal policy is not known before in the online inventory control literature. A key challenge in this learning problem is that both demand and supply data can be censored; hence, only truncated values are observable. We circumvent this challenge by showing that the data generated under an order quantity q 2 allow us to simulate the performance of not only q 2 but also, q 1 for all q 1 &lt; q 2 , a key observation to obtain sufficient information even under data censoring. By establishing a high-probability coupling argument, we are able to evaluate and compare the performance of different order policies at their steady state within a finite time horizon. Because the problem lacks convexity, commonly used learning algorithms, such as stochastic gradient decent and bisection, cannot be applied, and instead, we develop an active elimination method that adaptively rules out suboptimal solutions.

  abstract     = {Project leaders are responsible for planning, controlling, and revising projects. As a project unfolds, the leader evaluates the project’s progress by comparing ongoing costs and scope to a baseline plan and considers potential revisions. We offer a general model of managerial mental accounting, which includes loss aversion, reference point updating, and narrow framing, and examine how it impacts downstream decisions. Our model predicts insufficient adjustments of project scope and cost at revision, resulting in reduced financial profit. We show that the choice of measure to quantify the project progress—planned, actual, or earned—affects the updating of reference points, and hence the downstream decisions. Thus, progress measures could be wisely employed to mitigate insufficient adjustments. It turns out that measuring progress via planned scope is often advantageous, whereas utilizing earned value for cost is never advisable.

  abstract     = {This paper tests the efficiency of a set of sports betting markets using detailed betting line movement from opening until closing for four different sportsbooks for each of 3,681 Major League Baseball games. The reliability of the markets’ forecasts are assessed at several lead times. The forecasts are mostly reliable, but there are simple betting strategies that would have yielded significant profit. In addition, forecasts do not always improve monotonically as the games get closer, despite more information being available; forecasts at weekend day games’ start times are significantly worse than forecasts 90 minutes earlier. Furthermore, analysis of the sequences of forecasts within individual games reveals that these betting markets do not incorporate information optimally. There is sufficient evidence to reject weak form market efficiency; specifically, betting lines tend to overreact, exhibiting significant negatively autocorrelated changes that could be exploited by sophisticated bettors.

  abstract     = {We provide firm-level evidence on the real effects of shadow banking in terms of technological innovation. Firm-to-firm entrusted loans, the largest part of the shadow banking sector in China, enhance the borrowers’ innovation output. The effects are more prominent when the borrowers are subject to severer financial constraints, information asymmetry, and takeover exposures. A plausible underlying channel is capital reallocations from less productive but easily financed lender firms to more innovative but financially less privileged borrower firms. Our paper suggests that shadow banking helps correct bank credit misallocations and thus, serves as a second-best market design in financing the real economy.

  abstract     = {People often need to predict the outcomes of future events. We investigate the influence of order on such forecasts. Six preregistered studies ( n = 7,955) show that people are more likely to forecast improbable outcomes (e.g., that an “underdog” will win a game) for predictions they make later versus earlier within a sequence of multiple predictions. This effect generalizes across several contexts and persists when participants are able to revise their predictions as well as when they are incentivized to make correct predictions. We propose that this effect is driven by people’s assumption that improbable outcomes are bound to occur at some point within small sets of independent events (i.e., “belief in the law of small numbers”). Accordingly, we find that the effect is attenuated when the statistical independence of events is made salient to forecasters both through the nature of the predictions themselves (i.e., when the events are from distinct domains) and through directly informing them about statistical independence. These findings have notable practical implications, as policy makers and businesses have the ability to control the order in which people evaluate and predict future events.

  abstract     = {AT&amp;T was the largest U.S. firm for most of the 20th century. Telephone operators once comprised more than 50% of its workforce, but in the late 1910s, it initiated a decades-long process of automating telephone operation with mechanical call switching—a technology invented in the 1880s. We study what drove AT&amp;T to do so and why it took nearly a century. Interdependencies between call switching and nearly every other activity in AT&amp;T’s business presented obstacles to change: Telephone operators were the fulcrum of a complex production system that had developed around them, and automation only began after the firm and new technology were adapted to work together. Even then, automatic switching was only profitable in larger markets—hence, diffusion expanded when the technology improved or service areas grew. The example suggests even narrowly defined tasks can be difficult to automate if they interact with many others. This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.

  abstract     = {We are witnessing an increasing use of data-driven predictive models to inform decisions in high-stakes situations, from lending and hiring to university admissions. As decisions have implications for individuals and society, there is increasing pressure on decision makers to be transparent about their decision policies. At the same time, individuals may use knowledge, gained by transparency, to invest effort strategically in order to maximize their chances of receiving a beneficial decision. Our goal is to find decision policies that are optimal in terms of utility in such a strategic setting. First, we characterize how strategic investment of effort by individuals leads to a change in the feature distribution. Using this characterization, we show that, in general, optimal decision policies are hard to find in polynomial time, and there are cases in which deterministic policies are suboptimal. Then, we demonstrate that, if the cost individuals pay to change their features satisfies a natural monotonicity assumption, we can narrow down the search for the optimal policy to a particular family of decision policies with a set of desirable properties, which allow for a highly effective polynomial time-heuristic search algorithm using dynamic programming. Finally, under no assumptions on the cost, we develop an iterative search algorithm that is guaranteed to converge to locally optimal decision policies. Experiments on synthetic and real credit card data illustrate our theoretical findings and show that the decision policies found by our algorithms achieve higher utility than those that do not account for strategic behavior.

The differences in denial rates are disproportionately high compared with private-market lending and government-insured risk-sensitive loan pricing programs.

  abstract     = {Output fluctuations in nontraded sectors are an important country-specific risk factor because nontraded outputs are only consumed domestically. In interest rate markets, countries with higher nontraded output growth risks are associated with stronger motives for precautionary savings and lower interest rates. In currency markets, strategies with higher exposures to nontraded output growth risks offer higher average excess returns. Economic sizes play an important role in exacerbating the pricing impact of nontraded output growth risks as it requires larger international trades to mitigate nontraded output risks of larger economies. However, because economic sizes are functions of outputs in equilibrium, output growth risks also explain this role of economic sizes in international asset pricing.

  abstract     = {Audit committee (AC) responsibilities have increased over time, prompting concerns that overloading the AC with too many duties may impair the AC’s ability to oversee financial reporting. Using new AC charter-based proxies to measure AC responsibilities, we find that an emphasis on the AC overseeing financial risk management (which is a noncore AC duty) is associated with worse financial reporting quality, as proxied by restatements—consistent with the argument of AC overload by distraction. This overload effect is attenuated when an AC has more directors to share duties or when the AC retains an expert auditor who can serve as a substitute for AC oversight. This overload effect is accentuated when AC members are busy with multiple board appointments or when the external auditor is busy with other audits. We also find that AC financial risk oversight is associated with more AC meetings and greater turnover of AC directors, consistent with the notion of overload. In sharp contrast, we find that greater AC oversight over internal controls (which is a core AC duty) is associated with improved financial reporting quality. Overall, we document that the nature of AC duties impacts the AC’s ability to promote financial reporting quality and that noncore duties may overload ACs.

Firms covered by China’s Strategic Emerging Industries policies became less decoupled with the United States, gained cash flows, and gained valuation, but they saw no improvement in either innovation output/quality or productivity.

Specifically, we examine the extent to which firms issue Forms 8-K, press releases, and management forecasts following unexpected changes to the target federal funds rate. We find consistent evidence that unexpected decreases (increases) in the Federal Open Market Committee target rate lead to larger increases (decreases) in disclosure by firms that are more sensitive to monetary policy shocks. Furthermore, the disclosure response to target rate surprises is concentrated in Form 8-K items that require a materiality-based decision and hold when we examine a sample of M&amp;A-participating firms. Extended tests show that our results are not attributable to changes in the cost of capital leading to increased disclosure because firms are simultaneously raising capital or hyping their stock. Overall, our results are consistent with arguments raised in recent research papers that changes in cost of capital influence firms’ materiality thresholds, which can affect their decision to disclose.

  abstract     = {Working at home benefits entrepreneurs by lowering fixed costs and allowing them to engage in joint market and household production. We evaluate a large-scale reform in Singapore, the Home Office Scheme, that allowed business creation at one’s residential property and study whether home-based entrepreneurship spurs entrepreneurial activities. The difference-in-differences estimate shows that the reform led to a significantly higher level of business creation and the firms newly created in response to the reform had a higher survival rate. The effect is more pronounced for low-income female individuals and industries with high start-up capital, implying that financial constraints and nonpecuniary benefits likely drive the effect. The reform also encourages entrepreneurs to become serial entrepreneurs, and they open a larger business with a similar survival rate for their second firm. Overall, our findings suggest that the program effectively attracted more entry into self-employment without significantly lowering the average quality of the pool.

DBB constrains the dispersion among all possible distributions in an economy, consistent with observed prices and subject to a good-deal bound. In model-based economies, DBB effectively tracks belief heterogeneity and serves as a diagnostic tool for evaluating model calibrations. Empirically, DBB relates to common proxies of belief dispersion, offering a real-time, market-implied disagreement measure.

  abstract     = {We study the impact of firm-specific business disruptions on the performance of small emerging market firms and test the effectiveness of building in redundancies to buffer against disruptions. Managerial disruptions result in the absence of the entrepreneur-owner, whereas operational disruptions lead to a shortage of critical resources, for example, inventory or electricity. We propose the use of relational redundancy—that is, the availability of a trusted and capable person with whom the entrepreneur-owner has an existing relationship, who can manage the business in his or her absence—to recover from managerial disruptions. We also examine whether resource redundancy—for example, maintaining safety stock or electricity backup—helps recover from operational disruptions. In the absence of publicly available data, we hand-built a panel data set by interviewing 646 randomly selected small firms over four time periods in Kampala, Uganda. We find that disruptions are highly prevalent and have a statistically and economically significant effect on firm performance. When a firm faces multiple exogenous and severe disruptions in a six-month period, its monthly sales decrease by 13.8% ( p = 0.013), and its sales growth decreases by 18.8 percentage points ( p = 0.070). Importantly, we find that both managerial and resource redundancies can help firms build resilience against the negative impact of disruptions. In some cases, firms with high levels of redundancy are able to completely overcome the negative effect of disruptions on sales and sales growth. We discuss implications for entrepreneurs, policymakers, and large multinationals that buy from or sell to small emerging market firms.

  abstract     = {We examine the influence of physical proximity on between-start-up knowledge spillovers at one of the largest technology coworking hubs in the United States. Relying on the exogenous assignment of office space to the hub’s 251 start-ups, we find that proximity positively influences knowledge spillovers as proxied by the likelihood of adopting an upstream web technology already used by a peer start-up. This effect is largest for start-ups within close proximity of each other and quickly decays; start-ups more than 20 meters apart on the same floor are indistinguishable from start-ups on different floors. The main driver of the effect appears to be social interactions. Although start-ups in close proximity are most likely to participate in social coworking space events together, knowledge spillovers are greatest between start-ups that socialize but are dissimilar. Ultimately, start-ups that are embedded in environments that have neither too much nor too little diversity perform better but only if they socialize.

  abstract     = {Revealed preferences between alternatives can be systematically reversed across a variety of elicitation procedures (e.g., choice, valuation, matching, joint/separate evaluation). These puzzling findings have been usually invoked to challenge the procedure invariance principle. Yet procedure-dependent preferences can be endogenous. This paper presents a unifying theory of contextual deliberation to account for seemingly disparate phenomena of preference reversals. When attribute importance is ex ante imperfectly known, people can engage in costly information retrieval/acquisition activities (i.e., deliberation) prior to making decisions. Elicitation procedures can influence revealed preferences through affecting the incentive for deliberation. Therefore, contextual deliberation can endogenously yield procedure-dependent preference reversals, offer a common microfoundation for extant psychological accounts (e.g., the prominence hypothesis, the evaluability hypothesis), and coherently organize apparently unrelated/inconsistent findings in the literature. We also run five experiments and document new findings that are inconsistent with extant hypotheses but can be reconciled by contextual deliberation.

  abstract     = {Political influence on bank credit allocation is often viewed as being necessary to address social problems like income inequality. We hypothesize that such influence elicits bank capital responses. Our hypothesis yields three testable predictions for which we find supporting evidence. First, when banks observe election outcomes that suggest greater impending political credit-allocation influence, they reduce capital to increase fragility and deter political influence. Second, banks subject to greater political influence nonetheless increase lending that politicians favor, and household consumption consequently increases. Third, these banks exhibit poorer post-lending performance. Our study has implications for the interaction between politics, household consumption, and bank risk through a specific channel—the interplay between credit-allocation regulation and bank capital structure.

We show theoretically that takeover protections increase equity risk, stock returns, and bond yields by removing a valuable put option to sell the firm, notably for firms approaching distress. We investigate these claims empirically and find that distressed firms experience a significant decrease in value and increase in returns and market betas after the passage of antitakeover laws, in line with our predictions. At issue bond yields are also higher when an antitakeover law is in effect. Consistent with the model, the effects of antitakeover laws on stock returns, respectively, bond yields, are greater when shareholders, respectively, bondholders, have greater bargaining power.

  abstract     = {We show that macroprudential policies dampen the impact of global financial conditions on local bank credit cycles. For identification, we exploit variation in the U.S. volatility index (VIX) and household and business credit registers in an emerging market economy in which banks depend on foreign funding and macroprudential measures vary over the full cycle. Our results suggest that when the VIX is low, tighter macroprudential policies reduce household lending, notably for riskier (foreign currency (FX) and high debt-service-to-income) loans and by banks dependent on foreign funding. Moreover, they increase (less regulated) local currency lending to real estate firms. Such periods are associated with less subsequent total lending to households and firms and with a lower share of FX loans at the local level. Consistently, when the VIX is low, tighter macroprudential policies dampen house prices and economic activity. This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance. Funding: M.

The well-documented positive relation between borrowing and hedging is largely attributable in our sample to binding covenants, as the relation is much weaker in their absence.

  abstract     = {Retailers often employ professionals known as retail buyers to determine the right quantities of products to order. However, in many economies and industries, a manufacturer may seek to unduly influence the buyer through various means. One such means is to offer the buyer kickbacks (incl. entertainment, travel, gifts) in return for a large order. Despite prominent examples of retailers taking initiatives against kickbacks, the practice persists in many economies and industries. To aid initiatives combating kickbacks, one needs to do the right diagnosis and identify the root cause. To this end, in this paper, we introduce the retail buyer as a distinct player in the retail channel and study the implications of the tug-of-war between the retailer and the manufacturer to influence the buyer. Interestingly, we find when kickbacks are feasible, the manufacturer need not always benefit, and the retailer need not always be the victim. We show a well-designed buyer compensation plan is key for the retailer to avoid kickbacks from distorting the buyer’s demand assessments. Moreover, when the reputational harm from kickbacks is not too high, the retailer may be the one tacitly facilitating kickbacks by undercompensating the buyer and influencing her demand assessments such that it can leverage kickbacks for shifting some of its buyer compensation cost to the manufacturer. This sharing of cost may allow for better channel coordination. Furthermore, this cost-shifting mechanism of kickbacks we have identified in this paper can explain their persistence. No retailer tolerates kickbacks when the reputational harm is high. This paper was accepted by Eric Anderson, marketing.

  abstract     = {Using microdata from the American Red Cross (ARC) and the Federal Election Commission (FEC) in two natural experiments, we provide evidence that political giving and charitable giving are substitutes. In the first natural experiment, we estimate the effects of a positive shock to charitable donations to the ARC: foreign natural disaster events. We find that although charitable donations to ARC increase by 34.9% in the six weeks following a disaster, political donations decline by 18.8% in the same period. Put differently, each 1% increase in the charitable giving to ARC is accompanied by a 0.53% drop in political donations. At the average county-week–level donations, the implied effect of a $1 increase in charitable giving is a $0.42 decline in political donations. In the second natural experiment, we estimate the effects of a positive shock to political giving: advertisements for political campaigns. Exploiting geographic discontinuities in advertising markets, we find that political advertisements increase political giving, whereas they decrease charitable donations to ARC. Our estimates imply that each 1% increase in the political giving is accompanied by a 0.59% drop in charitable donations to ARC. At the average county-week–level donations, the implied effect of a $1 increase in political giving is a $0.33 decline in charitable donations. The crowding-out elasticities suggest that political giving and charitable giving are relatively close substitutes. We provide a number of robustness checks, and we discuss potential causal mechanisms. This paper was accepted by Eric Anderson, marketing. Funding: P.

  abstract     = {Data brokers use black-box methods to profile and segment individuals for ad targeting, often with mixed success. We present evidence from 5 complementary field tests and 15 data brokers that differences in profiling accuracy and coverage for these attributes mainly depend on who is being profiled. Consumers who are better off—for example, those with higher incomes or living in affluent areas—are both more likely to be profiled and more likely to be profiled accurately. Occupational status (white-collar versus blue-collar jobs), race and ethnicity, gender, and household arrangements often affect the accuracy and likelihood of having profile information available, although this varies by country and whether we consider online or offline coverage of profile attributes. Our analyses suggest that successful consumer-background profiling can be linked to the scope of an individual’s digital footprint from how much time they spend online and the number of digital devices they own. Those who come from lower-income backgrounds have a narrower digital footprint, leading to a “data desert” for such individuals. Vendor characteristics, including differences in profiling methods, explain virtually none of the variation in profiling accuracy for our data, but explain variation in the likelihood of who is profiled. Vendor differences due to unique networks and partnerships also affect profiling outcomes indirectly due to differential access to individuals with different backgrounds. We discuss the implications of our findings for policy and marketing practice. This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, marketing.

  abstract     = {Invoking a property rights approach, we examine how competition between advertising exchanges influences the targeting options that these exchanges make available to advertisers. When advertisers have strong property rights over data regarding consumers’ active purchase interests, competition between ad exchanges leads to too little sharing of data. This may harm consumers, who receive too few pertinent ads, and advertisers themselves can also be harmed due to a situation resembling a prisoner’s dilemma. We find that reallocating property rights to consumers, that is, giving them the right to opt out of tracking may also benefit consumers who allow tracking by altering the incentives of ad exchanges to offer improved targeting options. In addition, we show that initiatives by Apple and Google to limit third-party tracking and to introduce alternative tracking systems such as Google’s Topics might benefit consumers by weakening the data property rights of advertisers. Because more data are shared by default under such systems, this can be true even if these systems are less accurate than third-party tracking systems.

  abstract     = {We investigate the participation and effectiveness of paid endorsers in sponsored tweet campaigns. We manipulate the financial pay rate offered to endorsers on a Chinese paid endorsement platform, where payouts are contingent on participation rather than engagement outcomes. Hence, our design can distinguish between variation in participation and variation in outcomes, even if people select to endorse only specific tweets. Also, the lack of compensation for effort allows one to attribute differences in outcomes to precontractual selection rather than postcontractual behavior. The main finding is that endorsers exhibited adverse selection. Several observed and unobserved endorser characteristics associated with a higher propensity to participate had a negative association with being an effective endorser given participation. This adverse selection results in a conundrum when trying to recruit a sizable number of high-quality endorsers. Only 9.5%–11.8% of the endorsers were above the median in both the propensity to participate and the propensity to be effective compared to a benchmark of 25% in the absence of any association. A simulation analysis of various targeting approaches that leverages our data of actual endorsements and outcomes shows that targeting candidate endorsers by scoring and ranking them using models taking into account adverse selection on observables improves campaign outcomes by 13%–55% compared to models ignoring adverse selection.

  abstract     = {Continuity of care, defined as an ongoing therapeutic relationship between a patient and a physician, is a defining characteristic of primary care. However, arranging a consultation with one’s regular doctor is increasingly difficult as practices face physician shortages. We study the effect of declining care continuity on the productivity of physicians by analyzing data of over 10 million consultations in 381 English primary care practices over a period of 11 years. Specifically, we examine whether a consultation with the patient’s regular doctor is more productive than with another doctor in the practice. Using statistical models that account for confounding and selection bias and restricting the sample to consultations with patients who had at least three consultations over the past two years, we find that the time to a patient’s next visit is on average 18.1% (95% confidence interval: 16.9%, 19.2%) longer when the patient sees the doctor they have seen most frequently over the past two years, while there is no operationally meaningful difference in consultation duration. The data show that the productivity benefit of care continuity is larger for older patients, patients with multiple chronic conditions, and patients with mental health conditions. We estimate that the total consultation demand in our sample could have fallen by up to 5.2% had all practices offered continuity of care at the level of the top decile of practices while prioritizing patients expected to yield the largest productivity benefits. We discuss operational and strategic implications of these findings for primary care practices and for third-party payers. This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, healthcare management.

  abstract     = {This paper compares two estimators—the Border Approach and an Instrumental Variable (IV) estimator—using a unified framework where identifying variation arises from “preference externalities,” following the intuition in Waldfogel (2003) . We highlight two dimensions in favor of the IV approach. First, an econometric model of the data-generating process reveals that the border approach requires a set of identification assumptions that are not easily satisfied in practice: the ignorance of some payoff-relevant information and conflicting spatial correlation assumptions. The IV approach, in contrast, exhibits greater internal validity because it is derived from the model that generates the data. Second, the border approach suffers from representative issues when the true effect sizes are different between border and off-border regions. We use a common political advertising example to evaluate these estimators and suggest ways to evaluate or limit the above concerns, such as excluding localities that are a large share of the policy making region and evaluating spatial correlations of observables. We find the border approach’s representative issue to be substantial when the ignorance assumption is most plausible and observe that spatial correlations do not reflect those needed in the unobservables for consistency of the estimator. The IV, in contrast, does not exhibit concerns related to local average treatment effects. We also derive the specific conditions when the border approach can reduce bias relative to OLS.

  abstract     = {With the development of communication technology that makes online transactions easier, there is also an increased risk of disintermediation—sellers and buyers circumventing a platform to transact directly—in online two-sided marketplaces. Such disintermediation may lead to significant revenue loss for online platforms. However, it remains unclear how the characteristics of platforms affect their vulnerability to disintermediation. Using the blockade of Skype in mainland China as a natural experiment, this study examines how online communication technologies affect disintermediation and transaction outcomes in a large U.S. online freelance marketplace. The results show that restricting this alternative communication technology, which platforms struggle to monitor, reduces disintermediation by around 18%. This effect is potentially due to economic frictions in transactions, as the reduction in disintermediation is greater for high-transaction-cost jobs, such as time-sensitive jobs, communication-intensive jobs, and high-skilled jobs, as well as for cost-sensitive users, such as experienced users and personal users as opposed to enterprise users. With these results, platforms can reduce disintermediation risks when making investment and market entry decisions. This paper was accepted by D. J. Wu, information systems.

We find that as options trading volume increases, credit ratings become more responsive to expected credit risk and exhibit greater ability to predict future defaults. We also find that CRAs rely more on the options market as a source of ratings-related information when firm default risk is higher, options trading is more informative, manager-provided information is of lower quality, and firm uncertainty is higher. Our results are robust to a number of sensitivity tests, including alternative measures of options trading and credit rating accuracy. We reach similar inferences using various approaches to address endogeneity issues, including difference-in-difference analyses and an instrumental variables approach. Overall, our findings are consistent with the view that CRAs incorporate unique information from the options market into their rating decisions which, in turn, improves credit rating accuracy.

Using the merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) advisory industry as a laboratory, we show that high-performing individuals are more likely to migrate to boutique (focused) banks, especially those who are still on the upward trajectory of their career. Such migration is amplified by the cross-subsidization inside bulge bracket (multidivisional) firms, proxied by poor performance of their non-M&amp;A departments. The transition of skilled labor improves the performance of the boutique sector, potentially contributing to the rise of boutiques over the past two decades.

  abstract     = {To stay competitive, firms regularly invest in innovation by supporting internal capital projects (funded and executed in-house) that explore new products and operational improvements. Each year, in a highly competitive process, managers from different functional units of the firm submit proposals (that include estimated costs and benefits) for such projects. Managers, because of their domain knowledge and expertise, are naturally better informed about the costs and benefits of their respective projects and can use this information strategically to secure funding. An example of such behavior is the under-reporting of the cost estimate of a project and subsequently requesting additional funding during the execution phase. Such strategic behavior not only affects the firm’s ability to fund the best projects but is also costly. Motivated by this challenge of deciding the funding of such projects at a global agribusiness firm, we seek a mechanism that is both provably near-optimal for the firm and guarantees truthful reporting from managers. Our setting consists of a principal and multiple agents. In each time period, over an infinite horizon, each agent requests funding for a potential project from the principal. Before submitting his proposal, each agent privately estimates the project’s cost and its benefit. If funded, each project is executed in one period. The principal’s funding decisions are binary; that is, each project is either funded in full or not funded. The actual cost (benefit) of a funded project is realized on its completion and incurred (earned) by the principal. The agents earn utility from the experience and reputation gained in completing projects. In each period, the principal desires to keep the total spend below a budget but can borrow external money at a cost. Our main contribution is a practically appealing dynamic nonmonetary mechanism for internal capital allocation under which, for any ϵ &gt; 0 , (a) truth-telling forms an ϵ -Bayesian Nash equilibrium and (b) the principal’s expected utility is within ϵ of the expected utility in the first-best setting.

  abstract     = {Cooperation between individuals, a critical component of organizational and societal success, typically involves costs and benefits that accrue at different points in time. Using a series of controlled experiments, this paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the determinants of cooperation in an intertemporal context. Our findings demonstrate that cooperation is significantly reduced when the benefits of cooperation are shifted into the future, whereas delaying costs leads to an increase in cooperation. Our analysis of the underlying behavioral mechanisms reveals that the change in the level of cooperation can be explained by three factors: (i) a shift in the beliefs about others’ efforts, (ii) a shift in the willingness to conditionally cooperate, and (iii) an individual’s degree of impatience. We further find that injunctive norms of cooperation are unaffected by the timing of consequences, indicating that changes in behavior are due to a change in norm compliance rather than the norm itself. Implications for management practices are discussed. This paper was accepted by Yan Chen, behavioral economics and decision analysis.

  abstract     = {Choosing how easy to make it for buyers to discover new sellers is a key design decision for platforms. On one hand, enabling more discoverability generates more transactions and can be more attractive for sellers because they anticipate being discovered by new buyers. On the other hand, discoverability can make sellers more reluctant to participate because they anticipate their existing buyers will discover and purchase from other sellers. We model this fundamental trade-off and study how a platform’s optimal level of discoverability depends on various factors: the degree of substitutability between the sellers’ products; the standalone value of the platform’s tools; the size of the platform’s installed base of buyers; the nature of the platform’s fees, including its ability to charge differential fees depending on whether a transaction is with a seller’s existing buyers or not; the number of sellers; and asymmetries between sellers’ sizes.

  abstract     = {This paper studies the impact of betrayal aversion on employees’ effort provision in exchange for a bonus payment that is at the employers’ expense and discretion. In our first study, using a laboratory experiment, we find that the performance of an employee with average betrayal aversion is lower by more than 15% relative to betrayal-neutral employees. Inspired by the findings, we theoretically identify a tradeoff for the effort provision of betrayal-averse employees. That is, higher effort not only increases the level of betrayal when the bonus is not paid, but it also increases the chances to receive a bonus avoiding betrayal. In a second study, we confirm our findings in an online labor market. The data also find support for the identified tradeoff. In a third study, we manipulate employees’ beliefs about the chances of receiving the bonus to provide causal evidence for the tradeoff.

  abstract     = {Firms seeking business partners and individuals seeking life partners face several challenges in addition to finding available candidates. One of these challenges is uncertainty about a candidate’s compatibility with the match-seeker on various subjective criteria. Another challenge is authentication of objective quality features, particularly in online settings where credentials can be easily misrepresented. Online matching platforms can address these challenges through counseling services that help assess mutual compatibility of match-seekers and authentication services to validate match-seekers’ credentials. Using a stylized model, we show that the platform’s decisions to offer counseling and authentication services are influenced by match-seeker behavior in response to factors such as the platform’s counseling capability, the composition of the matching market, and the interactions between the two services. This leads to optimal strategies for the platform that are not obvious and can even be counterintuitive. For instance, offering better counseling does not necessarily result in higher revenues for the platform. And it may be optimal for the platform to reduce its access fee when it decides to offer an authentication service. We also show that when the platform’s counseling capability is modest, an increase in this capability increases the value of authentication (i.e., counseling complements authentication); however, when the platform’s counseling capability is high, counseling and authentication become substitutes , because narrowing the search to only high-value candidates based on authentication can exclude some compatible candidates. Our analysis and results provide valuable insights for platform operators on the relative value of counseling and authentication, and for researchers studying matching platforms for vertically and horizontally differentiated markets.

  abstract     = {We study a variation of the classical Pandora’s problem in which a decision maker (DM) sequentially explores alternatives from a given set and learns their values while trying to acquire the best alternative. The variations in the model we study are (i) alternatives randomly become unavailable during exploration and (ii) the DM’s ability to acquire a remaining alternative is uncertain and depends on a chosen offer price. Such acquisition uncertainties arise in many applications, including housing search, hiring problems, and e-commerce, but greatly complicate the search problem in that optimal policies retain all previously explored alternative values as part of the problem state, as opposed to only the highest explored value as in Pandora’s rule. Our central insight is that despite the complexity that these acquisition uncertainties create, simple greedy policies based on static sequencing and a single threshold value enjoy strong performance guarantees. We develop such a class of policies and show how to compute them using a greedy algorithm whose worst-case run-time scales linearly (up to logarithmic factors) in the number of alternative types. We show that our policies (a) are asymptotically optimal in high multiplicity regimes with many alternatives and (b) obtain at least 1 − e − 1 ≈ 63.2 % of the optimal value under a broad set of conditions. Extensive numerical examples support this theory: We illustrate our policies on a variation of Pandora’s problem with disappearing alternatives and housing search on models calibrated on data from the online brokerage Redfin. In these examples, our policies significantly outperform policies based on Pandora’s rule. This paper was accepted by Omar Besbes, revenue management and market analytics.

  abstract     = {Off-service placement is a common capacity-pooling strategy that hospitals utilize to address mismatches in supply and demand that arise from the day-to-day variation in patient demand. This strategy involves placing patients in a bed in a unit that is designated for another specialty service. Building on prior work that documents the negative first order effects of off-service placement on patients who are placed off service themselves, we quantify the spillover effects of this practice on patients who are actually placed on service. Using an estimation strategy that combines the Heckman correction procedure and a heteroskedasticity-based identification approach, we find that off-service placement has substantial negative spillover effects on the efficiency of care delivered to on-service patients. In particular, we find that a 10 percentage point increase in the level of off-service placement during a patient’s hospitalization is associated with a 10.9% increase in length of stay. Through a series of counterfactual analyses, we propose alternate routing and capacity-planning policies that could meaningfully improve the efficiency of care in the inpatient setting.

We prove the weak dynamic programming principle for the value function of our control problem, which we show to be the unique viscosity solution of the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. We develop an equivalent and computationally efficient representation of the Hamiltonian, which yields the optimal portfolio within a factor-dependent opportunity set defined by the maximum and minimum variance hypersurfaces. Our analysis shows that it is optimal to fund an expiring goal up to the level where the marginal benefit of additional fundedness is exceeded by the opportunity cost of diverting wealth from future goals. An all-or-nothing investor is more risk averse toward an approaching goal deadline if well funded, but more risk seeking if not on track with upcoming goals, compared with an investor with flexible goals.

  abstract     = {We derive analytical expressions for the risk of an investor’s expected utility under parameter uncertainty. In particular, our analysis focuses on characterizing the out-of-sample utility variance of three portfolios: the classic mean-variance portfolio, the minimum-variance portfolio, and a shrinkage portfolio that combines both. We then use our analytical expressions to study a robustness measure that balances out-of-sample utility mean and volatility. We show that neither the sample mean-variance portfolio nor the sample minimum-variance portfolio exhibits maximal robustness individually, and one needs to combine both to optimize portfolio robustness. Accordingly, we introduce a robust shrinkage portfolio that delivers an optimal tradeoff between out-of-sample utility mean and volatility and is more resilient to estimation errors. Our results highlight the importance of considering out-of-sample performance risk in designing and evaluating investment strategies and stochastic discount factor models.

  abstract     = {Consumers increasingly use digital advice when making purchasing decisions. How do such tools change consumer behavior and what types of consumers are likely to use them? We examine these questions with a randomized controlled trial of digital expert advice in the context of prescription drug insurance. The intervention we study was effective at changing consumer choices. We propose that, conceptually, expert advice can affect consumer choices through two distinct channels: by updating consumer beliefs about product features (learning) and by influencing how much consumers value product features (interpretation). Using our trial data to estimate a model of consumer demand, we find that both channels are quantitatively important. Digital expert advice tools not only provide consumers with information, but also alter how consumers value product features. For example, consumers are willing to pay 14% less for a plan with the most popular brand and 37% less for an extra star rating when they incorporate digital expert advice on plan choice relative to only having information about product features. Further, we document substantial selection into the use of digital advice on two margins. Consumers who are inherently less active shoppers and those who we predict would have responded to advice more were less likely to demand it. Our results raise concerns regarding the ability of digital advice to alter consumer preferences as well as the distributional implications of greater access to digital expert advice.

We show theoretically that the efficient outcome in the form of high effort can be sustained in the subgame-perfect equilibrium if the interactions are long term (even when each server has a short-term incentive to free-ride and provide low effort). In addition, we show that queue visibility plays an important role in the type of strategies that can sustain a high-effort equilibrium. In particular, we show that limiting feedback about the current state of the queue may be beneficial if the expected duration of interaction is long. We conduct two controlled laboratory experiments to test the theoretical predictions and find that effort increases with the expected duration of an interaction. We also find that visibility has a strong impact on the strategies that human subjects use to provide effort in a dynamic setting.

  abstract     = {Recent years have seen a growth in customized products and services. As a prerequisite for customization, private information on individual customers’ quality preferences needs to be uncovered. Sellers can listen to customers about their stated or self-reported preferences through direct communication (e.g., conversation, survey). Alternatively, customer preferences can be inferred from their behavior when they are given the rights to self-design the quality. In this research we endogenize the viability of customization by investigating whether and when customers may reveal their stated/inferred preferences truthfully. We find that, for either preference-learning approach, customers would voice their preferences faithfully if and only if they are sufficiently heterogenous. Equilibrium preference revelation, and hence endogenous customization, tend to be sustained by intermediate seller bargaining power or nonextreme production/selling costs. We examine how the preference-learning approaches may differ in the endogenous feasibility of customization, equilibrium qualities, and the parties’ expected payoffs. We show that giving up the design right need not always be harmful for the seller, and gaining it can make the buyers worse off, especially when fixed costs of customization are considered.

  abstract     = {Retailers face increasing competitive pressure to determine how best to deliver products purchased online to the end customer. Grocery retailers often require attended home delivery where the customer must be present to receive the delivery. For attended home delivery to function, the retailer and customer must agree on a delivery time slot that works for both parties. Using online data from a grocery retailer, we observe customer preferences for three delivery service attributes associated with each time slot: speed, precision, and timing. We define speed as the expected time between the placement of an order and its delivery, precision as the duration of the offered time slot, and timing as the availability of choices across times of the day and days of the week. We show that customers not only value speed as an attribute of delivery service but that precision and timing are also key drivers of the customer’s time slot selection process. We also observe substantial customer heterogeneity in the willingness of customers to pay for time slots. Customers that differ in their loyalty to the retailer, basket value, basket size, and basket composition exhibit distinct differences in their willingness to pay. We show that retailers with the capability to tailor their time slot offerings to specific customer segments have the potential to generate approximately 9% more shipping revenue than those who cannot. Our findings inform practitioners seeking to design competitive fulfillment strategies and academics modeling customer behavior in the attended home delivery context.

According to our regret-based framework, investors experience regret due to not achieving the highest possible return from a similar set of stock investments, and equity portfolios with high regret generate 6.84% more annualized alpha than portfolios with low regret. Using investor-trading activity of 78,000 households at a large U.S.-based brokerage firm, we develop an investor-based regret index and show that this household-level regret measure predicts stock returns in a similar way to our proposed regret measure.

  abstract     = {Most theories of decision making under risk assume that payoffs and probabilities are separable. In the context of a lottery, the subjective value of a prospective outcome (the payoff) is assumed to be independent of the likelihood that the outcome will occur (the probability). In violation of this assumption, we present eight experiments showing that people anticipate less utility from uncertain outcomes than from certain outcomes, even conditional on their realization. The devaluation of uncertain outcomes is observed across different measures of utility (willingness to spend money or time; choice between different options), different populations (student and online samples), and different manipulations of uncertainty. We show that this result does not simply reflect a misunderstanding of the instructions or people’s aversion toward a “weird” transaction with unexplained features. We highlight the implications of this phenomenon for empirical investigations of risk preferences and conclude with a discussion of the psychological mechanisms that might drive the devaluation of probabilistic outcomes.

  abstract     = {Many pharmaceutical drugs have multiple indications, for which they offer a varying degree of benefit for patients. Yet, in the current U.S. pricing system, the price of the drug is the same regardless of the indication for which it is prescribed. This uniform pricing policy can deter the payer from providing coverage for low-value indications, if the price is high relative to the potential benefit for patients, which can reduce patients’ access to the drug. It can also deter the drug manufacturer from investing in obtaining U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for new indications, as the lack of flexibility in pricing can result in too low demand (and thus profits) to recoup fixed investment costs. Indication-based pricing has been proposed as a new pricing mechanism for multi-indication drugs allowing the price to differ according to the indication, to better align the price of the drug to its value. In this paper, we analyze the effect of indication-based pricing in comparison with uniform pricing on the drug manufacturer’s profit and investment incentives, the patient demand and utility, the payer’s coverage incentives, and the payer’s objective. Under uniform pricing, we consider both the cases when the price can versus cannot be adjusted upon introduction of a new indication. We find that the drug manufacturer earns higher profits under indication-based pricing than under uniform pricing. Moreover, indication-based pricing improves incentives for the manufacturer to invest in a new indication and for the payer to cover the drug. If the fixed investment cost is high, indication-based pricing also benefits patients and the payer’s objective. Otherwise, the patient demand, patient utility and payer’s objective may be lower under indication-based pricing. Hence, payers who value the patient utility should carefully consider the tradeoffs involved in implementing this pricing system and where the bottlenecks are under uniform pricing.

  abstract     = {Women are underrepresented in many prestigious positions. Could increasing the share of women in hiring committees boost the rates at which women are hired into these positions? I use a difference-in-differences design to examine the effects of a French law on academic hiring committees that required each gender to represent a share of at least 40% of members. Contrary to the objectives of the law, I show that the reform backfired and significantly lowered women’s probability of being hired. Because the negative effect of the reform is concentrated in committees headed by men, this result seems driven by the reaction of men to the reform. I find little evidence that the reform affects supply-side characteristics, such as the likelihood of women applying. The results suggest that the underrepresentation of women is unlikely to be solved by simply increasing the share of women in hiring committees or interview panels.

  abstract     = {This paper examines the causal relationship between proximity and knowledge diffusion by estimating the elasticity of core-based statistical area (CBSA) pair-level citations to variations in travel time induced by the introduction of new flight routes. The findings reveal that decreasing travel time between U.S. cities by 20% increases knowledge flow by 0.5%, which corresponds to an increase of over 15,000 citations at the aggregate level. Rather than boosting within-firm knowledge transfer, travel time reduction leads to a rise in knowledge spillovers primarily across firm boundaries, particularly among those that form joint ventures, have block holdings in each other, or form supply chain relationships. These effects are stronger among city pairs located farther away from each other, with higher absorptive capacity, in complex technology classes, and for newly developed technologies. Additional mechanism tests suggest that the most likely channel through which travel time reduction impacts knowledge spillover is by influencing the transfer of tacit knowledge via facilitating cross-CBSA inventor flow and information acquisition.

  abstract     = {We use a game-theoretic model to examine how different types of activist motivation affect strategic interactions between an activist and a firm in the context of a threatened adversarial engagement, in which the activist can benefit from “warm glow” and media publicity as well as from firm compliance with activist demands. The model yields novel predictions about when firms prefer to self-regulate to pre-empt a contested engagement, how vigorously firms defend themselves against the activist’s attack if an engagement occurs, and a new taxonomy of engagements, characterized by offensive and defensive strategies and the likelihood of activist success. The model predicts that when warm glow and campaign-driven wins are important motivations for activists, safe bet and long shot types of engagements are more likely to occur: These tend to be lower expenditure skirmishes where one party has a clear advantage and where a pre-emptive settlement is infeasible. By contrast, firms and activists are more likely to negotiate self-regulation that pre-empts resource-intensive toss-up engagements where each side is evenly matched and expends significant effort. Our findings contribute to strategic management research by developing new insights about how firms respond to different activist motivations and types of engagements. We explore extensions of the model and discuss implications for future empirical and theoretical research on the management of activist relations.

  abstract     = {Overconfidence is pervasive in subjective probability distributions (SPDs). We develop new methods to analyze judgments that entail both a distribution of possible outcomes in a population (aleatory uncertainty) and imperfect knowledge about that distribution (epistemic uncertainty). In four experiments, we examine the extent to which subjective probability mass is concentrated in a small portion of the distribution versus spread across all possible outcomes. We find that although SPDs roughly match the concentration of the empirical, aleatory distributions, people’s judgments are consistently overconfident because they fail to spread out probability mass to account for their own epistemic uncertainty about the location and shape of the distribution. Although people are aware of this lack of knowledge, they do not appropriately incorporate it into their SPDs. Our results offer new insights into the causes of overconfidence and shed light on potential ways to address this fundamental bias.

  abstract     = {Illegal or unwanted waste disposal methods such as dumping and export are prevalent in practice. To minimize the environmental harm of these methods, policymakers have implemented laws and regulations designed to combat them. Even so, violations are rampant as a high degree of heterogeneity between firms and proprietary information render monitoring imperfect. Decentralized waste disposal chains, a common form of interbusiness organization in this sector, compound this problem as firms also have limited information available on their waste chain partner, creating complex interactions between firm behavior and policy interventions. Against this background, we analyze the effects of domestic and international waste regulations targeting dumping and export, respectively, on firm incentives and compliance. We develop a two-tier waste chain with a producer that generates waste and an operator that treats it. The producer’s waste quality and the treatment operator’s efficiency can be private information. Either party can avoid compliance cost by violating regulations where the producer can arrange for export and the operator can dump locally. Our analysis reveals that primarily focusing on penalizing dumping by treatment operators can worsen environmental harm. Solely focusing on penalizing low-quality waste exports, a common intervention in practice, can also backfire. Instead, penalizing producers for downstream dumping should be given consideration. In addition, the asymmetry in export burden between waste quality levels should be reduced. This paper was accepted by Vishal Gaur, operations management.},

  abstract     = {As digitization sweeps across industries and markets, analytics and data-driven decision making (DDD) are becoming increasingly important. The adoption of analytics and DDD has been slower in small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) compared with large firms, and reliable causal estimates of the impacts of analytics tools for small businesses have been lacking. We derive experiment-based estimates of the impact of an analytics tool on SME outcomes, analyzing the randomized introduction of eBay’s Seller Hub (SH), a data-rich seller dashboard. We find that SH adoption is associated with increased DDD and that access to SH increases e-retailers’ revenues by 3.6% on average, as more items are transacted and service quality increases, without increases in average prices. Our results suggest that analytics and DDD help SMEs establish a competitive advantage. Managerial practices play an important role in reaping the benefits from the analytics dashboard, as more than a third of the SH impact is driven by active performance monitoring. Digital platforms should therefore embed analytics tools to support SMEs to increase entry and revenues. Furthermore, policies to support small businesses’ transition to the data era should address analytics and DDD gaps by ensuring access to both tools like SH and to appropriate managerial training.

  abstract     = {High-value payment systems (HVPSs) are typically liquidity intensive because payments are settled on a gross basis. State-of-the-art solutions to this problem include algorithms that seek netting sets and allow for ad hoc reordering of submitted payments. This paper introduces a new algorithm that explores the entire space of payments reordering to improve the liquidity efficiency of these systems without significantly increasing payment delays. Finding the optimal payment order among the entire space of reorderings is, however, an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. We solve this problem using a hybrid quantum annealing algorithm. Despite the limitations in size and speed of today’s quantum computers, our algorithm provides quantifiable liquidity savings when applied to the Canadian HVPS using a 30-day sample of transaction data. By reordering batches of 70 payments, we achieve an average of Canadian (C) $240 million in daily liquidity savings, with a settlement delay of approximately 90 seconds. For a few days in the sample, the liquidity savings exceed C$1 billion. Compared with classical computing and with current algorithms in HVPS, our quantum algorithm offers larger liquidity savings, and it offers more reliable and consistent solutions, particularly under time constraints.

  abstract     = {This article introduces a class of Nash games among Stackelberg players (NASPs), namely, a class of simultaneous noncooperative games where the players solve sequential Stackelberg games. Specifically, each player solves a Stackelberg game where a leader optimizes a (parametrized) linear objective function subject to linear constraints, whereas its followers solve convex quadratic problems subject to the standard optimistic assumption. Although we prove that deciding if a NASP instance admits a Nash equilibrium is generally a Σ 2 p -hard decision problem, we devise two exact and computationally efficient algorithms to compute and select Nash equilibria or certify that no equilibrium exists. We use NASPs to model the hierarchical interactions of international energy markets where climate change aware regulators oversee the operations of profit-driven energy producers. By combining real-world data with our models, we find that Nash equilibria provide informative, and often counterintuitive, managerial insights for market regulators.

  abstract     = {Using data from a prominent online platform for launching new digital products, we document that “sampling bias”—defined as the difference between a startup’s target customer base and the actual sample on which early “beta tests” are conducted—has a systematic and persistent impact on the venture’s success. Specifically, we show that products with a female-focused target market launching on a typical day, when nine in 10 users on this platform are men, experience 45% less growth a year after launch than those for whom the target market is more male-focused. By isolating exogenous variation in the composition of beta testers unrelated to the characteristics of launched products on that day, we find that on days when there are unexpectedly more women beta testers on the platform—reducing the amount of sampling bias for female-focused products—the gender performance gap shrinks toward zero. Our results highlight how sampling bias can lead to fewer successfully commercialized innovations for consumers who are underrepresented among early users.

  abstract     = {Simple contest schemes, which tend to use extreme contemporaneous peer benchmarking, are generally thought to be less efficient at motivating productive and cooperative effort than explicit bonus contracts that optimally weight observed own and peer outputs. We show, however, that contest schemes can outperform explicit bonus contracts in a two-period dynamic setting if periodic output is correlated over time, and contract terms can be renegotiated. In our model, all parties update their beliefs about ex ante unknown time-invariant noise upon observing first-period outputs, and second-period wage offers are updated accordingly. This creates first-period shirking incentives for the agents. We show that relative to bonus contracts, the extreme contemporaneous peer benchmarking in contest schemes can weaken or even eliminate the adverse incentives created by prior-period benchmarking, even though the available information and the learning process are the same under both schemes. This dynamic advantage allows contest schemes to outperform repeated bonus contracts for a wide range of parameter values, despite imposing higher static efficiency losses in each period. If competing agents are assigned to sufficiently similar tasks, a contest scheme’s ability to sever the statistical link between periods can yield not only higher early productive effort compared with bonus contracts, but also less uncooperative behavior, despite putting the agents in a more contest-like situation.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel large-dimensional positive definite covariance estimator for high-frequency data under a general factor model framework. We demonstrate an appealing connection between the proposed estimator and a weighted group least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) penalized least-squares estimator. The proposed estimator improves on traditional principal component analysis by allowing for weak factors, whose signal strengths are weak relative to idiosyncratic components. Despite the presence of microstructure noises and asynchronous trading, the proposed estimator achieves guarded positive definiteness without sacrificing the convergence rate. To make our method fully operational, we provide an extended simultaneous alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm to solve the resultant constrained convex minimization problem efficiently. Empirically, we study the monthly high-frequency covariance structure of the stock constituents of the S&amp;P 500 index from 2008 to 2016, using all traded stocks from the NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ stock markets to construct the high-frequency Fama-French four and extended eleven economic factors. We further examine the out-of-sample performance of the proposed method through vast portfolio allocations, which deliver significantly reduced out-of-sample portfolio risk and enhanced Sharpe ratios. The success of our method supports the usefulness of machine learning techniques in finance. This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.

  abstract     = {Using big data on U.S. job postings, we show that firms increase skill requirements when hiring workers in states that cut personal income taxes. We trace a significant driver of this effect to companies’ reallocation of skilled job postings across states based on tax differentials. The tax-induced upskilling is observed within occupations and is more pronounced for high-skill positions within firms. It is accompanied and amplified by concurrent increases in information technology expenditures at local-level establishments. In characterizing the mechanism at play, we show that job upskilling is triggered by tax changes affecting middle- and upper middle-class workers. It is pronounced for high-growth firms, for firms in tradable industries, and in urban areas, but it is mitigated among profitable firms.

We derive conditions under which impact investing detracts from, improves on, or is neutral to the performance of traditional mean-variance optimal portfolios, which depends on whether the correlations between the impact factor and unobserved excess returns are negative, positive, or zero, respectively. Using Treynor–Black portfolios to maximize the risk-adjusted returns of impact portfolios, we derive an explicit and easily computable measure of the financial reward or cost of impact investing as compared with passive index benchmarks.

  abstract     = {Informal cross-border trade (ICBT) refers to the illegal activities of cross-border commerce conducted by unregistered small-scale traders. We seek to develop insights to understand the ICBT value chain and offer policy recommendations to successfully integrate it into the formal economy. Using a game-theoretic model, we analyze the operations and key market dynamics of ICBT. We analyze the policy implications of three representative UN directives: enhancing marginalized traders’ access to formal channels, reducing export tax rates for formal traders, and introducing an alternative simplified trade regime (STR) for informal traders. All three policies result in an increase in government proceeds when the inherent profitability of the formal or STR channels is sufficiently high. Furthermore, social welfare increases when the policies effectively balance wholesale price competition within the formal and informal channels. We apply our model to a case study based on Uganda’s agricultural exports over an 11-year horizon. The access enhancement policy is most effective in increasing government proceeds but least effective in improving the welfare of other participants. The tax reduction policy enhances traders’ profitability but sacrifices the welfare of farmers and government proceeds substantially. Finally, the STR acknowledgement policy results in the largest increase in profitability of marginalized traders and farmers but comes at the cost of government proceeds.

  abstract     = {Traditional asset management strategy has emphasized building barriers to entry or closely guarding unique assets to maintain a firm’s comparative advantage. A new “inverted firm” paradigm, however, has emerged. Under this strategy, firms share data seeking to become platforms by opening digital services to third parties and capturing part of their external surplus. This contrasts with a “pipeline” strategy where the firm itself creates value. This paper quantitatively estimates the effect of adopting an inverted firm strategy through the lens of application programming interfaces (APIs), a key enabling technology. Using both public data and those of a private API development firm, we document rapid growth of the API network and connecting apps since 2005. We then perform difference-in-difference and synthetic control analyses and find that public firms adopting public APIs grew an additional 38.7% over 16 years relative to similar nonadopters. We find no significant effect from the use of APIs purely for internal productivity: the pipeline strategy. Within the subset of firms that adopt public APIs, those that attract more third-party complementors and those that become more central to the network see faster growth. Using variation in network centrality caused by API degradation, an instrumental variables analysis confirms a causal role for APIs in firm market value. Finally, we document an important downside of public APIs: increased risk of data breach. Overall, these facts lead us to conclude that APIs have a large and positive impact on economic growth and do so primarily by enabling an inverted firm strategy. This paper was accepted by D. J.

Using hand-collected data, we document that when a firm has a sibling-chairperson, it holds more patents, receives more total citations to its patents, and has greater innovation efficiency and innovation quality than an otherwise equivalent firm with a chairperson having no siblings. The results are economically significant and robust to a battery of robustness checks. Specifically, the findings remain intact after using China’s one-child policy as an exogenous shock to apply a regression discontinuity research design to mitigate endogeneity. Additional analyses suggest that the mechanisms behind the impact of siblings on innovation are consistent with family-based human capital embedded in the sibling relationships such as competition, knowledge spillover, and family firm succession effect among siblings. Furthermore, we show that sibling comanagement and sibling gender diversity matter in corporate innovation. In addition, sibling effect enhances corporate investment efficiency, stock returns, and merger and acquisition performance.

  abstract     = {Overconfident behavior, the excessive willingness to bet on one’s performance, may be driven by optimistic beliefs and/or ambiguity attitudes. Separating these factors is key for understanding and correcting overconfident behavior, as they call for different corrective actions. We present a method to do so, which we implement in two incentivized experiments. The first experiment shows the importance of ambiguity attitudes for overconfident behavior. Optimistic ambiguity attitudes (ambiguity seeking) counterbalanced the effect of pessimistic beliefs, leading to neither over- nor underconfident behavior. The second experiment applies our method in contexts where overconfident behavior is expected to vary: easy versus hard tasks. Our results showed that task difficulty affected both beliefs and ambiguity attitudes. However, although beliefs were more optimistic for relative performance (rank) and more pessimistic for absolute performance (score) on easy tasks compared with hard tasks, ambiguity attitudes were always more optimistic on easy tasks for both absolute and relative performance. Our findings show the subtle interplay between beliefs and ambiguity attitudes: they can reinforce or offset each other, depending on the context, increasing or lowering overconfident behavior.

  abstract     = {We use the lens of weak signal asymptotics to study a class of sequentially randomized experiments, including those that arise in solving multiarmed bandit problems. In an experiment with n time steps, we let the mean reward gaps between actions scale to the order 1 / n to preserve the difficulty of the learning task as n grows. In this regime, we show that the sample paths of a class of sequentially randomized experiments—adapted to this scaling regime and with arm selection probabilities that vary continuously with state—converge weakly to a diffusion limit, given as the solution to a stochastic differential equation. The diffusion limit enables us to derive refined, instance-specific characterization of stochastic dynamics and to obtain several insights on the regret and belief evolution of a number of sequential experiments including Thompson sampling (but not upper-confidence bound, which does not satisfy our continuity assumption). We show that all sequential experiments whose randomization probabilities have a Lipschitz-continuous dependence on the observed data suffer from suboptimal regret performance when the reward gaps are relatively large. Conversely, we find that a version of Thompson sampling with an asymptotically uninformative prior variance achieves near-optimal instance-specific regret scaling, including with large reward gaps, but these good regret properties come at the cost of highly unstable posterior beliefs.

  abstract     = {An understanding of differences in nonmonetary work conditions is fundamental for a complete characterization of individuals’ well-being at work. Thus, to fully characterize gender inequalities in the labor market, scholars have begun to explore gender differences in nonmonetary work conditions. We examine one such condition—meaningful work—using nationally representative survey data linked with worker and employer administrative data. We document a large and expanding gender gap in meaningful work, wherein women experience their jobs as more meaningful than men do. We then explore patterns underlying this difference. We find little correlation between women’s higher experience of meaningful work and either labor market decisions related to first parenthood or women’s underrepresentation in leadership jobs. Instead, the gender gap appears to be highly correlated with the sorting of more women into occupations with a high level of beneficence: the sense of having a prosocial impact. Though both women and men experience such jobs as more meaningful, women do so by a larger margin. Next, we consider the relationship between the gender difference in meaningful work and the gender wage gap, contributing to the discussion on compensating differentials in work amenities. We find that, whereas the gender gap in meaningful work closes a substantial part of the wage gap in lower paid jobs, it does little to close the gap in higher paid jobs in which the gender wage gap is largest.

  abstract     = {Online video platforms face the challenge of balancing the needs of their users with those of their advertisers. Although users typically prefer to have less intrusive ads, advertisers aim to effectively catch user attention. This paper investigates how the provision of ad choice affects the effectiveness of video advertising. We argue that allowing users to choose an ad to view may trigger a “conjecture-formation-and-confirmation” process that motivates users to pay more attention to the selected ad. Two online experiments and four laboratory experiments are conducted to test the theorized underlying mechanism of the ad choice effect. Study 1 finds when users are unfamiliar (versus familiar) with the content of ad options (i.e., they need to make conjectures about ad content), ad choice is more likely to increase user attention to the chosen ad. Study 2 and Study 3 show that the impact of ad choice on user attention is more likely to be positive when users are enabled to make conjectures about ad content, such as when choice options provide more relevant information about ad content. Study 4a and Study 4b provide more direct support for the underlying mechanism by showing that the ad choice effect is attenuated when users cannot form conjectures about ad content at the choice stage. Study 5 further demonstrates that the positive effect of ad choice is robust across different ad settings. Taken together, these studies show ad choice is more likely to boost the effectiveness of video advertising when the “conjecture-formation-and-confirmation” process is triggered.

  abstract     = {We propose a novel measure of intermediary risk exposure based on the fraction of all trade that is conducted between dealers, called the interdealer trade (IDT) measure. Intuitively, when dealers’ aggregate risk exposure rises, they trade more with each other to redistribute inventory shocks. Consistent with risk exposures relating to expected returns, market-specific IDT measures add incremental return predictability across five different markets. For example, one-standard-deviation increases in the Treasury and foreign exchange (FX) IDT measures, respectively, forecast a 1.8% higher annual excess return on a five-year bond and a 3.7% higher annual excess return on currency-specific FX trades.

  abstract     = {We provide evidence that the yield impact of unconventional monetary policy is not a sufficient statistic to measure the strength of the bank lending channel of unconventional monetary policy. As a laboratory, we study three major positive events in the European sovereign debt crisis—the Greek debt restructuring (private sector involvement (PSI)), outright monetary transactions (OMT), and quantitative easing (QE)—using credit registry and security-level bank balance sheet data from Portugal, a country that was directly exposed to all three events. Even though the price of sovereign debt increased by substantially more after the PSI and OMT announcements, only QE led banks to reduce their net sovereign debt holdings and had statistically and economically significant effects on lending to firms and households. The differential effect on banks’ behavior reflects two forces. First, lower bank capitalization levels during the PSI and OMT episodes as well as disincentives to sell sovereign bonds because of their collateral value in the European Central Bank’s long-term refinancing operation facilities reduce the effectiveness of the recapitalization channel. Second, only QE involved direct asset purchases by the central bank and thereby induced a portfolio rebalancing channel from sovereign debt to loans.

  abstract     = {Some firms in the technology sector choose to cooperate with competitors (“co-opetition”) in standard setting organizations (SSOs). These SSOs create technology standards that facilitate rapid market penetration of new technologies such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and 4G. Active participation in the standard setting process requires the exchange of proprietary information with competitors. Although the goal of such information sharing is to further a technology or a product market, firms potentially receive an additional benefit from access to competitor and industry information. We examine whether contributing to SSO committees enhances a firm’s information set and allows managers to better predict future sales. We find that the centrality of a firm’s location within the network of SSO collaborators is positively related to the accuracy of the firm’s sales forecasts. This relation is stronger when firms exchange more information with direct competitors and with larger firms, when forecasting is more difficult ex ante, and when firms forecast over longer horizons. Our findings show that collaborating with competitors in the product market provides an important additional benefit of improving the manager’s information set.

  abstract     = {In rare-event simulation, an importance sampling (IS) estimator is regarded as efficient if its relative error, namely, the ratio between its standard deviation and mean, is sufficiently controlled. It is widely known that when a rare-event set contains multiple “important regions” encoded by the so-called dominating points, the IS needs to account for all of them via mixing to achieve efficiency. We argue that in typical experiments, missing less significant dominating points may not necessarily cause inefficiency, and the traditional analysis recipe could suffer from intrinsic looseness by using relative error or, in turn, estimation variance as an efficiency criterion. We propose a new efficiency notion, which we call probabilistic efficiency , to tighten this gap. In particular, we show that under the standard Gartner-Ellis large deviations regime, an IS that uses only the most significant dominating points is sufficient to attain this efficiency notion. Our finding is especially relevant in high-dimensional settings where the computational effort to locate all dominating points is enormous.

  abstract     = {Consumers often receive a full or partial refund for product returns or service cancellations. Much of the existing literature studies cash refunds, where consumers get the money back minus a fee upon a product return or service cancellation. However, not all refunds are issued in cash. Sometimes consumers receive credit that can be used for future purchases, oftentimes with an expiration term after which the credit is forfeited. We study the optimal design of credit refund policies. Different from models that consider cash refunds, we explicitly model repeated interactions between the seller and consumers over time. We assume that consumers’ valuation for the product/service varies over time and that there is an exogenous probability for product returns. Several interesting results emerge. First, a credit refund policy facilitates intraconsumer price discrimination for a single type of consumers with stochastic valuation. Second, an optimal policy often involves an intermediate credit expiration term, under which a consumer with a high product valuation always makes a purchase, whereas a consumer with a low product valuation may be induced to make a purchase as the credit approaches expiration, leading to a demand induction effect. Finally, a credit refund policy can be more profitable than a cash refund policy and can lead to a win-win outcome for both the firm and consumers under certain conditions. We also consider several extensions to check the robustness of our findings. This paper was accepted by Jeannette Song, operations management. Funding: Y.

  abstract     = {We develop a methodology to decompose the conditional market risk premium and risk premia on higher-order moments of excess market returns into risk premia related to contingent claims on down, up, and moderate market returns. The decomposition exploits information about the risk-neutral market return distribution embedded in option prices, but does not depend on assumptions about the functional form of investor preferences or about the market return distribution. The total market risk premium is highly time-varying, as are the contributions from downside, upside, and central risk. Time-series variation in risk premia associated with each region is primarily driven by variation in risk prices associated with the probability of entering each region at short horizons, but it is primarily driven by variation in risk quantities at longer horizons. Analogous decompositions implied by prominent representative agent models generally fail to match the dynamic risk premium behavior implied by the data. Our results provide a set of new empirical facts regarding the drivers of conditional risk premia and identify new challenges for representative agent models.

  abstract     = {Consumers frequently search for information before making decisions. Because their search and purchase decisions depend on the information environment, firms have a strong incentive to influence it. This paper endogenizes the consumer’s information environment from the firm’s perspective and endogenizes the search decision from the consumer’s perspective. We consider a dynamic model where a firm sequentially persuades a consumer to purchase the product. The consumer only wishes to buy the product if it is a good match. The firm designs the information structure. Given the endogenous information environment, the consumer trades off the benefit and cost of information acquisition and decides whether to search for more information. Given the information acquisition strategy of the consumer, the firm trades off the benefit and cost of information provision and determines how much information to provide. This paper characterizes the optimal information structure under a general signal space. We find that the firm only smooths information provision over multiple periods if the consumer is optimistic about the product fit before searching for information. Moreover, if the search cost for the consumer is high, the firm designs the information such that the consumer will be certain that the product is a good match and will purchase it after observing a positive signal. If the search cost is low, the firm provides noisy information such that the consumer will be uncertain about the product fit but will still buy it after observing a positive signal.

  abstract     = {Heuristics and biases in probabilistic belief updating have typically been examined in simple two-state experimental settings. We argue that the two-state setting has probabilistic properties that do not extend to settings with more states. With three states, we find that individuals apply similar heuristics, such as representativeness and anchoring, when providing posterior probability distributions. However, because of the different normative benchmark, the use of these heuristics results in different biases for point estimates. In particular, we demonstrate that the well-known finding of stronger underinference for larger signal sets does not translate from the two-state to the three-state setting. Our findings caution against an indiscriminate transfer of updating biases observed in two-state settings to a broad set of real-world applications.

  abstract     = {A central feature of most organizations is the use of measures to represent key elements of performance across multiple strategic objectives. Prior research demonstrates a tendency for individuals to treat these measures as though they are the higher order strategic objectives the measures were intended to represent as opposed to imperfect representations of those strategic objectives—a phenomenon labeled “surrogation.” We employ an experiment to further understand this phenomenon. In this study, we capture neural activation when processing measures and when processing strategic objectives. We find that, in regions of the brain with greater (less) activation for concrete versus abstract words, brain activation is greater (less) when processing measure phrases versus when processing strategy phrases. We further find evidence that greater brain activity and longer response times are associated with less surrogation. This affirms the notion that increased cognitive involvement can reduce surrogation. This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.

We implement the strategy in a panel data model to estimate the relation between prior signals and the future announcement. This method allows us to separate substitutes from complements, it can isolate multiple signals within the same quarter, and it can condition on the timing and signal characteristics. We find that analyst forecasts substitute earnings announcement information and that recommendations do not provide extra information on top of forecasts. Moreover, our evidence suggests that insiders sell to avoid uncertainty when the announcement is far away but pull forward earnings information when they trade one month before.

  abstract     = {We draw a surprising and direct mathematical equivalence between the class of fair division mechanisms, designed to allocate divisible goods without money, and the class of weakly budget-balanced wagering mechanisms, designed to elicit probabilities. Although this correspondence between fair division and wagering has applications in both settings, we focus on its implications for the design of incentive-compatible fair division mechanisms. In particular, we show that applying the correspondence to competitive scoring rules, a prominent class of wagering mechanisms based on proper scoring rules, yields the first incentive-compatible fair division mechanism that is both fair (proportional and envy-free) and responsive to agent preferences. Moreover, for two agents, we show that competitive scoring rules characterize the whole class of nonwasteful and incentive-compatible fair division mechanisms, subject to mild technical conditions. As one of several consequences, this allows us to resolve an open question about the best possible approximation to optimal utilitarian welfare that can be achieved by any incentive-compatible mechanism. Finally, because the equivalence greatly expands the set of known incentive-compatible fair division mechanisms, we conclude with an evaluation of this entire set, comparing the mechanisms’ axiomatic properties and examining their welfare performance in simulation.

  abstract     = {Organizations face challenges when trying to effectively introduce new operational practices that substitute for existing ones. We study how the dynamics due to social comparisons between employees give rise to individual strategic considerations and eventually shape the organizational adoption outcome. We develop an evolutionary game theory model that accounts for these microlevel individual adoption decisions and their impact on macrolevel population adoption equilibria. Social comparisons invoke dynamics that expand the possible outcomes beyond the traditional nonadoption versus full-adoption dichotomy. Specifically, ahead-seeking social comparisons drive the long-term coexistence of practices because employees seek to differentiate their choices from those of others. Meanwhile, behind-averse comparisons create a bandwagon effect that determines adoption depending on the initial fraction of adopters—that is, employees who are trained upfront. These dynamics are robust to various settings: different conceptualizations of social comparisons, each employee responding to more than one kind of social comparison, and nonhomogeneous social comparisons across employees. Moreover, they are material to organizations that seek to maximize their profit when introducing a new practice, by setting the levels of upfront training and adoption rewards. Our results call for senior managers to account for such behavioral traits when managing the introduction of new practices. Profitable adoption critically relies upon matching rewards and training to the type of social comparison. This paper was accepted by Sridhar Tayur, entrepreneurship and innovation.

  abstract     = {Cognitive differences can catalyze social learning through the process of one-to-one social influence. Yet the learning benefits of exposure to the ideas of cognitively dissimilar others often fail to materialize. Why do cognitive differences produce learning from interpersonal influence in some contexts but not in others? To answer this question, we distinguish between cognition that is expressed —one’s public stance on an issue and the way in which supporting arguments are framed—and cognition that is latent —the semantic associations that underpin these expressions. We theorize that, when latent cognition is obscured , one is more likely to be influenced to change one’s mind on an issue when exposed to the opposing ideas of cognitively dissimilar, rather than similar, others. When latent cognition is instead observable , a subtle similarity-attraction response tends to counteract the potency of cognitive differences—even when social identity cues and other categorical distinctions are inaccessible. To evaluate these ideas, we introduce a novel experimental paradigm in which participants (a) respond to a polarizing scenario; (b) view an opposing argument by another whose latent cognition is either similar to or different from their own and is either observable or obscured; and (c) have an opportunity to respond again to the scenario. A preregistered study ( n = 1,000) finds support for our theory. A supplemental study ( n = 200) suggests that the social influence of latent cognitive differences operates through the mechanism of argument novelty. We discuss implications of these findings for research on social influence, collective intelligence, and cognitive diversity in groups. This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, organizations.

  abstract     = {It is intuitive and theoretically sound to combine experts’ forecasts based on their proven skills, while accounting for correlation among their forecast submissions. Simpler combination methods, however, which assume independence of forecasts or equal skill, have been found to be empirically robust, in particular, in settings in which there are few historical data available for assessing experts’ skill. One explanation for the robust performance by simple methods is that empirical estimation of skill and of correlations introduces error, leading to worse aggregated forecasts than simpler alternatives. We offer a heuristic that accounts for skill and reduces estimation error by utilizing a common correlation factor. Our theoretical results present an optimal form for this common correlation, and we offer Bayesian estimators that can be used in practice. The common correlation heuristic is shown to outperform alternative combination methods on macroeconomic and experimental forecasting where there are limited historical data.

To investigate the causal effect of gender representation on multilateral negotiations, we experimentally manipulate the composition of triads in a majoritarian, divide-the-dollar game. We document a robust gender gap in earnings driven largely by the exclusion of women from alliances rather than differential shares within alliances. Experiments with different subject pools show that distinct bargaining dynamics can underlie the same inequitable outcomes; gender-biased outcomes can be caused by outright discrimination, but they can also be driven by more complex dynamics related to differences in bargaining strategies. Although replacing the male with a female majority all but eliminates the gap in one pool, it has minimal effect in the other. These findings show that there is no “one-size-fits-all” solution to the gender gap we uncovered and highlight the importance of studying bargaining dynamics in detail.

  abstract     = {Motivated by our collaboration with Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev), a consumer packaged goods (CPG) company, we consider the problem of forecasting sales under the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Our approach combines nonparametric regression, game theory, and pandemic modeling to develop a data-driven competitive online nonparametric regression method. Specifically, the method takes the future COVID-19 case estimates, which can be simulated via the susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) epidemic model as an input, and outputs the level of calibration for the baseline sales forecast generated by AB InBev. In generating the calibration level, we focus on an online learning setting where our algorithm sequentially predicts the label (i.e., the level of calibration) of a random covariate (i.e., the current number of active cases) given past observations and the generative process (i.e., the SIR epidemic model) of future covariates. To provide robust performance guarantee, we derive our algorithm by minimizing regret, which is the difference between the squared ℓ 2 -norm associated with labels generated by the algorithm and labels generated by an adversary and the squared ℓ 2 -norm associated with labels generated by the best isotonic (nondecreasing) function in hindsight and the adversarial labels. We develop a computationally efficient algorithm that attains the minimax-optimal regret over all possible choices of the labels (possibly non-i.i.d. and even adversarial). We demonstrate the performances of our algorithm on both synthetic and AB InBev’s data sets of three different markets (each corresponds to a country) from March 2020 to March 2021. The AB InBev’s numerical experiments show that our method is capable of reducing the forecast error in terms of weighted mean absolute percentage error (WMAPE) and mean squared error (MSE) by more than 37% for the company.

  abstract     = {At the onset of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, hospitals experienced a demand surge for COVID-19–related medical care while simultaneously struggling to source prescription drugs needed to manage COVID-19 patients. This is worrisome as shortfalls in the supply of essential drugs can negatively impact patient outcomes. The popular press reporting on these challenges suggests that they are caused by supply chain disruptions. However, rigorous research on the relationship between the pandemic and prescription drug supply is limited. To address this gap, we leverage a quasi-experimental design and IQVIA’s National Sales Perspectives™ data from 2018 to 2020. We focus on prescription drugs indicated for the management of COVID-19 patients and a set of control drugs (i.e., drugs not used for COVID-19). We find that in the early phases of the pandemic, hospitals stockpiled prescription drugs indicated for the management of COVID-19, making this behavior an under-recognized cause of the sourcing challenges. The sales volume of drugs indicated for COVID-19 management was concentrated in the first two months of the pandemic, after which sales decreased significantly despite a nationwide increase in COVID-19–related hospitalizations. We investigate another potential cause of stockpiling: expected price increases. Counter to concerns of price gouging, we find little evidence of price inflation for these drugs. An implication for drug manufacturers is that orders due to stockpiling by downstream buyers early on in a pandemic may need to be discounted when predicting future demand. Our results have implications for drug suppliers, hospitals, and policymakers interested in improving medical product supply chain resilience.

  abstract     = {This study explores the polarization of news content shared on Facebook compared with email using data from the New York Times ’ Most Emailed and Most Shared lists over 2.5 years. Employing latent Dirichlet allocation and large language models (LLMs), we find that highly polarized articles are more likely to be shared on Facebook (versus email), even after accounting for factors like topics, emotion, and article age. Additionally, distinct topic preferences emerge, with social issues dominating Facebook shares and lifestyle topics prevalent in emails. Contrary to expectations, political polarization of articles shared on Facebook did not escalate post-2020 election. We introduce a novel approach to measuring polarization of text content that leverages generative artificial intelligence models, like ChatGPT, and it is both scalable and cost effective. This research contributes to the evolving intersection of LLMs, social media, and polarization studies, shedding light on descriptive patterns of content dissemination across different digital channels.

  abstract     = {We study the impact of monetary policy changes on portfolio decisions of U.S. households. Contrary to the predictions of canonical portfolio choice models, interest rate increases are related to increased equity ownership and larger wealth allocations to risky assets. Inflation hedging is a likely explanation for these findings. Interest rates have a stronger impact on the equity exposure of households that experience higher inflation, especially those with greater inflation awareness and potentially stronger hedging motives. Using household portfolios at a large discount brokerage house, we provide direct evidence that investors with greater inflation sensitivity overweight stocks with high hedging potential.

  abstract     = {Compared with regular employees, independent contractors (ICs) offer labor flexibility and cost savings to their employers. Using a difference-in-differences design around the 2004 Massachusetts law that discourages IC usage, we find that this exogenous decrease in IC usage makes treated firms’ earnings more sensitive to changes in sales, increases labor-related expenses, and reduces profitability. Firms subsequently reduce share repurchases. The decrease is more pronounced for firms with high operating leverage and financial constraints. Our results are robust to entropy balancing. We conclude that IC usage affects firms’ operating leverage and profitability, which in turn, influence payout policy. This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance.

  abstract     = {Monetary incentives are widely used to align employee actions with employer objectives. We conducted a field experiment in a retail chain to evaluate whether an attendance bonus could reduce employee absenteeism. Apprentices in 232 stores were randomly assigned to a control group or one of two treatment groups in which a monetary or time-off attendance bonus was introduced for one year. We find that neither variant of the attendance bonus led to a systematic reduction in absenteeism. On the contrary, the monetary attendance bonus increased absenteeism substantially by around 50% on average, which corresponds to more than five additional days absent per employee and year. This effect was driven by the most recently hired apprentices. Survey results reveal that the monetary attendance bonus shifted the perception of absenteeism as acceptable behavior. The backfiring effect persisted beyond the end of the experiment, indicating a lasting erosion of social norms.

We find that DVP and UVP predict international stock returns through U.S. bad and good macroeconomic uncertainties, respectively. Sixty percent to 80% of the dynamics of the global equity risk premium for horizons under seven months are driven by economic uncertainty, whereas risk aversion appears more relevant for longer horizons. The predictability patterns of DVP and UVP vary across countries depending on those countries’ financial and economic exposure to global shocks. In those with higher economic exposure, investors demand higher compensation for bad macroeconomic uncertainty but lower compensation for good macroeconomic uncertainty, whereas the compensation for bad macroeconomic uncertainty is lower for countries with high financial exposure.

Critics argue (1) that these valuations are not relevant for public companies, which can assess the desirability of the deal based on the market premium, and (2) that the investment bank providers cater to management by “rationalizing” the deal price rather than providing an independent valuation check. I find that fairness valuations can provide valid information about the target’s value, incremental to its predeal stock price. They can impound expected transaction synergies, unravel rumor-driven stock price runups, and may signal ex ante fundamental mispricing. I also find evidence of the alleged catering, which I distinguish from “legitimate” valuation disagreements.

  abstract     = {Online platforms have a wealth of data, run countless experiments, and use industrial-scale algorithms to optimize user experience. Despite this, many users seem to regret the time they spend on these platforms. One possible explanation is that incentives are misaligned: platforms are not optimizing for user happiness. We suggest the problem runs deeper, transcending the specific incentives of any particular platform, and instead stems from a mistaken foundational assumption. To understand what users want, platforms look at what users do. This is a kind of revealed-preference assumption that is ubiquitous in the way user models are built. Yet research has demonstrated, and personal experience affirms, that we often make choices in the moment that are inconsistent with what we actually want. The behavioral economics and psychology literatures suggest, for example, that we can choose mindlessly or that we can be too myopic in our choices, behaviors that feel entirely familiar on online platforms. In this work, we develop a model of media consumption where users have inconsistent preferences. We consider a platform which wants to maximize user utility, but only observes behavioral data in the form of the user’s engagement. We show how our model of users’ preference inconsistencies produces phenomena that are familiar from everyday experience but difficult to capture in traditional user interaction models. These phenomena include users who have long sessions on a platform but derive very little utility from it, and platform changes that steadily raise user engagement before abruptly causing users to go “cold turkey” and quit. A key ingredient in our model is a formulation for how platforms determine what to show users: they optimize over a large set of potential content (the content manifold) parametrized by underlying features of the content. Whether improving engagement improves user welfare depends on the direction of movement in the content manifold: For certain directions of change, increasing engagement makes users less happy, whereas in other directions on the same manifold, increasing engagement makes users happier. We provide a characterization of the structure of content manifolds for which increasing engagement fails to increase user utility. By linking these effects to abstractions of platform design choices, our model thus creates a theoretical framework and vocabulary in which to explore interactions between design, behavioral science, and social media.

  abstract     = {Market producers often seek to position themselves in different categories over time. Successful repositioning is difficult, however, as audiences often devalue offerings that depart from a producer’s past creations. Prior research suggests that this penalty arises as evaluators withhold opportunities for producers to reposition because of presumptions of a lack of competence in different categories. In this paper, we develop understanding of a novel evaluator-driven challenge to producers’ repositioning efforts: evaluators are prone to “categorical stickiness,” by which the categories they have come to associate with a producer through its prior offerings shape their perceptions of the producer’s subsequent offerings. The result is a systematic mismatch between what producers claim and what evaluators perceive when a producer repositions. We further propose that audience members who have the greatest prior experience with a producer are the least likely to recognize its repositioning efforts. We examine evidence for our theory using data from Goodreads.com on authors within the book publishing industry, 2007–2017. We first build a novel deep-learning framework to predict categorization of a given book based solely on an author’s description of its content. We then use data on how Goodreads users categorize and evaluate books as well as their past reading behavior to test for evidence of our proposed mechanism. Overall, our results extend understanding of the evaluative processes that generate categorical constraints and how these may differ among various types of audience members.

Accounting signals generated by the accounting rules guide the continuation decision at an interim project stage. The entrepreneur enjoys private benefits from continuation, which may induce inefficient decisions. The optimal accounting rule is characterized by a threshold, with a higher threshold representing more conservative accounting. The first-best is achieved under small private benefits. As private benefits increase, the first-best eventually is not achievable and more informative bad news is required for the manager to terminate, resulting in less conservative accounting rules. Therefore, more conservative accounting rules are associated with more efficient investment decisions. This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.

  abstract     = {I examine whether financial statements are more comparable when accounting standards restrict managers’ discretion. My evidence suggests that restricting managers’ discretion is associated with reduced comparability, on average. This effect is strongest when transactions are dissimilar. To explore this relation, I develop novel measures of two distinct types of incomparability . I find that restricting managers’ discretion is associated with an increase in incomparability stemming from dissimilar transactions appearing overly similar. Together, these findings suggest that restricting managers’ discretion may be more harmful to comparability than is too much diversity in practice. However, I also find evidence that restricting managers’ discretion may enhance comparability in two scenarios. Specifically, I find that restricting managers’ discretion is associated with improved comparability when standards (1) restrict manipulation of financial reports and (2) eliminate dissimilar accounting treatments that do not reflect differences in the underlying transactions. Overall, these findings nuance our understanding of how the requirements imposed by standard setters influence financial statement comparability.

  abstract     = {We study the used car market to understand how public enforcement that intends to increase information reliability affects disclosure, pricing, and liquidity. In 1986, federal rules mandated the creation of odometer records, and states enforced the law in a staggered fashion. We find that used car asking-price sensitivity to mileage increases by 32.6%, and mileage disclosure in classified ads increases by 23.4%. The findings suggest that strengthened law enforcement increases odometer credibility and enhances market participants’ use of that information. We also show significant improvement in market outcomes: a 9.7% increase in asking price and a 13.4% increase in transaction speed, as reflected in the reduction in repeated ads. The price effect arises irrespective of whether ads contain mileage disclosure, whereas the liquidity effect arises mainly through disclosure.

  abstract     = {Although prior research suggests strict, fair value–based securities accounting rules cause banks to sell securities into negative liquidity shocks, a value-destroying behavior called “liquidity feedback trading,” the mechanism is uncertain. We find the sooner chief executive officers (CEOs) are permitted to cash out of their stock and option grants, the more prone are their banks to feedback trading. Furthermore, the sooner CEOs can cash out, the more positive their banks’ stock price reaction to news of accounting rule relaxation. We conclude incentives for managerial short-term focus are a mechanism by which stricter accounting rules cause feedback trading. We also find evidence that regulatory compliance concerns play a role. This paper was accepted by Tomasz Piskorski, finance. Funding: A.

  abstract     = {U.S. K–12 school districts that traditionally utilized ongoing “formative” assessments of student progress increasingly rely on additional “interim” assessments to predict student performance on standardized tests. Moreover, some districts are experimenting with merit-based teacher bonuses tied to standardized test scores. We examine the relationship between interim assessments and teacher bonuses using a two-period principal–agent model. The school district (principal), operating under a limited budget, decides whether to implement interim assessments and how much merit pay to offer, and teachers (agents) choose how much effort to exert in each period. We use two-state (proficient versus not proficient) Markovian dynamics to describe the evolution of student test readiness, in which the transition probability in a given period depends on both teachers’ effort decisions and the starting state. Our results indicate that, despite the popularity of interim assessments, their usefulness is far from guaranteed. In particular, the accuracy promised by these assessments is a double-edged sword: positive midyear results can make it easier to incentivize second period teacher effort, but negative results can have a demotivating effect. Moreover, even when an interim assessment does result in a higher probability of the school ending the year in the proficient state, the resulting higher expected costs of merit-based bonuses for the district may exceed the available budget. Thus, even a free interim assessment might be too expensive for the school district. This paper was accepted by Charles Corbett, operations management.

  abstract     = {Fueled by remarkable developments in mobile and wearable technologies coupled with the power of the Internet a multibillion industry constructed on digital platforms, Connected Fitness, has emerged. Sustained engagement is a crucial prerequisite for healthy behavior, and platforms that offer connected fitness services must contend with the challenge of engaging new users. In this study, we examine whether a virtual race, an event in which runners can participate remotely in an organized activity, can serve as an effective strategy to amplify users’ long-term engagement related to healthy behavior. We study the impact of offering virtual races to runners on a digital fitness platform on their engagement with the platform and level of physical activity. Leveraging the match of the theme of the virtual races and users’ zodiac signs as the instrument to support causal inference, we find that a virtual race increases the engagement of new users by 42.8 days and total spending on related e-commerce on the platform by 48.4% during our study period. We also find that the positive impact of virtual races transcends the typical mechanism of social connections; results show that virtual races can increase the engagement with the platform even when their social connections are low. Finally, we find that existing users who participate in a virtual race outrun those in the control group by 4.41 km in a three-week period. Our study highlights the potential of new forms of digital interactions, powered by mobile and wearable technologies, on user behavior in fitness platforms.

  abstract     = {We examine a supply chain with a single risk-averse manufacturer who purchases from suppliers and sells to consumers. Within this context, we focus on two channels that drive blockchain adoption by the manufacturer: manufacturer risk aversion and consumer information asymmetry. Regarding the first channel, blockchain enables efficient tracing of defective products so that the manufacturer can selectively recall defective products rather than conducting a full recall. This tracing ability reduces the risk involved in the manufacturer purchasing from multiple suppliers and thereby leads the manufacturer to endogenously diversify across suppliers when blockchain is adopted. The diversification enhances the manufacturer’s welfare due to the manufacturer’s risk aversion and thus drives the manufacturer to adopt blockchain. With regard to the second channel, blockchain stores details from the manufacturing process and reveals them to consumers, thereby ameliorating consumer information asymmetry. This reduction in information asymmetry improves consumer decision making that, in isolation, would enhance consumer welfare. However, the manufacturer responds by increasing the consumer price, thereby transferring potential consumer welfare gains to the manufacturer, and consequently serving as a second channel to drive blockchain adoption by the manufacturer.

  abstract     = {Motivated by a long-standing gap between inventory theory and practice, we study online inventory models with unknown cyclic demand distributions. We design provably efficient reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms that leverage the structure of inventory problems to achieve optimal theoretical guarantees that surpass existing results. We apply the standard performance measure in online learning literature, regret , which is defined as the difference between the total expected cost of our policy and the total expected cost of the clairvoyant optimal policy that has full knowledge of the demand distributions a priori. This paper analyzes, in the presence of unknown cyclic demands, both the lost-sales model with zero lead time and the multiproduct backlogging model with positive lead times, fixed joint-ordering costs and order limits. For both models, we first introduce episodic models where inventory is discarded at the end of every cycle, and then build upon these results to analyze the nondiscarding models. Our RL policies HQL and FQL achieve O ˜ ( T ) regret for the episodic lost-sales model and the episodic multiproduct backlogging model, matching the regret lower bound that we prove in this paper. For the nondiscarding models, we construct a bandit learning algorithm on top that governs multiple copies of the previous RL algorithms, named Meta-HQL . Meta-HQL achieves O ˜ ( T ) regret for the nondiscarding lost-sales model with zero lead time, again matching the regret lower bound. For the nondiscarding multiproduct backlogging model, our policy Mimic-QL achieves O ˜ ( T 5 / 6 ) regret. Our policies remove the regret dependence on the cardinality of the state-action space for inventory problems, which is an improvement over existing RL algorithms. We conducted experiments with a real sales data set from Rossmann, one of the largest drugstore chains in Europe, and also with a synthetic data set. For both sets of experiments, our policy converges rapidly to the optimal policy and dramatically outperforms the best policy that models demand as independent and identically distributed instead of cyclic.

  abstract     = {When a benchmark model is inefficient, including test assets in addition to the benchmark portfolios can improve the performance of the optimal portfolio. In reality, the efficiency of a benchmark model relative to the test assets is ex ante unknown; moreover, the optimal portfolio is constructed based on estimated parameters. Therefore, whether and how to include the test assets becomes a critical question faced by real world investors. For such a setting, we propose a combining portfolio strategy, optimally balancing the value of including test assets and the effect of estimation errors. The proposed combining strategy can work together with some existing estimation risk reduction strategies. In both empirical data sets and simulations, we show that our proposed combining strategy performs well. This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.

  abstract     = {This paper empirically studies the extent to which career concerns as part of a typical contract offer influence employees’ work performance in a Japanese auto dealership firm. Because career movements and base-wage adjustments rely on performance evaluation over time, we develop a dynamic structural model that allows concerns for future payoffs to impact an employee’s current work effort. A reform in personnel-management policies of the firm during the data period enables us not only to compare the performances across individuals, but also to compare within an individual the performance before and after the reform—this enhances the model identification. Our estimation results show that the added value from career movements on top of the monetary payoffs is more important than the monetary payoffs. Individuals respond to career movements and commissions differently, mainly due to varying cost of effort and different payoffs from career movements. Our counterfactual exercises suggest that, compared with the scenario when there is only monetary compensation, adding career movements in a contract package will greatly improve the firm’s gross profit. The firm can improve its net profit by making commission and promotion more performance-based. This paper was accepted by Matt Shum, marketing.

The low-price, high-volatility regime is associated with greater information asymmetry between informed and uninformed investors.

  abstract     = {Many platforms host user-generated content (UGC) and content developed by professionals side by side. However, thus far, their impact on platform ecosystems has been mostly studied in isolation. In this paper, we use data from a network of 122 local news outlets hosted by an online news platform to study the spillover effects from UGC developed by citizen journalists to the content developed by professional journalists. We use the removal of a status index associated with citizen journalists as an exogenous shock to their supply of UGC to identify these spillover effects. We find that experienced citizen journalists reduce their production of content when this status index is removed. We then find that inexperienced professional journalists increase their output in response to this behavior. However, as a result of these changes, we find a reduction in the overall content hosted by the platform, especially in the case of local news and in more isolated regions. We further show that this is likely to have detrimental effects for the platform. In particular, there is a decline in overall viewership, and the platform may need to hire and pay salaries to more professional journalists to produce enough articles to close the gap left by the departing citizen journalists. Our work contributes to the literature on UGC and online platforms and to the literature on local news. This paper was accepted by D. J. Wu, information systems division.

  abstract     = {This paper studies a novel social commerce practice known as “help-and-haggle,” whereby an online consumer can ask friends to help her “haggle” over the price of a product. Each time a friend agrees to help, the price is cut by a random amount, and if the consumer cuts the product price down to zero within a time limit, she will get the product for free; otherwise, the product reverts to the original price. Help-and-haggle enables the firm to promote its product and boost its social reach as consumers effectively refer their friends to the firm. We model the consumer’s dynamic referral behavior in help-and-haggle and provide prescriptive guidance on how the firm should randomize price cuts. Our results are as follows. First, contrary to conventional wisdom, the firm should not always reduce the (realized) price-cut amount if referrals are less costly for the consumer. In fact, the minimum number of successful referrals the consumer must make to have a chance to win the product can be nonmonotone in referral cost. Second, relative to the deterministic price-cut benchmark, a random price-cut scheme improves firm payoff, extracts more consumer surplus, and widens social reach. Additionally, in most instances, it also reduces the promotion expense while increasing profit from product sales at the same time. Third, help-and-haggle can be more cost effective in social reach than a reward-per-referral program that offers a cash reward for each successful referral. However, using the prospect of a free product to attract referrals cannibalizes product sales, potentially causing help-and-haggle to fall short. Yet, if consumers are heterogeneous in product valuations and referral costs or face increasing marginal referral costs, help-and-haggle can outperform the reward-per-referral program.

We formulate a new testing procedure for prospect spanning for two nested portfolio sets based on subsampling and linear programming. In an application, we use the prospect spanning framework to evaluate whether well-known anomalies are spanned by standard factors. We find that of the strategies considered, a few of them expand the opportunity set of the prospect type investors and thus have real economic value for them and involve absence of loss aversion. Those are the net stock issue anomaly under the FF-5 model, the momentum and net stock issue anomalies under the M-4 model, and the momentum anomaly under the q model.

  abstract     = {A merchant dynamically sets prices in each time period when selling a product over a finite time horizon with a given initial inventory. The merchant utilizes new external information that is observed at the beginning of each time period, whereas the demand function—how the external information and the price jointly impact that single-period demand distribution—is unknown. The merchant’s decision, setting price dynamically, serves dual roles to learn the unknown demand function and to balance inventory with an ultimate objective to maximize the expected cumulative revenue. The main objective of this work is to characterize and provide a full spectrum of relations between the order of optimal expected cumulative revenue achieved in three decision-making regimes: the merchant’s online decision-making regime, a clairvoyant regime with complete knowledge about the demand function, and a deterministic regime in which all the uncertainties are relaxed to the expectations. In the analyses, we derive an unconstrained representation of the optimality gap for generic constrained online learning problems, which renders tractable lower and upper bounds for the expected revenue achieved by dynamic pricing algorithms between different regimes. This analytical framework also inspires the design of two dual-based dynamic pricing algorithms for the clairvoyant and online regimes. This paper was accepted by Hamid Nazerzadeh, data science.

  abstract     = {We document considerable cross-investor variation in survey expectations about aggregate stock market returns. Although most investors are extrapolators who expect higher returns after a good market performance, some are contrarians who expect lower returns after a good performance. More notably, compared with extrapolators, contrarians have less persistent expectations that are corrected more quickly. We then develop a dynamic equilibrium model accounting for these differences in expectations and find that the equilibrium stock price exhibits short-term momentum and long-term reversal as in the data. Furthermore, we test the key predictions of our model linking the observable differences in extrapolators’ and contrarians’ expectations to aggregate stock market momentum and future stock performance and find supportive evidence for our model mechanism.

  abstract     = {In many domains, it is necessary to combine opinions or forecasts from multiple individuals. However, the average or modal judgment is often incorrect, shared information across respondents can result in correlated errors, and weighting judgments by confidence does not guarantee accuracy. We develop a Bayesian hierarchical model of crowd wisdom that incorporates predictions about others to address these aggregation challenges. The proposed model can be applied to single questions, and it can also estimate respondent expertise given multiple questions. Unlike existing Bayesian hierarchical models for aggregation, the model does not link the correct answer to consensus or privilege majority opinion. The model extends the “surprisingly popular algorithm” to enable statistical inference and in doing so, overcomes several of its limitations. We assess performance on empirical data and compare the results with other aggregation methods, including leading Bayesian hierarchical models.

  abstract     = {We examine determinants and consequences of virtual shareholder meetings (VSMs) using a sample of voluntary (precoronavirus disease 2019) and forced (i.e., because of coronavirus disease 2019) VSM adopters. Voluntary adopters are tech firms and firms traditionally more engaged with shareholders, consistent with the stated objective to increase shareholder participation. In contrast, we do not find that firms choose the virtual format to avoid shareholders’ scrutiny. Textual analysis of transcripts suggests that in VSMs, business presentations by management are less frequent, shorter, and more generic but only among voluntary adopters, suggesting that these properties reflect a firm’s choice rather than are a by-product of the virtual format per se. VSMs are more likely to exhibit no questions during the question and answer period, but conditioned upon having one question, they exhibit the same number of questions; such questions are more negative in tone, inconsistent with managers using the virtual format to filter out hostile questions. Finally, there is some evidence of greater abnormal absolute returns around VSMs, supporting the notion that greater attendance translates into greater information content. Overall, VSMs exhibit less activity on average, consistent with critics’ concerns, but such reduced activity does not appear to cause a loss in information content nor does it appear to reflect an attempt to avoid scrutiny.

  abstract     = {Short-term corporate social impact activities, wherein employees participate in firm-sponsored prosocial initiatives, are becoming increasingly common. However, it remains unclear whether short-term social impact activities affect employee behavior in a manner of relevance to the firm. Theoretically, arguments could be made in favor of or against the likelihood that such short-term activities would increase firm-benefitting employee behavior. We utilized data from a randomized field experiment implemented at a large Latin American bank to examine whether a short-term social impact activity can be beneficial for firms, focusing on one important outcome: turnover. Newly hired employees were randomly assigned to a short-term social impact activity as part of the new employee onboarding process or not. Notably, we find causal evidence that a day-long, short-term engagement reduced employee turnover almost a year later. We explore potential mechanisms behind this effect and find that employees’ perceptions of organizational justice help to explain the effects of the intervention on turnover. We also explore heterogeneous treatment effects and find more substantial effects for male, rather than female, employees. This paper advances the literature on the implications of corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices by shedding light on the causal mechanisms through which a theoretically underexplored and practically relevant type of CSR activity can benefit organizations and their employees.

We show there is more obfuscation when examiners are more lenient, and we provide an empirical exercise supporting this conclusion. We also show that more examination resources do not prevent and may lead to more obfuscation. This result continues to hold when applicants can invest in knowledge to increase their chances of having good ideas. We also show that there is less obfuscation when good ideas are harder to find.

We also find that relationships with major stakeholders (i.e., debtholders, suppliers, and employees) amplify the effect of the FTR of languages on income smoothing. Additional analyses suggest that income smoothing driven by the FTR of languages enhances earnings informativeness.

We build a simple theoretical model that captures the relative efficacy of personalized algorithmic recommendations and curation based on human expertise. We highlight a critical tension between detailed, yet potentially narrow, information available to the algorithm versus broad (often private), but not scalable, information available to the human editor. Empirically, we show that, on average, algorithmic recommendations can outperform human curation with respect to clicks, but there is significant heterogeneity in this treatment effect. The human editor performs relatively better in the absence of sufficient personal data and when there is greater variation in preferences. These results suggest that reverting to human curation can mitigate the drawbacks of personalized algorithmic recommendations. Our computations show that the optimal combination of human curation and automated recommendation technology can lead to an increase of up to 13% in clicks. In absolute terms, we provide thresholds for when the estimated gains are larger than our estimate of implementation costs. This paper was accepted by Chris Forman, information systems. Funding: C.

  abstract     = {Product recommendations can benefit consumers’ online product search via multiple underlying mechanisms, such as showing products that offer them high value, facilitating navigation on the website, or exposing more product information. However, it is unclear ex ante which is the primary underlying mechanism that drives the benefits of product recommendations to consumers. We conducted a randomized field experiment to estimate the benefits of an item-based collaborative filtering (CF) recommendation system to consumers. We collect unique data on the affinity scores computed by an item-based CF algorithm to develop measures of a product’s net value and horizontal (taste) fit for consumers. Our results indicate that product recommendations help consumers search for higher-value products that are lower priced, fit their tastes better, or both. Besides that, we find that the ability to find higher-value products (rather than easy navigation or exposure to more product information) is the primary driver for consumers’ higher purchase probabilities under recommendations. We further find a higher benefit of recommendations in product categories with higher price dispersion and heterogeneity in consumers’ tastes, providing additional evidence for the lower price and better horizontal fit mechanisms. Finally, we find that when made available, consumers substitute their usage of other search tools on the website with product recommendations. Our findings have important implications for online retailers, policymakers, regulators, and item-based CF recommendation system design. This paper was accepted by D. J. Wu, information systems.

  abstract     = {As artificial intelligence (AI) applications become more pervasive, it is critical to understand how knowledge workers with different levels and types of experience can team with AI for productivity gains. We focus on the influence of two major types of human work experience (narrow experience based on the specific task volume and broad experience based on seniority) on the human-AI team dynamics. We developed an AI solution for medical chart coding in a publicly traded company and conducted a field study among the knowledge workers. Based on a detailed analysis performed at the medical chart level, we find evidence that AI benefits workers with greater task-based experience, but senior workers gain less from AI than their junior colleagues. Further investigation reveals that the relatively lower productivity lift from AI is not a result of seniority per se but lower trust in AI, likely triggered by the senior workers’ broader job responsibilities. This study provides new empirical insights into the differential roles of worker experience in the collaborative dynamics between AI and knowledge workers, which have important societal and business implications.

In contrast, when competition is endogenous so that all buyers other than the strong buyer break even, seller revenue is always lower in the presence of a strong buyer. We also study seller actions such as providing buyer subsidies, setting reserve prices, securing multiple strong buyers, bundling assets, and optimally choosing the time of sale that might alleviate the fall in revenue.

Consistent with the theory, we document a significant and positive relation between changes in breadth and the cross-section of future corporate bond returns. Because of the bounded upside of debt, the ability of changes in breadth to predict returns appears to be less pronounced for corporate bonds relative to stocks. Furthermore, this predictability is stronger among bonds with higher credit risk, indicating that the effect of short-sale constraints and divergence of opinions on bond mispricing tends to be larger for riskier bonds with more upside potential and, thus, more scope for overvaluation.

  abstract     = {Exploiting a unique high-frequency, individual-level database, we (1) construct individual-level, incentive-compatible proxies of impulsivity based on video gaming behavior and (2) use these proxies to evaluate predictions concerning how impulsivity shapes individuals’ responses to a relaxation of credit constraints as captured by receiving a credit card. We discover that precard gaming intensity—as measured by the frequency and amount of game expenditures—is strongly and positively associated with (a) the probability of defaulting on credit card debt in the future, (b) postcard expenditures on luxury and addictive items, (c) surges in consumption spending immediately after receiving the credit card, and (d) rapid debt accumulation after obtaining the card. Differences in financial literacy, income, income variability, education, and demographics do not drive the results. The results are consistent with (1) neurological and psychological studies stressing that excessive gaming is associated with impulse control deficiencies and (2) behavioral theories stressing that impulsivity, i.e., time-inconsistent preferences for immediate gratification and ineffective strategies for avoiding myopic cues and temptations, substantially influence individual expenditure patterns and borrowing decisions when liquidity constraints are relaxed.

  abstract     = {A main research goal in various studies is to use an observational data set and provide a new set of counterfactual guidelines that can yield causal improvements. Dynamic Treatment Regimes (DTRs) are widely studied to formalize this process and enable researchers to find guidelines that are both personalized and dynamic. However, available methods in finding optimal DTRs often rely on assumptions that are violated in real-world applications (e.g., medical decision making or public policy), especially when (a) the existence of unobserved confounders cannot be ignored, and (b) the unobserved confounders are time varying (e.g., affected by previous actions). When such assumptions are violated, one often faces ambiguity regarding the underlying causal model that is needed to be assumed to obtain an optimal DTR. This ambiguity is inevitable because the dynamics of unobserved confounders and their causal impact on the observed part of the data cannot be understood from the observed data. Motivated by a case study of finding superior treatment regimes for patients who underwent transplantation in our partner hospital (Mayo Clinic) and faced a medical condition known as new-onset diabetes after transplantation, we extend DTRs to a new class termed Ambiguous Dynamic Treatment Regimes (ADTRs), in which the causal impact of treatment regimes is evaluated based on a “cloud” of potential causal models. We then connect ADTRs to Ambiguous Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (APOMDPs) proposed by Saghafian (2018) , and consider unobserved confounders as latent variables but with ambiguous dynamics and causal effects on observed variables. Using this connection, we develop two reinforcement learning methods termed Direct Augmented V-Learning (DAV-Learning) and Safe Augmented V-Learning (SAV-Learning), which enable using the observed data to effectively learn an optimal treatment regime. We establish theoretical results for these learning methods, including (weak) consistency and asymptotic normality. We further evaluate the performance of these learning methods both in our case study (using clinical data) and in simulation experiments (using synthetic data). We find promising results for our proposed approaches, showing that they perform well even compared with an imaginary oracle who knows both the true causal model (of the data-generating process) and the optimal regime under that model. Finally, we highlight that our approach enables a two-way personalization ; obtained treatment regimes can be personalized based on both patients’ characteristics and physicians’ preferences.

To address this question, we take advantage of a unique setting when in 2007 the ownership of The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) was transferred to News Corp., a media conglomerate with broad business interests. We find that, after the acquisition, WSJ’s sentiment toward competitors of News Corp. became significantly negative in comparison with similar reporting conducted by The New York Times . Further, WSJ’s reporting influences stock prices and is associated with more profitable insider trading.

This extrapolative behavior is more pronounced among lower-numeracy individuals, and it persists throughout the business cycle.

  abstract     = {“Buy-now-pay-later” (BNPL) is a relatively unregulated FinTech innovation that provides consumers with easy access to credit for retail purchases. BNPL spending is projected to reach $1 trillion by 2025, but we know little about its effects. Using banking data for 10.6 million U.S. consumers, we investigate the effects of BNPL on leading indicators of users’ financial health. We find that new BNPL users experience rapid increases in bank overdraft charges and credit card interest and fees compared with nonusers, consistent with BNPL facilitating overborrowing. An instrumental variable exploiting consumers’ pre-BNPL shopping habits bolsters our inferences. Our results inform regulatory investigations into the effects of BNPL on users’ financial health and expand academia’s understanding of an important consumer credit innovation.

  abstract     = {We estimate an infinite-horizon dynamic oligopoly model of audit firm tenure and misstatements and evaluate a policy counterfactual involving mandatory audit firm rotation. Longer tenure lowers the cost of producing audits, increasing audit quality and reducing audit fees. Thus clients are less likely to misstate and more likely to keep the incumbent audit firm as tenure increases. By reducing the value of retaining audit firms, mandatory rotation leads to large increases in auditor switches, even before the term limit, implying increases in the switching costs borne by clients. Misstatement rates increase because audit firms endogenously lower audit quality and newly hired audit firms have lower quality. Overall, the model suggests caution when evaluating the costs and benefits of government oversight over the audit profession. This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.

  abstract     = {Many firms delegate pricing decisions to sales agents that directly interact with customers. A premise behind this practice is that sales agents can gather informative signals about the customer’s valuation for the good of interest. The information acquired through this interaction with the customer can then be used to make better pricing decisions. We study the underlying principal-agent problem that arises in such situations. In this setting, the agent can exert costly effort to learn a customer’s valuation and then decide on the price to quote to the customer, whereas the firm needs to offer a contract to the agent to induce its desired joint learning and pricing behavior. We analyze two versions of this problem: a base model where there is a single customer and a single good, and a generalization where there are multiple customers and limited inventory of the good. For both problems, we find a family of contracts whose payoffs can approach first-best payoffs arbitrarily closely even if the agent has limited liability, that is, garners nonnegative payments in all states of the world, and shed light on the structure and implementation of such contracts. Under reasonable assumptions, these contracts can be implemented with commissions that are convex increasing in revenues up to some cap. These contracts continue to perform well under practical adjustments such as commissions with a revenue-sharing structure.

  abstract     = {In a world of increasingly extensive information, rational investors can make better decisions. However, reinforcement-oriented investors are also more likely to observe preferred signals close to their own perception. A focus on these signals distorts the perceived aggregate signal in the direction of the prior estimate. This reduces belief adaptation. Hence, the empirically well-documented selective exposure/reinforcement theory reduces the positive impact of greater information availability on price efficiency. Additional information can sometimes even decrease perception correctness. In a market with biased investors, managers have an incentive to announce more diffuse (fewer precise) signals in case of negative (positive) information. This results in postearnings-announcement drift and dispersion anomaly. Also, the distribution shape matters for information processing. For unimodal, symmetric distributions, agents’ perceptions converge to the fundamental—even though at a reduced speed. For multimodal signal distributions, the estimate can diverge from the fundamental. This paper was accepted by Yan Chen, behavioral economics and decision analysis.

We investigate these explanations in two samples: students and personnel managers. The subjects bet on the productivity of teams that are homogeneous with respect to gender at the outset and then either remain homogeneous or become diverse. The teams work on tasks that differ with respect to gender stereotypes. We obtain similar results in both samples. Women are picked more often for the stereotypically female task, and men are picked more often for the stereotypically male task. Subjects believe that gender-diverse teams perform better, especially in the task with complementarities, and they display an own-gender bias.

  abstract     = {Due to the sheer number of available choices, online retailers frequently use tiered assortment to present products. In this case, groups of products are arranged across multiple pages or stages, and a customer clicks on “next” or “load more” to access them sequentially. Despite the prevalence of such assortments in practice, this topic has not received much attention in the existing literature. In this work, we focus on a sequential choice model that captures customers’ behavior when product recommendations are presented in tiers. We analyze multiple variants of tiered assortment optimization (TAO) problems by imposing “no-duplication” and capacity constraints. For the offline setting involving known customers’ preferences, we characterize the properties of the optimal tiered assortment and propose algorithms that improve the computational efficiency over the existing benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study the online setting of the TAO problem. A unique characteristic of our online setting, absent from the one-tier MNL bandit, is partial feedback . Products in the lower priority tiers are not shown when a customer has purchased a product or has chosen to exit at an earlier tier. Such partial feedback, along with product interdependence across tiers , increases the learning complexity. For both the noncontextual and contextual problems, we propose online algorithms and quantify their respective regrets. Moreover, we are able to construct tighter uncertainty sets for model parameters in the contextual case and thus improve the performance. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithms through numerical experiments. This paper was accepted by J. George Shanthikumar, data science.

  abstract     = {This paper shows how convex incentives in vertical contracts between manufacturers and retailers can induce sales behavior with costs to consumers. We examine this problem in the automotive sector, where manufacturers commonly motivate new vehicle sales through dealer incentive programs with large discrete bonuses determined by monthly sales targets. Using subprime car loans from over 3,500 dealerships, we document high default rates on new car loans originated at the end of the month—the period when dealerships attempt to secure target-based bonuses by intensifying efforts to sell new cars. We provide evidence consistent with the observed higher default rates resulting from customers purchasing new vehicles at month end. New car purchases stretch borrower budgets and expose borrowers to rapid depreciation, which consigns the borrower with negative equity through much of the loan term. Our results imply that the quartile of customers with the highest payment-to-income ratio see default rates increase from 13.6% to 19.7% on the last day of the month. Although consumers bear high costs from increased defaults, we find no evidence that lenders that purchase the loans are hurt by the default increase. Our results demonstrate how the behaviors induced by convex incentive schemes for sales are borne by customers. This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, business strategy.

  abstract     = {We study the problem of maximizing payoff generated over a period of time in a general class of closed queueing networks with a finite, fixed number of supply units that circulate in the system. Demand arrives stochastically, and serving a demand unit (customer) causes a supply unit to relocate from the “origin” to the “destination” of the customer. The key challenge is to manage the distribution of supply in the network. We consider general controls including customer entry control, pricing, and assignment. Motivating applications include shared transportation platforms and scrip systems. Inspired by the mirror descent algorithm for optimization and the backpressure policy for network control, we introduce a rich family of mirror backpressure (MBP) control policies. The MBP policies are simple and practical and crucially do not need any statistical knowledge of the demand (customer) arrival rates (these rates are permitted to vary in time). Under mild conditions, we propose MBP policies that are provably near optimal. Specifically, our policies lose at most O ( K T + 1 K + η K ) payoff per customer relative to the optimal policy that knows the demand arrival rates, where K is the number of supply units, T is the total number of customers over the time horizon, and η is the demand process’ average rate of change per customer arrival. An adaptation of MBP is found to perform well in numerical experiments based on data from NYC Cab. This paper was accepted by Gabriel Weintraub, revenue management and market analytics. Funding: Y.

  abstract     = {Online platforms such as preprint servers have become an important way to disseminate new scientific knowledge prior to peer review. However, little is known about how attention to preprints may vary across authors from different countries of origin, particularly relative to evaluation in expert-controlled systems such as scientific journals. This study explores how readers allocated attention across preprints in the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic, a time when there was an increase in demand for new research and a corresponding increase in the use of preprint platforms around the world. We find that, after controlling carefully for article quality and topic, as well as the prominence of the preprint’s ultimate publication outlet, preprints with authors from Chinese institutions receive less attention, and preprints with authors from U.S. institutions receive more attention, than preprints with authors from the rest of the world. In an exploration of potential mechanisms driving the observed effects, we find evidence that when evaluation is more constrained, in terms of lack of knowledge or expertise and increase in time pressure, audiences tend to make greater use of preprint authors’ country of origin as a proxy for quality or relevance. The results suggest that geographic biases may persist or even be exacerbated on platforms designed to promote unfettered access to early research findings.

  abstract     = {Diagnostic errors are common and can result in serious patient harm. Making the right diagnosis often requires significant diagnostic effort. Yet most physician payment schemes are procedure based and do not account for diagnostic effort or accuracy because of observability issues. In this paper, we develop a parsimonious model to examine the impact of a physician payment scheme on a physician’s decisions to (1) exert diagnostic effort and (2) perform a confirmatory test. High effort provides an informative (though imperfect) signal of the patient’s true state; the test is confirmatory in that it is a prerequisite for diagnosing a severe condition. Our model uses a two-step diagnostic process to capture the interaction between the physician’s diagnostic effort and testing decisions. We show that under a fee-for-service payment scheme, the physician may view the diagnostic effort and the confirmatory test as either complementary or substitutive, depending on the additional revenue from testing. We also reveal nonmonotonic properties such that a more patient-centered physician may not exert more effort or provide a more accurate diagnosis. In addition, either a flat or differentiated payment scheme may be optimal. We also show that an alternative payment scheme, under which the revenue from the confirmatory test is contingent on its result, can induce the social optimum under certain conditions. With the advent of artificial intelligence as part of the standard of care and its increasing use as confirmatory tests, our research has implications for the design of physician payment systems in light of concerns about the potential erosion of individual attention.

  abstract     = {The Securities and Exchange Commission’s 2016 Tick Size Pilot Program was a natural experiment that imposed increases in tick size for randomly selected small-cap firms. Using a difference-in-differences research design, we examine the effect of this increase in tick size on earnings guidance. We find that after initiation of the program, treatment firms provide significantly less earnings guidance. We provide further evidence that this decrease is driven by increases in investors’ fundamental information acquisition and in firms’ financial reporting quality, consistent with firms reducing earnings guidance when investors are already more informed. The decrease is stronger for firms with higher proprietary costs of disclosure, consistent with firms being more likely to reduce costly disclosure when investors are more informed. In contrast, the decrease is weaker for firms with greater external financing needs, consistent with these firms continuing to seek the benefits of disclosure, even when investors are more informed. Taken together, our results suggest that an increase in tick size makes investors more informed, which, in turn, reduces the need for firms to provide earnings guidance, though the extent of the reduction depends on the costs and benefits of providing earnings guidance.

In times of low arbitrage activity, the beta-arbitrage strategy exhibits delayed correction, taking up to three years for abnormal returns to be realized.

  abstract     = {The k -secretary problem deals with online selection of at most k numerically scored applicants, where selection decisions are immediate upon their arrival and irrevocable, with the goal of maximizing total score. There is, however, wide prevalence of bias in evaluations of applicants from different demographic groups (e.g., gender, age, race), and the assumption of an algorithm observing their true score is unreasonable in practice. In this work, we propose the poset secretary problem, where selection decisions must be made by observing a partial order over the applicants. This partial order is constructed to account for uncertainty and biases in applicant scores. We assume that each applicant has a fixed score, which is not visible to the algorithm and is consistent with the partial order. Using a random partitioning technique from the matroid secretary literature, we provide order-optimal competitive algorithms for the poset secretary problem and provide matching lower bounds. Further, we develop the theory of thresholding in posets to provide a tight, adaptive-thresholding algorithm under regimes where k grows quickly enough, thus matching the adaptiveness to k shown for the classical k -secretary problem. We then study a special case, in which applicants belong to g disjoint demographic groups and the bias is group specific. We provide competitive algorithms for adversarial and stochastic variants of this special case, including a framework, Gap, for parallelizing any vanilla k -secretary algorithm to the group setting. Finally, we perform a case study on real-world data to demonstrate the responsiveness of our algorithms to data and their impact on selection rates.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the design and analysis of experiments conducted on a set of units over multiple time periods in which the starting time of the treatment may vary by unit. The design problem involves selecting an initial treatment time for each unit in order to most precisely estimate both the instantaneous and cumulative effects of the treatment. We first consider nonadaptive experiments, in which all treatment assignment decisions are made prior to the start of the experiment. For this case, we show that the optimization problem is generally NP-hard, and we propose a near-optimal solution. Under this solution, the fraction entering treatment each period is initially low, then high, and finally low again. Next, we study an adaptive experimental design problem, in which both the decision to continue the experiment and treatment assignment decisions are updated after each period’s data are collected. For the adaptive case, we propose a new algorithm, the precision-guided adaptive experiment algorithm, which addresses the challenges at both the design stage and the stage of estimating treatment effects, ensuring valid post-experiment inference, accounting for the adaptive nature of the design. Using realistic settings, we demonstrate that our proposed solutions can reduce the opportunity cost of the experiments by more than 50%, compared with static design benchmarks.

  abstract     = {Some nonprofit organizations (NPOs) manage a complex workforce composed of a mix of volunteers, part-time workers, and full-time workers. We study the NPO’s finite-horizon staffing problem to determine the optimal initial staff planning decisions and per period optimal hiring and assignment decisions given a budget, capacity constraints, and an uncertain supply of volunteers and part-time workers. Our main goal is to solve this problem in a way that is effective and easy to implement while obtaining interesting managerial insights. To this end, we first demonstrate that the optimal staffing policies are computationally challenging to identify in general. However, we demonstrate that a prioritization assignment policy and a hire-up-to policy for part-time workers can be conveniently applied and are close to optimal. These policies are, in fact, optimal under staff scarcity and staff sufficiency. In our numerical analysis, we study the value and impact of the general optimal solution that considers flexibility and turnover of part-time workers versus the prioritization assignment policy and a constant hire-up-to policy that omit flexibility and turnover behaviors. We further suggest two easy-to-implement heuristics and theoretically analyze them and run a numerical performance study. We observe that both heuristics have low relative optimality gaps. Finally, we extend our analysis by studying how the optimal policy varies under three different practical considerations: a concave social value objective, nonzero volunteer costs, and dynamic volunteer behaviors.

  abstract     = {In a wide variety of applications, including healthcare, bidding in first price auctions, digital recommendations, and online education, it can be beneficial to learn a policy that assigns treatments to individuals based on their characteristics. The growing policy-learning literature focuses on settings in which policies are learned from historical data in which the treatment assignment rule is fixed throughout the data-collection period. However, adaptive data collection is becoming more common in practice from two primary sources: (1) data collected from adaptive experiments that are designed to improve inferential efficiency and (2) data collected from production systems that progressively evolve an operational policy to improve performance over time (e.g., contextual bandits). Yet adaptivity complicates the problem of learning an optimal policy ex post for two reasons: first, samples are dependent and, second, an adaptive assignment rule may not assign each treatment to each type of individual sufficiently often. In this paper, we address these challenges. We propose an algorithm based on generalized augmented inverse propensity weighted (AIPW) estimators, which nonuniformly reweight the elements of a standard AIPW estimator to control worst case estimation variance. We establish a finite-sample regret upper bound for our algorithm and complement it with a regret lower bound that quantifies the fundamental difficulty of policy learning with adaptive data. When equipped with the best weighting scheme, our algorithm achieves minimax rate-optimal regret guarantees even with diminishing exploration. Finally, we demonstrate our algorithm’s effectiveness using both synthetic data and public benchmark data sets. This paper was accepted by Hamid Nazerzadeh, data science.

  abstract     = {Consumer showrooming has become a common phenomenon in the retail industry, but little is known about its influence on the interplay between an upstream supplier and a downstream retailer in a distribution channel. Our study examines such an influence by considering an upstream supplier who sells a product through a downstream physical retailer based on a wholesale contract. At the same time, based on an agency contract, the supplier sells the product on an online retail platform where a nonneglectable amount of consumer returns occurs due to product misfits. We find that, on the one hand, consumer showrooming enables the supplier to take a greater share of the offline channel profit by exploiting the physical retailer’s deterrence of showrooming. On the other hand, consumer showrooming as a mixed-channel shopping method makes the supplier less capable of adjusting the direct online demand according to its marginal cost of handling returns. Such a return-loss-propagation-moderating effect protects the downstream physical retailer from the upstream supplier’s strategic pricing that intends to shift sales from offline to direct online when the supplier finds it cost efficient to handle online product returns. Our study also shows that the retailer can replace the wholesale contract with the store-within-a-store model with a rental fee contract to leverage the upstream supplier’s incentive to mitigate the adverse effect of showrooming. The findings inform the physical retailer that the more critical issue may not be showrooming itself but aligning with the upstream supplier to promote offline sales in the presence of showrooming.

  abstract     = {Waitlists are commonly used to allocate scarce resources, such as public housing or organs. Waitlist policies attempt to prioritize agents who wait longer by assigning them priority points (à la first come, first served). We show that such point systems can lead to severe inequality across the agents’ assignment probabilities unless they use randomization. In particular, deterministic point systems lead to a more unequal allocation than any other rule that prioritizes earlier arrivals, an axiom that ensures that agents who wait longer are treated (weakly) better. Among the policies abiding by this axiom, we show that service in random order (SIRO) leads to the most equal allocation. From a utilitarian perspective, we show that the planner faces no trade-off between equity and efficiency when the flow utility from waiting is nonnegative or negative and increasing over time. In these cases, SIRO is also the most efficient policy. However, when the flow cost of waiting increases over time, then the planner may face an efficiency–equity trade-off: SIRO remains the most equitable policy but may not be the most efficient one.

  abstract     = {We examine five summer Olympics and identify stocks that media outlets hype as benefiting from the Olympics (Olympic stocks). There is a seven-year period from the time that a country first learns it has won the Olympic bid to the start of the games (Olympic time period). We predict that the excitement of the Olympics along with the greater media attention impacts the valuation and risk of Olympic stocks. Consistent with this prediction, we show that Olympic stocks earn higher returns than their matched counterparts and comove more strongly with each other over the Olympic time period. Olympic stocks also exhibit increases in trading volume and stock volatility on days when media outlets have stories linking the firm to the Olympic Games. However, we find no evidence that the Olympic Games translate into stronger fundamentals for Olympic firms or stronger fundamental comovements. These findings suggest that investors are not purchasing the stocks based on an analysis of fundamentals, but are purchasing them based on their Olympic attribute. To confirm that event-based groupings occur in other settings, we show that comovement increases for stocks classified by the media as “stay-at-home” stocks at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

  abstract     = {During 2005–2007, the Securities and Exchange Commission conducted a randomized trial in which it removed short-sale restrictions from one third of the Russell 3000 firms. Early studies found modest market microstructure effects of removing the restrictions but no effect on short interest, stock returns, volatility, or price efficiency. More recently, many studies have attributed a wide range of indirect outcomes to this experiment, mostly without assessing the causal channels for those outcomes. We examine the three most often cited causal channels for these indirect effects: short interest, returns, and managerial fear. We find no evidence to support these channels. We then reexamine the principal findings in four recent studies using a sample that closely matches the actual experiment and a common research design and find minimal support for the reported indirect effects. Our findings highlight the importance of confirming a causal channel or an economic mechanism and show that sample selection and specification choices can produce statistical significance even without an underlying economic mechanism.

  abstract     = {Firms adopt randomized experiments to evaluate various interventions (e.g., website design, creative content, and pricing). However, most randomized experiments are designed to identify the impact of one specific intervention. The literature on randomized experiments lacks a holistic approach to optimize a sequence of interventions along the customer journey. Specifically, locally optimal interventions unveiled by randomized experiments might be globally suboptimal when considering their interdependence as well as the long-term rewards. Fortunately, the accumulation of a large number of historical experiments creates exogenous interventions at different stages along the customer journey and provides a new opportunity. This study integrates multiple experiments within the reinforcement learning (RL) framework to tackle the questions that cannot be answered by stand-alone randomized experiments. How can we learn optimal policy with a sequence of interventions along the customer journey based on an ensemble of historical experiments? Additionally, how can we learn from multiple historical experiments to guide future intervention trials? We propose a Bayesian recurrent Q -network model that leverages the exogenous interventions from multiple experiments to learn their effectiveness at different stages of the customer journey and optimize them for long-term rewards. Beyond optimization within the existing interventions, the Bayesian model also estimates the distribution of rewards, which can guide subject allocation in the design of future experiments to optimally balance exploration and exploitation. In summary, the proposed model creates a two-way complementarity between RL and randomized experiments, and thus, it provides a holistic approach to learning and optimizing interventions along the customer journey.

  abstract     = {We replicate 469 anomaly variables similar to those studied by Hou et al. (2020) using Chinese A-share data and a reliable testing procedure with mainboard breakpoints and value-weighted returns. We find that 83.37% of the anomaly variables do not generate significant high-minus-low quintile raw return spreads. Further adjusting risk increases the failure rate slightly to 84.22% based on CAPM alphas and 86.99% based on Fama–French three-factor alphas. We show that the conventional procedure using all A-share breakpoints with equal-weighted returns for the anomaly test is indeed problematic as it assigns too much weight to microcaps and has a very limited investment capacity. The CH3-factor, CH4-factor, and q -factor models show the best performance over the whole sample period. The q -factor model is the best performer in the post-2007 subsample period after significant improvements occurred in China’s financial market environment, such as the completion of the split-share structure reform and the implementation of new accounting standards conforming to the International Financial Reporting Standards. The non–state-owned enterprise subsample in the post-2007 period is a cleaner sample in which the CH4-factor and q -factor models are the best performers.

  abstract     = {Random coefficient multinomial logit models are widely used to estimate customer preferences from sales data. However, these estimation models can only allow for products with positive sales; this selection leads to highly biased estimates in long tail markets, that is, markets where many products have zero or low sales. Such markets are increasingly common in areas such as online retail and other online marketplaces. In this paper, we propose a two-stage estimator that uses machine learning to correct for this bias. Our method first uses deep learning to predict the market shares of all products, where the neural network’s structure mirrors the random coefficient multinomial logit model’s data generating process. In the second stage, we use the predictions of the first stage to reweight the observed shares in a way that corrects for the induced bias and maintains the causal interpretation of the structural model. We show that the estimated parameters are consistent in the number of markets. Our method performs well on simulated and real long tail data, producing accurate estimates of customer behavior. These improved estimates can subsequently be used to provide prescriptive policy recommendations on important managerial decisions such as pricing, assortment, and so on.

First, we use the “friends-of-friends” approach and exploit the fact that analyst coverage networks partially overlap to identify endogenous peer effects, in which firms respond directly to the capital structure choices of their peers, separately from contextual effects, in which they respond to their peers’ characteristics. We further show evidence that analysts facilitate these peer effects through their role as informational intermediaries. Analyst network peer effects are distinct from industry peer effects and are more pronounced among peers connected by analysts that are more experienced and from more influential brokerage houses.

  abstract     = {Limited access to large-scale data is a key obstacle to building machine learning (ML) applications in practice, partly due to a reluctance of information exchange among data owners out of privacy and data security concerns. To address this “information silo” problem, federated learning (FL) techniques have been proposed to enable decentralized model training via an orchestrating central server and have received increasing attention in several industries (including healthcare and finance). Despite its superior privacy protection property, adoption of FL is limited by a lack of systematic understanding of its underlying economics. In this paper, we take an analytical approach to answer two questions: (1) when do data owners prefer to form a FL partnership over building ML models by themselves and (2) how can different contractual mechanisms be used to promote repeated contributions to FL (the cooperative outcome that benefits all participants). We formulate an iterated prisoner’s dilemma (IPD) model that accounts for unique FL characteristics, including the specification of the payoff matrix and the involvement of a central server to sanction noncooperation. We find that partnership formation requires participants to be not too forward-looking in temporal preferences, which is contrary to the conventional wisdom in IPD. Furthermore, to promote repeated contributions, it is insufficient to only rely on penalties imposed by the central server or by participants for noncooperation, but a combination of both is enough. Our work advances theoretical understanding of the economics of FL and provides prescriptive insights that can inform FL participant selection and contract design. This paper was accepted by D. J.

  abstract     = {We conduct a large-scale natural field experiment with a Fortune 500 company to test several light-touch approaches to attract minorities to high-profile positions. A total of 5,000 prospective applicants were randomized into treatments that vary a small portion of recruiting materials. We find that self-selection at two early-career stages exhibits a substantial race gap. We then show that this gap can be strongly influenced by several treatments, with some closing the race gap and increasing application rates of minorities by 40% and others being particularly effective for minority women. These effects are not accompanied by any declines in application rates of majority group job seekers. In addition, we do not find that endorsing the “business case” for diversity reduces the race gap or raises application rates by minorities or women. The heterogeneities we find by gender, race, and career stage shed light on the underlying drivers of self-selection barriers among minorities.

  abstract     = {Institutional investors increasingly hold firms in both the industrial and financial sectors. These cross-industry holdings link firms to “outside” banks that they have not borrowed from, creating a network between the two sectors. We show that such networks reduce firms’ loan spreads. This effect is more prominent when cross-holders are actively involved in borrowers’ routine operations and when they have stronger incentives to advocate for borrowers in the loan process. Furthermore, outside banks begin to lend more to firms once the two parties become linked. This network is “behind-the-scenes” because it does not arise from prior interactions between firms and banks, but is instead built through institutions’ cross-holdings.

  abstract     = {If a financial asset’s price movement impacts a firm’s product demand, the firm can respond to the impact by adjusting its operational decisions. For example, in the automotive industry, automakers decrease the selling prices of fuel-inefficient cars when the oil price rises. Meanwhile, the firm can implement a risk-hedging strategy using the financial asset jointly with its operational decisions. Motivated by this, we develop and solve a general risk-management model integrating risk hedging into a price-setting newsvendor. The optimal hedging strategy is calculated analytically, which leads to an explicit objective function for optimizing price and “virtual production quantity” (VPQ). (The latter determines the service level—that is, the demand-fulfillment probability.) We find that hedging generally reduces the optimal price when the firm sets the target mean return as its production-only maximum expected profit. With the same condition on the target mean return, hedging also reduces the optimal VPQ when the asset price trend positively impacts product demand; meanwhile, it may increase the VPQ by a small margin when the impact is negative. We construct the return-risk efficient frontier that characterizes the optimal return-risk trade-off. Our numerical study using data from a prominent automotive manufacturer shows that the markdowns in price and reduction in VPQ are small under our model and that the hedging strategy substantially reduces risk without materially reducing operational profit.

  abstract     = {An ideal that supports quality and delivery of care is to have hospital operations that are coordinated and optimized across all services in real time. As a step toward this goal, we propose a multistage adaptive robust optimization approach combined with machine learning techniques. Informed by data and predictions, our framework unifies the bed assignment process across the entire hospital and accounts for present and future inpatient flows, discharges, and bed requests from the emergency department, scheduled surgeries and admissions, and outside transfers. We evaluate our approach through simulations calibrated on historical data from a large academic medical center. For the 600-bed institution, our optimization model was solved in seconds and reduced off-service placement by 24% on average and boarding delays in the emergency department and postanesthesia units by 35% and 18%, respectively. We also illustrate the benefit of using adaptive linear decision rules instead of static assignment decisions. This paper was accepted by Carri Chan, healthcare management.

  abstract     = {This paper examines how data-driven personalized decisions can be made while preserving consumer privacy. Our setting is one in which the firm chooses a personalized price based on each new customer’s vector of individual features; the true set of individual demand-generating parameters is unknown to the firm and so must be estimated from historical data. We extend the existing personalized pricing framework by requiring also that the firm’s pricing policy preserve consumer privacy, or (formally) that it be differentially private : an industry standard for privacy preservation. We develop privacy-preserving personalized pricing algorithms and show that they achieve near-optimal revenue by deriving theoretical (upper and lower) performance bounds. Our analyses further suggest that, if the firm possesses a sufficient amount of historical data, then it can achieve a certain level of differential privacy almost “for free.” That is, the revenue loss due to privacy preservation is of smaller order than that due to estimation. We confirm our theoretical findings in a series of numerical experiments based on synthetically generated and online auto lending (CPRM-12-001) data sets. Finally, motivated by practical considerations, we also extend our algorithms and findings to a variety of alternative settings, including multiproduct pricing with substitution effect, discrete feasible price set, categorical sensitive features, and personalized assortment optimization.

  abstract     = {Neuropsychological studies propose that listeners unconsciously assess speakers’ trustworthiness via their facial expressions. Building on this theory, we investigate how investors respond to CEOs’ dynamic hemifacial asymmetry of expressions ( HFAsy ) shown in CNBC’s video interviews about corporate earnings. Consistent with the neuropsychological prediction that facial asymmetry induces distrust, we document that (1) the stock market reacts negatively to the CEO’s HFAsy shown in the interview video, and (2) the market reaction to favorable earnings news is negatively associated with the CEO’s HFAsy . We also find a significantly positive association between the short-window abnormal bid-ask spreads and HFAsy , suggesting a larger investor disagreement for firms with high- HFAsy CEOs. Furthermore, we show that analyst forecast revisions are negatively associated with CEOs’ HFAsy . Our results are robust to conducting a falsification test using the previous quarter as a pseudo-event, employing an alternative measure of HFAsy , and using more granular trading data at the second level. Overall, our study provides evidence that investor trust and trading behavior are affected by the dynamic hemifacial asymmetry of expressions appearing on CEOs’ faces.

Startups that move to Silicon Valley experience a significant improvement in performance. This improvement is higher than migrations to other regions in the United States, many of which report null treatment effects. The startups that benefit the most from migration are those leaving low performing entrepreneurial ecosystems and moving to high performing ecosystems, consistent with an agglomeration mechanism. Within different measures of the ecosystem, the level of local patenting predicts startup improvements more than venture capital or the quality-adjusted number of startups, suggesting the local innovation environment is more important to migrant performance than financing or the presence of other startup peers.

During the crisis, trading surges, whereas dealers’ liquidity provision plunges for mutual-fund-held bonds, leading to greater price depressions in these bonds. Importantly, the crisis reshapes the market’s perceptions of mutual fund fragility risks, with the aftermath-yield spreads widening significantly more for bonds with greater mutual fund exposures. Such postcrisis pricing effects reflect dealers’ continued reluctance to provide liquidity for mutual fund–held bonds, and they are stronger for bonds whose mutual fund holders are more susceptible to investor runs.

  abstract     = {Using textual analysis techniques, including seeded word embedding and bag-of-words-based content analysis, I develop a firm-level measure of supply chain risk exposure from a novel source of unstructured data—the discussion between managers and equity analysts on supply chain-related topics during firms’ quarterly earnings conference calls. I validate the measure by showing that (1) the measure exhibits intuitive variations over time and across firms, successfully capturing both routine and systematic supply chain risk events; and (2) the measure is about risk exposure, as it significantly correlates with realized and options-implied stock return volatility, even after controlling for well-known aggregate risk measures. I then demonstrate that the measure is specifically indicative of the supply chain component of risk exposure. (3) Consistent with theoretical predictions, firms facing higher supply chain risks have higher inventory buffers, particularly in raw materials and intermediate inputs, increased cash holdings in lieu of investments, and significantly lower trade credit received from suppliers. Moreover, (4) during unexpected risk episodes, such as the Tohoku earthquake, firms with higher ex ante risk exposure have worse operating and financial performance. These results indicate that the text-based measure provides a credible quantification of firm-level exposure to supply chain risks and can thus be reliably utilized as outcome or explanatory variables in empirical supply chain research.

Approximately 66% of active retail investors predominantly hold simple, one-sided positions in only one class of options, whereas institutional investors are more likely to use complex strategies. Hypothesizing that the complexity of trading styles reflects investors’ skills, we examine the effect of options trading styles on investment performance. We find that retail investors using simple strategies lose to the rest of the market. For both retail and institutional investors, selling volatility is the most successful strategy.

  abstract     = {We introduce a new family of mechanisms for one-sided matching markets, denoted pick-an-object (PAO) mechanisms. When implementing an allocation rule via PAO, agents are asked to pick an object from individualized menus. These choices may be rejected later on, and these agents are presented with new menus. When the procedure ends, agents are assigned the last object they picked. We characterize the allocation rules that can be sequentialized by PAO mechanisms and the ones that can be implemented in a robust truthful equilibrium. We justify the use of PAO as opposed to direct mechanisms by showing that its equilibrium behavior is closely related to the one in obviously strategy-proof (OSP) mechanisms, but implements commonly used rules, such as Gale-Shapley DA and top trading cycles, which are not OSP implementable. We run laboratory experiments comparing truthful behavior when using PAO, OSP, and direct mechanisms to implement different rules. These indicate that agents are more likely to behave in line with the theoretical prediction under PAO and OSP implementations than their direct counterparts.

  abstract     = {We study debt-contracting implications of uncertainty surrounding U.S. gubernatorial elections. In election years, loan contracts are more likely to include performance-pricing provisions, whereas loan spreads are mostly unaffected. Additionally, we find, only among those loans without performance-pricing provisions, a marginal increase in loan spreads in election years and a significant increase in loan-spread amendments postelection. The results suggest that under transitory uncertainty, performance pricing curbs an explicit rise in loan spreads and reduces ex-post renegotiations, yielding efficiency gains in contracting. Our further analysis uncovers a veiled pricing effect manifested through interest-rate contingencies: the likelihood of using rate-increasing pricing grids rises in election years for borrowers with a high exposure to uncertainty, thereby ensuring compensation to lenders for uncertainty. Overall, our findings suggest that loan contracting attempts to mitigate the problem of election uncertainty and renegotiation costs through state-contingent pricing, with which borrowers weigh initial loan spreads against the potential for loan-spread variability in the future.

We use a series of experiments to explore gender differences in willingness to apply for higher-return, more challenging work.

We provide evidence both in a controlled setting and in the field that reducing ambiguity surrounding required qualifications increases the rate at which qualified women apply.

  abstract     = {Concepts are introduced and applied for analyzing and selecting arbitrage portfolios in the face of uncertainty about initial positions and risk preferences. A stochastic arbitrage opportunity is defined as a zero-cost investment portfolio that enhances every feasible host portfolio for all admissible utility functions. The alternative to the existence of such investment opportunities is the existence of a solution to a dual system of asset pricing restrictions based on a class of stochastic discount factors. Feasible approaches to numerical optimization and statistical inference are discussed. Empirical results suggest that equity factor investing is appealing for all risk-averse stock investors with a wide range of initial position and sufficiently low transactions costs by mixing multiple factor portfolios with high after-cost appraisal ratios, low mutual correlation, and negative exposures to the relevant host portfolios. These findings weaken the case for risk-based explanations for the profitability of factor investing. This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.

  abstract     = {This study presents unique empirical evidence on the importance of moral support for performance. We take advantage of an unusual change in Argentinean football legislation. In August 2013, as a matter of national security, the Argentinean government forced all teams in the first division to play their games with only home team supporters. Supporters of visiting teams were not allowed to be in stadiums during league games. We estimate the effect of this exogenous variation of supporters on team performance and find that visiting teams are on average about 20% more likely to lose without the presence of their supporters. As a counterfactual experiment, we run the analysis using contemporaneous cup games, where the visiting team supporters were allowed to attend, and find no effect of the ban on those games. Moreover, the ban does not seem to bias the decisions of referees, the lineups, or the market value of the teams, suggesting that the effect on team performance is due to the loss of moral support rather than other factors. Finally, we find that moral support is more relevant when there is equal power between the two teams, suggesting that moral support compensates the power of monetary resources. This paper provides a proof of concept of moral support as an important nonmonetary resource, even in settings with high monetary incentives.

  abstract     = {Whereas corporate insiders at U.S.-listed, U.S.-domiciled companies must disclose their stock sales electronically within two business days on Form 4, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) exempts insiders at U.S.-listed, foreign-domiciled companies from this requirement. Instead, these “foreign insiders” report their sales on a paper form mail-filed with the SEC. Using a unique data set compiled from digitized versions of thousands of paper forms, we examine the stock sales of foreign insiders and compare their trading to that of their U.S. counterparts. Consistent with a lack of public scrutiny facilitating opportunism, we show that foreign insiders’ stock sales are highly opportunistic and opportunistic trading is concentrated in companies that are domiciled in nonextradition countries beyond the reach of U.S. legal authorities: specifically, Russia and China. The average stock sale by foreign insiders affiliated with companies domiciled in these countries is more than four times larger than that of U.S. insiders and occurs prior to stock price declines of at least −18%. In our sample, we estimate that insiders at these companies have traded to avoid losses of more than $9 billion. Collectively, our results suggest that corporate insiders associated with Chinese and Russian companies listed on U.S. exchanges trade in a highly opportunistic and abusive manner. The SEC’s decision to exempt these insiders from Form 4 reporting requirements prevents much needed public scrutiny of their trading and, in turn, prevents market forces from disciplining their trading.

Exploiting cross-country variations in ETS implementations, we show that ETS adoption materially reduced greenhouse gas (carbon dioxide) emissions by 12.1% (18.1%). Moreover, ETSs reduced overall emissions by cutting the usage of fossil fuels such as coal by 23.70% while boosting the usage of renewable energy by 61.59%, on average. In contrast, introducing carbon taxes has a less effective impact on emissions reduction. It fails to boost the usage of renewable energy, though elevating tax rates and expanding tax coverage may help enhance the efficacy of carbon taxes.

We document significant economic benefits of digitization in increasing SMEs’ resilience against such a large shock, as seen through mitigated demand decline, sustainable cash flow, ability to quickly reopen, and positive outlook for growth. After the January 2020 lockdown, firm entries exhibited a V-shaped pattern, with entries of e-commerce firms experiencing a less pronounced immediate drop and a quicker rebound. Moreover, the pandemic has accelerated the digital transformation of existing firms and the industry in multiple dimensions (e.g., altering operation scope to include e-commerce, allowing remote work, and adopting electronic information systems). The effect persists more than one year after reopening, and it is more pronounced for certain sectors, firms in industrial clusters, and areas with more digital inclusion but less financial efficiency, constituting initial evidence for the long-term impact of the pandemic and the supposedly transitory mitigation policies.

An investment strategy long in high-UNC firms and short in low-UNC firms generates 8.5% annual risk-adjusted return.

  abstract     = {Although information design has recently received significant attention as a tool for shaping consumers’ purchase behavior, little is known about its use and implications in two-sided marketplaces, where both supply and demand consist of self-interested strategic agents. In this paper, we develop a model of a two-sided platform that facilitates transactions between vertically differentiated suppliers and consumers who differ in their quality preferences. We focus on illustrating the potential benefits of optimal information provision in managing the supply side of the marketplace, including the entry, exit, and pricing decisions of potential suppliers. We show that the revenue-optimal information provision policy often involves delaying the disclosure of information regarding the quality of the available suppliers. When the outside options available to consumers are relatively unattractive, we find that information design can help the platform achieve a more revenue-efficient matching between supply and demand. On the other hand, when consumers have access to attractive outside options, we show that information design can accelerate the discovery of high-quality suppliers, leading to an increase in the platform’s total transaction volume. Moreover, in cases where the platform benefits from commission subsidies to incentivize the entry of new suppliers, information design can be used to achieve the same goal while allowing the platform to earn higher commission revenue. Overall, our numerical experiments suggest that the impact of information design on platform revenue, as well as on consumer surplus, can be substantial.

  abstract     = {It is well documented that people have misperceptions about energy costs. However, there is mixed empirical evidence about the effectiveness of information provision and its persistence over time. Understanding the interplay between information regarding the private and social benefits of low-carbon technologies and identifying mechanisms through which information treatments affect people’s long-term behaviors can help reconcile the mixed findings in the literature. In this paper, we measured the long-term effects of information provision through online experiments involving more than 3,000 households in China. We provided people with information on low-carbon light bulbs’ monetary and climate benefits and observed their purchasing decisions over 10 months. We find that information on private or social benefits leads to a temporary effect on most households and a persistent one on the uninformed. This evidence suggests that information provision works through two different mechanisms: increasing saliency and filling the information gap.

  abstract     = {Gifts are important instruments for forming bonds in interpersonal relationships. Our study analyzes the phenomenon of gift contagion in online groups. Gift contagion encourages social bonds by prompting further gifts; it may also promote group interaction and solidarity. Using data on 36 million online red packet gifts on a large social site in East Asia, we leverage a natural experimental design to identify the social contagion of gift giving in online groups. Our natural experiment is enabled by the randomization of the gift amount allocation algorithm on the platform, which addresses the common challenge of causal identification in observational data. Our study provides evidence of gift contagion: On average, receiving one additional dollar causes a recipient to send 18 cents back to the group within the subsequent 24 hours. Decomposing this effect, we find that it is mainly driven by the extensive margin: more recipients are triggered to send red packets. Moreover, we find that this effect is stronger for “luckiest draw” recipients, suggesting the presence of a group norm regarding the next red packet sender. Finally, we investigate the moderating effects of group- and individual-level social network characteristics on gift contagion as well as the causal impact of receiving gifts on group network structure. Our study has implications for promoting group dynamics and designing marketing strategies for product adoption. This paper was accepted by Axel Ockenfels, behavioral economics and decision analysis.

  abstract     = {We study the relationship between ownership concentration and firm value using hand-collected data on the stakes of owner–managers before and after initial public offerings (IPOs). We instrument for the reduction in stake using market returns shortly before IPOs. Short-run market returns are plausible instruments because owners engage in market timing by selling more when prior returns are high, but high short-run returns are unlikely to directly affect firm value years after the IPO. As predicted by agency theory, a large reduction in ownership concentration at the IPO is negatively related to valuation. Future asset growth is low when owners have low stakes.

  abstract     = {We provide a game-theoretic analysis of the problem of front-running attacks. We use it to distinguish attacks from legitimate competition among honest users for having their transactions included earlier in the block. We also use it to introduce an intuitive notion of the severity of front-running attacks. We then study a simple commit-reveal protocol and discuss its properties. This protocol has costs because it requires two messages and imposes a delay. However, we show that it prevents the most severe front-running attacks while preserving legitimate competition between users, guaranteeing that the earliest transaction in a block belongs to the honest user who values it the most. When the protocol does not fully eliminate attacks, it nonetheless benefits honest users because it reduces competition among attackers (and overall expenditure by attackers).

We find the market reaction to insider-trading filings on FDICconnect is less timely than to those on SEC’s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system, suggesting FDICconnect generates higher information-processing costs. We also find only large investors trade more on insider-trading filings on FDICconnect than on insider-trading filings on SEC EDGAR, thus extracting benefits from the delayed market reaction to insider-trading filings on FDICconnect. Finally, we find increased insider selling in stand-alone banks prior to negative earnings news, suggesting insiders’ opportunistic use of private information.

  abstract     = {This study examines how equity market fragmentation affects firms’ capital investment decisions. Recent empirical research finds that market fragmentation lowers trading costs and thus improves market quality. We examine whether this increase in market quality translates into greater revelatory price efficiency, where stock prices reveal with greater precision information to managers and/or creditors about firms’ investment opportunities. Consistent with this notion, our findings reveal that the association between capital investment and investment opportunities is increasing in market fragmentation. Additional evidence suggests that (a) market fragmentation increases revelatory price efficiency at least in part by encouraging information acquisition and informed trade by equity investors and (b) the more efficient stock prices inform both managers and creditors about firms’ investment opportunities.

Labor market flexibility also increases the link between employee satisfaction and current valuation ratios, future profitability, and future earnings surprises, inconsistent with omitted risk factors and identifying channels through which employee satisfaction may affect stock returns.

  abstract     = {Weather risk affects the economy, agricultural production in particular. Index insurance is a promising tool to hedge against weather risk, but current piecewise-linear index insurance contracts face large basis risk and low demand. We propose embedding a neural network-based optimization scheme into an expected utility maximization problem to design the index insurance contract. Neural networks capture a highly nonlinear relationship between the high-dimensional weather variables and production losses. We endogenously solve for the optimal insurance premium and demand. This approach reduces basis risk, lowers insurance premiums, and improves farmers’ utility. This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.

  abstract     = {Acquisition announcements coincide with upward value revisions for the target firms’ technology peers, which are not due to economic relations based on product market, supply chain, or geographical location. Such a phenomenon is robust across subsample periods, not specific to merger or technology waves, and not related to product-market structure and the unique innovation features of certain technology-intensive industries. Firms experience more dramatic value revisions when they have deeper technology overlaps with their targets, are more dependent on technology, or when a transaction features higher premium or greater technology overlap between the acquirer and target. Our mechanism analysis provides evidence that is primarily consistent with the acquisition-probability hypothesis whereby acquisition announcements elevate expected technology synergies and merger prospects for peers and partially in line with the enhanced-investment hypothesis that peers’ revaluations correlate with increased technology investments. We do not find any evidence in line with the competition-balance hypothesis that attributes peers’ value revisions to the change in industrial competition intensity. Overall, our results demonstrate that acquisition announcements disseminate novel information about the value of technology that is of common interest among firms with close technologies.

As the platform-based P2P markets shift from their grassroots nature toward elite offerings, will differentiating suppliers by quality increase matching performance? Can P2P markets differentiate certain suppliers without marginalizing others? We seek answers to these questions by leveraging an empirical opportunity on Airbnb, which differentiates listings that meet high quality standards from others through its Plus program in several U.S. cities. Our findings are threefold. First, we find a sizable increase in market-level matching performance after the program launch, that is, a 15.8%–16.2% increase in the number of booked nights. Second, the rise in matching performance is attributed to reduced search frictions, evident in markets with higher discovery and evaluation costs. Third, the Plus program benefits all listing tiers through reduced search frictions, yielding the most benefits to the Plus and non-Plus listings in terms of increased bookings and prices. Regular listings also receive increased bookings because of competitive prices. Our findings hold across multiple robustness checks and offer important insights for platform design and supply management in P2P markets.

  abstract     = {People tasked with replacing a departing group member are disproportionately likely to choose a replacement with the same demographic identity, leading to demographic “stickiness” in group composition. We examine this effect in 2,163 U.S. federal judge appointments over 75 years, in the selection of 5,616 S&amp;P 1500 board directors from 2014 to 2019, and in four preregistered experiments ( n = 2,900). The patterns we document are generally consistent with both impact aversion (desires to minimize changes to group composition and dynamics) and diversity loss aversion (outsized concerns about losing ground on demographic diversity relative to interests in gaining ground). Ultimately, our results suggest that replacement decisions are influenced by loss-averse preferences regarding the demographic identities of departing group members. The propensity to choose new group members based on whether they demographically resemble their predecessors suggests that once progress toward diversification has occurred, it should be “sticky,” so backsliding is less likely than might otherwise be expected. An optimistic outlook is that one-time interventions to change group composition may have a lasting impact, and change agents committed to diversification may have enduring effects on equality beyond their tenure.

  abstract     = {Because a hospital is an interconnected, interdependent network of care units, allocating resources—beds, nurses, and improvement initiatives—to one unit to reduce its congestion may have spillover effects on other units. If such congestion spillover is substantial, ignoring it may lead to unintended consequences and missed opportunities. We use data collected over five years from a hospital with 16 inpatient units to empirically examine whether and how much congestion propagates through the network of inpatient units. Our estimation result suggests that the magnitude of the congestion spillover is indeed substantial in our study hospital. For example, increasing one inpatient unit’s utilization by 10 percentage points today can increase its neighboring inpatient unit’s utilization by up to 4.33 percentage points tomorrow. Using counterfactual analyses, we estimate the effect of adding a bed to each unit. We find that due to congestion spillover, adding one bed to the bottleneck unit can free up 4.14 beds in the hospital, which translates to 383.53 more hospital visits per year or a 3% increase in hospital throughput. This effect is about three times bigger in magnitude compared with what one can achieve by naively choosing which unit to add a bed to. Hospitals and other manufacturing and service systems with complex interdependence across resources can use our empirical framework to examine the spillover effect of resources on performance metrics and leverage such understanding to effectively improve their operations.

  abstract     = {We consider the role of personalized pricing (PP) on product differentiation when PP is costly to implement. Using a stylized yet commonly used formulation, we find that when firms decide on positioning before deciding on PP implementation, PP implementation cost affects not only the amount of differentiation firms choose in their positioning, firm profits, consumer surplus, and social welfare, but also whether firms implement PP. When PP implementation cost is low, firms cannot help but to implement PP and engage in direct price competition. Moreover, firms implementing PP reduce their differentiation, further intensifying price competition, and are worse off. When PP implementation cost is moderate, firms position to reduce their differentiation to commit to not implementing PP, again aggravating price competition. In contrast, when PP implementation cost is higher, firms increase their differentiation due to the threat of PP but do not implement PP. As a result, the availability of PP improves firm profits, even though firms do not implement PP. However, if differentiation is restricted, then PP availability cannot improve firm profits. If an information seller sets the PP implementation cost, then it sets the cost low. Consequently, firms implement PP and are worse off. We also find that when firms decide whether to implement PP before deciding on positioning, they never implement PP. This is the case when PP implementation is complex, and differentiation can be affected by short-run advertising and promotion. Finally, we show that banning PP can benefit consumers when accounting for changes in firm positioning. This paper was accepted by D. J. Wu, information systems.

  abstract     = {We document evidence that firms systematically increase specialized, locally targeted advertising following the firm being taken to trial in that given location, precisely following initiation of the suit. In particular, we use legal actions brought against publicly traded firms over the 20-year sample period that progress to trial between 1995 and 2014. In terms of magnitude, the increase is sizable: targeted local advertising increases by 23% ( t = 4.37) following the suit. They focus their advertisement spikes specifically toward jury trials, and in fact specifically toward the most likely jury pool.

  abstract     = {The core premise of permissionless blockchains is their reliable and secure operation without the need to trust any individual agent. At the heart of blockchain consensus mechanisms is an explicit cost (e.g., mining cost) for participation in the network and the opportunity to add blocks to the blockchain. A key rationale for that cost is to make attacks on the network, which could be theoretically carried out if a majority of nodes were controlled by a single entity, too expensive to be worthwhile. We demonstrate that a majority attacker can successfully attack with a negative net cost when accounting for the mining rewards the attacker collects during the attack. This shows that the protocol mechanisms are insufficient to create a secure network, emphasizing the importance of socially driven mechanisms external to the protocol. At the same time, negative cost enables a new type of majority attack that is more likely to elude external scrutiny. This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, finance.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the market consequences of sovereign accounting errors, opening a new area of research on sovereign accounting quality in the accounting literature. Eurostat, a division of the European Commission, provides semiannual assessments of financial reports produced by the member states of the European Union (EU) and issues reservations that detail financial reporting errors. Using a sample of Eurostat reservation issuances across 28 EU countries from 2004 to 2018, we find that sovereign bond yields abnormally increase during a reservation announcement window, especially when a reservation explicitly mentions deficit or debt, when it quantifies the extent of the errors’ financial impact, or when the errors relate to recent fiscal data. Consistent with a home bias after the release of negative news, we find that domestic holdings of sovereign debt increase after the issuance of a reservation. Overall, our evidence suggests that sovereign accounting errors have significant market consequences and raises further questions for future research in sovereign accounting quality.

  abstract     = {For a large class of demand models that allow for multiple consumer types, we present performance guarantees for simple nonpersonalized pricing heuristics relative to optimal personalized pricing. Our results demonstrate that in a general setting, the effectiveness of pricing along a positive vector depends on how the price vector aligns with optimal personalized price vectors. We propose two positive direction vectors: the “economic” and “robust” directions. The economic direction is a convex combination of the optimal personalized price vectors and aims to do well on average. The robust direction offers the best worst-case performance guarantee. By judiciously selecting pricing directions, our results also provide performance guarantees of simple pricing strategies relative to more sophisticated pricing strategies. In particular, we provide performance guarantees for nonpersonalized, optimal linear pricing relative to optimal nonlinear, personalized pricing. Our research also examines the performance of common heuristics for bundle pricing relative to optimal, personalized, bundle-size pricing. Our experiments show that performance often improves when consumer types are clustered and each cluster is offered a price direction. We compared the performance of the k -means clustering heuristic and the farthest point first clustering heuristic. Our findings indicated that k -means clustering has significantly superior performance on average. This suggests that businesses could potentially benefit from implementing k -means clustering in their pricing strategies. In conclusion, our study offers valuable insights and performance guarantees for various pricing strategies and their relative effectiveness. These findings could inform pricing decisions and potentially lead to improved outcomes for firms. This paper was accepted by Chung-Piaw Teo, optimization.

The impact of discrimination is concentrated among racial/ethnic minorities, inducing 12%–16% greater variation in their income uncertainty expectations and 10%–12% greater variation in their inflation uncertainty expectations.

  abstract     = {Major banks around the world lost nearly $210 billion during the period of 2011–2016 due to operational risk events. To mitigate the severe consequences that can arise from such events, the Basel Regulatory Committee has mandated that financial institutions worldwide conduct inspections on operational risk. In light of the importance of operational risk and its current regulation in the industry, this paper proposes a continuous-time principal-agent model that explores the optimal inspection policy of a financial firm (principal) and the effort of its employees (agent) to reduce the occurrence of risk events. First, we characterize the optimal inspection strategy under two commonly used policies in practice, namely random and periodic policies. This characterization reveals the conditions for two different modes of inspection (effort inducement and error correction), as well as the nuanced interactions among the inspection frequency, the penalty charged for errors, and the wage paid to employees. Next, by comparing random and periodic policies, we find that the random policy outperforms the periodic policy if and only if the inspection cost is high. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid policy that strictly dominates the random policy and weakly dominates the periodic policy, suggesting that a proper reduction of the random element in the inspection policy, in the manner of our proposed hybrid policy, can always improve its performance. Finally, we examine the complete information benchmark (without moral hazard), supplemental mitigation strategies, and numerical studies to provide further insights and show the robustness of our main findings.

  abstract     = {Experimentation is prevalent in online marketplaces and social networks to assess the effectiveness of new market intervention. To mitigate the interference among users in an experiment, a common practice is to use a cluster-based experiment, where the designer partitions the market into loosely connected clusters and assigns all users in the same cluster to the same variant (treatment or control). Given the experiment, we assume an unbiased Horvitz–Thompson estimator is used to estimate the total market effect of the treatment. We consider the optimization problem of choosing (correlated) randomized assignments of clusters to treatment and control to minimize the worst-case variance of the estimator under a constraint that the marginal assignment probability is q ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) for all clusters. This problem can be formulated as a linear program where both the number of decision variables and constraints are exponential in the number of clusters—and hence is generally computationally intractable. We develop a family of practical experiments that we refer to as independent block randomization (IBR) experiments. Such an experiment partitions clusters into blocks so that each block contains clusters of similar size. It then treats a fraction q of the clusters in each block (chosen uniformly at random) and does so independently across blocks. The optimal cluster partition can be obtained in a tractable way using dynamic programming. We show that these policies are asymptotically optimal when the number of clusters grows large and no cluster size dominates the rest. In the special case where cluster sizes take values in a finite set and the number of clusters of each size is a fixed proportion of the total number of clusters, the loss is only a constant that is independent of the number of clusters. Beyond the asymptotic regime, we show that the IBR experiment has a good approximation for any problem instance when q is not very tiny. We also examine the performance of the IBR experiments on data-driven numerical examples, including examples based on Airbnb and Facebook data.

  abstract     = {We propose a monopoly and Stackelberg duopoly model for “new economy” markets—with a Beckerian S-shaped demand curve at its center—that allows for intermediate degrees of firm focality and consumer heterogeneity. Because of network externalities, firms compete for the dominant market share, rather than the marginal consumer. This leads to a type of limit pricing—from within, rather than from outside the market—where the nondominant firm captures a positive market share that serves as a consolation prize. We characterize how firms’ technologies, “consumer impulses” (which might be influenced by past sales, defaults, or advertising), and network externalities affect competition, and derive implications for firm strategy. Broadly speaking, we find that the dominant firm should adopt an aggressive “top-dog” stance (akin to, but not identical to, that of a firm seeking to deter rival entry), whereas the nondominant firm should respond with an accommodating “puppy-dog” approach.

Following minimalist market design , an institution design paradigm that integrates research and policy efforts, we formulate pandemic allocation of scarce life-saving resources as a new application of market design. Interfering only with the restrictive feature of the priority system to address its shortcomings, we formulate a reserve system as an alternative allocation rule.

  abstract     = {We study structured multiarmed bandits, which is the problem of online decision-making under uncertainty in the presence of structural information. In this problem, the decision-maker needs to discover the best course of action despite observing only uncertain rewards over time. The decision-maker is aware of certain convex structural information regarding the reward distributions; that is, the decision-maker knows that the reward distributions of the arms belong to a convex compact set. In the presence of such structural information, the decision-maker then would like to minimize his or her regret by exploiting this information, where the regret is its performance difference against a benchmark policy that knows the best action ahead of time. In the absence of structural information, the classical upper confidence bound (UCB) and Thomson sampling algorithms are well known to suffer minimal regret. However, as recently pointed out by Russo and Van Roy (2018) and Lattimore and Szepesvari (2017) , neither algorithm is capable of exploiting structural information that is commonly available in practice. We propose a novel learning algorithm that we call “DUSA,” whose regret matches the information-theoretic regret lower bound up to a constant factor and can handle a wide range of structural information. Our algorithm DUSA solves a dual counterpart of the regret lower bound at the empirical reward distribution and follows its suggested play. We show that this idea leads to the first computationally viable learning policy with asymptotic minimal regret for various structural information, including well-known structured bandits such as linear, Lipschitz, and convex bandits and novel structured bandits that have not been studied in the literature because of the lack of a unified and flexible framework.

  abstract     = {Trialing an experience good allows consumers to learn their value for the sampled good and also informs beliefs about their value for similar products. These demand-side information spillovers across products create a relatively well-informed group of potential future consumers for rival firms. When both switching consumers and repeat buyers are profitable, firms face reduced incentives to set a low initial price to attract inexperienced consumers. Switchers and repeat buyers are more likely to be profitable in new product categories that build on major innovations and when firms can price discriminate based on purchasing history. We suggest that competing products and services arising from new innovations often have demand-side information spillovers from any product trial and are, hence, settings where competing firms can make overall profits even when selling products that consumers perceive to be indistinguishable prior to initial trial.

  abstract     = {Despite mixed evidence for the relationship between demographic diversity and creativity, we propose that observers hold a lay belief that demographic diversity increases creativity and apply this lay belief in judgments about teams and their creative work. Across eight preregistered studies ( n = 5,530), we find that observers judge teams diverse in terms of race and gender to be more creative than teams homogeneous in terms of race and gender, including in incentive-compatible predictions made about real teams competing in a creativity challenge. We also find that products attributed to demographically diverse teams are evaluated as more creative compared with identical products attributed to demographically homogenous teams. Mediation analyses provide evidence consistent with the notion that people perceive demographic diversity (i.e., social category differences) to be correlated with cognitive diversity (i.e., difference of perspectives), and this belief contributes to attributions of greater creativity to diverse teams and the ideas they generate. We can also turn off the perceived association between demographic diversity and creativity by directly manipulating people’s perceptions of team cognitive diversity. Furthermore, we find evidence of a curvilinear relationship between the proportion of racial minorities or women in a group and judgments of the group’s creativity. Together, our results suggest that the popular uptake of the belief that diversity boosts creativity may impact how creativity is identified in organizational contexts.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates how organizational misconduct is perpetuated through intergenerational transmission. We theorize that early exposure to a subculture of misconduct imprints newcomers with the belief that misconduct is normal, which is then carried by these individuals into managerial positions and passed down to their subordinates. We test this using longitudinal administrative data from the Chicago Police Department from 1980 to 2017. We exploit a lottery that assigns applicants to training cohorts to demonstrate that officers exposed early on to a subculture of misconduct not only engage in more misconduct over their entire careers, but also increase the misconduct of their subordinates after they become managers. We also find that this intergenerational dynamic is stronger when subordinate officers were exposed to a subculture of misconduct themselves, are earlier in their tenure, and have not yet received their annual review from their manager. Taken together, these findings reveal a bottom-up dynamic whereby beliefs about misconduct are developed in an organization’s lowest ranks, carried by these individuals over time, and passed down to future generations. This study expands our understanding of how organizational misconduct is perpetuated as well as offers important policy implications for addressing the problem of police misconduct.

  abstract     = {Decision makers often want to target interventions so as to maximize an outcome that is observed only in the long term. This typically requires delaying decisions until the outcome is observed or relying on simple short-term proxies for the long-term outcome. Here, we build on the statistical surrogacy and policy learning literatures to impute the missing long-term outcomes and then approximate the optimal targeting policy on the imputed outcomes via a doubly robust approach. We first show that conditions for the validity of average treatment effect estimation with imputed outcomes are also sufficient for valid policy evaluation and optimization; furthermore, these conditions can be somewhat relaxed for policy optimization. We apply our approach in two large-scale proactive churn management experiments at The Boston Globe by targeting optimal discounts to its digital subscribers with the aim of maximizing long-term revenue. Using the first experiment, we evaluate this approach empirically by comparing the policy learned using imputed outcomes with a policy learned on the ground-truth, long-term outcomes. The performance of these two policies is statistically indistinguishable, and we rule out large losses from relying on surrogates. Our approach also outperforms a policy learned on short-term proxies for the long-term outcome. In a second field experiment, we implement the optimal targeting policy with additional randomized exploration, which allows us to update the optimal policy for future subscribers. Over three years, our approach had a net-positive revenue impact in the range of $4–$5 million compared with the status quo. This paper was accepted by Eric Anderson, marketing.

  abstract     = {Compared with existing payment systems, Bitcoin’s throughput is low. Designed to address Bitcoin’s scalability challenge, the Lightning Network (LN) is a protocol allowing two parties to secure bitcoin payments and escrow holdings between them. In a lightning channel, each party commits collateral toward future payments to the counterparty and payments are cryptographically secured updates of collaterals. The network of channels increases transaction speed and reduces blockchain congestion. This paper (i) identifies conditions for two parties to optimally establish a channel, (ii) finds explicit formulas for channel costs, (iii) obtains the optimal collaterals and savings entailed, and (iv) derives the implied reduction in congestion of the blockchain. Unidirectional channels costs grow with the square-root of payment rates, while symmetric bidirectional channels with their cubic root. Asymmetric bidirectional channels are akin to unidirectional when payment rates are significantly different, otherwise to symmetric bidirectional.

  abstract     = {We study a courier dispatching problem in an on-demand delivery system in which customers are sensitive to delay. Specifically, we evaluate the effect of temporal pooling by comparing systems using the dedicated strategy, with which only one order is delivered per trip, versus the pooling strategy, with which a batch of consecutive orders is delivered on each trip. We capture the courier delivery system’s spatial dimension by assuming that, following a Poisson process, demand arises at a uniformly generated point within a service region. With the same objective of revenue maximization, we find that the dispatching strategy depends critically on customers’ patience level, the size of the service region, and whether the firm can endogenize the demand. We obtain concise but informative results with a single courier and assuming that customers’ underlying arrival rate is large enough, meaning a crowded market, such as rush hour delivery. In particular, when the firm has a growth target and needs to achieve an exogenously given demand rate, using the pooling strategy is optimal if the service area is large enough to fully exploit the pooling efficiency in delivery. Otherwise, using the dedicated strategy is optimal. In contrast, if the firm can endogenize the demand rate by varying the delivery fee, using the dedicated strategy is optimal for a large service area. The reason is that it is optimal for the firm to sustain a relatively low demand rate by charging a high fee for a large service radius: within this large area, the pooling strategy leads to a long wait because it takes a long time for multiple orders to accumulate. Moreover, with an exogenous demand rate to meet, customers’ patience level has no impact on the dispatch strategy. However, when the demand rate can be endogenized, the dedicated strategy is preferable if customers are impatient. Furthermore, we extend our model to account for social welfare maximization, a hybrid contingent delivery policy, a general arrival rate that does not have to be large, a nonuniform distribution of orders in the service region, and multiple couriers. We also conduct numerical analysis and simulations to complement our main results and find that most insights in our base model still hold in these extensions and numerical studies.

  abstract     = {The Hospital Value-Based Purchasing (VBP) Program is Medicare’s implementation of yardstick incentives applied to hospitals in the United States. Under the VBP Program, 2% of all Medicare payments to hospitals, estimated to be U.S. $1.9 billion in fiscal year 2021, are withheld and redistributed based on their relative performance in the quality of delivered care. We develop a dynamic mean-field equilibrium model in which hospitals are engaged in repeated competition under yardstick incentives. Using structural estimation methods, we recover key parameters that govern hospitals’ decisions to invest in quality improvement, including the financial and nonfinancial costs and uncertain outcomes of investment. By dynamically solving for hospitals’ individually optimal investment policies, we estimate the trajectory of quality improvements for each hospital, including its investment decisions and quality levels throughout the implementation of the VBP Program. Our counterfactual analyses explore the benefits, on the one hand, of modifying the overall size of the yardstick incentives and on the other hand, of implementing a more focused program tailored to hospital type. We find that increasing the size of the incentives from 2% to 4% would have resulted in an additional quality investment of U.S. $1.2 billion from 2011 to 2018, leading to a 3.3% reduction in the average rate of central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs). Applying yardstick incentives to the tailored hospital peer groups, even without changing the size of the incentives, can lead to an average reduction of 1.4% in the rate of CLABSI among groups of hospitals associated with the highest costs of quality investment.

  abstract     = {We deal with the problem of managing a project or a complex operational process by controlling the execution pace of the activities it comprises. We consider a setting in which these activities are clearly defined, are subject to precedence constraints, and progress randomly. We formulate a discrete-time, infinite-horizon Markov decision process in which the manager reviews progress in each period and decides which activities to expedite to balance expediting costs with delay costs. We derive structural properties for this dynamic project expediting problem. These enable us then to devise exact solution methods that we show to reduce computational burden significantly. We illustrate how our method generalizes and can be used to tackle a wide range of so-called stochastic shortest-path problems that are characterized by an intuitive property and can capture other applications, including medical decision-making and disease-modeling problems. Moreover, we also deal with the state identification issue for our problem, which is a challenging task in and of itself, owing to precedence constraints. We complement our analytical results with numerical experiments, demonstrating that both our solution and state identification methods significantly outperform extant methods for a supply chain example and for various randomly generated instances.

  abstract     = {Marketing researchers are often interested in estimating causal effects when a randomized experiment is infeasible. The synthetic control (SC) method has emerged as a powerful tool in these quasiexperimental settings. It is important to verify the SC parallel pretrends assumption, the testable part of the identifying assumption, because its violation may lead to biased estimates. However, no formal test exists, so researchers have to rely on visual inspection. Even with a formal test, researchers still need to know how to balance the bias-efficiency trade-off for the estimate. We fill this void and advance the two-step synthetic control (TSSC) approach that comprises a formal test for the SC pretrends assumption in the first step and recommends an appropriate method that balances the dual goal of reducing bias and increasing efficiency in the second step. Simulations show that the TSSC approach performs favorably in the bias-variance (bias-efficiency) trade-off. Applying the TSSC approach, we find that New York State’s repeal of the tampon tax caused a positive and significant (2.08%) increase in weekly tampon sales. Using theory, simulations, and empirics, we demonstrate the importance, validity, and usefulness of the TSSC approach. This paper was accepted by Matthew Shum, marketing.

  abstract     = {We explore the nature and robustness of the attraction effect. The attraction effect can be seen as a persistent bias or as the result of heuristics that may not persist upon reflection. We provide robust experimental evidence that the attraction effect first rises and then falls over time when participants are incentivized to make a quick choice they can later revise. Participants in two experiments under continuous time pressure make choices among options with the aim to maximize an objective, measurable value. We find that participants disproportionately favor the asymmetrically dominant option in the first seconds and then revise their choices until the effect disappears or is significantly reduced. The effect survives only in the special and often studied case of indifference among options. We develop a tractable extension to the multiattribute linear ballistic accumulator model to allow for choice revisions. That model explains how choice revisions reduce context effects. We estimate its parameters at the individual level and document differences between fast and slow participants that also play a role in explaining the rise-and-fall pattern in the attraction effect. We extend the analysis to similarity and compromise effects. We find a very small similarity effect, which does not exhibit any dynamics, and a significant reverse compromise effect displaying a rise-and-fall pattern. Our findings, although limited to objective-value tasks, are consistent with context effects being short-term heuristics that can be superseded by more reflective cognitive strategies when decision makers have time and incentive to do so.

  abstract     = {Several features of automotive procurement distinguish it from the prototypical supply chain in the academic literature: pass-through pricing that reimburses suppliers for raw material costs, market frictions that prohibit cost transparency and imbue suppliers with pricing power, and contractual commitments that span multiple production periods. In this context, we formalize a procurement model by considering an automaker that buys components from an upstream supplier to assemble cars over several production periods in an environment where period demands and raw material costs are both stochastic. Our paper clarifies how information asymmetry and market factors that amplify or weaken this asymmetry affect the firms’ procurement protocol preferences. Then, using proprietary contract and supplier data from BMW, we empirically validate this model and show that it reflects BMW’s reality: the factors that should theoretically go into automotive procurement decisions do so. Our analysis also reveals that existing contracting protocols in this context are not optimal for procurement under asymmetric information, and so we propose an alternative contracting method. We calibrate our model and estimate an automaker’s performance improvement from this optimal contract over the status quo. This paper was accepted by Vishal Gaur, operations management.

  abstract     = {Classic inventory theory suggests that inventory plays a vital role in matching demand and supply. This paper provides both country- and firm-level evidence that inventory can be used as a financial instrument to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities in financial markets with limited capital mobility. Using data from China customs’ metal imports and firm-level inventory from metal processing industries, we show that firms can utilize the inventory of an imported product to carry lower cost capital into a country with strict capital controls and, thus, gain higher financial returns. Specifically, at the country level, we find that the level of imported metal commodities is positively associated with the expected returns from financial arbitrage. At the firm level, we find that a higher expected return from financial arbitrage will incentivize a firm to increase its inventory level through short-term borrowing. In addition, our evidence supports the notion that firms with higher liquidation value, larger size, and higher sales growth (i.e., firms with higher borrowing capacity) may be more active in using inventory as an instrument to seek higher financial gains. We also utilize a unique regulatory policy shock as a quasi-natural experiment to enhance the causality interpretation of our empirical findings.

  abstract     = {Early stage technology startups rely critically on talented scientists and engineers to commercialize new technologies. And yet these startups compete with established technology firms to hire the best workers. Theories of ability sorting predict that high-ability workers will choose jobs in established firms that offer greater complementary assets and higher pay, leaving low-ability workers to take lower paying and riskier jobs in startups. We propose an alternative view in which heterogeneity in both worker ability and preferences enable startups to hire talented workers who have a taste for a startup work environment even at lower pay. Using a longitudinal survey that follows 2,394 science and engineering PhDs from graduate school into their first industrial employment, we overcome common empirical challenges by observing ability and stated preferences prior to entry into the labor market. We find that both ability and career preferences strongly predict startup employment with high-ability workers who prefer startup employment being the most likely to work in a startup. We show that this partly reflects dual selection effects whereby worker preferences result in a large pool of startup job applicants and startups make job offers to the most talented workers. Additional analyses confirm that startup employees earn approximately 17% lower pay. This gap is greatest for high-ability workers and persists over workers’ early careers, suggesting that they accept a negative compensating differential in exchange for the nonpecuniary benefits of startup employment. Data on job attributes and stated reasons for job choice further support this interpretation. This paper was accepted by Toby Stuart, entrepreneurship and innovation.

We present empirical evidence that marketable pieces of large parent orders are routed to ELPs seemingly to avoid paying liquidity fees on exchanges. This routing decision results in lower net effective spreads for these child orders but leads to higher execution shortfall for the parent order. We provide evidence suggestive of a causal relation by utilizing the parent orders of investors that disallow the broker to route their child orders to ELPs. Our analysis suggests that ELPs detect the presence of the parent order very quickly given the transparent bilateral relation with the broker. This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.

  abstract     = {Fragmenting clearing across multiple central counterparties (CCPs) is costly because global dealers cannot net positions across CCPs. They have to collateralize both the short position in one CCP and an offsetting long position in another CCP. This, coupled with a structural net order imbalance across CCPs, can cause prices to persistently differ across them (“the CCP basis”). Tests based on unique CCP data for interest-rate derivatives (IRDs) yield broad empirical support for this intuition and suggest that the clearing friction costs sellers clearing in LCH, the largest European CCP for IRDs, $80 million daily.

This paper builds a semistructural, cross-sectional option pricing model to separate the structural risk contributions from the information flow. The model identifies two structural risk sources that contribute to the cross-sectional variation of the skew: the company’s business cyclicality and its default risk. The model can explain as much as 44% of the cross-sectional variation in implied volatility skew and is particularly informative during and after recessions. The remaining skew variation reflects mainly short-term information flow and can be used to construct stock portfolios with much better investment performance and without hidden structural risk exposures.

Our approach yields a formalized, scale-free, and interpretable measure of deterrence motives that informs researchers about the proportion for which deterrence motives account of all entry motives. In addition, the decomposition leads to a set of conditions for counterfactual analysis where hypothetical scenarios with deterrence motives eliminated can be explored. We illustrate the use of our measure and counterfactual by conducting an empirical case study about the dynamics of coffee chain stores in Toronto, Canada. The inferred deterrence motives suggest that a noticeable proportion of entry motives can be attributed to deterrence; it can be as high as 43% for the increasingly dominant coffee chain, Starbucks, in certain types of markets. Finally, counterfactual analysis confirms that deterrence motives are indeed associated with Starbucks’ aggressive presence as the number of its outlets and its market share are markedly lower once these motives are eliminated.

In a within-subject laboratory experiment, decision makers make competition entry decisions for both themselves and a randomly selected other. Although we replicate the standard gender gap in decisions for oneself, we do not find a gender gap when the decision to compete is made by someone else. This is driven by men being significantly more willing to enter themselves than others into competitions. Men’s and women’s willingness to enter others into competitions is statistically indistinguishable from women’s willingness to enter themselves into competitions.

This paper proposes a model-free method to measure degrees of intertemporal correlation aversion. We disentangle attitudes toward positive and negative intertemporal correlation, which can differ if expected intertemporal utility is violated. In an experiment, subjects on average exhibited correlation aversion both for lotteries with positive correlation and for lotteries with negative correlation. That is, they disliked positive correlations and liked negative correlations. At the individual level, we found heterogeneity and remarkably, many subjects being insensitive to intertemporal correlations. Moreover, for most subjects, expected intertemporal utility was violated because attitudes toward positive and negative correlation differed.

  abstract     = {Connected healthcare is a form of health delivery that connects patients and providers through connected health devices, allowing providers to monitor patient behavior and proactively intervene before an adverse event occurs. Unlike the costs, the benefits of connected healthcare in improving patient behavior and health outcomes are usually difficult to determine. In this study, we examine the efficacy of a connected health system that aimed to reduce readmissions through improved medication adherence. Specifically, we study 975 patients with heart disease who received electronic pill bottles that tracked medication adherence. Patients who were nonadherent received active social support that involved different types of feedback, such as text messages and calls. By integrating data on adherence, intervention, and readmission, we aim to (1) investigate the efficacy of connected healthcare in promoting medication adherence, (2) examine the relationship between medication adherence and readmission, and (3) develop a dynamic readmission risk-scoring model that considers medication adherence and use the model to better target nonadherent patients. Our findings suggest that patients are more likely to become adherent when they or their partners receive high levels of intervention that involve personalized feedback and when the intervention is escalated quickly and consistently. We also find that long-term adherence to three common heart medications is strongly associated with reduced readmission risk. Lastly, using counterfactual simulation, we apply the dynamic readmission risk-scoring model to our setting and find that, when using an intervention strategy that prioritizes high-risk patients, we obtain 10% fewer readmissions while using the same effort level from the patient support team.

  abstract     = {Consumers encounter costs and inconvenience in the purchase and consumption of goods. Time, effort, training, and expertise, also referred to as access costs, are examples of factors that constrain the ability of consumers to derive utility from offerings beyond the price of a good. Economies of scope exist when household production of these factors share commonalities among choice alternatives, making it more likely that some products would be purchased and consumed in conjunction with others. For example, consumers planning out-of-town travel might consider visiting multiple tourist attractions during their trip, and course offerings might appeal more to students who are already in the mindset of taking courses. We develop a model with economies of scope that captures a leveraging effect where the purchase of one good makes the purchase of other goods more likely. Our model offers an alternative explanation of complementary purchases that are driven by cost reductions rather than utility enhancements. The model is applied to four conjoint datasets where we find that economies of scope and access costs play an important role in consumer purchases and have high economic value relative to the role played by price.

  abstract     = {Emotional involvement is known to be necessary but not sufficient for good decision making in the face of uncertainty. It has been conjectured that emotional engagement in anticipation of risky outcomes constitutes “good” emotions. We introduce a new methodology to determine whether anticipatory emotional engagement is beneficial in the context of trading in financial markets. We focus on heart rate changes because they occur at a sufficiently high frequency to discern timing relative to events in the marketplace. After conservatively adjusting for multiple hypothesis testing, we find that participants whose heart rate changes anticipate their order submissions at inflated prices earn significantly more, whereas participants whose heart rate responds to their trades earn significantly less. By investigating cointegration between skin conductance response and the dynamics of individual portfolio values, we confirm the importance of emotional involvement in determining who makes or loses money.

  abstract     = {We study the classic model of joint pricing and inventory control with lost sales over T consecutive review periods. The firm does not know the demand distribution a priori and needs to learn it from historical censored demand data. We develop nonparametric online learning algorithms that converge to the clairvoyant optimal policy at the fastest possible speed. The fundamental challenges rely on that neither zeroth-order nor first-order feedbacks are accessible to the firm and reward at any single price is not observable due to demand censoring. We propose a novel inversion method based on empirical measures to consistently estimate the difference of the instantaneous reward functions at two prices , directly tackling the fundamental challenge brought by censored demands. Based on this technical innovation, we design bisection and trisection search methods that attain an O ˜ ( T ) regret for the case with concave reward functions, and we design an active tournament elimination method that attains O ˜ ( T 3 / 5 ) regret when the reward functions are nonconcave. We complement the O ˜ ( T 3 / 5 ) regret upper bound with a matching Ω ˜ ( T 3 / 5 ) regret lower bound. The lower bound is established by a novel information-theoretical argument based on generalized squared Hellinger distance, which is significantly different from conventional arguments that are based on Kullback-Leibler divergence. Both the upper bound technique based on the “difference estimator” and the lower bound technique based on generalized Hellinger distance are new in the literature, and can be potentially applied to solve other inventory or censored demand type problems that involve learning.

Following supervisory rating downgrades, banks decrease credit commitments and downgrade internal risk assessments. Borrowers face larger commitment reductions whenever banks have low ex ante screening and monitoring incentives or whenever examiners’ assessments contain more information than banks’ assessments, suggesting that examinations complement bank monitoring.

  abstract     = {Little is known about how people-centric factors affect the shape of service time distributions despite distributional statistics (variance or quantiles) being key drivers of system performance in many service industries. We investigate the impact of one people-centric factor— worker fatigue —on the average, variance, and quantiles of service times in paramedic operations. Our analysis uses data on the performance of 368,634 paramedic teams in the London Ambulance Service over 10 years. We measure fatigue by the number of prior jobs a paramedic crew has completed during a shift and estimate its impact on the time it takes the crew to respond to incidents and bring patients to hospitals. Using a recentered influence function regression approach with multiple fixed effects, we find that the average time to hospital increases by 5% throughout the course of an average shift. In addition, the workers become less consistent with fatigue; service time variance increases by 39% during a normal shift. Furthermore, we find that in addition to an upward shift in mean service times, both the upper and lower tails of the distribution have more weight for fatigued paramedics. These effects are driven mostly by the performance of paramedics at the scene, rather than their driving to or from the incident. The distributional effects of fatigue are only slightly mitigated by increased experience or reduced system workload. Our work demonstrates that the impact of people-centric factors can be highly nonuniform across the service time distribution.

  abstract     = {We examine the impact of government interventions on the spread of COVID-19 and consumer spending. We do this by first estimating models of COVID-19 spread, consumer spending, and social distancing in the United States during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Social distancing has a large effect on reducing COVID-19 spread and is responsive to national and local case numbers. Nonmask government interventions reduce COVID-19 spread, whereas the effectiveness of mask mandates is much smaller and statistically insignificant. Mask mandates tend to increase social distancing, as do nonmask governmental restrictions as a whole. Social distancing hurts spending in the absence of a mask mandate but has a negligible effect on spending if there is a mask mandate. Mask mandates have a direct effect of increasing spending in counties with high levels of social distancing while reducing spending in counties with low levels of social distancing. We use these three estimated models to calculate the effect of mask mandates and other governmental interventions on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and consumer spending. Implemented mask mandates decreased COVID-19 cases by a statistically insignificant 774,000 cases, saving 28,000 lives, over a four-month period, but led to $76B–$155B of additional consumer spending. Other nonmask governmental interventions that were implemented reduced the number of COVID-19 cases by 34M, saving 1,230,000 lives, while reducing consumer spending by approximately $470B–$703B over our 4-month period of the study. Thus, these restrictions were cost effective as long as one values each saved life at $387,000–$608,000 or more. This paper was accepted by Matt Shum, marketing.

Forty-five percent of the experts expressed willingness to contribute in the baseline condition, whereas 51% (a 13% increase over the baseline) expressed interest when they received a signal that an article matched their expertise. However, none of the treatments had a significant effect on actual contributions. Instead experts contributed longer and better comments when the actual match between a recommended Wikipedia article and an expert&#39;s expertise, measured by cosine similarity, was higher, when they had higher reputation, and when the original article was longer.

  abstract     = {Companies that are investing in blockchain technology to enhance supply chain transparency face challenges in fostering collaborations with others and deciding what information to share. Transparency over the actions of supply chain partners can improve operational decisions, but sharing own data on the blockchain can put firms at a competitive disadvantage. In this paper, we investigate the resulting questions of when blockchain should be adopted in a supply chain and how it should be designed by analyzing two ways that it can enhance supply chain transparency: making the manufacturer’s sourcing cost transparent to the buyers (i.e., vertical cost transparency) and making the ordering status of buyers transparent to each other (i.e., horizontal order transparency). Given such transparency, firms can design a smart contract that automates transactions contingent on the revealed information and enables them to realize better equilibrium outcomes. We find that blockchain increases supply chain profit only when the manufacturer’s capacity is large and decreases supply chain profit otherwise. If the capacity is sufficiently large to eliminate the buyers’ competition, blockchain leads to a win–win–win and the incentives of all participants are naturally aligned. If the capacity is only moderately large, the manufacturer needs to compensate the buyers to facilitate a blockchain implementation. However, if the capacity is small, horizontal order transparency enabled by the blockchain mitigates the buyers’ overorder incentive to compete for the manufacturer’s capacity and increases double marginalization. For such cases, we show that a blockchain that only enables vertical cost transparency should (and can) still be adopted in a range of small capacity cases, and we propose an access control layer for the logistics data to implement such a blockchain.

  abstract     = {Interfirm innovation projects often require tight collaboration among firms with complementary skills and resources. The success of such projects depends on all firms generating high-quality outputs, which can be difficult to attain for aspects of quality that are not easily observable or contractible. We consider a setting with a focal firm and its collaborating firm (henceforth, the collaborator) engaging in a joint project, in which they make their quality decisions over time, respectively, and study the firm’s decision to communicate its quality output progress to its collaborator voluntarily. We first develop normative predictions using game-theoretic models by analyzing a reporting (respectively, revealing) case, in which the firm can report a not necessarily truthful quality (the truthful quality) to the collaborator. We find that the firm should be indifferent between reporting and not reporting for all project values and should be indifferent between revealing and not revealing (prefer revealing) for high (low) project values. To test this prediction, we run an experiment following a 2 × 3 design, varying the project value (high and low) and the form of communication (no communication, reporting, and revealing). We find that the quality provision is significantly lower than the normative prediction in all treatments. When the project value is high, the decision to report is beneficial to the firm (regardless of the reported quality) because the decision signals the firm’s intention to contribute high quality. The decision to reveal is also beneficial for a firm; however, a different mechanism is at play in this case. The decision itself does not directly affect the quality provisions, but the revealed quality does as the collaborator waits to observe the truthful revealed quality and incorporates this information in choosing a quality later. By contrast, when the project value is low, neither reporting nor revealing are beneficial for a firm. In particular, the decision to report no longer acts as a positive signal as it is used by firms trying to deceive the collaborator and get an advantage.

  abstract     = {This research introduces a new heuristic decision model called myopic-value of perfect information (VPI) to study multiarmed bandit (MAB) problems. The myopic-VPI approach only involves ranking the alternatives and computing a one-dimensional integration to obtain the expected future value of exploration. Because myopic-VPI is intuitive and does not involve solving a dynamic programming problem, it has the potential to serve as a useful heuristic approach to model exploration-exploitation tradeoffs. We conduct a series of simulation experiments to study its performance relative to other heuristics under a wide range of parameterizations. We find that myopic-VPI provides significant savings in computational time and decent performance in accumulated utility (although not the strongest) relative to other forward-looking heuristics; this suggests that it is a useful “fast-and-frugal” heuristic. Furthermore, our simulation experiments also reveal the conditions under which myopic-VPI outperforms and underperforms compared with other heuristics. Its empirical performance in the diaper category further shows that myopic-VPI can save estimation time significantly and fit the data on par with index and near-optimal, providing encouraging news that myopic-VPI could be added to the researcher’s or practitioner’s toolkit for MAB problems.

We further show that, at the relevant margin, switching from in-house development to licensing reduces the risk of brand dilution.

  abstract     = {Educational inequality undermines the pivotal role of education in increasing the ability of the poor to move up the income ladder. This paper investigates educational inequality that arises from low-income students’ lack of monetary resources that higher-income students invest in education. We show low-income students’ inability to make monetary investments in education reduces their incentive to study and contributes to educational inequality. In the context of developing markets, we study implications of a reservation policy that aims to reduce inequality by reserving some college seats for students of the disadvantaged group. The policy essentially transfers college seats from the advantaged student group to the disadvantaged student group and as a result increases the welfare of students from the disadvantaged group. In some cases, the seat transfer also improves the welfare of higher-income students. We show such a transfer, if small, can enhance overall student welfare in developing markets. However, a large transfer may reduce overall student welfare. Finally, we show the welfare-maximizing transfer is usually smaller than inequality-minimizing transfer of seats.

  abstract     = {Because of a growing population and shrinking arable land, the world is facing a global food crisis. One important solution could be to subsidize farmers to sustain their production so that they can produce more food for consumers and earn more money for themselves. An efficient subsidy program should also aim to reduce income inequality among farmers, as measured by the Gini coefficient of farmers’ income. In this paper, we examine and compare the effects of input and output farm subsidy programs. The input subsidy reduces the farmers’ input purchasing costs, whereas the output subsidy reduces the farmers’ output processing costs. By considering a continuum of infinitesimal price-taking farmers who are heterogeneous in their average yield rates, our equilibrium analysis of a game-theoretical model yields three results. First, both subsidy schemes reduce the aggregate income inequality measured by the Gini coefficient. However, they create the following “opposite” effects: the input subsidy decreases the income gap among farmers (under mild conditions), whereas the output subsidy increases it. Second, farmers with low yield rates prefer the input subsidy, whereas farmers with high yield rates prefer the output subsidy. Third, the output subsidy scheme is more effective in improving the total farmer income than the input subsidy scheme, whereas the input subsidy scheme is more effective in reducing income disparities and improving consumer surplus than the output subsidy scheme. Our results provide new insights for policymakers who are crafting subsidy schemes. This paper was accepted by Jayashankar Swaminathan, operations management.

In our designer-agent-principal game, the designer selects the information privately observed by the agent who can misreport it at a cost, whereas the principal can audit the report. We study three organizational levers: tampering prevention, tampering detection, and the allocation of the experimental-design task. We show that motivating informative experimentation while discouraging misreporting are often conflicting organizational goals. To incentivize experimentation, the principal foregoes a flawless tampering detection/prevention system and separates the tasks of experimental design and analysis.

  abstract     = {Retailers managing both online and offline channels have to decide whether to adopt the uniform (i.e., charging the same price online and offline) or dual (i.e., charging different prices online and offline) pricing strategy. This decision is made even more challenging as consumers are increasingly multirooming as they may search offline and then purchase online (showrooming) or the other way around (webrooming). In this paper, we develop an analytical model to examine such a decision. The model takes into consideration (1) consumers’ uncertainty about digital and nondigital product attributes, (2) consumers’ costs of showrooming as well as webrooming, and (3) the prevalence of costly product return. We show that uniform pricing can be optimal for a monopoly retailer even though consumers have different costs for shopping online versus offline and there is no intrinsic disutility against price discrimination by consumers. In addition, when the uniform price is optimal, it can be lower than both the offline and online prices under optimal dual pricing. This is because, compared with dual pricing, uniform pricing eliminates consumers’ uncertainty about the offline store’s price so that they are more likely to search the nondigital attribute at the offline store and buy the fitted product. Moreover, a relatively higher online price has to be used under dual pricing to encourage consumers to search offline for the purpose of reducing the product return costs.

Using product market shocks caused by trade liberalization of China, which has the world’s largest state sector, we find that subjecting state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to higher competition leads to an increase in private ownership. This response is strengthened when SOEs operate in industries with large technology or productivity gaps from those in the frontier economies or when SOEs impose large fiscal burdens on local governments. Our findings are consistent with politicians’ incentives to boost economic growth for better career development and to shed burdens when rents decrease.

  abstract     = {A significant proportion of the world’s population has no access to grid-based electricity and so relies on off-grid lighting solutions. Rechargeable lamp technology is gaining popularity as an alternative off-grid lighting model in developing countries. In this paper, we explore consumer behavior and the operational inefficiencies that result under this model. Specifically, we are interested in (i) measuring the impact of inconvenience (of traveling to recharge the lamp) along with the impact of liquidity constraints (because of poverty) on lamp usage and (ii) evaluating the efficacy of strategies that address these factors. We build a structural model of consumers’ recharge decisions that incorporates several operational features of the low-income regions. We conducted large-scale field experiments in Rwanda in partnership with a local rechargeable lamp operator and use the resultant data to estimate and test our model. We find that the complete removal of inconvenience and liquidity constraints from the current business model results in 73% and 126% increases in both recharges and revenue, thereby suggesting that these constraints are major sources of inefficiency. By implementing simple operations-based strategies—such as starting more recharge centers, visiting consumers periodically to collect their lamps for recharge, and allowing consumers to partially recharge their lamps and pay flexibly for the recharge—more than half the benefit of completely eliminating the inefficiencies can be attained. By contrast, the price- and capacity-based strategies that vary the economic variables (i.e., the amount paid per recharge and the amount of light obtained in return) but not the operational model perform far worse than the aforementioned strategies. Overall, our analysis emphasizes the importance of managing operations effectively even in markets with cash-constrained consumers, in which firms may have a natural tendency to focus more on reducing prices.

  abstract     = {This paper studies a dynamic principal–agent setting in which the principal needs to dynamically schedule an agent to work or be suspended. When the agent is directed to work and exert effort, the arrival rate of a Poisson process is increased, which increases the principal’s payoff. Suspension, on the other hand, serves as a threat to the agent by delaying future payments. A key feature of our setting is a switching cost whenever the suspension stops and the work starts again. We formulate the problem as an optimal control model with switching and fully characterize the optimal control policies/contract structures under different parameter settings. Our analysis shows that, when the switching cost is not too high, the optimal contract demonstrates a generalized control-band structure. The length of each suspension episode, on the other hand, is fixed. Overall, the optimal contract is easy to describe, compute, and implement.

Building on the fact that vicarious learning typically co-occurs and interacts with individual learning-by-doing, we propose an alternative mechanism—one in which vicarious learning is useful because it corrects for certain well-known limitations of individual learning-by-doing. Using computational agent-based models, we show that, under this mechanism, vicarious learning can be beneficial, even without any ex ante differential knowledge to exploit. Our analysis contributes to a deeper understanding of the microfoundations of vicarious learning, which is a vital component of organizational learning.

  abstract     = {We examine a large transaction-level data set of an Italian omnichannel furniture retailer to study channel-specific effects of fulfillment lead time on demand. This omnichannel retailer sells the same products and has the same product fulfillment across three channels: showroom, online, and catalog. The showroom channel carries no inventory but allows customers to touch and feel the products. The online channel provides a website for consumers to browse and order the products. The catalog channel sends a product catalog to all the households in Italy, so they can place an order over the phone. We find that the showroom channel makes consumers less sensitive to fulfillment lead time than both online and catalog channels. In particular, a 10% increase in lead time (1.83 days from the sample mean of 18.26 days) causes a 0.29% reduction in the daily sales volume (approximately 29 units from the sample mean of 10,140 units per day) at the showroom, which is less than the reduction of 1.85% and 0.92% in the online and the catalog channels, respectively. This finding contradicts the common practical and theoretical assumption about homogeneous lead time sensitivity across channels. In addition, we find that niche products and experience goods accentuate the difference of lead time sensitivity between showroom and nonphysical channels. Through an online experiment, we show that higher product information precision, such as that provided in a showroom, can alleviate customers’ anxiety around product uncertainty, thus reducing lead time sensitivity and increasing purchase intent. We further build two analytical models to show the implications of our empirical results for showroom network design and inventory rationing decisions. Our study highlights the previously ignored fulfillment time sensitivity aspect of the physical store’s value. This paper was accepted by Vishal Gaur, operations management.

  abstract     = {This paper studies a canonical general scheduling model that captures the fundamental trade-off between processing jobs and performing diagnostics (testing). In particular, testing reveals the required processing time and urgency of need-to-schedule jobs to inform future scheduling decisions. The model captures a range of important applications. Prior work focused on special cases (e.g., jobs with independent and identically distributed processing time) to devise optimal policies. In contrast, the current paper studies the most general form of the model and describes two simple heuristics to solve it; adaptive weighted shortest processing time is an adaptive generalization of Smith’s rule that optimally solves several important extensions of previously studied models, whereas index policy optimally solves a closely related stochastic optimization bandit problem. The latter achieves an approximation guarantee that quickly approaches a constant factor that is bounded by two as the number of jobs grows and approaches optimally when the testing time decreases. Extensive numerical experiments suggest that our policies effectively solve the general setting (under 0.1% from optimal on average and under 10% from optimal in rare, worst-case instances).

  abstract     = {People often need to plan how to allocate their attention across different tasks. In this paper, we run two experiments to study a stylized version of this attention-allocation problem between strategic tasks. More specifically, we present subjects with pairs of 2 × 2 games, and for each pair, we give them 10 seconds to decide how they would split a fixed time budget between the two games. Then, subjects play both games without time constraints, and we use eye-tracking to estimate the fraction of time they spend on each game. We find that subjects’ planned and actual attention allocation differ and identify the determinants of this mismatch.

  abstract     = {We measure the willingness to compete of entrepreneurs and salaried workers in an experiment. Participants can choose between a piece rate and a tournament scheme in either private or public. We find that in the private condition, entrepreneurs are less competitive than salaried workers, but in the public condition, this ordering is reversed. Survey data suggest that perceived norms of appropriate behavior, along with beliefs about the instrumental value of competitiveness for professional success, can explain why entrepreneurs are more competitive when decisions are publicly observable. We also find that the latter condition improves the quality of experimental decisions. This paper was accepted by Yan Chen, behavioral economics and decision analysis.

  abstract     = {Laws mandating vaccination against Covid-19 as a condition of employment in health and care sectors were commonplace during the pandemic. Using weekly data at the local authority level, we examine the impact of the vaccine mandate for elderly care homes in England on vaccine take-up, staffing levels, and mortality. Our identification strategy involves (1) comparing take-up and staffing in English elderly care homes relative to other social care settings unaffected by the mandate; (2) comparing take-up and staffing in English elderly care homes relative to those in Wales where the mandate also did not apply; and (3) comparing Covid-19 mortality among English elderly care home residents relative to mortality in domestic homes in England and to care homes in Wales. Our results suggest that the mandate substantially decreased the proportion of care home workers who remained unvaccinated (equivalent to between 28,000 and 41,000 fewer unvaccinated staff), but this came at the cost of a reduction in staffing levels of between 3% and 4% (equivalent to 14,000 to 18,000 staff). We observe this effect most strongly in areas of low unemployment. Our results do not provide evidence that the vaccine mandate was successful in its primary aim of reducing care home deaths. Relatively wide confidence intervals mean inferences regarding mortality are more uncertain than for vaccination uptake and staffing. This paper was accepted by Carri W. Chan, healthcare management.

Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics survey, I construct an empirical measure of countercyclical earnings risk and find evidence consistent with the model’s predictions. Specifically, larger downside earnings risk decreases consumption growth, increases left skewness in consumption growth, and reduces the share of wealth in stocks. Furthermore, the consumption effects are substantially more significant for stockholders than for nonstockholders, which arises through heterogeneity in the elasticity of intertemporal substitution.

This paper presents a unified framework, motivated by the literature on inattention. Agents choose whether and how to prepare for different possible states of the world by collecting information. Agents optimally ignore sufficiently unlikely events, so the occurrence of such events does not resolve, but rather increases, uncertainty. Uncertain agents have dispersed beliefs, making it harder to focus future preparation. Thus, uncertainty begets uncertainty for an inattentive agent, endogenously persisting. In a financial application, this framework matches patterns in volatility, volume of trade, belief dispersion, and spreads. This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance.

  abstract     = {We study a shipment consolidation problem commonly faced by companies that outsource logistics operations and operate in a commit-to-delivery mode. It involves delivering a given set of orders to their destinations by their committed due times using multiple shipping methods at the minimum total shipping and inventory cost. The shipping cost is generally nonlinear in shipping quantity and can be represented by a subadditive piecewise linear function. We investigate two shipping scenarios, one involving long-haul shipping only and the other involving joint long-haul and short-haul shipping. We develop analytical results and solution algorithms for the shipment consolidation problem under each shipping scenario. The problem under the first shipping scenario is shown to be strongly N P -hard. We find that a simple policy, called the First-Due-First-Delivered (FDFD) policy, which assigns orders with earlier delivery due times to shipping methods with earlier destination arrival times, is very effective. This policy enables us to develop a polynomial time algorithm, which not only solves the problem under the concave shipping cost structure optimally but also achieves a performance guarantee of 2 for the problem under the general subadditive shipping cost structure. For the problem under the second shipping scenario, we extend the FDFD policy for long-haul shipping and derive another policy, called the No-Wait policy, for short-haul shipping. We use these policies to develop a polynomial time algorithm and analyze its performance guarantee. Our computational experiments show that the algorithm significantly outperforms a commercial optimization solver, and its performance is robust across different parameter settings that reflect various practical situations.

  abstract     = {We study how to optimally match agents in a dynamic matching market with heterogeneous match cardinalities and values. A network topology determines the feasible matches in the market. In general, a fundamental tradeoff exists between short-term value—which calls for performing matches frequently—and long-term value—which calls, sometimes, for delaying match decisions in order to perform better matches. We find that in networks that satisfy a general position condition, the tension between short- and long-term value is limited, and a simple periodic clearing policy (nearly) maximizes the total match value simultaneously at all times. Central to our results is the general position gap ϵ ; a proxy for capacity slack in the market. With the exception of trivial cases, no policy can achieve an all-time regret that is smaller, in terms of order, than ϵ − 1 . We achieve this lower bound with a policy, which periodically resolves a natural matching integer linear program, provided that the delay between resolving periods is of the order of ϵ − 1 . Examples illustrate the necessity of some delay to alleviate the tension between short- and long-term value. This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, revenue management and market analytics.

  abstract     = {U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) allows banks to offset derivative assets against derivative liabilities with the same counterparty and report only the net amount on the balance sheet. Derivative offsetting under international financial reporting standards (IFRS) is much more restrictive, resulting in the single largest difference in balance sheet presentation between U.S. GAAP and IFRS. Two important factors dominate the standard-setting discussion on this issue: (1) whether these derivatives are informative about bank risk and (2) whether disclosing them substitutes for recognition on the balance sheet. Using a hand-collected global sample of banks, we first show that offsetable derivatives are positively associated with bank risk, based on multiple risk measures, suggesting that these derivatives are informative about bank risk. Next, exploiting the differential accounting treatment across U.S. GAAP and IFRS banks, we find that disclosure versus recognition of offsetable derivatives matters for the risk assessment of equity investors but not for that of (more sophisticated) credit default swap investors. Additional tests corroborate the inference that investor sophistication helps explain the differential investor assessment of recognized versus disclosed offsetable derivatives. Collectively, our findings suggest that offsetable derivatives convey information about bank risk and that, for less sophisticated investors, disclosing them may not substitute for recognizing them.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we explore an employee workaround widespread in K–12 schools: compensating for insufficient funding with partnerships to nonprofit organizations (NPOs). We take an equity perspective and ask the following questions. (i) How do partnering workarounds differ across schools with different levels of socioeconomic advantage? (ii) What can education and NPO leaders do to ensure these workarounds do not exacerbate educational inequities? To answer these questions, we use Little’s Law: a school’s long-run average number of resource-supplementing partnerships ( L ) is a function of its average annual partnership formation rate ( λ ) and partnership cycle time ( W ). We collect and analyze interview ( n = 62) and survey ( n = 140) data from six strategically sampled schools with different levels of socioeconomic advantage to compare differences in λ and W and understand the implications for educational equity. We find wealthier schools have higher λ , making them more productive. We also find schools have equal W independent of wealth, but this problematically amplifies differences in λ . The difference in partnering productivity translates to educational inequities. We find that poorer schools report about 35% greater utility per partnership, but that is not enough to offset the disadvantage of fewer partnerships. Moreover, we find that differences in partnering productivity are particularly large for curricular partnerships, which are harder for poorer schools to form because of the high demand for wrap-around partnerships. Our findings contribute new knowledge on workarounds which supplement organizational resources and on the relationship between workarounds and equity.

  abstract     = {Substantial funding is provided to the healthcare systems of low-income countries. However, an important challenge is to ensure that this funding is used efficiently. This challenge is complicated by the fact that a large share of healthcare services in low-income countries is provided by nonprofit health centers that often lack (i) effective governance structures and (ii) organizational know-how and adequate training. In this paper, we argue that the bundling of performance-based incentives with auditing and feedback (A&amp;F) is a potential way to overcome these obstacles. First, the combination of feedback and performance-based incentives—that is, feedback joined with incentives to act on this feedback and achieve specific health outcomes—helps address the knowledge gap that may otherwise undermine performance-based incentives. Second, coupling feedback with auditing helps ensure that the information underlying the feedback is reliable—a prerequisite for effective feedback. To examine the effectiveness of this bundle, we use data from a randomized governance program conducted in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Within the program, a set of health centers was randomly assigned to a “governance treatment” that consisted of performance-based incentives combined with A&amp;F, whereas others were not. Consistent with our prediction, we find that the governance treatment led to (i) higher operating efficiency and (ii) improvements in health outcomes. Furthermore, we find that funding is not a substitute for the governance treatment; health centers that only receive funding increase their scale but do not show improvements in operating efficiency or health outcomes.

  abstract     = {The common ownership of firms can have anticompetitive effects by incentivizing collusive outcomes that maximize joint surpluses of the commonly held firms or procompetitive effects through enhanced knowledge spillovers. Using a difference-in-differences regression methodology that exploits mergers between financial institutions as exogenous shocks to common ownership, our baseline results suggest that higher common ownership leads to greater product market fluidity (a text-based metric of competition) and generally leads to more product development and higher investments. These findings suggest that, on average, common ownership spurs dynamism in product spaces rather than tacit collusion between cross-held competitors. This is especially true in economic environments in which it is easier to take advantage of knowledge spillovers. However, common ownership can also inhibit product market competition and dynamism, especially in industries more prone to quasi-monopoly outcomes in product spaces. Implementing a one-size-fits-all regulatory policy limiting common ownership may be harmful in industries with strong spillover opportunities. This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance.

  abstract     = {Because of many firms’ lack of collateral, banks have imposed loan limits as a form of risk-control regulations of bank financing. In response, loan insurance has emerged as a useful instrument to lift loan limits. To study the joint value of bank loans and loan insurance, this article investigates a supply chain composed of one supplier and one capital-constrained buyer who takes out a bank loan and potentially purchases loan insurance. The analysis reveals that both the supplier and the buyer can benefit from the bank financing with loan insurance in an insurance-cooperation region wherein the supplier is willing to reduce the wholesale price to entice the buyer to purchase insurance. Further still, in the insurance-cooperation region, worse contract terms of the bank loan benefit the supplier, whereas worse policy terms of loan insurance help the buyer. Such benefits can lead to a higher order quantity than the capital-abundant one and partially coordinate the entire supply chain. However, when production cost is low, the supplier and the buyer can encounter a Stackelberg prisoner’s dilemma, in which both firms no longer cooperate with each other, and both are worse off. Nevertheless, a government subsidy for the insurance premium can not only reduce the Stackelberg prisoner’s dilemma, but also improve the social welfare although it is not always optimal for the government to provide that subsidy. The main qualitative results are robust in a variety of extensions. This paper was accepted by Jayashankar Swaminathan, operations management.

  abstract     = {Simple and affordable testing tools are often not accurate enough to be operationally relevant. For coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) detection, rapid point-of-care tests are cheap and provide results in minutes, but they largely fail policy makers’ accuracy requirements. We propose an analytical methodology, based on robust optimization, that identifies optimal combinations of results from cheap tests for increased predictive accuracy. This methodological tool allows policy makers to credibly quantify the benefits from combination testing and thus, break the trade-off between cost and accuracy. Our methodology is robust to noisy and partially missing input data and incorporates operational constraints—relevant considerations in practice. We apply our methodology to two data sets containing individual-level results of multiple COVID-19 rapid antibody and antigen tests, respectively, to generate Pareto-dominating receiver operating characteristic curves. We find that combining only three rapid tests increases out-of-sample area under the curve by 4% (6%) compared with the best-performing individual test for antibody (antigen) detection. We also find that a policy maker who requires a specificity of at least 0.95 can improve sensitivity by 8% and 2% for antibody and antigen testing, respectively, relative to available combination testing heuristics. Our numerical analysis demonstrates that robust optimization is a powerful tool to avoid overfitting, accommodate missing data, and improve out-of-sample performance. Based on our analytical and empirical results, policy makers should consider approving and deploying a curated combination of cheap point-of-care tests in settings where “gold standard” tests are too expensive or too slow.

  abstract     = {Personal data have become a key input in internet commerce, facilitating the matching between millions of customers and merchants. Recent data regulations in China, Europe, and the United States restrict internet platforms’ ability to collect and use personal data for personalized recommendation and may fundamentally impact internet commerce. In collaboration with the largest e-commerce platform in China, we conduct a large-scale field experiment to measure the potential impact of data regulation policy and to understand the value of personal data in internet commerce. For a random subset of 555,800 customers on the Alibaba platform, we simulate the regulation by banning the use of personal data in the home page recommendation algorithm and record the matching process and outcomes between these customers and merchants. Compared with the control group with personal data, we observe a significantly higher concentration in the algorithmic recommendation of products in the treatment group and a very sharp decrease in the matching outcomes as measured by both customer engagement (click-through rate and product browsing) and market transaction (sales volume and amount). The negative effect is disproportionate and more pronounced for niche merchants and customers who would benefit more from e-commerce. We discuss the potential economic impact of data regulation on internet commerce as well as the role of personal data in generating value and fostering long-tail innovations.

  abstract     = {Using an hourly data set on retail investor individual security positions from Robinhood Markets, we find no evidence that environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosures inform retail investors’ buy and sell decisions. The response on ESG press release days by retail investors is indistinguishable from nonevent days. In contrast, these same investors make economically meaningful changes to their portfolios in response to non-ESG press releases, especially those that pertain to earnings announcements. We use stock return tests to show that there is economic content in ESG press releases, and we conduct subsample analyses showing that retail investors do not respond to the most salient and economically transparent ESG disclosures. Collectively, these tests suggest that a lack of economic content, a lack of visibility, and difficulty with investment integration are unlikely to explain our findings.

  abstract     = {We conducted a randomized, controlled trial with small- and medium-sized enterprises in Kenya to estimate the causal impact of an electronic payment (e-payment) technology on business finance. Using an encouragement design, we exogenously increased e-payment usage among a random subset of firms by relaxing adoption transaction costs and information barriers. Sixteen months after the intervention, we find that the e-payment technology increased access to mobile loans (in the number of loans as well as in the amount borrowed) by at least 50% (0.17 standard deviation), likely because of the reduction of information asymmetries brought by an increase in digital transactions. We find no effect of the e-payment technology on sales and profits, but we do find a reduction of sales volatility and precautionary investment, especially for smaller firms. This suggests that mobile loans help smaller firms cope with short-term negative shocks. We provide a stylized model of business finance that rationalizes these findings.

  abstract     = {This paper examines mutual funds’ dual role as both clients and shareholders of broker banks. Mutual funds are more likely to hold and significantly overweight stocks of their broker banks. In line with the portfolio decisions, fund voting is biased toward broker management in contentious proposals. Such voting bias is inconsistent with maximizing broker banks’ shareholder value yet significantly affects voting outcomes and the presence of contentious proposals at the banks’ shareholder meetings. Furthermore, we show that although client funds are rewarded with preferential initial public offering allocations from connected brokers for their voting support, fund managers’ engagement in reciprocal practices is ultimately determined by the economic tradeoffs they face. Our study not only uncovers a new mechanism—being brokers’ friendly shareholders—through which the two parties maintain their quid pro quo relationships but also raises a broader concern about governance of important financial institutions.

  abstract     = {Models of statistical discrimination typically assume that employers make rational inference from (education) signals. However, there is a large amount of evidence showing that most people do not update their beliefs rationally. We use a model and two experiments to show that employers who are conservative, in the sense of signal neglect, discriminate more against disadvantaged groups than Bayesian employers. We find that such non-Bayesian statistical discrimination deters high-ability workers from disadvantaged groups from pursuing education, further exacerbating initial group inequalities. Excess discrimination caused by employer conservatism is especially important when signals are very informative. Out of the overall hiring gap in our data, around 40% can be attributed to Bayesian statistical discrimination, a further 40% is due to non-Bayesian statistical discrimination, and the remaining 20% is unexplained or potentially taste-based.

Mixed evidence exists on whether quality disclosures improve outcomes for disclosed ailments. Moreover, disclosure policies can generate spillovers and impact ailments not targeted by the policy. We examine the effects of quality disclosure regulation on mortality improvements in disclosed and nondisclosed ailments. We use patient records for California hospitals for 1995–2014 and construct three groups of ailments: those that were the target of disclosure regulation, complementary ailments that were not the target of disclosure regulation but are medically related to the disclosed ailments, and medically unrelated ailments. Using a difference-in-differences design, we find that quality disclosure regulation is associated with declines in mortality risk of disclosed ailments ranging from 11.5% to 23%. Quality disclosure regulation is also associated with improvements for complementary ailments that are not the target of the disclosure policy. Such positive spillover effects yield an estimated 15.2% decline in mortality risk. Consistent with demand-side pressures driving improvements, market shares become sensitive to disclosed quality measures after disclosure regulation. Our findings of direct and spillover effects have implications for disclosure regulation. This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, accounting.

  abstract     = {Disputes over transactions on two-sided platforms are common and usually arbitrated through platforms’ customer service departments or third-party service providers. This paper studies crowd-judging, a novel crowdsourcing mechanism whereby users (buyers and sellers) volunteer as jurors to decide disputes arising from the platform. Using a rich data set from the dispute resolution center at Taobao, a leading Chinese e-commerce platform, we aim to understand this innovation and propose and analyze potential operational improvements with a focus on in-group bias (buyer jurors favor the buyer, likewise for sellers). Platform users, especially sellers, share the perception that in-group bias is prevalent and systematically sways case outcomes as the majority of users on such platforms are buyers, undermining the legitimacy of crowd-judging. Our empirical findings suggest that such concern is not completely unfounded: on average, a seller juror is approximately 10% likelier (than a buyer juror) to vote for a seller. Such bias is aggravated among cases that are decided by a thin margin and when jurors perceive that their in-group’s interests are threatened. However, the bias diminishes as jurors gain experience: a user’s bias reduces by nearly 95% as experience grows from zero to the sample median level. Incorporating these findings and juror participation dynamics in a simulation study, the paper delivers three managerial insights. First, under the existing voting policy, in-group bias influences the outcomes of no more than 2% of cases. Second, simply increasing crowd size through either a larger case panel or aggressively recruiting new jurors may not be efficient in reducing the adverse effect of in-group bias. Finally, policies that allocate cases dynamically could simultaneously mitigate the impact of in-group bias and nurture a more sustainable juror pool.

  abstract     = {We study interdepartment knowledge sharing in an investment research setting where the benefits are potentially significant for the brokerage and the capital market, but so are the frictions impeding it. Using hand-collected data on equity analyst access to in-house debt research expertise, we find significant benefits to equity analysts in the form of improved ability to forecast cash flows and to anticipate credit rating downgrades. Moreover, we find evidence that access to management and research expertise underlie in-house debt analysts’ capacity to generate information beneficial to equity analysts. Finally, these benefits exist only in the presence of a collaborative brokerage culture or debt-equity analyst collocation, consistent with these factors promoting knowledge sharing in the investment research industry.

  abstract     = {We study how social connectedness affected active mutual fund manager trading behavior in the first half of 2020. In the first quarter during which the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak occurred, fund managers located in or socially connected to COVID-19 hotspots sold more stock holdings compared with a control group of unconnected managers. The economic impact of social connectedness on stock holdings was comparable with that of COVID-19 hotspots and was elevated among “epicenter” stocks most susceptible to the pandemic shock. In the second quarter, social interaction had an overall negative effect on fund performance, but this effect depended on manager skill; unskilled managers who were connected to the hotspots underperformed, whereas skillful managers suffered no deleterious effect. Our evidence suggests that social connections can intensify salience bias for all but the most skilled institutional investors, and policy makers should be wary of the destabilizing role of social networks during market downturns.

  abstract     = {We explore the consequences of limiting executive pay on voluntary executive turnover by exploiting a Chinese government policy restricting executive pay at a subset of firms. Affected firms experience an increase in voluntary executive turnover, with executives increasingly moving to firms not bound by the pay policy. Executives that leave are of higher quality as suggested by their stronger stock and accounting performance in the year prior to the turnover. Affected firms suffer firm value losses, especially when talented executives leave. Our findings demonstrate the importance of compensation contracts in retaining executives and suggest a need for regulatory caution, since mandated constraints aimed at trying to “fix” executive pay can hurt firm value and ultimately, hurt shareholders.

  abstract     = {Economic theory predicts that bond insurance lowers issuers’ financing costs by resolving asymmetric information and mitigating credit risk. With comprehensive data over the last 36 years, we find increasingly diminished empirical support for these models. The value of insurance in resolving asymmetric information beyond that resolved by credit ratings and other observable bond characteristics is economically minimal. The average gross value of insurance ranges from 4 to 14 bps when bond insurers offer Aaa-rated coverage. However, this gross value becomes insignificant after 2008 when Aaa-rated insurance no longer exists. Evidence suggests that the lack of insurance benefit in the postcrisis period is attributable to the deteriorated creditworthiness of insurance companies. Examining noninterest saving explanations for the continued use of insurance in the no-Aaa insurance market, we find evidence that issuers purchase insurance out of habit (with insurance value most diminished for habitual purchasers with low governance quality) and for the convenience it affords in default, but no evidence that insurance improves secondary market liquidity.

  abstract     = {We study policy optimization for the feature-based newsvendor, which seeks an end-to-end policy that renders an explicit mapping from features to ordering decisions. Most existing works restrict the policies to some parametric class that may suffer from suboptimality (such as affine class) or lack of interpretability (such as neural networks). Differently, we aim to optimize over all functions of features. In this case, the classic empirical risk minimization yields a policy that is not well-defined on unseen feature values. To avoid such degeneracy, we consider a Wasserstein distributionally robust framework. This leads to an adjustable robust optimization, whose optimal solutions are notoriously difficult to obtain except for a few notable cases. Perhaps surprisingly, we identify a new class of policies that are proven to be exactly optimal and can be computed efficiently. The optimal robust policy is obtained by extending an optimal robust in-sample policy to unobserved feature values in a particular way and can be interpreted as a Lipschitz regularized critical fractile of the empirical conditional demand distribution. We compare our method with several benchmarks using synthetic and real data and demonstrate its superior empirical performance. This paper was accepted by J. George Shanthikumar, data science.

  abstract     = {Does the arrival of culturally diverse workers affect the work style of incumbent workers? We examine how the large influx of Russian hockey players in the National Hockey League after 1989 affected North American–born players. The Soviet style of hockey was largely based on skilled skating, constant movement, circling, and passing. In contrast, the North American play was more individualistic and linear, with higher emphasis on physical strength and aggressive behavior. Using 50 years of data at the player-game level, we show that (i) the number of penalty minutes per game increases steadily from 1970 to 1989, but decreases thereafter; (ii) although Russian players get systematically fewer penalty minutes in and after 1989, the trend reversal is driven by North American–born players; and (iii) the number of penalty minutes per game of North American–born players decreases systematically with the number of Russian players on their team and on the opposing team. Evidence shows that the hockey style brought about by Russian players was adopted and diffused within and across North American teams and players.

We identify this novel form of regulatory arbitrage by studying housing overappraisals, the difference between housing collateral values computed by appraisers and actual transaction prices. We leverage granular loan-level data from Spain and a kink in the scheme of residential mortgage risk weights to show that tighter regulatory requirements cause larger overappraisals. This bias depends on the relationship between appraisers and banks; appraisers inflate mortgage collateral values only for their major customer banks. On average, overappraisals lower risk-weighted mortgages by 9%. Mortgage overappraisals allow banks to free up regulatory capital to support additional risk-taking in the corporate loan market.

  abstract     = {We explore the statistical and economic importance of restrictions on the dynamics of risk compensation from the perspective of a real-time Bayesian learner who predicts bond excess returns using dynamic term structure models (DTSMs). The question on whether potential statistical predictability offered by such models can generate economically significant portfolio benefits out-of-sample is revisited while imposing restrictions on their risk premia parameters. To address this question, we propose a methodological framework that successfully handles sequential model search and parameter estimation over the restriction space in real time, allowing investors to revise their beliefs when new information arrives, thus informing their asset allocation and maximizing their expected utility. Empirical results reinforce the argument of sparsity in the market price of risk specification since we find strong evidence of out-of-sample predictability only for those models that allow for level risk to be priced and, additionally, only one or two of these risk premia parameters to be different than zero. Most importantly, such statistical evidence is turned into economically significant utility gains, across prediction horizons, different time periods and portfolio specifications. In addition to identifying successful DTSMs, the sequential version of the stochastic search variable selection scheme developed can be applied on its own and offer useful diagnostics monitoring key quantities over time.

Ex ante, reform occurs earlier in states with weaker unions, stronger bondholders’ interests, and better courts. Similar factors explain congressional voting on municipal bankruptcy law.

  abstract     = {We propose a mean field game model to study the question of how centralization of reward and computational power occur in Bitcoin-like cryptocurrencies. Miners compete against each other for mining rewards by increasing their computational power. This leads to a novel mean field game of jump intensity control, which we solve explicitly for miners maximizing exponential utility and handle numerically in the case of miners with power utilities. We show that the heterogeneity of their initial wealth distribution leads to greater imbalance of the reward distribution, and increased wealth heterogeneity over time, or a “rich get richer” effect. This concentration phenomenon is aggravated by a higher Bitcoin mining reward and reduced by competition. Additionally, an advantaged miner with cost advantages such as access to cheaper electricity, contributes a significant amount of computational power in equilibrium, unaffected by competition from less efficient miners. Hence, cost efficiency can also result in the type of centralization seen among miners of cryptocurrencies. This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance. Funding: A. M.

Our results are consistent with a stylized capital structure model in which the negative relation between option returns and default risk is driven by firm leverage and asset volatility.

  abstract     = {Recent financialization in commodity markets makes it easier for institutional investors to trade a portfolio of commodities via various commodity-indexed products. We present several pieces of novel causal evidence that daily exposure to such index trading results in price overshoots and reversals, as reflected in negative daily return autocorrelations, only among commodities in that index. This is because index trading propagates nonfundamental noise to all indexed commodities. We present direct evidence for such noise propagation using commodity news sentiment data.

  abstract     = {We consider a dynamic pricing problem in which a firm sells one item to a single buyer to maximize expected revenue. The firm commits to a price function over an infinite horizon. The buyer arrives at some random time with a private value for the item. He is more impatient than the seller and strategizes over the timing of the purchase in order to maximize his expected utility, which implies either buying immediately, waiting to benefit from a lower price, or not buying. We study the value of the seller’s ability to observe the buyer’s arrival time in terms of her expected revenue. When the seller can observe the buyer’s arrival, she can make the price function contingent on the buyer’s arrival time. On the contrary, when the seller can’t, her price function is fixed at time zero for the whole horizon. The value of observability (VO) is defined as the worst-case ratio between the expected revenue of the seller when she observes the buyer’s arrival and that when she does not. First, we show that, for the particular case in which the buyer’s valuation follows a monotone hazard rate distribution, the upper bound of VO is exp ( 1 ) . Next, we show our main result: in a setting very general on valuation and arrival time distributions: VO is at most 4.911. To obtain this bound, we fully characterize the solution to the observable arrival problem and use this solution to construct a random and periodic price function for the unobservable case. Finally, we show by solving a particular example to optimality that VO has a lower bound of 1.136. This paper was accepted by Itai Ashlagi, revenue management and market analytics.

  abstract     = {This article studies the consumption of advertising when attention is costly. Our objective is to understand the advertiser’s optimal decision for informational and noninformational content when facing consumers with heavy distractions common in the digital age. We take an equilibrium approach in which an ad is consumed if and only if the content of the ad is worth the viewer’s attention. We classify many advertising decisions observed in practice. First, an advertiser can structure content to induce curiosity for continued viewing by showing the information that is relatively less likely to resonate with the broad audience. This tactic is evident in clickbait ads and “mystery ads.” Second, we find that digital ads, which tend to be skippable, have lower amounts of noninformational content (e.g., entertainment) relative to nonskippable ads. This finding can explain the industry perception that ads on digital media are of lower copy quality than traditional ads. This paper was accepted by Dmitri Kuksov, marketing.

We characterize these stimulus checks as a wealth shock for households and examine their effect on retail trading in Bitcoin. We find a significant increase in Bitcoin buy trades of size $1,200, which is the modal EIP amount. We find similar increases in trading for other countries that paid out stimulus checks. We estimate that the EIPs have a significant impact on the U.S. dollar–Bitcoin trading pair, increasing buy volume by 3.8% and the price by 0.6%. We also find that demand for Bitcoin is highly price inelastic compared with the demand for stocks. We suggest the demographic characteristics that make people more resilient to the COVID-19 economic shock—single, computer literate, and educated—are also characteristics of people who are more interested in Bitcoin.

  abstract     = {Retailers are increasingly selling returned products as open-box along with their new product offerings. Whereas some retailers position open-box products side-by-side with their new counterparts in the assortment (i.e., side-by-side strategy), other retailers position them separately in a different part of the retail space/website (i.e., separate strategy). We conduct multimethodology research to investigate the effectiveness of these two visual merchandising strategies. First, using a choice-based conjoint design in a controlled behavioral experiment, we identify how the two strategies affect the perceived value of new products. Next, using proprietary data from a retailer that has implemented both strategies across different stores, we empirically test the impact of each strategy on new product sales and returns under real market conditions. Finally, we extend our empirical analysis to prescribe how retailers can identify the right visual merchandising strategy for a given product profile. Overall, our results reveal a novel trade-off between the two visual merchandising strategies. With respect to retail revenue, the separate strategy outperforms the side-by-side strategy as we find that new product sales are higher with the separate strategy. However, with respect to retail cost, the side-by-side strategy outperforms the separate strategy as we find that new product returns are lower with the side-by-side strategy. Our extended analysis reveals that this tradeoff varies by product profile. Using counterfactual analysis, we further demonstrate that customizing the visual merchandising strategy by product mix could increase profit by 3.2% at the focal retailer.

  abstract     = {Do gender diversity quotas enhance firm value? This broad question has sparked significant debate because, whereas diversity is generally thought to improve board functioning, prior research in international settings suggests mandating diversity may have adverse consequences if it moves firms away from market equilibrium. Exploiting the political events leading up to the passage of California Senate Bill (SB) 826 as an exogenous shock to assess the market implications of board gender composition, we document either significantly positive or insignificant two-day abnormal returns for California firms across a variety of model specifications. Importantly, this finding contradicts the strong claims of contemporary studies of SB 826 that the California mandate was value-destructive. We reconcile these findings by providing critical evidence that contemporaneous results lack robustness to alternative model specifications and provide an incomplete picture by failing to comprehensively examine a broader set of event dates or account for mixed messaging on the final event date. We also provide some evidence of significant negative abnormal returns to litigation milestones that threaten to overturn SB 826 with the magnitude increasing in the size of board gender deficits. Finally, we provide evidence that there is no observable decline in newly appointed female director quality following the implementation of SB 826 relative to either preregulation or male director appointments. Collectively, our results suggest nonnegative (if not positive) consequences to California firms arising from SB 826 and directly counter assertions that mandated gender diversity is detrimental to firm value.

  abstract     = {As coined by the SEC, Digital Engagement Practices (DEPs) are visual cues and design features to engage investors on mobile trading platforms. With the rise of mobile stock trading, regulators and other capital market participants are concerned that these DEPs may cause retail investors to trade in ways they otherwise would not. Using an experiment, we examine the impact of two common DEPs in mobile trading platforms—color (i.e., the use of green or red to indicate performance) and allowing investors to swipe versus click and confirm to execute trades. Drawing from prior research, we predict that the color associated with firm information will interact with how investors execute their trades to affect investment decisions. Consistent with expectations, results show that investors make the largest investment in a firm when they swipe to trade and firm information is colored green, relative to when they click and confirm to trade or firm information is colored red, holding firm economics constant. Swiping to trade causes investors to focus relatively more on the upside of investing, but only when firm information is colored green and not when it is colored red. The color red leads to a muted effect of swiping to trade as investors experience more negative affect and focus relatively more on the downside of investing. Our study answers calls from regulators and academics to examine the effects of technology on information evaluation in investment decisions, and has important practical implications for investors.

A well-established result in the network economics literature is that a profit-maximizing firm concerns only how quality is valued by the marginal consumer but not by inframarginal consumers, aka the Spence effect/distortion. For markets with strong network effects under which multiple market-tipping equilibria exist, I show that the validity of the previous result depends on the choice of the equilibrium selection criterion. Precisely, I show that all criteria commonly used in this literature give rise to the Spence effect, whereas the well-justified risk dominance criterion in game theory and its generalizations do not. Novel quality strategies are derived based on the latter criteria. This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.},

Using the cross-section of currency returns and the relative presence of U.S. firms in foreign economies, we compute a foreign operations-related exchange shock ( FOREXS ) measure. We find FOREXS to predict firms’ future cash flows and stock returns, driving much of the previously documented underreaction to foreign information. An FOREXS -based long-short strategy yields a 6.74% annualized abnormal return.

Consistent with this conjecture, we find that the overall sentiment of media coverage tilts significantly more negative for pilot relative to control firms following exogenous relief of short sale constraints. We find a more pronounced effect for media-initiated articles relative to firm-initiated press releases. Further, following abnormal increases in short interest, there is a significantly greater increase in negative news flow for pilot relative to nonpilot firms.

  abstract     = {In 2020, Berlin introduced a rigorous rent-control policy responding to soaring prices by capping rents: the Mietendeckel (rent freeze). The German Constitutional Court revoked the policy only one year later. Although successful in lowering rents during its duration, the consequences for Berlin’s rental market and close-by markets are per se not clear. This article evaluates the short-term causal supply-side effects in terms of prices, quantities, and landlords’ strategic behavior. We develop a theoretical framework capturing the key features of first-generation rent control policies and Berlin-specific aspects. Using a rich pool of detailed rent advertisements, predictions are tested, and further empirical causal inference techniques are applied for comparing price trajectories of dwellings inside and outside the policy’s scope. Mechanically, advertised rents drop significantly upon the policy’s enactment. A substantial rent gap along Berlin’s administrative border emerges, and rapidly growing rents in Berlin’s (unregulated) adjacent municipalities are observed. Landlords started adopting a hedging strategy insuring themselves against the risk of contractually long-term fixed low rents following a potentially unconstitutional law. Whereas this hedge was beneficial for landlords, the risk was completely borne by tenants. Moreover, the number of available properties for rent dropped significantly, a share of which appears to be permanently lost for the rental sector. This hampers a successful housing search for first-time renters and people moving within the city. Overall, negative consequences for renters appear to outweigh positive ones.

The estimated risk-aversion coefficient is lower when we use the consumption growth of wealthy households over a longer horizon as a risk factor, and a model with a 20-quarter horizon yields a risk-aversion coefficient of 15, a value similar to the one estimated from equity portfolios.

  abstract     = {One advantage of online retail is that a large number of products can be displayed at low cost. However, online retailers must decide which of these products to carry in inventory (stock items) and which to order from suppliers when a customer places an order (nonstock items). In this paper, we empirically investigate how carrying a product in inventory affects its online sales. We use data from a European furniture and interior design retailer consisting of daily sales transactions and inventory data covering 18 months. We use a quasi-natural experiment—random transitions of products in and out of inventory at the retailer’s central warehouse—to estimate the causal effect of carrying inventory on sales. Our results show a strong and statistically significant increase in sales of, on average, 65% associated with having the product available in stock. More interestingly, this effect differs between products and is moderated by the price of the product: sales of more expensive products are less sensitive to the product being in stock. We use these results to draw insights on which types of items to carry in inventory. This paper was accepted by Victor Martínez-de-Albéniz, operations management.

Bearish information in hedge fund option positions is economically large, distinct from information in short interest, and it is the combination of option positions and short interest that provides the strongest information signal. A portfolio of stocks with high short interest and bearish hedge fund option positions predicts negative abnormal returns that are more than four times as large as the portfolio with high short interest and bullish options positions. The information in hedge fund option positions increases during periods of market stress, whereas that in short interest does not. This increase is concentrated in capital-constrained hedge funds, suggesting that options provide a channel for capital-constrained hedge funds to exploit their information advantage.

  abstract     = {This paper studies whether credit ratings can alleviate the hold-up problem in the loan market. We exploit a refinement of the rating information produced by a certifier that rates private bank-dependent firms in France on a vast scale. The refinement causes some firms to receive a positive rating surprise that is not due to an improvement in firm fundamentals. We show that affected firms become less reliant on lenders that have greater ability to extract informational rents. These firms receive greater and less expensive bank credit from new and less informed lenders and invest more. We deduce that credit ratings reduce the monopoly power of informed banks, helping firms to expand their access to bank credit. This paper was accepted by David Sraer, finance.

  abstract     = {In manufacturing and service operations, flexibility is beneficial for matching supply with demand, but it comes at a cost. In modern digital workplaces, agents have different skills associated with corresponding and variable task preferences. Some are inclined to give up part of their payment to avoid unfavorable matches, and the platform manager, in turn, gains extra freedom in allocating tasks by possibly charging servers for favorable assignments. Innovative marketplaces facilitate task discretion and seek novel and beneficial implementations in the platform design. This naturally leads to the problem of exploring and optimizing the task allocation process. We introduce an innovative mechanism for task assignment in the workplace and compare it to the traditional mechanism in which task routing is solely the platform’s decision. To improve the welfare of all users, agents are allowed some task discretion in exchange for a fee. In a multiserver system, a server may request flexibility and, considering the other agents’ behavior, choose the costly to the platform option, which may or may not be beneficial for the platform when the agents’ and the platform’s preferences are misaligned. We model different working environments and server preferences via different distributions and study how the agents’ preferences, task costs, and flexibility fee affect the equilibrium assignment. In every case, through pricing and offering flexibility, the platform can do at least as well as a scheme with no flexibility. An important conclusion is that pricing task discretion can often improve the agents’ welfare and the labor platform’s profit.

  abstract     = {Maintaining good ratings increases the profits of sellers on online platforms. We analyze the role of strategic pricing for ratings management in a setting where a monopolist sells a good of unknown quality. Higher prices reduce the value for money, which on average worsens reviews. However, higher prices also induce only those consumers with a strong taste for the product to purchase, which on average improves reviews. Our model flexibly parametrizes the two effects. This parametrization can rationalize the observed heterogeneity in the relationship between reviews and prices. Based on an analytic characterization of the optimal dynamic pricing strategy, we study a platform’s choice of the sensitivity of its rating system to incoming reviews. The optimal sensitivity depends on the effect of prices on reviews and on how the platform weighs consumers and sellers in its objective. Although sellers always benefit from more sensitivity, consumers may suffer from higher prices and from slower learning from reviews due to endogenously emerging price and rating cycles.

  abstract     = {Recent years have witnessed significant advancements in matching technologies used to improve the matching between workers and employers requesting job tasks on a gig-economy platform. Although conventional wisdom suggests that technologies with higher matching quality benefit the platform by assigning better-matched jobs to workers, we discover a possible unintended revenue-decreasing effect. Our stylized game-theoretic model suggests that, although a technology’s matching enhancement effect can increase a platform’s revenue, the jobs assigned by the better matching technology can also unintentionally reveal more information about uncertain labor demand to workers, especially when demand is low, and thus unfavorably change workers’ participation decisions, resulting in a revenue loss for the platform. We extend our model to cases in which (1) the share of revenue between workers and platform is endogenous, (2) the matching quality can be improved continuously, (3) the opportunity cost of workers is affected by competition between platforms, and (4) workers compete for job tasks. We find consistent results with additional insights, including the optimal matching quality that a platform should pursue. Furthermore, we examine two approaches to mitigate the potential negative effect of using an advanced matching technology for the platform and find that under certain conditions, the platform can benefit from revealing labor demand or competition information directly to workers. Our results shed light on both the intended positive and unintended negative effects of improvements in matching quality and highlight the importance of thoughtful development, management, and application of matching technologies in the gig economy.

  abstract     = {I examine the effect of relative performance evaluation (RPE) on firm performance and risk-taking behavior. Agency theory suggests that, for firms that experience common shocks, RPE in executive compensation plans improves risk sharing and strengthens incentive alignment by providing more information about managerial effort than firm performance alone. In practice (i.e., in the presence of a finite number of peers), RPE effectiveness depends on the extent of firms’ common risk exposure and the amount of common risk captured by RPE peers. I develop a simple model that predicts that the benefit of using RPE exceeds the cost of adding noise from peers when the amount of common risk removed is large. Consistent with predictions, I find empirically that RPE firms perform better than similar non-RPE firms when there is high common risk exposure and the common risk removed by the selected peers is high. I also find that, in these circumstances, the use of RPE is associated with greater firm risk and a lower likelihood of underinvesting. Overall, my study provides evidence that RPE is associated with better risk sharing and stronger incentive alignment when (1) RPE firms are exposed to high common risk and (2) RPE peers are effective in removing common risk for performance evaluation.

  abstract     = {Deliberation among individuals online plays a key role in shaping the opinions that drive votes, purchases, donations, and other critical offline behavior. Yet, the determinants of opinion change via persuasion in deliberation online remain largely unexplored. Our research examines the persuasive power of ethos —an individual’s “reputation”—using a seven-year panel of over a million debates from an argumentation platform containing explicit indicators of successful persuasion. We identify the causal effect of reputation on persuasion by constructing an instrument for reputation from a measure of past debate competition and by controlling for unstructured argument text using neural models of language in the double machine-learning framework. We find that an individual’s reputation significantly impacts their persuasion rate above and beyond the validity, strength, and presentation of their arguments. In our setting, we find that having 10 additional reputation points causes a 31% increase in the probability of successful persuasion over the platform average. We also find that the impact of reputation is moderated by characteristics of the argument content, in a manner consistent with heuristic information processing under cognitive overload. We discuss managerial implications for platforms that facilitate deliberative decision making for public and private organizations online.

  abstract     = {We study whether and how the availability of incremental time associated with retirement and unemployment affects the types of products households buy. For this, we develop a new theoretical model of the composition and size of the grocery shopping basket subject to money and time constraints. We construct a novel household panel data set that combines purchase records for grocery goods with information on labor market status and other demographics. We use the data to document that, in line with predictions from the model, consumers buy more varieties and generally shift their spending into products that take more time to turn them into consumption experiences.

  abstract     = {Becker and Murphy proposed that task specialization raises productivity but is limited by the costs of coordinating workers. We propose that automation enables workers to specialize without coordination costs. To the extent that the cost of effort exhibits increasing differences, workers increase effort in nonautomated tasks and productivity. The proposition is supported by a field experiment among supermarket cashiers. Conventionally, supermarket cashiers perform two tasks: scanning purchases and collecting payment. Cashiers exhibited increasing differences in the cost of effort: when they scanned faster, they took longer to collect payments. We rotated cashiers between the conventional job design and one in which they specialized in scanning. The new job design increased cashier productivity in scanning by more than 10%. The faster scanning was not due to customer sorting or cashier learning. The proposition is also validated by a survey of taxi drivers. Drivers who reported that difficulties in finding their way affected their driving were more likely to use map apps. This paper was accepted by Alfonso Gambardella, business strategy.

  abstract     = {We develop a dynamic portfolio choice model with illiquid alternative assets to analyze the “endowment model,” widely adopted by institutional investors, such as pension funds, university endowments, and sovereign wealth funds. In the model, the alternative asset has a lockup but can be liquidated at any time by paying a proportional cost. We model how investors can engage in liquidity diversification by investing in multiple illiquid alternative assets with staggered lockup expirations and show that doing so increases alternatives allocations and investor welfare. We show how illiquidity from lockups interacts with illiquidity from secondary market transaction costs resulting in endogenous and time-varying rebalancing boundaries. We extend the model to allow crisis states and show that increased illiquidity during crises causes holdings to deviate significantly from target allocations.

  abstract     = {A key issue for the design of online marketplaces is addressing leakage. Buyers may use the marketplace to discover a seller or to obtain certain conveniences, but the seller may then want to take transactions off the marketplace to avoid transaction fees. Assuming buyers are heterogenous in their switching cost or inconvenience cost of purchasing directly, we provide a model in which there is partial leakage in equilibrium. We use the model to analyze the trade-offs associated with different strategies the marketplace can use to attenuate the effects of leakage: investing in transaction benefits, limiting communication, charging referral fees, using price-parity clauses, introducing seller competition on the marketplace, and hiding sellers that try to induce too much leakage.

The reductions in sales are economically and statistically significant, persistent, and more pronounced after attacks with high levels of foreign media coverage.

Empirical choice data, however, display several contextual choice effects that violate these axioms. We study a choice model with a fixed underlying utility function and explain contextual choices with a novel type of information friction: the agent’s perception of the options is affected by attribute-specific uncertainty. Under this friction, the agent learns useful information when the agent sees more options. Therefore, the agent chooses contextually, exhibiting intransitivity, joint–separate evaluation reversal, the compromise effect, the phantom decoy effect, the attraction effect, and the similarity effect. Because the uncertainty is attribute-specific and common across alternatives, the classic axioms hold when the alternatives dominate one another in attributes.

  abstract     = {Many governments subsidize the agricultural industry, trying to raise the market outputs either for domestic needs or for export. In many countries, particularly developing countries, the producers’ market may be fragmented, involving a large number of farmers with variable productivity levels. The format of subsidies can have significantly different implications for farmers in different market segments. In this study, we examine four types of subsidies. A planting subsidy is paid to a farmer based on the amount of input, and a harvesting subsidy compensates a farmer for the cost incurred during the process of output collection and distribution. The government may also offer a combined subsidy under which a farmer gets paid for both planting and harvesting, or it may offer a selective subsidy under which a farmer can choose to be subsidized on either planting or harvesting but not both. In addition to examining the efficiency of budget spending and social welfare, two common performance measures studied in various contexts, we thoroughly analyze the implications of subsidies on the output and wealth distributions among the farmers. In general, subsidizing on harvesting or overly compensating on planting can increase the disparity among the farmers, whereas an appropriate level of planting subsidy helps to balance the distributions of the farmers’ output and profit. A comprehensive evaluation of the government’s policies reveals that the harvesting subsidy, while inducing the most dispersed output and profit distributions, leads to the most efficient use of input resources and the highest social welfare. The planting subsidy, although being the most effective in balancing the farmer income for a moderate output increase, performs poorly in budget spending, resource usage, and welfare generation when the government sets an aggressive target for output increase. In such a situation, the combined subsidy can offer the most evenly distributed farmer income, with the least amount of budget needed to achieve the output target.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the problem of information sharing between a retail platform and a manufacturer in a supply chain. We develop a stylized model salient to which is that the product’s quality is a priori unknown to customers, who can infer it from customer-generated reviews. The platform, in turn, has access to private information concerning the relationship between quality and demand, and the manufacturer can choose to acquire said information to help determine the quality of its product accordingly. Our analysis yields three main insights. First, information sharing in and of itself induces the manufacturer to improve quality. Second, under a wholesale price contract, information sharing and product reviews together have a negative effect on product quality: When each firm is able to adjust its price in response to the quality signal, it benefits the manufacturer and hinders the platform. Consequently, the presence of reviews discourages the platform from sharing information, and the manufacturer tends to produce a lower-quality product. Finally, the negative effect of product reviews on the supply chain can be mitigated when the platform can share less accurate information or when the platform and manufacturer make a commission contract, rather than a wholesale price contract.

  abstract     = {Financial companies often use disclosure statements (DSs) to categorize uncertain contingencies into different sections (e.g., a health insurance plan includes sections such as “hospital coverage” and “dental coverage”). We model DSs as information partitions of the state space, which influence how a consumer perceives her choice problem and how she makes her demand decisions. We study a consumer with weakly separable preferences, which allows us to define event-risk attitude to the DS’s categories. Our main results show that aggregating the more expensive events into a coarser DS decreases a firm’s profit if and only if the consumer is event-risk averse. The opposite result holds for event-risk loving. Our findings can be extended to a more general class of consumer preferences and provide insights into the optimal design of DSs.

We exploit the explicit worst case expectation of supermodular functions and derive the worst case distribution for the robust counterpart. This enables us to develop an efficient method to obtain an exact optimal solution to these two-stage problems. Further, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for checking whether any given two-stage optimization problem has the supermodularity property. We also investigate the optimality of the segregated affine decision rules when problems have the property of supermodularity. We apply this framework to several classic problems, including the multi-item newsvendor problem, the facility location problem, the lot-sizing problem on a network, the appointment-scheduling problem, and the assemble-to-order problem. Whereas these problems are typically computationally challenging, they can be solved efficiently under our assumptions.

  abstract     = {Motivated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s project on the disaggregation of income statement expenses, we study a Korean rule change that allowed firms to withhold a previously mandated disaggregation of cost of sales (CoS). We find that after withholding, firms’ profitability increases by 1.6 percentage points. Our industry-focused results suggest that withholding affects profitability by reducing the transfer of competitive information to peer firms. We then document a range of evidence consistent with the idea that firms withhold disaggregated CoS to protect cost innovations from rivals. First, we construct a novel measure of firms’ cost-innovative potential and show that it predicts withholding and subsequent profitability gains under the voluntary disclosure regime. Second, we document efficiency gains following the withholding of disaggregated CoS. Third, our survey experiment of 1,257 U.S. public firm managers shows that they would reduce investments in process/cost innovations if they were required to disaggregate CoS. Our study highlights to standard setters and academics that CoS disaggregation entails operational consequences for firms. This paper was accepted by Brian Bushee, accounting.

More competition disciplines sellers, but at the same time, it erodes reputational premia. This paper identifies whether one effect dominates the other using data from Airbnb. I exploit the introduction of a short-term rental regulation effective in San Francisco in 2017 that halved the number of short-term listings on the platform. I focus on hosts who are present on the platform before and after the regulation, and I identify a negative causal effect of the number of competitors on ratings about hosts’ effort. I extend this result with two other measures of effort: hosts’ response rate and response time. I confirm that hosts exert less effort when the number of competitors increases.

  abstract     = {With the help of more than 700 reviewers, we assess the reproducibility of nearly 500 articles published in the journal Management Science before and after the introduction of a new Data and Code Disclosure policy in 2019. When considering only articles for which data accessibility and hardware and software requirements were not an obstacle for reviewers, the results of more than 95% of articles under the new disclosure policy could be fully or largely computationally reproduced. However, for 29% of articles, at least part of the data set was not accessible to the reviewer. Considering all articles in our sample reduces the share of reproduced articles to 68%. These figures represent a significant increase compared with the period before the introduction of the disclosure policy, where only 12% of articles voluntarily provided replication materials, of which 55% could be (largely) reproduced. Substantial heterogeneity in reproducibility rates across different fields is mainly driven by differences in data set accessibility. Other reasons for unsuccessful reproduction attempts include missing code, unresolvable code errors, weak or missing documentation, and software and hardware requirements and code complexity. Our findings highlight the importance of journal code and data disclosure policies and suggest potential avenues for enhancing their effectiveness.

  abstract     = {We study the problem of dynamic batch learning in high-dimensional sparse linear contextual bandits, where a decision maker, under a given maximum-number-of-batch constraint and only able to observe rewards at the end of each batch, can dynamically decide how many individuals to include in the next batch (at the end of the current batch) and what personalized action-selection scheme to adopt within each batch. Such batch constraints are ubiquitous in a variety of practical contexts, including personalized product offerings in marketing and medical treatment selection in clinical trials. We characterize the fundamental learning limit in this problem via a regret lower bound and provide a matching upper bound (up to log factors), thus prescribing an optimal scheme for this problem. To the best of our knowledge, our work provides the first inroad into a theoretical understanding of dynamic batch learning in high-dimensional sparse linear contextual bandits. Notably, even a special case of our result—when no batch constraint is present—yields that the simple exploration-free algorithm using the LASSO estimator already achieves the minimax optimal O ˜ ( s 0 T ) regret bound ( s 0 is the sparsity parameter or an upper bound thereof and T is the learning horizon) for standard online learning in high-dimensional linear contextual bandits (for the no-margin case), a result that appears unknown in the emerging literature of high-dimensional contextual bandits.

In addition to developing an isomorphism to pricing with mixed bundling, we obtain three main insights. First, firms optimally use nonlinear bonuses to economize on the rent paid to advisors. Second, equilibrium bonus payments induce advisors to make biased recommendations that are artificially contingent on each other, resulting in an inefficient allocation. Third, if advisor liability is stepped up, firms respond by increasing the size of the bonus, leaving advisor bias unchanged. These results shed light on prevailing compensation practices for advisors and support direct regulatory interference. This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.},

  abstract     = {One million international students study in the United States each year, and the majority of them compete in global labor markets after graduation. I conducted a large-scale field experiment and a companion employer survey to study how employers in China value U.S. college education. I sent more than 27,000 fictitious online applications to business and computer science jobs in China, randomizing the country of college education. I find that U.S.-educated applicants are on average 18% less likely to receive a callback than applicants educated in China, with applicants from very selective U.S. institutions underperforming those from the least selective Chinese institutions. The United States-China callback gap is smaller at high-wage jobs, consistent with employers fearing U.S.-educated applicants have better outside options and would be harder to hire and retain. The gap is also smaller at foreign-owned firms, consistent with Chinese-owned firms knowing less about American education. Controlling for high school quality, test scores, or U.S. work experiences does not attenuate the gap, suggesting that the gap is not driven by employer perceptions of negative selection. A survey of 507 hiring managers at college career fairs finds consistent and additional supporting evidence for the experimental findings.

  abstract     = {The rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies by many organizations has recently raised concerns that AI may eventually replace humans in certain tasks. In fact, when used in collaboration, machines can significantly enhance the complementary strengths of humans. Indeed, because of their immense computing power, machines can perform specific tasks with incredible accuracy. In contrast, human decision makers (DMs) are flexible and adaptive but constrained by their limited cognitive capacity. This paper investigates how machine-based predictions may affect the decision process and outcomes of a human DM. We study the impact of these predictions on decision accuracy, the propensity and nature of decision errors, and the DM’s cognitive efforts. To account for both flexibility and limited cognitive capacity, we model the human decision-making process in a rational inattention framework. In this setup, the machine provides the DM with accurate but sometimes incomplete information at no cognitive cost. We fully characterize the impact of machine input on the human decision process in this framework. We show that machine input always improves the overall accuracy of human decisions but may nonetheless increase the propensity of certain types of errors (such as false positives). The machine can also induce the human to exert more cognitive efforts, although its input is highly accurate. Interestingly, this happens when the DM is most cognitively constrained, for instance, because of time pressure or multitasking. Synthesizing these results, we pinpoint the decision environments in which human-machine collaboration is likely to be most beneficial.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a methodology to price bonds jointly issued by a group of countries—Eurobonds in the euro-area context. We consider two types of bonds; the first is backed by several and joint guarantees (SJGs), and the second features several but not joint guarantees (SNJGs). The pricing of SJG and SNJG bonds reflects different assumptions regarding the pooling of debtors’ fiscal resources. We estimate fiscal limits for the six largest euro-area economies over 2008–2021 and deduce counterfactual Eurobond prices. For the five-year maturity, SNJG bond yield spreads would have been about three times larger than SJG ones over the estimation sample. Hence, issuing SJG bonds could result in gains at the aggregate level. Notwithstanding, our model also predicts that gains may temporarily vanish in periods of acute fiscal stress. We finally envision postissuance redistribution schemes, whereby gains stemming from the issuance of SJG bonds could be shared among participating countries; we argue that these schemes may alleviate the reduction in market discipline resulting from common bonds issuance.

  abstract     = {We examine the extent to which the labor market facilitates the diffusion of tax-planning knowledge across firms. Using a novel data set of tax department employee movements between S&amp;P 1500 firms, we find that firms experience an increase in their tax planning after hiring a tax employee from a tax-aggressive firm. This finding is robust to various research designs and specifications. Consistent with tax-planning knowledge driving the result, we find that the tax-planning benefits are more substantial when the employee is involved in a director-level role and has more experience. Further tests suggest that tax-planning knowledge is highly specific in nature: the increase in tax avoidance is larger when the hiring and former firms are similar (i.e., operating in the same sector or having similar foreign operations), and firms are more likely to hire tax department employees from firms with similar characteristics. Finally, we do not find that the prior firm’s tax planning changes after the employee leaves the firm, suggesting that the tax-planning knowledge simply spreads to the hiring firm and does not leave the prior firm. Our study documents the first order role of the labor market in the diffusion of tax-planning knowledge across firms, and our findings suggest that tax department human capital is a central determinant of tax-planning outcomes.

We propose new trading strategies decomposing the skewness risk premium into jump and leverage effect components, and we analyze the skewness risk premia in the market for S&amp;P 500 index options. We find that the skewness premium is higher when markets are closed than during trading hours, consistently with uncertainty resolution patterns by non-U.S investors; that it increases after left-tail market events; and that it is distinct from the variance premium.

  abstract     = {Do people have well-defined social preferences waiting to be applied when making decisions? Or do they have to construct social decisions on the spot? If the latter, how are those decisions influenced by the way in which information is acquired and evaluated? These temporal dynamics are fundamental to understanding how people trade off selfishness and prosociality in organizations and societies. Here, we investigate how the temporal dynamics of the choice process shape social decisions in three studies using response times and mouse tracking. In the first study, participants made binary decisions in mini-dictator games with and without time constraints. Using mouse trajectories and a starting time drift diffusion model, we find that, regardless of time constraints, selfish participants were delayed in processing others’ payoffs, whereas the opposite was true for prosocial participants. The independent mouse trajectory and computational modeling analyses identified consistent measures of the delay between considering one’s own and others’ payoffs (self-onset delay, SOD). This measure correlated with individual differences in prosociality and predicted heterogeneous effects of time constraints on preferences. We confirmed these results in two additional studies, one a purely behavioral study in which participants made decisions by pressing computer keys, and the other a replication of the mouse-tracking study. Together, these results indicate that people preferentially process either self or others’ payoffs early in the choice process. The intrachoice dynamics are crucial in shaping social preferences and might be manipulated via nudge policies (e.g., manipulating the display order or saliency of self and others’ outcomes) for behavior in managerial or other contexts.

A stronger relationship also reduces loan underpricing. A relationship lead bank relies less on information from syndicate members.

In this paper, we examine whether social media use can improve funding outcomes for firms founded by women and by other people also lacking connections to the investor network, two groups that face greater difficulties in securing VC financing. Using Twitter data and data on VC investment in start-ups from Crunchbase, we explore the interaction effect between Twitter usage and gender and between Twitter usage and the network constraint measure. Overall, we show that social media can mitigate some disparities in financing experienced by these firms through improving information access. We find that this effect is stronger for first-time entrepreneurs than for experienced ones, stronger for attracting new investors than repeat ones, and stronger in more competitive markets. Collectively, these results suggest that social media could primarily help women and less connected individuals obtain financing by alleviating information asymmetry between founders and investors.

  abstract     = {On many multisided app platforms, the supply-side monetizes their work with targeted advertising. The targeting of ads has raised concerns over user privacy and has led to calls for platform firms and regulators to bar this practice. Important for this debate is to understand the consequences that a ban on targeted advertising would have for app development. To inform, we exploit that Google, in 2019, banned targeted advertising in Android children’s games. This setting represents an ideal real-world laboratory and permits a quasi-experimental research design. Our overall finding is that the ban on targeted advertising caused substantial app abandonment. The ban reduced the release of feature updates, particularly for games of young, undiversified, and advertisement-dependent firms. Only games of exceptionally high quality and demand showed an increase in development. Corroborating this picture, affected games were more likely to be delisted. Developers shifted their efforts toward their unaffected games and released fewer new games on average. Further tests substantiate that targeted advertising represented a crucial form of monetization for affected games and that the ban obliterated ad revenues used for app development. Our findings have several implications. To avoid a loss in app innovation, platform firms should consider implementing measures to reduce the burden on developers, especially by creating alternative monetization opportunities. Consumers and policymakers should be aware that targeted advertising plays a crucial role for app development and can use our estimates for designing policies. Thus, consumers’ demand for privacy can conflict with platform firms’ goal to foster app innovation. This paper was accepted by Hemant Bhargava, information systems.

  abstract     = {We examine how asymmetric information in financial markets affects voluntary research and development (R&amp;D) disclosure, considering scientific publications as a disclosure channel. Difference-in-differences regressions around brokerage house mergers and closures, which increase information asymmetry through reductions in analyst coverage, indicate a quick and sustained increase in scientific publications from treated firms relative to the number of publications from control firms. The treatment effects are concentrated among firms with higher information asymmetry and lower investor demand, firms with greater financial constraints, and firms with lower proprietary costs. We do not find evidence of changes in financial disclosure, nor do we find changes in patenting. Results from ordinary least squares regressions show that scientific publications by firms are positively associated with investor attention toward those firms. We complement these results with qualitative evidence from conference calls. Our results highlight the limitations and trade-offs R&amp;D firms face in their financial market disclosure policies.

  abstract     = {Through repeated interactions, firms today refine their understanding of individual users’ preferences adaptively for personalization. In this paper, we use a continuous-time bandit model to analyze firms that recommend content to multihoming consumers, a representative setting for strategic learning of consumer preferences to maximize lifetime value. In both monopoly and duopoly settings, we compare a forward-looking recommendation algorithm that balances exploration and exploitation to a myopic algorithm that only maximizes the quality of the next recommendation. Our analysis shows that, compared with a monopoly, firms competing for users’ attention focus more on exploitation than exploration. When users are impatient, competition decreases the return from developing a forward-looking algorithm. In contrast, development of a forward-looking algorithm may hurt users under monopoly but always benefits users under competition. Competing firms’ decisions to invest in a forward-looking algorithm can create a prisoner’s dilemma.

  abstract     = {This paper studies an emerging subscription model called ship-then-shop. Leveraging its predictive analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) capability, the ship-then-shop firm curates and ships a product to the consumer, after which the consumer shops (i.e., evaluates product fit and makes a purchase decision). The consumer first pays the up-front ship-then-shop subscription fee prior to observing product fit and then pays the product price afterward if the consumer decides to purchase. We investigate how the firm balances the subscription fee and product price to maximize its profit when consumers can showroom. A key finding is the ship-then-shop firm’s nonmonotonic surplus extraction strategy with respect to its prediction capability. As prediction capability increases, the firm first switches from ex ante to ex post surplus extraction (by lowering fees and raising prices). However, if the prediction capability increases further, the firm reverts to ex ante surplus extraction (by raising fees and capping prices). We also find that the ship-then-shop model is most profitable when (i) the prediction capability is advanced, (ii) the search friction in the market is large, or (iii) the product match potential is large. Finally, we show that the marginal return of AI capability on the firm’s profit decreases in search friction but increases in product match potential. Taken together, we provide managerially relevant insights to help guide the implementation of the innovative subscription model. This paper was accepted by Dmitri Kuksov, marketing.

  abstract     = {In most platform environments, the exclusive provision of premium content from leading creators (superstars) is used as a strategy to boost user participation and secure a competitive edge vis-à-vis rivals. In this article, we study the impact of superstar exclusive content provision on platform competition and complementors’ homing decisions. Two competing platforms facilitate interactions between consumers and suppliers, of which the latter are identified by the superstar and a fringe of complementors (e.g., independent developers, amateurs). When platform competition is intense, more consumers become affiliated with the platform favored by superstar exclusivity. This mechanism is self-reinforcing as it generates an entry cascade of complementors, and some complementors single home on the favored platform. We find that cross-group externalities are key in shaping market outcomes. First, exclusivity benefits complementors and might make consumers better off when cross-group externalities are large enough. Second, contrary to conventional wisdom, vertical integration (platform-superstar) may make exclusivity less likely than vertical separation under reasonable conditions. Finally, we discuss implications for the strategies of platform owners, managers of superstars and complementors, and antitrust enforcers. This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.

  abstract     = {We investigate the potential and limits of privacy-preserving corporate blockchain applications for information provision. We provide a theoretical model in which heterogeneous firms choose between adopting a blockchain application or relying on traditional third-party intermediaries to inform the capital market. The blockchain’s ability to generate information depends on each firm’s data profile and all firms’ endogenous adoption decisions. We show that blockchain technology can improve the information environment and outperform traditional institutions with firms’ adoption decisions serving as a credible value signal and the application uncovering firm values by analyzing all participating firms’ data. However, we also characterize an adverse mixed-adoption equilibrium in which neither of the two channels realizes its full potential and information provision declines not only for individual firms, but also in aggregate. The equilibrium is a warning sign that has broad implications for policymakers’ regulatory effort and investors’ assessment of corporate blockchain applications.

  abstract     = {Highly skilled workers are not only a crucial and relatively scarce input into firms’ productive and innovative processes, but are also a critical resource determining competitive advantage. An increasingly high proportion of these workers in the United States were born abroad and permitted to work on skilled worker visas. How do multinational firms respond when artificial constraints, namely, policies restricting skilled immigration, are placed on their ability to hire scarce human capital? This paper combines visa microdata and comprehensive data on U.S. multinational firm activity to demonstrate that firms respond to restrictions on H-1B immigration by increasing foreign affiliate employment at the intensive and extensive margins, particularly in China, India, and Canada. The most impacted jobs were R&amp;D-intensive ones, but there is some evidence that non-R&amp;D employment was also affected. The paper highlights a means by which firms can circumvent constraining policies and mitigate country-level risk, and it also suggests that, for the average multinational company (MNC), this means is imperfect; for every visa rejection, they hire 0.4 employees abroad. The most globalized MNCs are the most likely to respond to these restrictions by offshoring, highlighting that firm capabilities—in the form of prior internationalization—shape the decision and ability to offshore in response to skilled immigration restrictions; indeed, these firms hire 0.9 employees abroad for every visa rejection. More broadly, the paper provides evidence of a push factor for internationalizing knowledge activity: artificial constraints on resources result in firms circumventing restrictive policies in ways that may not be anticipated by policy makers.

This paper investigates the impact of unemployment risk on chief executive officers (CEOs)’ risk-taking incentive compensation. Exploiting state-level changes in unemployment benefits, we find that after unemployment insurance benefits become more generous, boards increase the convex payoff structure of CEO pay to encourage risk taking. The increase in CEOs’ convexity payoff is stronger in firms with more independent and diverse boards, higher ownership of long-term shareholders, and in industries requiring highly skilled labor. Our findings suggest that boards internalize workers’ interests in firms’ risk-taking decisions and executive compensation is one mechanism used.

However, I show that embedded covenants can generate price pressure in collateralized loan obligation (CLO) funds, even though such funds are closed end. Loans held by constrained CLOs report significantly lower cumulative returns than loans held by unconstrained CLOs. This can be explained by contractual arbitrage, a practice by which CLOs exploit loopholes in the design of covenants to mechanically loosen their covenants and avoid covenant breaches. Covenant breaches are associated with significant pecuniary and nonpecuniary costs, affecting CLO compensation, reputation, and career prospects. I show that when covenants breaches are imminent, managers fire sell distressed loans. Hence, I demonstrate a channel by which closed-end funds can also create fire sale risk, akin to their open-end counterparts. This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.

Waves and spillovers have significant effects on share prices. Early-wave target firms have the largest short-run losses in share values and the largest information spillovers on industry peer firms. Late-wave targets’ short-run losses are smaller, but not because they involve less costly instances of misconduct. Rather, late-wave targets are subject to more information spillovers from earlier in the wave. These results indicate that prices incorporate changes in the likelihood that a firm will face wave-related enforcement action for financial misconduct. Short-window share-price losses understate the total share-price impact, particularly for firms whose financial misrepresentation is revealed late in an enforcement wave.

  abstract     = {Tracking the movement of top managers across firms, we document the importance of manager-specific fixed effects in explaining heterogeneity in firm exposures to systematic risk. In equilibrium, manager fixed effects on systematic risk are positively related with manager fixed effects on stock returns. These differences in systematic risk are partially explained by managers’ corporate strategies, such as their preferences for internal growth and financial conservatism. The early career experiences of managers starting their first job in a recession also contribute to differential loadings on systematic risk. These effects are more pronounced when managers wield more influence, as in smaller firms and firms that do not have an independent board. Overall, our results suggest that managers play an important role in shaping a firm’s systematic risk. This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance. Funding: A.

  abstract     = {Existing studies suggest that platform access restriction may cause restricted complementors to switch to competing platforms, which will increase complement quantity on competing platforms. We re-examine this prediction by accounting for the impact of economies of scope on complementor responses to platform access restriction. We argue that restricting a complementor’s access on a platform may prevent it from achieving economies of scope from multi-homing, thereby incentivizing it to abandon both the restricted and (unrestricted) competing platforms. Using rideshare data in New York City, we compare the numbers of trips made by Lyft and Uber drivers, respectively, before and after Lyft restricted drivers’ access on its platform. We find that Lyft’s access restriction reduced trip numbers not only on Lyft but also on Uber. In addition, both Lyft’s and Uber’s trip numbers decreased not only during the restricted low-demand periods (e.g., non-rush hours) but also during the unrestricted high-demand periods (e.g., rush hours). In contrast, after a substantial number of multi-homing drivers left both platforms following Lyft’s access restriction, a subsequent access restriction by Uber led to an increase in trip numbers on Lyft. These results highlight the importance of accounting for interdependencies across complementor activities when designing platform governance policies.

Although high-quality analysts’ average forecast is more accurate than the consensus forecast for firms with a large analyst following, the benefits of using high-quality analysts’ average forecasts are not economically significant.

  abstract     = {We build on recent studies on daughter-to-father influence to explore how male founders’ fatherhood of daughters impacts female representation in their ventures. We find that, conditional on the total number of children, fathering an additional daughter versus a son is associated with a 4% (11%) increase in female director (employee) representation. This daughter-to-father effect gradually matures as daughters grow up and socialize in schools and workplaces, and it increases as daughters age, suggesting that male founders vicariously learn from their daughters about the constraints women face throughout the daughters’ life cycles. Heterogeneity analyses (regarding founder cohort, divorce status, and social class), combined with qualitative evidence, further substantiate the plausibility of vicarious learning as a potential yet understudied mechanism underlying daughter effects. In addition, daughter effects on employee recruitment are concentrated in microbusinesses (number of employees is ≤10) where the founder is close in decision authority to all employees. These findings add important nuances to our understanding of daughter effects in organizational contexts and extend theory of gender homophily in organizations.

  abstract     = {Construct-based models have become a mainstay of management and information systems research. However, these models are likely overfit to the data samples upon which they are estimated, making them risky to use in explanatory, prescriptive, or predictive ways outside a given sample. Empirical researchers currently lack tools to analyze why and how their models may not generalize out of sample. We propose a composite overfit analysis (COA) framework that applies predictive tools to describe the sources and ramifications of overfit in terms of the focal concepts important to empirical researchers: cases, constructs, and causal paths. The COA framework begins by using a leave-one-out crossvalidation procedure to identify cases with unusually high predictive error given their in-sample fit—a difference we describe as predictive deviance . The framework then employs a novel deviance tree method to group deviant cases that have similar predictive deviance and for similar theoretical reasons. We then employ a leave-deviant-group-out method, which sequentially analyzes how each deviant group affects model parameters, thereby identifying potentially unstable paths in the model. We can then infer descriptive reasons for why and how overfit affects a given model and data sample using the grouping criteria of the deviance tree, construct scores of deviant groups, and resulting unstable paths. These insights allow researchers to identify unexpected behavior that could define boundary conditions of their theory or point to new theoretical phenomena. We demonstrate the practical utility of our analytical framework on a technology adoption model in a new context. This paper was accepted by Dongjun Wu, information systems.

  abstract     = {In a large-scale natural field experiment, we partnered with a microlending company in Kyrgyzstan that asked over 180,000 of its clients for donations to social projects as a form of corporate philanthropy. In a 2 × 2 design, we explored two main (preregistered) hypotheses about giving by the poor. First, based on a conjecture that the poor are more price sensitive than the rich and in contrast to previous studies, we hypothesize that matching incentives induce crowding in of out-of-pocket donations. Second, we hypothesize that our population cares about their proximity to the charitable project. We find evidence in favor of the former hypothesis but not the latter. Previous studies of charitable giving focus on middle- or high-income earners in Western countries, neglecting the poor, although the lowest-income groups are often shown to contribute substantial shares of their income to charitable causes. Our results challenge the evidence in the extant literature but are in line with our theoretical model. The implications for fundraising managers are that the optimal design of fundraising campaigns crucially depends on the targeted groups and that donation matching is successful in stimulating participation in poorer populations.

We investigate the consequences of social reference points for risk taking in a laboratory experiment. In the main treatments, risk-taking subjects observe the predetermined earnings of peer subjects when making a risky choice. We exogenously manipulate peers’ earnings and find a significant treatment effect: decision makers make less risk-averse choices in the case of larger peers’ earnings. The treatment effect is consistent with an application of prospect theory to social reference points and cannot be explained by reference points based on counterfactual information, anchoring, and experimenter demand effects. In additional analyses, we show that diminishing sensitivity seems to play an important role in subjects’ risky choices. We explore also whether inequity aversion and expectations-based reference points can account for our findings and conclude that they do not provide plausible alternative explanations for them.

  abstract     = {We develop a dynamic equilibrium model to derive the endogenous relations among firms’ ownership structures, managerial incentives, and asset returns. Ownership concentration is positively related to managerial incentives (PPS) but is negatively related to its expected stock (dollar) return, and volatility. If initial block ownership is above (below) its steady-state level, block ownership and managerial PPS decrease (increase) over time to their steady-state levels, whereas the expected stock returns, return volatilities, and the price impacts of block trades increase (decrease). The convergence of these variables to their respective steady-state levels is faster for firms that are less productive, that are riskier, and whose earnings are more sensitive to managerial actions. The price impact of block trades is larger in firms that are more productive and smaller in firms whose earnings are more sensitive to managerial actions. Changes in the expected stock return over time are negatively affected by changes in block ownership but positively affected by changes in managerial incentives. Relative to owner-managed firms, more widely owned firms have lower expected stock returns and volatilities, faster dispersion of block ownership, and smaller but more variable price impacts of block trades. Compared with diffusely owned firms, firms with significant blockholdings have lower expected stock returns, higher return volatilities, and less powerful managerial incentives.

  abstract     = {Reputation feedback systems assign feedback scores to traders with the aim of separating them according to reliability. There is now a substantial amount of literature on what these mechanisms do well and not so well. Conspicuously absent is a theoretical framework to guide thinking on improving these systems. Here we construct a prototype market, stylized and conceptual in nature, but also suitable for laboratory testing. We use the prototype to examine competing approaches to eliciting feedback from traders. Using entropy to benchmark informativeness, we show that the informativeness of feedback elicitation approaches depends on the ability to solve a coordination problem such that traders use a common mapping to turn experiences into ratings. In theory, different approaches can be about equally informative although the map to coordinate on is more ambiguous in some cases. We then test the approaches in the laboratory. The resulting data find that the most informative feedback is associated with the elicitation methods where the solution to the coordination problem is least ambiguous.

  abstract     = {In this paper, I analyze the joint design of capital requirements and fair value reporting rules for financial institutions with illiquid assets. I specifically examine how prudential regulation aimed at solving agency problems affects financial institutions’ incentives to use Level 2 versus Level 3 fair value reporting, as well as financial stability. Crucially, Level 3 reporting allows financial institutions to use their private information, whereas Level 2 fair values are only measured with public information. Interestingly, my analysis shows regulators may leave to financial institutions the discretion to report illiquid assets at Level 2 or Level 3. Financial institutions then report at Level 3 only if they have good private information about the assets’ quality. Moreover, prudential rules that only rely on Level 2 fair values may be efficient at solving agency problems within financial institutions but may also decrease financial stability. By contrast, prudential rules that leave to financial institutions the discretion to report illiquid assets at Level 2 or Level 3 while relaxing capital requirements may increase financial stability.

  abstract     = {We study how a data-rich firm can benefit by unilaterally sharing its customer data with a data-poor competitor when the data can be used for price discrimination. By sharing data on the segment of market that is more loyal to the competitor and keeping the data on the competitor’s most loyal segment to itself, the firm can induce the competitor to raise its price for consumers on which it does not have data. Such data sharing is an example of a fat-cat strategy as it softens price competition that follows data sharing. Although consumer surplus decreases as a result of data sharing, total surplus can increase when the sharing firm concedes its market share to the competitor, which improves the quality of consumer–firm matching.

  abstract     = {This study tests the hypothesis that competitive strategic interactions foster overconfidence. We experimentally compare a strategic environment in which players have an incentive to overstate their own ability to deter competitors and avoid competition with a nonstrategic environment in which these incentives are removed. Subsequently, we measure the participants’ confidence. Overconfidence persists in the former environment but vanishes in the latter. We provide evidence for three mechanisms that contribute to the persistence of overconfidence. First, participants who win uncontested update their confidence as if they had won in an actual competition. Second, by contrast, participants who do not compete do not update their confidence, thus creating an asymmetry in updating. Third, inflated ability messages are “contagious” because they affect positively how their receivers update their confidence. We provide empirical evidence on the role of these mechanisms to explain the Dunning–Kruger effect and gender differences in confidence.

  abstract     = {This paper studies intertemporal asset pricing in network economies when distress shocks can propagate through the network, similarly to epidemic outbreaks. Two classes of equilibria exist. In the first, idiosyncratic shocks are diversifiable and do not affect valuations; the consumption capital asset pricing model applies. In the second, idiosyncratic shocks generate nondiversifiable long-run cascades of shocks (financial pandemics) that introduce a new risk premium component unexplained by traditional systematic factors. We derive closed solutions for asset prices as a function of the network properties and discuss their properties. After a structural break (1984), we find evidence of a network risk premium that is statistically and economically significant. This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.

  abstract     = {Network effects are often used to justify platform strategies such as acquisitions and subsidies that aggregate users to a single dominant platform. However, when users have heterogeneous preferences, a single platform may not be as effective as multiple platforms from both a strategic perspective and an antitrust perspective. We study the role of network effects and platform differentiation in the context of a merger between the two largest platforms for pet-sitting services. To obtain causal estimates of network effects, we leverage geographic variation in premerger market shares and employ a difference-in-differences approach. Our results reveal that although users of the acquiring platform benefit from the merger thanks to network effects, those of the acquired platform are comparatively worse off because their preferred option is removed. Network effects and differentiation offset each other such that at the market level, users are not substantially better off with a combined platform than with two separate platforms. These findings have strategic and regulatory implications as well as highlight the importance of platform differentiation even in the presence of network effects.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we evaluate the economic value of a blockchain application. In the context of asset-backed securities (ABS) issuance in China, where some ABS are issued with blockchain technology and others are not, we find that the use of blockchain significantly reduces the coupon yield at issuance. Compared with other ABS, those issued using blockchain technology experience a decrease of 31.4 basis points in the yield spread, which corresponds to a relative decrease of 13%. We further document that the effect of blockchain is more pronounced for ABS deals rated by less reputable credit rating agencies and agencies that rely more on issuers for their rating business, for revolving ABS, and for ABS with a larger number of underlying assets. We also find that the use of blockchain can reduce the level of retained interest and number of credit enhancement mechanisms.

Further analysis shows that this sponsorless premium compensates for higher risk and costs of risk mitigation as sponsorless lenders adopt a more hands-on approach emulating VCPE sponsors’ roles.

Using difference-in-differences regressions around the November 19, 2018, tick size reduction in the 2-year Treasury note and a similar change in the 2-year futures eight weeks later, we find significantly improved market quality. Moreover, dealers become more competitive in liquidity provision and price improvement, consistent with the hypothesis that HFTs find liquidity provision less profitable in the smaller tick size environment. Last, we find a significant shift in short-run price discovery toward the cash market, which then reverses when the futures market tick size is reduced, suggesting that the finer pricing grid in the cash market allows traders to act on small information signals that are not profitable to exploit in the larger-tick futures market. Our findings suggest that reducing the tick size in tick-constrained and highly liquid markets like the Treasury market is on balance beneficial. This paper was accepted by Bruno Biais, finance.

  abstract     = {This paper studies the cost of capital effect of a major regulatory technology, or RegTech, event: the staggered implementation of the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system of the Securities and Exchange Commission in the period from 1993 to 1996. This event represents a largely exogenous shock to corporate information dissemination technologies, resulting in a considerable reduction in information acquisition costs for investors. Using a difference-in-differences research design, we show that the cost of equity capital declines substantially after a firm switches from paper filing to mandatory electronic filing in EDGAR. The effect is stronger for small firms and firms with low analyst coverage and low institutional ownership. We identify three channels through which EDGAR affects a firm’s cost of capital: the liquidity, risk-taking, and corporate governance channels. EDGAR implementation also improves a firm’s investment efficiency significantly. We find evidence that the marginal value of a firm’s capital investment and cash is higher during the post-EDGAR period. This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting. Funding: C.

We measure the number of estimates using the frequency of the use of the word estimate in the qualitative portions of a firm’s Notes to the Financial Statements (footnotes). Motivated by arguments regarding the impact of estimation errors in accruals, we hypothesize and find that the accruals of firms that have more estimates have a lower relation with future earnings (i.e., lower persistence) and a lower association with their past, current, and future cash flows.

  abstract     = {Despite a large minimum wage literature that analyzes employee outcomes, there is less evidence on firm performance, prices, and quality. Exploiting staggered changes in U.S. minimum wages during 2000–2008 and census data on more than 29,000 hotel properties, we find that doubling the minimum wage as currently debated would reduce average hotel revenues by 6% per year and their occupancy rates by 3.1%. Responses vary by employer quality and organizational form. Although luxury hotels pass through cost increases to their customers with no impact on their revenues, upscale hotels facing more price-sensitive customers reduce prices but still suffer losses in occupancy rates and revenues as they struggle with preserving the expected quality level. They are also most likely to see quality downgrades from their segment. The lower-end hotels also pass through cost increases to their customers but, unlike luxury hotels, face significant declines in occupancy rates and revenues. Overall, the performance effects of minimum wage increases are nonmonotonic across quality. We also find negative impacts on hotel entry rates, although the performance and entry effects appear to be short lived. Furthermore, the negative effects of minimum wages dominate in states without right-to-work regulation, suggesting the need for a more comprehensive approach to labor market regulation.

  abstract     = {We study the interaction of flexible capital utilization and depreciation for expected returns and investment of firms. Empirically, an investment strategy that buys (sells) equities with low (high) utilization rates earns 5% per annum. Utilization predicts excess returns beyond other production-based variables. We reconcile this novel utilization premium quantitatively using a production model. The model suggests that flexible utilization is important for matching the cross-sectional distribution of investment and stock prices jointly. A model without flexible utilization yields many counterfactuals that flexible utilization addresses by making depreciation fluctuate endogenously. Overall, utilization tightens the link between firms’ production and valuations. This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.

  abstract     = {The convention when calculating corporate bond trading costs is to estimate bid–ask spreads that customers pay, implicitly assuming that dealers always provide liquidity to customers. We show that, contrary to this assumption, customers increasingly provide liquidity following the adoption of post-2008 banking regulations, and thus, conventional bid–ask spread measures underestimate the cost of dealers’ liquidity provision. Among large trades wherein dealers use inventory capacity, customers pay 40%–60% wider spreads than before the crisis. Customers’ balance-sheet capacity and their trading relationships with dealers are important determinants of customer liquidity provision. This paper was accepted by Bruno Biais, finance.

This anomaly is not accounted for in the standard four-factor framework, nor by the addition of a betting-against-beta factor to the benchmark model. We identify the active component of alpha (active alpha) not attributable to the passive effects related to beta. Active alpha is persistent and associated with superior portfolio performance. We find that, although many investors use standard alpha to allocate capital, a subset of sophisticated investors allocate their money based on active alpha. Our procedure is useful across the commonly used benchmark models for measuring performance and can be extended to accommodate other potential factor beta anomalies.

  abstract     = {Using current performance to set future targets can discourage effort and reduce performance. Our study examines whether this ratchet effect also undermines incentives of high-level managers and executives. We use a dynamic model to show that empirical tests used in prior literature can falsely reject the null hypothesis of no ratchet effect. We also motivate a new test that can better detect the adverse incentives effects of target setting. Specifically, we show that the ratchet effect can be identified as the effect of past performance on changes in perceived target difficulty. We use panel data from nine annual 2011–2019 surveys to implement this test. Similar to prior studies, we find strong evidence that targets are revised upward following good performance. Nevertheless, we reject the ratchet effect hypothesis because we further find that good performance in one period is associated with a decrease in perceived target difficulty in the next period. This finding is more pronounced in settings where well-performing managers have more private information about future performance and where long-term commitments are more credible.

  abstract     = {Whereas trust is the cornerstone of any market’s functioning, it is of particular importance in markets that are unregulated, illiquid, and opaque, such as the art market. This study examines the role of authenticity, as captured by provenance information in auction catalogs, on the probability of auctioned oil paintings, watercolors, and prints being sold; their price formation; and returns. Auction catalogs include four authenticity dimensions: pedigree (ownership “blockchain,” descendance information; type of past owners, such as renowned collectors; and past sales records), exhibition history (e.g., in famous museums or galleries), literature coverage (e.g., in catalogues raisonnés or authoritative press), and certification (e.g., artist’s physical testimonial, expert opinions). We find that trust, proxied by provenance information, increases the probability of a work being sold by up to 4%, leads to hammer price premiums up to 54%, and increases annualized returns by 5%–16%. To address potential endogeneity problems between the provision of provenance and past prices/price expectations, we perform quasi-natural experiments in difference-in-differences settings on auction houses’ provenance policy changes following authenticity litigation and on a contamination effect of the discovery of fakes and forgeries on the oeuvre of forged artists. We also test transactions less affected by past prices, such as estate sales following the death of a collector. The findings on the relation between provenance and prices are robust to artist reputation, artistic style, auction house reputation, art market liquidity, and artist career timing.

  abstract     = {We propose a novel framework for investigating learning dynamics on the debt market. Observing a firm’s survival of apparently distressed periods, the market eliminates asset value estimates that are too low to be consistent with the observed survival. Therefore, the firm’s cost of debt becomes lower for given financials. Relative to a perfect information setting, the firm strategically delays default to benefit from a subsequently lower cost of debt. Default comes as a surprise, as it reveals the currently worst possible asset value as correct. The surprise effect is mitigated for debt with higher performance sensitivity and for lower ex ante information asymmetry. This paper was accepted by Gustavo Manso, finance.

  abstract     = {International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 9 is of practical relevance to banks because it requires intense monitoring of borrowers to record timely loan losses. Using data from 50 countries, we find that accounting-driven bank monitoring due to IFRS 9 adoption reduces firms’ reliance on bank debt relative to public debt. This finding is consistent with firms experiencing more costly bank monitoring after a shift in regulatory reporting that requires banks to monitor borrowers more intensely. In further analyses, we find that the negative effect of IFRS 9 adoption on bank debt reliance is more pronounced with more stringent regulatory supervision of banks, consistent with regulatory stringency exacerbating costly bank monitoring for firms. We also find that the negative effect is stronger when firms can more easily switch from bank debt to public debt financing, consistent with the relevance of switching costs in firms’ decisions to avoid costly bank monitoring.

  abstract     = {This study demonstrates the importance of separating the probabilities of misstatement occurrence and detection when examining financial statement restatements. Despite the many benefits of examining the probability of restatements using traditional logistic models, interpretations of these models are clouded by partial observability—only subsequently detected misstatements are observable. We propose addressing this often overlooked issue by implementing a bivariate probit model with partial observability. We demonstrate the importance of separating these latent probabilities by re-examining three prior restatement studies and show the importance of separating the occurrence and detection probabilities. Our evidence suggests that future studies interested in restatements as a measure of accounting quality should consider implementing bivariate probit models as one way to address the partial observability inherent in this setting.

  abstract     = {Exhibiting altruism toward and cooperativeness with others is a key ingredient for successful work relationships and managerial decision making. Rising political polarization creates a hazard because it ruptures this fabric and impedes the interaction of employees, especially across political isles. This paper’s focus is to examine various behavioral-, belief-, and norm-based layers of (non)strategic decision making that are plausibly affected by polarization. I quantify this phenomenon via five preregistered studies in the context of Donald J. Trump, comprising 15 well-powered behavioral experiments and a diverse set of over 8,600 participants. To capture the pervasiveness of polarization, I contrast the findings with various political and nonpolitical identities. Overall, I consistently document strong heterogeneous effects: ingroup-love occurs in the perceptional domain (how close one feels toward others), whereas outgroup-hate occurs in the behavioral domain (how one helps/harms/cooperates with others). The rich setting also enables me to examine the mechanisms of observed intergroup conflict, which can be attributed to one’s grim expectations regarding cooperativeness of the opposing faction, rather than one’s actual unwillingness to cooperate. For the first time, the paper also tests whether popular behavioral interventions (defaults and norm-nudges) can reduce the detrimental impact of polarization in the contexts studied here. The tested interventions improve prosociality but are ineffective in closing the polarization gap. This paper was accepted by Yan Chen, behavioral economics and decision analysis.
