  abstract     = {Problem definition : United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3.8 states that health coverage should be universal by 2030. This is challenging in rural and poor areas. To address this challenge, mobile outreach teams of healthcare workers visit a fixed set of remote sites to provide healthcare services. Because of dynamics in demand and supply, once-rational site-to-team assignment decisions can become far from optimal over time. This paper considers the problem of reassigning sites to teams to maximize effectiveness. Solving this problem through a central planner does not fit the context: outreach teams commonly have a high degree of decision-making autonomy. We study a decentralized approach where subsets of teams collaborate in a series of team meetings to reassign sites. The key question for decision makers is whether and when such an approach is effective. Methodology/results : We propose a mixed-integer programming model for centralized site reassignment. We extend this model to represent the decentralized approach and develop a set of simple decision rules for this approach. We use empirical data from six country outreach programs of the nongovernmental organization MSI Reproductive Choices. Our results suggest that, when properly designed, decentralized decision making performs close to centralized decision making, and even outperforms it in the case of inaccurate information at the central level. The finding remains valid when demand and supply fluctuate, and is insensitive to the chosen objective. Managerial implications : Humanitarian organizations currently deploy mobile outreach teams to provide a wide variety of health services. We present several useful insights for decision makers in humanitarian organizations when making design choices, taking account of context. In particular, we show that decentralized site reassignment provides a feasible and effective alternative to centralized approaches in many contexts.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Min-max or max-min objective criteria naturally arise in many resource allocation applications, especially when the attendant goal involves distribution of a limited resource across multiple subsystems, locations, or activities. Each has a different consumption rate of the resource. In this setting, the decision maker is interested in optimizing the system performance, which can be measured in terms of the smallest or largest order statistic across subsystems. Examples include the allocation of health resources to maximize the first runout time or to minimize the maximum delay. Methodology/results : In the literature, there are no unified theoretical and computational results on the optimal allocations for these problems. Thus, in this paper, we develop key theoretical properties of the attendant stochastic resource allocation problems, providing a technical condition for the objective functions to have favorable properties, upon which we derive novel optimal allocation rules with clear interpretation. Managerial implications : The proportional allocation rule can be interpreted as a robust solution when the full distribution of the interarrival time is unknown. It generally has poor performance, especially when the resource consumption rates vary across locations, which happens regularly in practice. Our allocation rule is exact and should be used for the allocation of scarce resources—that is, when the number of resources per location is limited, which is often encountered in healthcare settings.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : A service is offered at certain locations (“facilities”) in a geographical region. Customers can appear anywhere in the region, and each customer chooses a facility based on travel distance as well as expected waiting time. Customer decisions affect waiting times by increasing the load on a facility, and thus, they impact other customers’ decisions. The service provider can also influence service quality by adjusting service rates at each facility. Methodology/results : Using a combination of queueing models and computational geometry, we characterize demand equilibria in such spatial service systems. An equilibrium can be visualized as a partition of the region into service zones that form as a result of customer decisions. Service rates can be set in a way that achieves the best-possible social welfare purely through decentralized customer behavior. Managerial implications : We provide techniques for computing and visualizing demand equilibria as well as calculating optimal service rates. Our analytical and numerical results indicate that in many situations, resource allocation is a far more significant source of inefficiency than decentralized behavior. Funding: J. G.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Contrary to traditional queueing theory, recent field studies in B2C services indicate that pooled queues may be less efficient than dedicated queues. Methodology/results : We use two online experiments in the healthcare delivery context to replicate this finding and assess the interplay of servers’ customer ownership and queue length awareness as potential underlying mechanisms. We operationalize customer ownership as the extent to which servers feel ownership toward their customers and queue length awareness as the extent to which servers are able to accurately quantify their number of customers. We find that, following a change in queue configuration, dedicated queues outperform pooled queues with respect to processing speed without sacrificing quality. The reduction in speed is partially mediated by the servers’ queue length awareness and partially suppressed by their ownership of customers in queue. The former is because servers turn out to be less likely to underestimate their load, which makes them work faster. The latter is because ownership of customers in queue may distract servers from the customer in service. When the queue configuration changes from a dedicated to a pooled one, the shorter processing times and higher levels of queue length awareness persist across the change, unlike the higher ownership of customers in the queue. Managerial implications : In discretionary service settings, switching to a dedicated queue is often beneficial in terms of operational performance, partly because the increased queue length awareness motivates servers to work faster; however, the increased degree of customer ownership of those in queue may distract them and result in a slowdown.

Methodology/results : Based on an agency model with general demand and cost functions, we derive optimality conditions for implementable contracts that can achieve the second-best outcome in all scenarios. The contracts are in the forms of a menu with linear compensation for demand or sales, incorporating inventory costs. Moreover, the contracts feature adjustments in compensation corresponding to the ordering level if it is delegated. Managerial implications : Our study reveals that, under reasonably mild conditions, optimal salesforce contracts can still maintain relatively simple forms, even when confronted with common operational factors and generalized demand and cost functions. However, the contracts must be tailored to suit the operational settings. Intriguingly, neither the loss of demand information nor the delegation of inventory decisions would compromise system efficiency at optimum. Funding: H.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study settings where agents sequentially search among different options under competition. Motivated by labor markets and the allocation of kidneys from deceased donors, we focus on the effect of (i) the mechanism to collect decisions, that is, whether all agents make their decisions simultaneously or sequentially, and (ii) competition, that is, the number of agents who are searching from a shared pool of options. Methodology/results : We introduce a model of sequential search under competition, in which agents are exogenously prioritized and must decide when to stop their search to maximize the chosen option’s value. We characterize the optimal policy, which defines a sequence of thresholds that dictates when each agent should accept an option based on their priority relative to others still searching and the number of remaining options. Our analysis reveals that neither the mechanism for collecting agents’ decisions nor the number of lower-priority agents influences the optimal policy. To test these predictions, we designed and conducted a laboratory experiment replicating our theoretical model. The results indicate significant deviations from the optimal policy. Moreover, we find that the mechanism significantly affects agents’ decisions due to primarily two drivers: (i) saliency of competition and (ii) frustration. Finally, we identify an “illusion of competition” effect, whereby agents use significantly lower thresholds when the number of agents with lower priority increases. Managerial implications : Our results show that a higher perception of competition and using a simultaneous mechanism (i.e., batch offering) significantly decrease the thresholds that agents use to guide their search, making them stop their search earlier. Thus, clearinghouses that suffer from inefficient discard of options should increase the saliency of competition and use batch offerings to reduce agents’ selectivity and mitigate waste.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : This paper studies how polarization influences content consumption and production on digital platforms that monetize consumer engagement. Specifically, we consider a content that advocates a particular position on a divisive issue. Consumers with polarized preferences toward the content’s position are sequentially exposed to the content. Initially, consumers are uncertain about the content quality, but they have the opportunity to learn about it using aggregate consumption metrics and other informative signals provided by the platform. Methodology/results : Using a stylized model, we find that under polarization, social learning based on consumption metrics can mislead consumers to perceive low-quality content as higher quality, even in the long run. Consequently, content providers may decrease their effort to improve content quality. These effects are amplified for more polarizing issues, especially when the content’s position is “mainstream” (i.e., aligned with the majority of the population). Our results thus provide a potential explanation for the proliferation of low-quality, polarizing content on platforms. Managerial implications : We offer normative guidance for content platforms seeking to enhance content quality, including offering consumers information to aid the social learning mechanism and appropriately selecting audience to mitigate the echo-chamber effect. Additionally, we propose payment schemes based on content popularity as an effective means to encourage content providers to improve quality.

The principal may commit to publicly observed bilateral contracts or offer secretly observed contracts to each agent simultaneously. We also consider the problem of sequential contracting. Methodology/results : By correcting the main analysis in Hu and Qi [Hu B, Qi A (2018) Optimal procurement mechanisms for assembly. Manufacturing Service Oper. Management 20(4):655–666], we employ passive beliefs to study secret contracting. We show that there is a unique configuration of two-part tariffs under secret offers in both simultaneous and sequential contracting. We also extend the analysis to take into account ex post individual rationality (IR), which is arguably more relevant in this assembly setting. With ex post IR, we show that the traditional two-part tariffs should be augmented with payment adjustments. Managerial implications : We find that the efficiency achieved through public offers can be maintained with secret offers in this assembly setting contrary to conventional wisdom.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Despite extensive research on buyback contracts in supply chain management, little attention has been given to a direct comparison between a traditional full-quantity, partial-credit (FQ) buyback contract and an alternative full-credit, partial-quantity (FC) contract, especially when considering the behavioral biases of the retailer. This study aims to fill this research gap by exploring how these biases influence contract performance and offer practical guidelines for suppliers. Methodology/results : Through controlled laboratory experiments and structural model estimation, we show that the ordering decisions made by human retailers are jointly affected by three behavioral biases—loss aversion, prospective accounting, and psychological cost of inventory error—and these biases differ in magnitude between the two contracts. Incorporating these biases into a behavioral retailer’s utility function, we then analytically examine which buyback policy the supplier should choose. When the wholesale price is exogenously given, the supplier should adopt the FC contract for high-margin (low-cost) products. Conversely, when the supplier has the power to set both the wholesale and buyback prices, the FC contract is generally more beneficial for low-margin products. Finally, when the product cost is sufficiently high, a wholesale price contract may be advantageous over buyback policies. Managerial implications : The managerial implication of this paper is significant for suppliers who have to choose between different buyback policies. The paper suggests that the supplier should carefully consider not just the economic, but also the behavioral dimensions when making contract decisions, particularly when dealing with a retailer influenced by behavioral biases. Specifically, the choice between FQ and FC contracts is influenced by two key environmental factors: the production cost of the product and the nature of wholesale pricing. Understanding these elements allows suppliers to be flexible in contract choices and design appropriate return policies for their downstream supply chain partners. Funding: P.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We introduce and formalize a concept termed conditional lead-time flexibility (CLF), which refers to the industry practice where a manufacturer requests that its upstream suppliers dynamically adjust the pipeline orders’ remaining lead times. Over a finite horizon, an assemble-to-order manufacturer makes joint decisions on inventory replenishment and lead-time adjustment to minimize the total discounted expected cost. Methodology/results : The problem is formulated as a multiperiod dynamic programming with an enlarged state space to track the adjustable pipeline orders. The replenishment and lead-time adjustment decisions are made sequentially in each period. The analysis reveals that (i) the optimal cost-to-go function is both convex and additively separable, that (ii) both the optimal replenishment and lead-time adjustment decisions follow general base-stock policies, and that (iii) the convexity and additive separability allow us to perform a derivative analysis on the optimality equations and design an efficient algorithm. Managerial implications : Using real industry data, we numerically find that (i) CLF achieves notable cost savings over a wide range of parameters, that (ii) the value of CLF comes from both the order expediting and deferring, and that (iii) CLF outperforms dual sourcing when the unit adjustment cost is less than 40% of the unit ordering cost from the express source.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : When a firm (buyer) outsources the production of a new product/component to a supplier subject to random yield, a major challenge is that the supplier’s yield is usually private information. In practice, yield information is often shared via nonbinding communication—for example, a supplier self-assessment report. We examine whether such communication can be truthful and credible. Methodology/results : We analyze a cheap-talk game in which, given a simple contract that specifies the prices for each unit ordered and for each effective unit delivered, the supplier first communicates its yield level, and then the buyer determines an order quantity. We prove that truthful communication can emerge in equilibrium. To do so, we first show that if knowing the supplier’s type, the buyer will either inflate or reduce the order quantity to cope with a lower yield, depending on the product’s market potential. Under asymmetric information, the supplier will truthfully communicate its type if (i) the buyer with a high market potential intends to inflate the order quantity for a lower yield, but the buyer with a low market potential prefers to do the reverse; and (ii) the supplier is uncertain about the product’s market potential, which is the buyer’s private information, and anticipates that a hard-to-make product is more likely to have a higher market potential. Managerial implications : Truthful cheap-talk communication can emerge in equilibrium when the product’s market size and yield are negatively correlated. Truthful communication always benefits the buyer and consumers and may benefit the supplier if the product has sufficient market potential and the supplier’s production cost is not too high. Moreover, the buyer can be better off paying more for the input quantity (although part of the output is defective) or paying a higher wholesale rate if the adjustment in payment terms enhances communication credibility.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : About 30 million tons of plastic waste reaches the oceans each year, mostly from low- and middle-income coastal countries. We study novel business models of firms aiming to reduce ocean plastic pollution with a triple-bottom-line (TBL) objective—a weighted sum of profit, environmental impact, and social impact. These firms sell (a) plastic offsets and (b) segregated plastic. Methodology/results : We develop and analyze models where a firm partners with a local plastic recycling supply chain to sell (a), (b), or both via collecting and recycling ocean-bound plastic. Considering additionality (i.e., that the firm can only sell plastic offsets based on recycled plastic that is additional to the plastic recycled without the firm’s presence), we solve the equilibrium outcomes by maximizing the firm’s TBL objective. For the special case of a for-profit firm, we show that additionality can decrease the firm’s social and environmental impacts when selling (a) only or when selling both (a) and (b). Additionality may also alter the effect of the local recycled plastic market (i.e., the number of collectors and the recycled plastic price) on the firm. We find similar insights under the TBL objective via a numerical study calibrated with real data. Managerial implications : When firms decide whether to integrate and promote additionality, they must be careful because it may not only reduce their profit but also, reduce their social and environmental impacts. Moreover, we find that selling both (a) and (b) can generate a much higher TBL objective value than selling either one alone. We also find that firms employing a TBL objective can generate much larger environmental and social impacts with a slight reduction in profits than profit-maximizing firms. Our model and results provide insights into new initiatives for tackling ocean plastic pollution. Funding: O. Baron and G.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Opportunity zones (OZs) are designated census tracts in which real estate investments can gain tax benefits. Introduced by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the goal of the OZ program is to foster economic development in distressed neighborhoods. In this paper, we investigate and optimize the OZ selection process and examine the impact of OZs by exploiting two data sets: a proprietary real estate data set that includes 36.1 million residential transactions spanning all 50 U.S. states and census-tract demographics data between 2010 and 2019. Methodology/results : We show that census tracts with higher poverty and unemployment rates were more likely to be selected. Counterintuitively, however, tracts with a higher average real estate price were also more likely to be selected. We then apply difference-in-differences, synthetic control, and matching techniques to rigorously assess the impact of the OZ program on two key real estate metrics: price and transaction volume. We find that the OZ program increased real estate prices by 4.03%–6.13% but do not observe a significant effect on the transaction volume. We also find that investors primarily targeted the high-end real estate market, namely, exhibiting a cherry-picking behavior. To better fulfill its intended societal and economic goals, we propose an optimization framework with fairness considerations for OZ assignment decisions. We show that the OZs assigned from our fairness-aware optimization formulation can better serve distressed communities and mitigate investors’ cherry-picking behavior. Managerial implications : Our paper underscores the importance of incorporating fairness in OZ designation to achieve a desirable real estate market reaction. Our large-scale empirical analysis provides a comprehensive assessment of the current government OZ assignment, and our fairness-aware optimization framework provides concrete recommendations for policy makers.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Multistage stochastic programming is a well-established framework for sequential decision making under uncertainty by seeking policies that can be dynamically adjusted as uncertainty is realized. Often, for example, because of contractual constraints, such flexible policies are not desirable, and the decision maker may need to commit to a set of actions for a certain number of periods. Two-stage stochastic programming might be better suited to such settings, where first-stage decisions do not adapt to the uncertainty realized. In this paper, we propose a novel alternative approach, named as adaptive two-stage stochastic programming, where each component of the decision policy requiring limited flexibility has its own revision point, a period prior to which the decisions are determined at the beginning of the planning until this revision point, and after which they are revised for adjusting to the uncertainty realized thus far until the end of the planning. We then analyze this approach over the capacity expansion planning problem, that may require limited flexibility over expansion decisions. Methodology/results : We provide a generic mixed-integer programming formulation for the adaptive two-stage stochastic programming problem with finite support, in particular, for scenario trees, and show that this problem is NP-hard in general. Next, we focus on the capacity expansion planning problem and derive bounds on the value of adaptive two-stage programming in comparison with the two-stage and multistage approaches in terms of revision points. We propose several heuristic solution algorithms based on this bound analysis. These algorithms either provide approximation guarantees or computational advantages in solving the resulting adaptive two-stage stochastic problem. Managerial implications : We provide insights on the choice of the revision times based on our analytical analysis. We further present an extensive computational study on a generation capacity expansion planning problem with different generation resources including renewable energy. We demonstrate the value of adopting adaptive two-stage approach against the existing policies under limited flexibility and highlight the efficiency of the proposed heuristics along with practical implications on the studied problem.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Volunteers, the primary workforce for many charities, represent a complex labor pool; they are unreliable and exhibit substantial heterogeneity in both performance and affinity to the organization. Additionally, many volunteers engage not only to contribute but also to immerse themselves in a volunteering experience that, if rewarding, can inspire them to become future donors. However, practical approaches to volunteer management commonly neglect these traits and the consequential impact that tactical decision-making can have on nurturing potential future donations. Methodology/results : Building on a previous study, we propose a forward-looking volunteer scheduling model that accounts for the heterogeneity among volunteers, mitigates both understaffing and overstaffing costs, and explicitly correlates individual time contribution with their monetary donations. We provide analytical solutions when the charity can reliably estimate distributions (e.g., uniform distribution) from data and suggest a distribution-free method to offer actionable insights where data are limited or uncertain. Managerial implications : At the strategic level, by viewing volunteers as potential donors, the optimal staffing strategy balances meeting the charity’s labor needs and maximizing volunteers’ satisfaction, as this satisfaction influences their likelihood of becoming future donors. We show that charities could avert substantial losses by adopting an integrative approach, thereby challenging conventional organizational structures that compartmentalize volunteer and donor management. Our model suggests that building robust data infrastructures can significantly advance the charity’s core mission. Paradoxically, efforts to increase labor productivity may inadvertently undermine this objective. At the operational level, we provide an Excel-based decision support tool and a decision-tree framework to navigate optimal policies, determining when and how a charity can rely on episodic (less reliable) volunteers. Our results confirm that reducing uncertainty in volunteer turnout benefits charities. However, we also find that when labor value is low, episodic volunteers are preferred, whereas formal (reliable) volunteers are favored when labor value is high.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : This study identifies a resource misallocation problem in Medicare Advantage (MA), the United States’ largest healthcare capitation program, which may result in discrepancies between patients’ health status and the healthcare resources allocated to them. Methodology/results : Utilizing a large commercial insurance database with claims from more than 2 million MA enrollees, this research investigates the allocation of MA capitation payments. By exploiting an exogenous policy shock on MA capitation payments through a difference-in-difference design, we find empirical evidence of an illegal practice known as “cross-subsidization.” This practice involves MA health plans strategically reallocating portions of the capitation payments intended for one group of patients to spend on another group of patients. Additionally, we show that this cross-subsidization practice is associated with the risk selection problem in MA, where low-risk patients are more likely to enroll in MA compared with high-risk patients. Managerial implications : This research unveils a previously undocumented healthcare resource misallocation problem, that is, strategic cross-subsidization. This practice is explicitly prohibited by law in the United States due to its heightened effect on the undesired risk selection within capitation programs, where health plans cherry-pick profitable enrollees through strategic benefit designs. Our study has direct practical implications as it underscores the need for greater transparency in MA claims data to enable the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services to more effectively administer the MA program.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Social influenced emotions of pride and guilt have been identified by the environmental psychology (EP) literature as crucial drivers impacting recycling behavior, but they have mostly been overlooked in operations management (OM) research. In contrast, EP studies often ignore firms’ operational decisions. We analyze the impacts of both social influence and firms’ operational decisions to provide a comprehensive understanding of consumers’ recycling behaviors, which is essential for realizing remanufacturing’s full potential. Methodology/results : We consider a closed-loop supply chain consisting of a manufacturer selling a single product to a consumer community. Consumers’ recycling behavior depends on both the recycling reward offered by the manufacturer, as well as intrinsic and socially influenced pride (guilt) from recycling (not recycling). We develop an evolutionary game to model consumers’ recycling behavior and characterize the resulting equilibrium recycling rate, which is then integrated into the manufacturer’s decision problem. We characterize the manufacturer’s optimal strategy and the equilibrium recycling rate in four distinct regions defined by both the product’s overall difficulty of remanufacturing and the underlying strengths of consumers’ socially influenced pride and guilt. We show that in settings where the product has a moderately high difficulty of remanufacturing and consumers have stronger socially influenced pride than guilt, the manufacturer optimally induces an interior recycling rate. In such scenarios, there exist win-win pathways in using social influence–based interventions to increase both the manufacturer’s profit and the recycling rate. However, misalignment may occur when consumers substantially care for the product’s recyclability. Managerial implications : This study bridges sustainable OM and EP literature by analyzing how consumers’ socially influenced emotions of pride and guilt affect a manufacturer’s optimal decisions, profits, and the resulting recycling rate. We provide important insights for designing effective and efficient social influence–based interventions to improve recycling rates. Funding: W.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Shocks that trigger supply chain disruptions inflict initial losses by damaging firms’ assets. The disruption can then cascade when an affected firm fails to deliver to its buyer, thereby interrupting the buyer’s operations, and continue thus across multiple levels (tiers) in the supply chain. To protect against such disruption cascades, firms can make ex ante investments in risk mitigation. These investments depend heavily on the operational characteristics of network participants and their interconnections. Gathering operational information can be challenging. Our aim is to shed light on the forces that govern information requirements for risk mitigation. Methodology/results : We introduce a game-theoretic model to characterize the equilibrium mitigation by firms in a decentralized arborescent network facing severe disruptions. We find that when the trigger shocks are nonconcurrent events, the equilibrium mitigation by a firm displays a limited vertical dependence on the operational attributes of suppliers that are farther away in tier (network) distance. Specifically, we show that information about a firm’s extended local neighborhood —up to its tier 2 suppliers—suffices to characterize its equilibrium mitigation. Allowing for concurrent shocks to simultaneously strike multiple firms increases the information requirement at partner firms that typically lie within two tiers downstream from the firms experiencing concurrent shocks. Managerial implications : Full supply chain visibility is costly. The literature offers little guidance on how to prioritize efforts to enhance visibility into the attributes of supply chain partners. Rather than a blanket call for greater visibility, our results proffer nuanced managerial prescriptions for the extent to which risk mitigation requires such visibility.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : As the largest retail channel in the world, nanostores are the source of income for millions of shopkeepers in developing countries. Being cash constrained, nanostore shopkeepers face the challenge of deciding how much of their available cash to retain to support their families and how much to invest in acquiring products from their suppliers, who visit the nanostore with different frequencies and offer products with different margins. We study how shopkeepers deal with this challenge while seeking to make their nanostores financially sustainable. Methodology/results : We conduct an empirical study to explain how suppliers’ visit frequency influences shopkeepers’ ordering behavior. The study integrates more than 29 million orders placed with a multinational manufacturer. Results show that visit frequency adjustments by the supplier cause nanostores to experience a significant discontinuity in their orders such that reduced order frequency leads to significantly lower orders per unit of time. Building on this insight, we ran two experimental studies that make use of theoretical benchmarks to explore how shopkeepers’ ordering decisions are influenced by supplier visit frequency, product margin, and shopkeepers’ cash constraints. We analyze how and when shopkeepers deviate from the theoretical benchmarks and show how the available budget moderates the relationship between suppliers’ visit frequencies and shopkeepers’ order volumes, normalized by unit of time. Our results give support to the theory of diversification bias and show how this bias might bring additional benefits to suppliers offering low-margin products. Finally, we propose a behavioral model that explains how shopkeepers’ decisions might be driven by their preference toward inventory (i.e., leftover versus shortage aversion) and toward cash (i.e., liquidity preferences). Managerial implications : Our findings suggest that suppliers should deploy high-frequency visits to cash-constrained nanostores regardless of the margin that their products provide for shopkeepers. For low-margin suppliers, this mitigates shopkeepers’ tendencies to reduce the order volume per unit of time following a visit frequency decrease. For high-margin suppliers, high-frequency visits mitigate shopkeepers’ overdiversification bias and liquidity preference. Financial and digital schemes that reduce the need for high-frequency visits may lead to substantial efficiency gains.

When multiple alternatives could potentially solve the entrepreneur’s problem, advisors can lead the entrepreneur’s exploration by choosing which alternative(s) to suggest and in what sequence. Methodology/results : We develop a dynamic game-theoretic model that captures the sequential interaction between an advisor and an entrepreneur. The advisor chooses how to recommend alternative solutions, and the entrepreneur chooses which solution to try. The trial’s success depends on the viability of a solution and the entrepreneur’s execution capability. When a trial of a recommended solution fails, the belief about the viability of the solution is updated. Managerial implications : Our analysis reveals that the advisor should strategically recommend alternatives based on the entrepreneur’s execution capability, trial costs, and correlation between alternatives (among other factors). When the trial of the first alternative fails, the advisor should readily offer a new alternative if the entrepreneur’s capability is either very high or very low. Otherwise, the advisor should encourage the entrepreneur to try the same solution multiple times. In order to motivate and sustain the entrepreneur’s exploration over time and across solutions, the advisor may find it optimal to recommend inferior solutions before superior ones (e.g., when trial costs are different or the entrepreneur can improve her capability with experience) or recommend multiple solutions simultaneously (e.g., when there is correlation between alternatives).

  abstract     = {Problem definition : How can retailers incentivize customers to make healthier food choices? Price, convenience, and taste are known to be among the main drivers behind such choices. Unfortunately, healthier food options are often expensive and not adequately promoted. However, we are observing recent efforts to nudge customers toward healthier food. Methodology/results : In this paper, we conducted a field experiment with a global convenience store chain to better understand how different add-on bundle promotions influence healthy food choices. We considered three types of add-on bundles sequentially: (i) an unhealthy bundle (when customers purchased a coffee, they could add a pastry for $1), (ii) a healthy bundle (offering a healthy snack, such as fruit, vegetable, or protein, as a coffee add-on for $1), and (iii) a choice bundle (the option of either a pastry or a healthy snack as an add-on to coffee for $1). In addition to our field experiment, we conducted an online laboratory study to strengthen the validity of our results. Managerial implications : We found that offering healthy snacks as part of an add-on bundle significantly increased healthy purchases (and decreased unhealthy purchases). Surprisingly, this finding continued to hold for the choice bundle, that is, even when unhealthy snacks were concurrently on promotion. However, we did not observe a long-term stickiness effect, meaning that customers returned to their original (unhealthy) purchase patterns once the healthy or choice bundle was discontinued. Finally, we show that offering an add-on choice bundle is also beneficial for retailers, who can earn higher revenue and profit.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : In this paper, we study the newsvendor problem under some distributional ambiguity sets and explore their relations. Additionally, we explore the benefits of implementing this robust solution in the feature-based newsvendor problem. Methodology and results : We propose a new type of discrepancy-based ambiguity set, the JW ambiguity set, and analyze it within the framework of first-order stochastic dominance. We show that the distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problem with this ambiguity set admits a closed-form solution for the newsvendor loss. This result also implies that the newsvendor problem under the well-known infinity-Wasserstein ambiguity set and Lévy ball ambiguity set admit closed-form inventory levels as a by-product. In the application of feature-based newsvendor, we adopt general kernel methods to estimate the conditional demand distribution and apply our proposed DRO solutions to account for the estimation error. Managerial implications : The closed-form solutions enable an efficient computation of optimal inventory levels. In addition, we explore the property of optimal robust inventory levels with respect to the nonrobust version via concepts of perceived critical ratio and mean repulsion. The results of numerical experiments and the case study indicate that the proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in environments where demand is influenced by covariates and difficult to estimate.

  abstract     = {Problem definition: Ride-hailing platforms offering shared rides devote effort to reducing the trip-lengthening detours that accommodate fellow customers’ divergent transportation needs. By reducing shared-ride delay, improving shared-ride efficiency has the twin benefits of making shared rides more attractive to customers and increasing the number of customers a driver can serve per unit time. Methodology/results: We analytically model a ride-hailing platform that can offer individual rides and shared rides. We establish results that are counter to naive intuition: greater customer sensitivity to shared-ride delay and greater labor cost can reduce the value of improving shared-ride efficiency, and an increase in shared-ride efficiency can prompt a platform to add individual-ride service. We show that when network effects are small, increasing shared-ride efficiency pushes wages to extremes : if the current wage is high (low), increasing shared-ride efficiency pushes the wage higher (lower). We provide a sharp characterization of whether shared-ride efficiency and labor supply are complements or substitutes. We provide simple conditions under which increasing shared-ride efficiency reduces (alternatively, increases) labor welfare. We provide evidence that increasing shared-ride efficiency increases consumer surplus. Managerial implications: Our results inform a platform’s decision of whether to invest in improving shared-ride efficiency, as well as how to change its service offering and wage, as shared-ride efficiency improves.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We consider an online retailer selling multiple products to different zones over a finite horizon with multiple periods. At the start of the horizon, the retailer orders the products from a single supplier and stores them at multiple warehouses. The retailer determines the products’ order quantities and their storage quantities at each warehouse subject to its capacity constraint. At the end of each period, after random demands in the period are realized, the retailer chooses the retrieval quantities from each warehouse to fulfill the demands of each zone. The objective is to maximize the retailer’s expected profit over the finite horizon. Methodology/results : For the single-zone case, we show that the multiperiod problem is equivalent to a single-period problem and the optimal retrieval decisions follow a greedy policy that retrieves products from the lowest-cost warehouse. We design a nongreedy algorithm to find the optimal storage policy, which preserves a nested property: Among all nonempty warehouses, a smaller-index warehouse contains all the products stored in a larger-index warehouse. We also analytically characterize the optimal ordering policy. The multizone case is unfortunately intractable analytically, and we propose an efficient heuristic to solve it, which involves a nontrivial hybrid of three approximations. This hybrid heuristic outperforms two conventional benchmarks by up to 22.5% and 3.5% in our numerical experiments with various horizon lengths, fulfillment frequencies, warehouse capacities, demand variations, and demand correlations. Managerial implications : A case study based on data from a major fashion online retailer in Asia confirms the superiority of the hybrid heuristic. With delicate optimization, the heuristic improves the average profit by up to 16% compared with a dedicated policy adopted by the retailer. The hybrid heuristic continues to outperform the benchmarks for larger networks with various structures. Funding: X.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : The loyalty penalty refers to a pricing strategy where companies charge higher prices to loyal customers for exploitation while offering lower prices to nonloyal customers for attraction. To address this unfair business practice, various regulatory agencies, such as the Competition and Markets Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom, have proposed or implemented regulations aimed at promoting fairness in pricing. In this study, we analyze the impact of such regulations on both firms and consumers. Methodology/results : We develop a stylized model to investigate duopoly competition in two symmetric markets, where consumers exhibit loyalty to different firms in each market. The regulatory intervention mandates that the price difference between the two markets, set by each firm, must not exceed a certain threshold. Our analysis reveals an intriguing interaction between market competition and price fairness regulation. When competition is intense, fairness regulation can alleviate cutthroat competition between firms, resulting in Pareto improvements compared with a scenario with no regulation. On the other hand, when competition is weak, fairness regulation can further enhance firms’ existing monopoly power, potentially leading to collusive high prices that are detrimental to consumers and society. We also consider several extensions to enrich our findings, including fairness regulation on relative price discounts, asymmetric markets, and a two-pronged policy regulating the price gap and price cap. Managerial implications : Our study reveals the economic consequences of price fairness regulations; firms can benefit by pricing fairly, but well-intended fairness requirements may have adverse effects on consumers.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Loyalty programs have greatly expanded in scale and scope, and loyalty points issued by firms serve as a new form of currency alongside the traditional currency of money. In this paper, we study how consumers decide to pay with points or money for a purchase and how these decisions are affected by consumers’ points earning characteristics. Methodology/results : We develop a model of consumers’ payment choices and estimate it on proprietary loyalty program data from a major U.S. airline company using a hierarchical Bayesian framework. Our results demonstrate that mental accounting, the subjective perceived value of points, and the reference exchange rate play important roles in consumers’ payment choices. Moreover, the primary points earning source and the total earning level are jointly associated with consumers’ attitudes toward points and money: Consumers who earn many points and mostly with the focal firm tend to value points more than money, while those who earn few points or mostly through a cobranded credit card tend to value money more than points. To better understand heterogeneity in consumers’ attitudes toward points, we propose a probabilistic segmentation of consumers and identify four behavioral segments with distinctive characteristics. Through counterfactual analysis, we demonstrate how a firm can implement money and point pricing policies to optimally target and influence consumers’ payment choices. Managerial implications : It is important for firms to understand how consumers think about points and decide to pay with points or money as it affects firms’ cash flows, profitability, and consumer loyalty and engagement. We demonstrate that firms can design optimal price targeting policies by utilizing the significant level of heterogeneity in consumers’ attitudes toward points. Furthermore, our results indicate that firms that are expanding their partnership networks and offering more points earning sources should consider the impact that this would have on consumers’ mental accounting of money and points, and consequently their payment choices.

Although both business models can bridge the gap between demand and supply, it is not clear which model is better for the firm or for the consumers. Methodology/results : We show that, whereas the two models differ substantially in pricing power, inventory risk, fee structure, and fulfillment time, both models share several important features with the revenues earned by the firm from the two models converging when the markets are thick. We also show that, for thick markets, there is a one-to-one mapping between their corresponding optimal policies. Managerial implications : Our results provide guidelines for firms entering two-sided markets: when the market is thick, the two business models are similar; when the market is thin, they should carefully inspect a number of market conditions before making the choice.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : This paper considers a tandem queueing system in which stage 1 has one station serving multiple classes of arriving customers with different service requirements and related delay costs, and stage 2 has multiple parallel stations, with each station providing one type of service. Each station has many statistically identical servers. The objective is to design a joint capacity allocation between stages/stations and scheduling rule of different classes of customers to minimize the system’s long-run average cost. Methodology/results : Using fluid approximation, we convert the stochastic problem into a fluid optimization problem and develop a solution procedure. Based on the solution to the fluid optimization problem, we propose a simple and easy-to-implement capacity allocation and scheduling policy and establish its asymptotic optimality for the stochastic system. The policy has an explicit index-based scheduling rule that is independent of the arrival rates, and resource allocation is determined by the priority orders established between the classes and stations. We conduct numerical experiments to validate the accuracy of the fluid approximation and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed policy. Managerial implications : Tandem queueing systems are ubiquitous. Our results provide useful guidelines for the allocation of limited resources and the scheduling of customer service in those systems. Our proposed policy can improve the system’s operational efficiency and customers’ service quality. Funding: Z.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Despite their widespread use, promotional inventory displays’ campaign execution is opaque. Brands (manufacturers) can only verify in-store display presence through manual, on-site audits, which are costly and limited in scope. This lack of visibility into execution makes it difficult for brands to quantify the sales impact of displays and properly evaluate campaign performance. Methodology/results : We use Internet-of-Things (IoT)-generated data on the real-time location of about 15,000 displays from 10 display campaigns in about 5,000 stores of a Fortune 500 retail chain, paired with the stores’ point-of-sale (POS) data between September 2017 and March 2018, to measure the operational execution and effectiveness of display campaigns. First, we find that campaigns are poorly executed: 29% of displays never made it to a store’s floor, and those that made it only spent 62% of the campaign there. Second, we find that poor execution deprives brands of substantial sales, especially during campaign weeks: placing a display on the floor during an arbitrary week increases the targeted products’ sales by 7.3%, and placing it on the floor during a campaign week boosts sales by another 2.3%. Managerial implications : Our results enable brands to optimize investments in promotional display campaigns and execution. We project that brands would suffer a 3.1% dollar sales decrease during campaign weeks by discontinuing current campaigns. However, they could achieve up to a 6.9% dollar sales increase during campaign weeks through improved execution.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Gift card promotions offer a tiered incentive (a gift card) to customers for purchasing regularly-priced products, with higher expenditure receiving a larger incentive. We empirically investigate the impact of gift card promotions on customer purchase behavior by collaborating with a major U.S.-based department store that targets gift card promotion emails on its online channel. Methodology/results : We use a collection of discontinuities in the retailer’s targeting policies and corresponding fuzzy regression discontinuity designs to estimate localized causal effects of the gift card promotion. We find that gift card promotion provided to customers whose most recent purchase was 4 and 13 months ago, respectively, increased their purchase probability by 11.24% and 26.64%, and their average expenditure by 9.53% and 1.9%, respectively. Overall, the gift card promotion generated, on average, $100K in incremental sales per promotion from these customers alone. Furthermore, the promotion induced customers to seek out products from niche categories and increased spending on high-end brands. Gift card promotion emails also had a dominant advertisement effect, that is, customers who received the gift card promotion email increased expenditure even if they did not participate in the promotion. Managerial implications : (i) Gift card promotions are a viable strategy to boost short-term sales and to alter the distribution of the types (brand, category) of purchased products. (ii) Retailers should optimize gift card promotion tiers based on the tradeoff between increased customer expenditure and promotion expenses and consider the advertisement effect when targeting the promotion emails. (iii) Contrary to popular belief, retailers benefit from customers’ redeeming gift cards because they spend more due to the gift card, validating the dual value of the delayed incentive.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Volunteer crowdsourcing platforms match volunteers with tasks that are often recurring. To ensure completion of such tasks, platforms frequently use a lever known as “adoption,” which amounts to a commitment by the volunteer to repeatedly perform the task. Despite reducing match uncertainty, high levels of adoption can decrease the probability of forming new matches, which in turn can suppress growth. We study how platforms should manage this trade-off. Our research is motivated by a collaboration with Food Rescue U.S. (FRUS), a volunteer-based food recovery organization active in more than 30 locations. For platforms such as FRUS, effectively using nonmonetary levers, such as adoption, is critical. Methodology/results : Motivated by the volunteer management literature and our analysis of FRUS data, we develop a model for two-sided markets that repeatedly match volunteers with tasks. We study the platform’s optimal policy for setting the adoption level to maximize the total discounted number of matches. When market participants are homogeneous, we fully characterize the optimal myopic policy and show that it takes a simple extreme form: depending on volunteer characteristics and market thickness, either allow for full adoption or disallow adoption. In the long run, we show that such a policy is either optimal or achieves a constant-factor approximation. We further extend our analysis to settings with heterogeneity and find that the structure of the optimal myopic policy remains the same if volunteers are heterogeneous. However, if tasks are heterogeneous, it can be optimal to only allow adoption for the harder-to-match tasks. Managerial implications : Our work sheds light on how two-sided platforms need to carefully control the double-edged impacts that commitment levers have on growth and engagement. Setting a misguided adoption level may result in marketplace decay. At the same time, a one-size-fits-all solution may not be effective, as the optimal design crucially depends on the characteristics of the volunteer population.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Motivated by the debate around workers’ welfare in the gig economy, we propose a framework to evaluate current practices and possible alternatives. We study a setting in which customers seek service from workers and a platform facilitates such matches over the course of the day. The platform allocates time slots to workers using an allocation policy, and the workers are strategic agents (with respect to “when to work”) who maximize their expected utility that depends on their preferred times to work, the allocated slots, and the total availability time. The platform seeks to ensure that a sufficient number of workers is available to satisfy demand, whereas the workers aim to maximize their wage-driven utility. Methodology/results : We evaluate policies on two dimensions critical to any firm: the supply of workers across the day, and the effective wages of workers. We illustrate that several families of currently deployed policies have serious limitations. We find these limitations exist because the policies do not let workers fully express their preferences and/or cannot account for heterogeneity in such preferences. We propose a new allocation policy and establish strong performance guarantees with respect to both the workers’ supply and effective wages. The policy is simple and fully leverages the market information to reach better market outcomes. We supplement our theory with numerical experiments in the context of ride-hailing calibrated on various New York City data sets that illustrate performance across a range of markets. Managerial implications : We highlight a fundamental inefficiency of policies currently deployed that limit workers’ ability to express their preferences. By allowing workers to express their temporal preferences, and by judiciously prioritizing “full-time” workers over “part-time” workers, we can obtain a potentially significant Pareto improvement, maintaining (or even increasing) workers’ supply while increasing their effective wages.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (HFVs) have been proposed as a promising green transportation alternative. For regions experiencing renewable energy curtailment, promoting HFVs can achieve the dual benefit of reducing curtailment and developing sustainable transportation. However, promoting HFVs faces several major hurdles, including uncertain vehicle adoption, the lack of refueling infrastructure, the spatial mismatch between hydrogen demand and renewable sources for hydrogen production, and the strained power transmission infrastructure. In this paper, we address these challenges and study how to promote HFV adoption by deploying HFV infrastructure and utilizing renewable resources. Methodology/results : We formulate a planning model that jointly determines the location and capacities of hydrogen refueling stations (HRSs) and hydrogen plants as well as electricity transmission and grid upgrade. Despite the complexity of explicitly considering drivers’ HFV adoption behavior, the bilevel optimization model can be reformulated as a tractable mixed-integer second-order cone program. We apply our model calibrated with real data to the case of Sichuan, a province in China with abundant hydro resources and a vast amount of hydropower curtailment. Managerial implications : We obtain the following findings. (i) The optimal deployment of HRSs displays vastly different spatial patterns depending on the HFV adoption target. The capital city, a transportation hub, is excluded from the plan under a low target and only emerges as the center of HFV adoption under a high target. (ii) Promoting the HFV adoption can overall help reduce hydropower curtailment, but the effectiveness depends on factors such as the adoption target and the grid upgrade cost. (iii) Being a versatile energy carrier, hydrogen can be transported to various locations, which allows for strategic placement of HRSs in locations distinct from hydrogen plant sites. This flexibility offers HFVs greater potential cost savings and curtailment reduction compared with other alternative fuel vehicles (e.g., electric vehicles) under current cost estimates. Funding: W.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : More than 99% of the new power generation capacity to be installed in the United States from 2023 to 2050 will be powered by wind, solar, and natural gas. Additionally, large-scale battery systems are planned to support power systems. It is paramount for policymakers and electric utilities to deepen the understanding of the operational and investment relations among renewable, flexible (natural gas-powered), and storage capacities. In this paper, we optimize both the joint operations and investment mix of these three types of resources, examining whether they act as investment substitutes or complements. Methodology/results : Using stochastic control theory, we identify and prove the structure of the optimal storage control policy, from which we determine various pairs of charging and discharging operations. We find that whether storage complements or substitutes other resources hinges on the operational pairs involved and whether executing these pairs is constrained by charging or discharging. Through extensive numerical analysis using data from a Florida utility, government agencies, and industry reports, we demonstrate how storage operations drive the investment relations among renewable, flexible, and storage capacities. Managerial implications : Storage and renewables substitute each other in meeting peak demand; storage complements renewables by storing surplus renewable output; renewables complement storage by compressing peak periods, facilitating peak shaving and displacement of flexible capacity. These substitution and complementary effects often coexist, and the dominant effect can alternate as costs change. A thorough understanding of these relations at both operational and investment levels empowers decision makers to optimize energy infrastructure investments and operations, thereby unlocking their full potential.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Leading specialty coffee roasters rely on direct trade to source premium coffee beans. We examine a roaster who sells two basic types of roasts: (1) a single-origin roast sourced from a specific locale and (2) a blend roast that uses a mix of beans from sources that vary over the course of a year. The prices of blend roasts are lower than those of single-origin roasts and appeal to a larger market. We study how characteristics of the operating and market environment affect the optimal sourcing strategy for single-origin beans. Methodology/results : We develop a two-stage stochastic program with recourse that reflects these characteristics. A roaster has the option to allocate some of the single-origin beans for sale under a blend label, known as downward substitution. We identify three distinct optimal sourcing strategies—specialized (no downward substitution), diversified (consistent downward substitution), and mixed (between these extremes)—and show that they are robust under different definitions of yield and demand. Managerial implications : We identify four main insights: (1) Two factors determine which strategy is optimal: the mean price of the inferior product (blend label) and the marginal cost of the superior product (single-origin label). (2) When compared with the newsvendor model, we find distinct structural differences across strategies. For example, whereas the effects of increasing uncertainty on optimal quantity align with the newsvendor model under a mixed strategy, the effects are distinctly different under specialized and diversified strategies (e.g., monotonic decreasing behavior for specialized, no change in quantity under diversified). (3) The weighted average price of an agricultural product is decreasing in negative yield–price correlation. We coin this as the “farmer’s curse,” which carries lessons for direct trade sourcing (e.g., advocating against paying the grower at postharvest market prices). (4) We find evidence of a virtuous feedback loop wherein the grower–roaster relationship becomes stronger over time. Our findings also point to a simple signal that policymakers may use to identify coffee growing locales where targeted interventions can improve grower welfare. Funding: B.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Professional sports leagues may be suspended because of various reasons, such as the recent coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. A critical question that the league must address when reopening is how to appropriately select a subset of the remaining games to conclude the season in a shortened time frame. Despite the rich literature on scheduling an entire season starting from a blank slate, concluding an existing season is quite different. Our approach attempts to achieve team rankings similar to those that would have resulted had the season been played out in full. Methodology/results : We propose a data-driven model that exploits predictive and prescriptive analytics to produce a schedule for the remainder of the season composed of a subset of originally scheduled games. Our model introduces novel rankings-based objectives within a stochastic optimization model, whose parameters are first estimated using a predictive model. We introduce a deterministic equivalent reformulation along with a tailored Frank–Wolfe algorithm to efficiently solve our problem as well as a robust counterpart based on min-max regret. We present simulation-based numerical experiments from previous National Basketball Association seasons 2004–2019, and we show that our models are computationally efficient, outperform a greedy benchmark that approximates a nonrankings-based scheduling policy, and produce interpretable results. Managerial implications : Our data-driven decision-making framework may be used to produce a shortened season with 25%–50% fewer games while still producing an end-of-season ranking similar to that of the full season, had it been played.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study customer service chat (CSC) systems, in which agents can serve multiple customers simultaneously, with generally distributed service and patience times. The multitasking capability of agents introduces idiosyncratic challenges when making routing and staffing decisions. Methodology/results : To determine the dynamic matching of arriving customers with available agents, we first formulate a routing linear program (LP) based on system primitives. Inspired by the optimal solution of the routing LP, we design a parsimonious dynamic routing policy that is independent of arrival rate and service capacity information. We also use the optimal solution to develop closed-form approximations for crucial performance metrics and show that a similar LP can be utilized to make staffing decisions. Through extensive simulation experiments, we showcase the efficacy of our approximations and staffing decisions. Furthermore, under our proposed policy, the CSC system exhibits a unique stationary fluid model in which the steady-state performance measures align with our approximations. Managerial implications : The extant literature primarily focuses on Markovian systems with exponential distributions. In this paper, customers’ service and patience times are allowed to be generally distributed to agree with practical settings. Our findings indicate that the distributions have a significant impact on routing policies, staffing decisions, and system performance. Funding: Z.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study early-stage dose-finding clinical trials with simultaneous consideration of efficacy and toxicity without parametric assumptions on the forms of the unknown dose-efficacy and dose-toxicity curves. We propose algorithms that adaptively allocate doses based on patient responses, in order to maximize the efficacy for the patients during the trial while minimizing the toxicity. Methodology/results : We leverage online learning to design the clinical trial and propose two algorithms. The first one follows dose-escalation principles and analyzes the efficacy and toxicity simultaneously. The second one uses bisection search to identify a safe dose range and then applies upper confidence bound algorithms within the safe range to identify efficacious doses. We show the matching upper and lower bounds for the regret of both algorithms. We find that observing the dose-escalation principle is costly, as the optimal regret of the first algorithm is in the order of N 3 / 4 , worse than the optimal regret of the second algorithm, which is in the order of N 2 / 3 . We test our proposed algorithms with three benchmarks commonly used in practice on synthetic and real data sets, and the results show that they are competitive with or significantly outperform the benchmarks. Managerial implications : We provide a novel insight that following the dose-escalation principle inevitably leads to higher regret.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Artificial intelligence (AI) assistants—software agents that can perform tasks or services for individuals—are among the most promising AI applications. However, little is known about the adoption of AI assistants by service providers (i.e., physicians) in a real-world healthcare setting. In this paper, we investigate the impact of the AI smartness (i.e., whether the AI assistant is powered by machine learning intelligence) and the impact of AI transparency (i.e., whether physicians are informed of the AI assistant). Methodology/results : We collaborate with a leading healthcare platform to run a field experiment in which we compare physicians’ adoption behavior, that is, adoption rate and adoption timing, of smart and automated AI assistants under transparent and non-transparent conditions. We find that the smartness can increase the adoption rate and shorten the adoption timing, whereas the transparency can only shorten the adoption timing. Moreover, the impact of AI transparency on the adoption rate is contingent on the smartness level of the AI assistant: the transparency increases the adoption rate only when the AI assistant is not equipped with smart algorithms and fails to do so when the AI assistant is smart. Managerial implications : Our study can guide platforms in designing their AI strategies. Platforms should improve the smartness of AI assistants. If such an improvement is too costly, the platform should transparentize the AI assistant, especially when it is not smart.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Public health interventions, such as social distancing and lockdown, play an important role in containing infectious disease outbreaks, such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Yet, these interventions could cause significant financial losses because of the disruption to regular socioeconomic activities. Moreover, an individual’s activity level is influenced not only by public health policies but also by one’s perception of the disease burden of infection. Strategic planning is required to optimize the timing and intensity of these public health interventions by considering individual responses. Methodology/results : We use the multinomial logit choice model to characterize individual reactions to the risk of infection and public health interventions and integrate it into a repeated Stackelberg game with the susceptible-infected-recovered disease transmission dynamics. We find that the individual equilibrium activity level is higher than the socially optimal activity level because of an individual’s ignorance of the negative externality imposed on others. As a result, implementing lockdown and social distancing policies at moderate disease prevalence may be equivalently critical, if not more, compared with their implementations when the disease prevalence is at its peak level. To verify these findings, we conduct numerical studies based on representative COVID-19 data in Minnesota. Managerial implications : Our results call for policymakers’ attention to consider the impact of individuals’ responses in the planning for different pandemic containment measures. Individuals’ responses in the pandemic may significantly affect the optimal implementation of lockdown and social distancing policies.

We then conclude by proposing a framework to help identify how ML and BSci can jointly contribute to OM problems. Managerial implications : Overall, we aim to explore how the integration of ML and BSci can enable researchers to solve a wide range of problems within OM, allowing future research to generate valuable insights for managers, companies, and society.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Data analytics models and machine learning algorithms are increasingly deployed to support consequential decision-making processes, from deciding which applicants will receive job offers and loans to university enrollments and medical interventions. However, recent studies show these models may unintentionally amplify human bias and yield significant unfavorable decisions to specific groups. Methodology/results : We propose a distributionally robust classification model with a fairness constraint that encourages the classifier to be fair in the equality of opportunity criterion. We use a type- ∞ Wasserstein ambiguity set centered at the empirical distribution to represent distributional uncertainty and derive a conservative reformulation for the worst-case equal opportunity unfairness measure. We show that the model is equivalent to a mixed binary conic optimization problem, which standard off-the-shelf solvers can solve. We propose a convex, hinge-loss-based model for large problem instances whose reformulation does not incur binary variables to improve scalability. Moreover, we also consider the distributionally robust learning problem with a generic ground transportation cost to hedge against the label and sensitive attribute uncertainties. We numerically examine the performance of our proposed models on five real-world data sets related to individual analysis. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our proposed approaches significantly improve fairness with negligible loss of predictive accuracy in the testing data set. Managerial implications : Our paper raises awareness that bias may arise when predictive models are used in service and operations. It generally comes from human bias, for example, imbalanced data collection or low sample sizes, and is further amplified by algorithms. Incorporating fairness constraints and the distributionally robust optimization (DRO) scheme is a powerful way to alleviate algorithmic biases.

We challenge this assumption and investigate the causal relationship between an individual’s volunteering activities and their subsequent decisions to donate. Methodology/results : We conducted three consequential experiments where participants engaged in virtual assignments and were subsequently prompted to donate to an existing charity. In the first two experiments, participants were tasked with creating affectionate cards for the homeless, enjoying full autonomy in the design of these cards. In the third experiment, participants colored patterns of varying complexity. Our results indicated that volunteering increased both the propensity and the amount of participants’ donations, pointing to a potential explanation rooted in moral consistency . However, as individuals’ volunteering efforts intensified, their subsequent donations decreased, reflecting a mental budgeting mechanism in these settings. Managerial implications : Our results suggest that (i) volunteer programs not only build up a charity’s labor source but may also increase their donation income; (ii) charities should consider developing virtual volunteering programs that increase their resources by connecting them with more volunteers; and (iii) to maximize donations, charities should carefully design light volunteer tasks.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition: In practice, consumers are directly or indirectly connected with branded manufacturers through intermediaries across industries. In this paper, we explore the effects of different selling formats on product quality and price depending on consumer valuations in a market. We employ a distribution family to comprehensively capture the heterogeneity of consumer valuations. Motivated by realistic phenomena, consumer valuations are used to investigate strategic decisions under different selling formats that are not trivial to analyze. Methodology/results: We develop game-theoretical models to examine the equilibrium decisions of stakeholders. The impact of consumer valuations is investigated and validated using sensitivity analysis, and the results are connected to practice. First, we find that agency selling induces a premium quality and maximizes the channel profit; remarkably, a nonmonotonic (approximate U-shaped) relationship exists between the agency fee and consumer valuations. A higher consumer surplus can be achieved in an agency selling channel compared with a reselling channel, particularly when targeting a mass of high-end consumers. Second, by examining distinct consumer valuations, maintaining top-notch quality and the highest price in an agency selling channel is not universally viable under some conditions. Third, in the case of production-level competition, an agency selling format tends to cause product quality to vary noticeably. Moreover, in the hybrid selling channel, in contrast to agency selling, the high-type manufacturer reduces both quality and price, which bolsters the overall profits of the channel and the consumer surplus. Managerial implications: Branded manufacturers can efficiently respond to individualized consumer needs in a centralized distribution channel. In contrast, for selling basic products, the reselling channel could contribute to achieving economies of scale and offering competitive prices. In the agency selling channel, standardized pricing determined by branded manufacturers can create a consistent perception of product quality throughout the distribution network.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Recent global crises have caused unprecedented economic uncertainty and intensified retailers’ concerns over inventory risks. Mitigating inventory risks and incentivizing retailer orders is critical to managing retail supply chains and restoring their norms after severe impacts. We study the allocation of inventory risk using contracts in a retail supply chain with a risk-neutral manufacturer and a risk-averse retailer. We consider two factors that affect the effectiveness of contracting: (1) asymmetric risk aversion information—retailers’ attitudes are typically diverse and unknown to the manufacturer, and (2) uncertain outside opportunity—retailers typically face a volatile external business environment. Methodology/results : With a game-theoretic model that captures the interaction among risk aversion, information asymmetry, and outside opportunity, we derive the contracting equilibrium under two widely adopted risk allocation schemes—push (i.e., the retailer bears the inventory risk) and pull (i.e., the manufacturer bears the inventory risk) contracts. Contrary to the conventional wisdom that pull contracts are more effective in risk mitigation, we show that push contracts may induce larger expected order quantities and achieve the highest supply chain efficiency due to the interaction of asymmetric risk aversion information and risky outside opportunities. We also find that the manufacturer may obtain higher profits with push contracts when both the heterogeneity in the retailer’s risk attitude and the risk of the outside opportunity are sufficiently high. In addition, when the risk of the outside opportunity is in a medium range, the push contract allows the manufacturer to fully eliminate the information rent and achieve the supply chain’s first-best outcomes. We further evaluate the effects of product profitability and demand uncertainty and generalize the retailer’s risk measure to any coherent risk measure. Managerial implications : Our analysis highlights the importance of modeling asymmetric risk aversion information and risky outside opportunities in analyzing supply chain contracting. When considering these practical factors, allocating more inventory risks to a risk-averse retailer may be better than a risk-neutral manufacturer. Our results provide novel insights into the selection of proper contract types for managing inventory risks in retail supply chains.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : As related party transactions (RPTs) increase in global supply chains, understanding the impact of corporate governance on such transactions becomes crucial for businesses. RPTs often lead to operational diversion due to power disparities between parent and its subsidiaries. In this study, we explore how operational diversion in RPTs within multinational firms is affected by the roles of foreign subsidiaries and corporate governance mechanisms. Methodology/results : Using a unique data set on RPTs of Korean multinational firms from 2006 to 2013, we compare the performance of multinational firms engaging in RPTs with two types of foreign subsidiaries: vertical and horizontal . We conduct our empirical analysis based on the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in Korea in 2011, which acts as a policy shock affecting corporate governance and deterring operational diversion. Our results show that the improvement in operational performance of a multinational firm following the IFRS adoption is more significant when the parent firm engages in transactions with vertical subsidiaries compared with horizontal ones. We further show that strong corporate governance mechanisms, such as internal governance, institutional ownership, and large shareholders, play a crucial role in restraining operational diversion in RPTs involving vertical subsidiaries. Managerial implications : The implications of our study extend to shareholders and auditors, highlighting the importance of prioritizing monitoring efforts concerning a parent firm’s RPTs with vertical subsidiaries, especially when corporate governance mechanisms are weak. In contrast, RPTs with horizontal subsidiaries are relatively robust against operational diversion, making them a natural deterrent to such malpractices.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Beneficiaries of social assistance programs with transfers of undifferentiated commodities often have a designated agent to collect their entitlements from. This gives monopoly power to agents over beneficiaries. When coupled with weak government monitoring, agents do not have incentives to adhere to stipulated operating guidelines, leading to reduced uptake by beneficiaries. Some governments are attempting to break the monopoly by allowing beneficiaries to choose agents. However, the impact of choice on uptake may be limited by lack of alternate agents in beneficiaries’ vicinities, restricted ability of agents to compete with undifferentiated commodities, and collusion among agents. Methodology/results : Using a reverse difference-in-differences framework on data from a food security program in two neighboring states in India, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, we find that providing agent choice results in a 6.6% increase in the quantity of entitlements collected by the beneficiary households. We also find that increase in uptake is about four times higher in regions with high agent density compared with those with low agent density. This emphasizes the importance of having an alternate agent in the vicinity for choice to be effective. Nearly all of the increase in uptake is attributable to new beneficiaries collecting entitlements from their preassigned agent. This is suggestive of agents improving adherence to operating guidelines in response to choice. We find associative evidence for this response in the number of days agents keep their shops open. Managerial implications : Governments executing in-kind transfers of undifferentiated commodities are piloting interventions to provide choice to their beneficiaries. Replacement of in-kind transfers with cash, an increasingly popular intervention, may be challenging in volatile markets, as the magnitude of the transfer needs to be periodically adjusted. Our results indicate that alternate designs of providing choice even in a limited form, that is, the place where the beneficiaries can collect their entitlements with products and prices fixed, can present a viable alternative.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Product service plays a crucial role for brands to retain customers and spur revenue growth. It is, however, often outsourced to a third-party provider, driven by cost savings and the ability to focus on core businesses. Although there is a large body of literature studying service outsourcing, the impact of service environment uncertainty (i.e., changing customer needs and shifting resource requirements) has received sparse attention in the past but is becoming a major concern because of increased market turbulence. This research explores how environment uncertainty in service provision influences a brand’s intent to outsource, and, if the brand decides to outsource, how it can retain the potential cost advantages offered by a third-party provider. Methodology/results : This research develops a normative model to explore key drivers that impact service outsourcing outcomes under environment uncertainty and partial observability. We find that environment uncertainty can accelerate a brand’s propensity to outsource, and a brand typically benefits from outsourcing initially. Yet, we show that such benefits can dissipate over time because of partial observability. Monitoring efforts help to mitigate the adverse impact of environment uncertainty and partial observability, but cannot attain anticipated outsourcing benefits unless monitoring is costless. In contrast, nudging service providers to self-report the cost of resources is effective even if the monitoring cost is high. Managerial implications : Brands should carefully consider environment uncertainty, partial observability, and monitoring ability when deciding whether to outsource product services to third-party providers. A heuristic monitoring policy can be effective when the monitoring cost is very high or very low but can perform poorly when the monitoring cost is in the intermediate range. Thus, outsourcing is more attractive when environment uncertainty is significant, but the value of outsourcing can only be realized when (a) partial observability is insignificant, (b) monitoring is inexpensive, or (c) provider self-reporting can be nudged. If none of the conditions hold, then the brand can suffer significant losses from the anticipated benefits of product service outsourcing.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Most subsidy welfare programs operate in a bilevel hierarchical structure, wherein a funding agency allocates funds to multiple service organizations . These service organizations invest in activities within their areas to generate societal impact for beneficiaries by enhancing the quantity and quality of services at local providers. The funds allocation decisions in such programs are complicated by the funding agency’s equity consideration, intricate relationships among contextual factors in societal impact generation, and information asymmetry between different entities about availability of additional funds for an agency. Methodology/results : We propose a model to analyze how the funding agency should allocate funds to generate the most societal impact equitably across areas. We show that the funding agency should direct more funds toward an area with a relatively balanced mix of subsidy-accepting and nonaccepting providers, or with fewer nonaccepting providers, and outreach activity is more likely to yield a higher investment return. Further, comparing the inequity levels and total societal impact under the proposed equity-ensuring method with those under other methods, we find that an efficiency-focused method enhances total societal impact, but can result in greater inequity, especially when there is a large across-area disparity in the size of beneficiaries. A simple formula-based method could achieve greater total societal impact, while not severely sacrificing equity in certain situations. Conversely, the equity-ensuring method always eliminates inequity by not severely sacrificing the total societal impact under a wide range of parameter values. Managerial implications : Given the growing impetus to consider equity within their operations, our equity-ensuring method helps the funding agencies adjust their allocation strategies to generate the greatest equitable impact. Finally, using a case study based on Massachusetts’ child care subsidy program, we illustrate that the proposed method achieves equity while enhancing the overall societal impact by approximately 3% versus the current formula-based method.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We examine the effects of prolonged consecutive working days without breaks on care quality and explore its association with daily staffing levels in neonatal intensive care nursing teams. Academic/practical relevance : Healthcare organizations typically base staffing guidelines on safe daily metrics like nurse-to-patient ratios. However, in response to unforeseen demand spikes or staff shortages, managers often depend on staff working additional consecutive days to bridge staffing gaps. This approach, although addressing immediate staffing needs, can inadvertently impact care quality and safety, potentially undermining the benefits of higher staffing levels. Methodology : Using longitudinal data from 62 German neonatal units, we analyze the effect of nursing teams’ consecutive working days on the time from admission to full enteral feeding for 847 low-birth-weight babies, considering nurse-to-patient ratios and patient complexity. Results : Longer consecutive working periods harmfully affect care quality, especially during staffing shortages. The detrimental impact on days with low staffing is particularly pronounced in patients with less complex medical needs. Limiting the team-average number of consecutive working days to two days would have reduced the time to full enteral feeding in our study by 6.4%. Shifting from half a day less to half a day more than the average number of consecutive working days has an impact equal to 20% of the difference in time taken to reach full enteral feeding between low- and high-birth-weight babies. Managerial implications : Limiting consecutive working days could significantly improve intensive care outcomes. Management should monitor consecutive working days alongside daily staffing levels. Policy makers should consider introducing limits on the number of consecutive working days for intensive care nurses.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Drone delivery has recently garnered significant attention due to its potential for faster delivery at a lower cost than other delivery options. When scheduling drones from a depot for delivery to various destinations, the dispatcher must take into account the uncertain wind conditions, which affect the delivery times of drones to their destinations, leading to late deliveries. Methodology/results : To mitigate the risk of delivery delays caused by wind uncertainty, we propose a two-period drone scheduling model to robustly optimize the delivery schedule. In this framework, the scheduling decisions are made in the morning, with the provision for different delivery schedules in the afternoon that adapt to updated weather information available by midday. Our approach minimizes the essential riskiness index, which can simultaneously account for the probability of tardy delivery and the magnitude of lateness. Using wind observation data, we characterize the uncertain flight times via a cluster-wise ambiguity set, which has the benefit of tractability while avoiding overfitting the empirical distribution. A branch-and-cut (B&amp;C) algorithm is developed for this adaptive distributionally framework to improve its scalability. Our adaptive distributionally robust model can effectively reduce lateness in out-of-sample tests compared with other classical models. The proposed B&amp;C algorithm can solve instances to optimality within a shorter time frame than a general modeling toolbox. Managerial implications : Decision makers can use the adaptive robust model together with the cluster-wise ambiguity set to effectively reduce service lateness at customers for drone delivery systems.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study supply chain contract design under uncertainty. In this problem, the retailer has full information about the demand distribution, whereas the supplier only has partial information drawn from historical demand realizations and contract terms. The supplier wants to optimize the contract terms, but she only has limited data on the true demand distribution. Methodology/results : We show that the classical approach for contract design is fragile in the small data regime by identifying cases where it incurs a large loss. We then show how to combine the historical demand and retailer data to improve the supplier’s contract design. On top of this, we propose a robust contract design model where the uncertainty set requires little prior knowledge from the supplier. We show how to optimize the supplier’s worst-case profit based on this uncertainty set. In the single-product case, the worst-case profit can be found with bisection search. In the multiproduct case, the worst-case profit can be found with a cutting plane algorithm. Managerial implications : Our framework demonstrates the importance of combining the demand and retailer information into the supplier’s contract design problem. We also demonstrate the advantage of our robust model by comparing it against classical data-driven approaches. This comparison sheds light on the value of information from interactions between agents in a game-theoretic setting and suggests that such information should be utilized in data-driven decision making.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : This paper studies the single-warehouse assortment selection problem that aims to minimize the order fulfillment cost under the cardinality constraint. We propose two fulfillment-related cost functions corresponding to spillover fulfillment and order splitting. This problem includes the fill rate maximization problem as a special case. We show that although the objective function is submodular for a broad class of cost functions, the fill rate maximization problem with the largest order size being two is NP-hard. Methodology/results : To make the problem tractable to solve, we formulate the general warehouse assortment problem under the two types of cost functions as mixed integer linear programs (MILPs). We also provide a dynamic programming algorithm to solve the problem in polynomial time if orders are nonoverlapping. Furthermore, we propose a simple heuristic called the marginal choice indexing (MCI) policy that allows the warehouse to store the most popular products. This policy is easy to compute, and hence, it is scalable to large-size problems. Although the performance of MCI can be arbitrarily bad in some extreme scenarios, we find a general condition under which it is optimal. This condition is satisfied by many multi-purchase choice models. Managerial implications : Through extensive numerical experiments on a real-world data set from RiRiShun Logistics, we find that the MCI policy is surprisingly near optimal in all the settings we tested. Simply applying the MCI policy, the fill rate is estimated to improve by 9.18% on average compared with the current practice for the local transfer centers on the training data set. More surprisingly, the MCI policy outperforms the MILP optimal solution in 14 of 25 cases on the test data set, illustrating its robustness against demand fluctuations.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Through the laws of inheritance, knowing an individual’s genetic status informs disease risk for family members, but current protocols for deciding whom to genetically test only consider one person at a time rather than design an optimal testing plan for the entire family. Methodology/results : We develop a Markov decision process framework for maximizing the net benefits of genetic testing that integrates a Bayesian network of genetic statuses, with a functional representation of cost-effectiveness. Our model provides a contingent sequence of family members to test one at a time, that is, a plan that dynamically incorporates new test results, revealed sequentially at random, to decide who next to test. In the general case, we show that optimal stopping follows a structure with two-sided thresholds, previously known only for individual testing. Although the optimal testing sequence, in general, is contingent on the family test results, in the special case of sibling-only tests we can identify this sequence a priori. Our numerical case study, which was conducted in a realistic BRCA1/2 testing setting, demonstrates that an optimal policy significantly improves cost-effectiveness over existing policies. Thus, our framework offers a promising and powerful new approach to genetic testing. Managerial implications : In an optimal policy, prioritizing testing family members who might otherwise not have been tested can lead to an overall improvement in familial health value, surpassing even the most cost-effective existing protocols. From a management perspective, healthcare organizations and insurance companies can potentially save costs by implementing this approach for such families.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We quantify the increase in productivity in emergency departments (EDs) from increasing nurse staff. We then estimate the associated revenue gains for the hospital and the associated welfare gains for society. The United States is over a decade into the worst nursing shortage crisis in history fueled by chronic underinvestment. To demonstrate to hospital managers and policymakers the benefits of investing in nursing, we clarify the positive downstream effects of doing so in the ED setting. Methodology/results : We use a high-resolution data set of patient visits to the ED of a major U.S. academic hospital. Time-dependent hazard estimation methods (nonparametric and parametric) are used to study how the real-time service speed of a patient varies with the state of the ED, including the time-varying workloads of the assigned nurse. A counterfactual simulation is used to estimate the gains from increasing nursing staff in the ED. We find that lightening a nurse’s workload by one patient is associated with a 14% service speedup for every patient under the nurse’s care. Simulation studies suggest that adding one more nurse to the busiest 12-hour shift of each day can shorten stays and avert $160,000 in lost patient wages per 10,000 visits. The reduction in service times also frees up capacity for treating more patients and generates $470,000 in additional net revenues for the hospital per 10,000 visits. Extensive sensitivity analyses suggest that our key message—that investing in nursing will more than pay for itself—is likely to hold across a wide range of EDs. Managerial implications : In determining whether to invest in more nursing resources, hospital managers need to look beyond whether payer reimbursements alone are sufficient to cover the up-front costs to also account for the resulting downstream benefits.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We consider a platform’s problem of how to staff its operations given the possibilities of hiring employees and setting up a contractor marketplace. We aim to understand the operational difference between these two work arrangement models. Methodology/results : We consider a model where demand is not only stochastic but also evolving over time, which we capture via a state of the world that determines the demand distribution. In the case of employees, the platform controls the number of employee hours it uses for serving demand, whereas in the case of contractors, it sets the wage paid to them per utilized hour. We show that although the employee problem is equivalent to a standard newsvendor, the contractor one corresponds to an unusual version of the newsvendor model where utilization is the control variable. Managerial implications : This distinction makes the contractor model more flexible, allowing us to prove that it performs significantly better, especially if the order of magnitude of demand is unknown. Meanwhile, hybrid solutions that combine both employees and contractors have complex optimal solutions and offer relatively limited benefits relative to a contractor marketplace.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Commodity prices have exhibited significant volatility in recent times, which poses an exogenous risk factor for commodity-processing and commodity-trading firms. Accurate commodity price forecasts can help firms leverage data-driven procurement policies that incorporate the underlying price volatility for financial and operational hedging decisions. However, historical prices alone are insufficient to obtain reasonable forecasts because of the extreme volatility. Methodology/results : Building on the hypothesis that commodity prices are driven by real-world events, we propose a method that automatically extracts events from news articles and combines them with price data using a neural network-based predictive model to forecast prices. In addition to achieving a high prediction accuracy that outperforms several benchmarks (by up to 13%), our proposed model is also interpretable , which allows us to identify meaningful events driving the price fluctuations. We found that the events frequently associated with major fluctuations in the price include “natural,” “hike,” “policy,” and “elections,” all of which are known drivers of price change. We used a corpus containing about 1.6 million news articles of a major Indian newspaper spanning 15 years and daily prices of four crops (onion, potato, rice, and wheat) in India to perform this study. Our proposed approach is flexible and can be used to predict other time series data, such as disease incidence levels or macroeconomic indicators, that are also influenced by real-world events. Managerial implications : Firms can leverage price forecasts from our system to design inventory and procurement policies in the face of uncertain commodity prices. Commodity merchants can also use the forecasts to design optimal storage policies for physical trading of commodities when prices are volatile. Our findings can also significantly impact policymakers, who can leverage the information of impending price changes and associated events to mitigate the negative effects of price shocks.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : The electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer NIO adopts a swappable-battery design and a battery-leasing business model known as battery as a service (BaaS). It recently introduced flexible battery leasing, which allows customers to temporarily up-/downgrade their primary leased batteries based on the needs for range. We investigate whether this business model innovation is viable, namely whether introducing flexible battery leasing in BaaS could benefit the manufacturer, the customers, and the environment compared with simple battery leasing. Methodology/results : Adopting a game-theoretical model, we find that introducing flexible battery leasing in BaaS can simultaneously improve the manufacturer profit as well as reduce the total customer cost and the total battery capacity. Such win-win-win outcomes generally occur for large high-capacity battery ranges and moderate high-capacity battery costs—both consistent with the ongoing trend in the EV industry and a model-calibration exercise. We further show that this key finding is robust for correlated regular and peak needs for range and when launching BaaS with flexible battery leasing and that if the manufacturer was to choose a high-capacity battery range for flexible battery leasing, it would choose one such that battery reallocation alone can meet all battery up-/downgrade demand without acquiring additional batteries. Managerial implications : Our findings confirm that flexible battery leasing can be a viable BaaS business model innovation and offer insights into when this may be the case. This insight strengthens the strategic support for EV manufacturers’ potential adoption of the swappable-battery design and the BaaS model, and it may inform their operating policies to implement flexible battery leasing.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Reducing the likelihood of man-made disasters that cause harm to life, property, and the environment is a key societal goal. To that end, regulatory agencies are responsible for ensuring man-made disasters do not occur. In practice, to accomplish this task, regulators have to rely on and cooperate with operators. However, how much cooperation is optimal? In this study, we explore the prudent level of cooperation between operators and regulators to avoid man-made disasters and the role whistleblowers and other policy levers can play in maintaining it within a Goldilocks range. Methodology/results : We synthesize various theories and accounts of man-made disasters to construct a system dynamics model of the mechanisms that lead up to these unwanted outcomes. We employ simulations to uncover how changes in crucial parameters related to cooperation lead to different outcomes and influence the likelihood of the occurrence of man-made disasters. Managerial implications : We resist explanations for man-made disasters rooted in regulatory capture and offer instead a nuanced account rooted in excess cooperation between operators and regulators emerging as a result of everyday operational imperatives and constraints. Our findings indicate that absence of disasters leads operators and regulators to fall into a “confidence trap” that perpetuates limited regulatory oversight and excess cooperation and eventually leads to a disaster. To mitigate this tendency, we investigate, in particular, the role that timely whistleblowing and other policy levers can play in mitigating man-made disasters. We provide managerial and policy implications such as incentivizing and safeguarding whistleblowers, limits on the revolving door between operators and regulators, and more stringent operating and safety scientific standards. Overall, we offer a new frame and potentially fruitful frontier for the operations management community to explore.

  abstract     = {Problem definition: The opioid epidemic is a crisis that has plagued the United States for decades. One central issue of the epidemic is inequitable access to treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD), which puts certain populations at a higher risk of opioid overdose. Methodology/results : We integrate a predictive dynamical model and a prescriptive optimization problem to compute high-quality opioid treatment facility and treatment budget allocations for each U.S. state. Our predictive model is a differential equation-based epidemiological model that captures the dynamics of the opioid epidemic. We use a process inspired by neural ordinary differential equations to fit this model to opioid epidemic data for each state and obtain estimates for unknown parameters in the model. We then incorporate this epidemiological model into a corresponding mixed-integer optimization problem (MIP) that aims to minimize the number of opioid overdose deaths and the number of people with OUD. We develop strong relaxations based on McCormick envelopes to efficiently compute approximate solutions to our MIPs that have a mean optimality gap of 3.99%. Our method provides socioeconomically equitable solutions, as it incentivizes investments in areas with higher social vulnerability (from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control’s Social Vulnerability Index) and opioid prescribing rates. On average, when allowing for overbudget solutions, our approach decreases the number of people with OUD by 9.03 ± 1.772 % , increases the number of people in treatment by 88.75 ± 26.223 % , and decreases the number of opioid-related deaths by 0.58 ± 0.111 % after 2 years compared with the baseline epidemiological model’s predictions. Managerial implications : Our solutions show that policymakers should target adding treatment facilities to counties that have significantly fewer facilities than their population share and are more socially vulnerable. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our optimization approach, guided by epidemiological and socioeconomic factors, should help inform these strategic decisions, as it yields population health benefits in comparison with benchmarks based solely on population and social vulnerability.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study open-shop service networks where customers go through multiple services. We were motivated by a partnering health screening clinic, where customers are routed by a dispatcher and operational performance is measured at two levels: micro-level, via waits for individual services, and macro-level, via overall wait. Both measures reflect customer experience and could support its management. Our analysis revealed that waits were long and increased along the service process. Such long waits give rise to negative waiting experience and the increasing shape is detrimental as it is known to create perceived waits that are even longer. Our goal is hence to analyze strategies that shape and improve customers’ perceived experience. Methodology/results : Analytically, we use a stylized two-station open-shop network to show that prioritizing advanced customers, jointly with pooling (virtual) queues, can improve both macro- and micro-level performance. We validate these findings with a simulation model, calibrated with our clinic’s data. Practically, we find that an automated routing system (ARS), recently implemented in the clinic, had a negligible impact on overall wait—It simply redistributed waiting among wait-for-routing and wait-for-service. However, ARS renders applicable sophisticated priority and routing policies (that were infeasible under the manual routing practice), specifically the ones arising from the present research. Managerial implications : Our study amplifies performance benefits of accounting for individual customers’ system status in addition to station-level load information. We offer insights into the implementation of new technologies: Firms better plan for fundamental changes in their operation rather than harness new technology to their existing operation, which may be suboptimal due to past technical limitations.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Physicians spend more than five hours a day working on Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems and more than an hour doing EHR tasks after the end of the workday. Numerous studies have identified the detrimental effects of excessive EHR use and after-hours work, including physician burnout, physician attrition, and appointment delays. However, EHR time is not purely an exogenous factor because it depends on physician usage behavior that could have important operational consequences. Interestingly, prior literature has not considered this topic rigorously. In this paper, we investigate how physicians’ workflow decisions on when to perform EHR tasks affect: (1) total time on EHR and (2) time spent after work. Methodology/results : Our data comprise around 150,000 appointments from 74 physicians from a large Academic Medical Center Family Medicine unit. Our data set contains detailed, process-level time stamps of appointment progression and EHR use. We find that the effect of working on EHR systems depends on whether the work is done before or after an appointment. Pre-appointment EHR work reduces total EHR workload and after-work hours spent on EHR. Post-appointment EHR work reduces after-work hours on EHR but increases total EHR time. We find that increasing idle time between appointments can encourage both pre- and post-appointment EHR work. Managerial implications : Our results not only help us understand the timing and structure of work on secondary tasks more generally but also will help healthcare administrators create EHR workflows and appointment schedules to reduce physician burnout associated with excessive EHR use.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study stochastic periodic-review inventory systems with lost sales, where the decision maker has no access to the true demand distribution a priori and can only observe historical sales data (referred to as censored demand) and feature information about the demand. In an inventory system, excess demand is unobservable because of inventory constraints, and sales data alone cannot fully recover the true demand. Meanwhile, feature information about the demand is abundant to assist inventory decisions. We incorporate features for inventory systems with censored demand. Methodology/results : We propose two feature-based inventory algorithms called the feature-based adaptive inventory algorithm and the dynamic shrinkage algorithm. Both algorithms are based on the stochastic gradient descent method. We measure the performance of the proposed algorithms through the average expected regret in finite periods: that is, the difference between the cost of our algorithms and that of a clairvoyant optimal policy with access to information, which is acting optimally. We show that the average expected cost incurred under both algorithms converges to the clairvoyant optimal cost at the rate of O ( log T / T ) for the perishable inventory case and O ( 1 / T ) for the nonperishable inventory case. The feature-based adaptive inventory algorithm results in high volatility in the stochastic gradients, which hampers the initial performance of regret. The dynamic shrinkage algorithm uses a shrinkage parameter to adjust the gradients, which significantly improves the initial performance. Managerial implications : This paper considers feature information. The idea of dynamic shrinkage for the stochastic gradient descent method builds on a fundamental insight known as the bias-variance trade-off. Our research shows the importance of incorporating the bias-variance in a dynamic environment for inventory systems with feature information. Funding: W. T.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Production systems deteriorate stochastically due to use and may eventually break down, resulting in high maintenance costs at scheduled maintenance moments. This deterioration behavior is affected by the system’s production rate. Although producing at a higher rate generates more revenue, the system may also deteriorate faster. Production should thus be controlled dynamically to tradeoff deterioration and revenue accumulation in between maintenance moments. We study systems for which the relation between production and deterioration is known and the same for each system and systems for which this relation differs from system to system and needs to be learned on-the-fly. The decision problem is to find the optimal production policy given planned maintenance moments (operational) and the optimal interval length between such maintenance moments (tactical). Methodology/results : For systems with a known production-deterioration relation, we cast the operational decision problem as a continuous time Markov decision process and prove that the optimal policy has intuitive monotonic properties. We also present sufficient conditions for the optimality of bang-bang policies, and we partially characterize the structure of the optimal interval length, thereby enabling efficient joint optimization of the operational and tactical decision problem. For systems that exhibit variability in their production-deterioration relations, we propose a Bayesian procedure to learn the unknown deterioration rate under any production policy. Numerical studies indicate that on average across a wide range of settings (i) condition-based production increases profits by 50% compared with static production, (ii) integrating condition-based production and maintenance decisions increases profits by 21% compared with the state-of-the-art sequential approach, and (iii) our Bayesian approach performs close, especially in the bang-bang regime, to an Oracle policy that knows each system’s production-deterioration relation. Managerial implications : Production should be adjusted dynamically based on real-time condition monitoring and the tactical maintenance planning should anticipate and integrate these operational decisions. Our proposed framework assists managers to do so optimally. Funding: This work was supported by the Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek [Grant 439.17.708].

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Slotting fees are lump-sum payments retailers demand from manufacturers to include manufacturers’ products in their assortments. Although retailers regard slotting fees as part of doing business, some manufacturers claim that slotting fees limit their ability to compete on a level playing field with other manufacturers. Considering these conflicting views, we study the role of manufacturer competition in the emergence of slotting fees and how slotting fees affect retailers’ category management (i.e., assortment and pricing) decisions. Methodology/results : We consider a game-theoretic model with a single retailer and two competing manufacturers, each offering a single product. The retailer makes slotting fee, assortment, and pricing decisions in the presence of an operational cost term that increases in the assortment size. The manufacturers that can afford the slotting fee set the wholesale prices for their products. This study leads to three key findings. First, slotting fees can be suboptimal when their absence would trigger intense wholesale price competition. Second, depending on the retailer’s operational cost and the intensity of manufacturer competition, slotting fees create three distinct effects -category expansion, rent extraction, and competitive exclusion under which product variety (i.e., the retailer’s assortment size) increases, remains unchanged, and decreases, respectively. Third, slotting fees are most (least) beneficial for the retailer when they lead to a decrease (increase) in product variety. Managerial implications : This study not only illustrates that retailers can use slotting fees as a strategic tool to control the intensity of manufacturer competition but also reveals how slotting fees impact retailers’ assortment and pricing decisions, with implications for manufacturers and policy makers.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Inaccurate records of inventory occur frequently and, by some measures, cost retailers approximately 4% in annual sales. Detecting inventory inaccuracies manually is cost-prohibitive, and existing algorithmic solutions rely almost exclusively on learning from longitudinal data, which is insufficient in the dynamic environment induced by modern retail operations. Instead, we propose a solution based on cross-sectional data over stores and stock-keeping units (SKUs), viewing inventory inaccuracies as a problem of identifying anomalies in a (low-rank) Poisson matrix. State-of-the-art approaches to anomaly detection in low-rank matrices apparently fall short. Specifically, from a theoretical perspective, recovery guarantees for these approaches require that nonanomalous entries be observed with vanishingly small noise (which is not the case in our problem and, indeed, in many applications). Methodology/results : So motivated, we propose a conceptually simple entrywise approach to anomaly detection in low-rank Poisson matrices. Our approach accommodates a general class of probabilistic anomaly models. We show that the cost incurred by our algorithm approaches that of an optimal algorithm at a min-max optimal rate. Using synthetic data and real data from a consumer goods retailer, we show that our approach provides up to a 10× cost reduction over incumbent approaches to anomaly detection. Along the way, we build on recent work that seeks entrywise error guarantees for matrix completion, establishing such guarantees for subexponential matrices, a result of independent interest. Managerial implications : By utilizing cross-sectional data at scale, our novel approach provides a practical solution to the issue of inventory inaccuracies in retail operations. Our method is cost-effective and can help managers detect inventory inaccuracies quickly, leading to increased sales and improved customer satisfaction. In addition, the entrywise error guarantees that we establish are of interest to academics working on matrix-completion problems.

  abstract     = {Problem definition: We investigate the effects of waiting time, mainly due to production in a make-to-batch-order (MTBO) system, on consumer choice behavior, pricing, assortment, and model estimation. In an MTBO system, the seller/manufacturer first collects orders placed within a certain period of time into a batch and then starts the production process. After the production of all orders in a batch are complete, the products are then shipped and delivered to individual consumers. Because of batch production and shipping, the disutility of the waiting time exhibits negative externality. Methodology/results: We adopt the widely used multinomial logit (MNL) model as a starting point and incorporate the anticipated wait into consumers’ decision making. The derived model, referred to as the MNL with wait model , is a solution of the rational expectation equilibrium and is capable of capturing the effects of negative externality induced by anticipated wait that may change the substitution patterns dramatically. We characterize the multiproduct price optimization problem under the MNL with wait model by establishing a one-to-one mapping between the price vector and the choice probability vector. We find that firms tend to charge higher prices for time-consuming items and charge lower prices for time-saving items compared with the optimal prices under the standard MNL model. In addition to price competition, we also study the Cournot-type competition, in which the decision is the choice probability for each firm and establish the existence of a Nash equilibrium. For assortment optimization, we identify mild conditions under which the optimality of revenue-ordered assortments still holds. However, the assortment problem under the MNL with wait model is generally NP-hard, so we develop approximation algorithms with performance guarantees and provide an easy-to-compute tight upper bound. Moreover, we develop an efficient maximum likelihood-based algorithm for model calibration and further conduct numerical studies to showcase the importance of incorporating disutility due to wait in estimation, pricing, and assortment planning problems. Managerial implications: The MNL with wait model can increase prediction accuracy for consumers’ choice behavior especially when they are aware of the potential wait. Failure to take into account the effects of anticipated wait in firms’ decision making may lead to substantial losses. Funding: The research of C.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Content promotion policies are crucial for online content platforms to improve content consumption and user engagement. However, traditional promotion policies generally neglect the diffusion effect within a crowd of users. In this paper, we study the candidate generation and promotion optimization (CGPO) problem for an online content platform, emphasizing the incorporation of the diffusion effect. Methodology/results : We propose a diffusion model that incorporates platform promotion decisions to characterize the adoption process of online content. Based on this diffusion model, we formulate the CGPO problem as a mixed-integer program with nonconvex and nonlinear constraints, which is proved to be NP-hard. Additionally, we investigate methods for estimating the diffusion model parameters using available online platform data and introduce novel double ordinary least squares (D-OLS) estimators. We prove the submodularity of the objective function for the CGPO problem, which enables us to find an efficient ( 1 − 1 / e ) -approximation greedy solution. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the D-OLS estimators are consistent and have smaller asymptotic variances than traditional ordinary least squares estimators. By utilizing real data from a large-scale video-sharing platform, we show that our diffusion model effectively characterizes the adoption process of online content. Compared with the policy implemented on the platform, our proposed promotion policy increases total adoptions by 49.90%. Managerial implications : Our research highlights the essential role of diffusion in online content and provides actionable insights for online content platforms to optimize their content promotion policies by leveraging our diffusion model.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Most of the display advertising inventory is sold through real-time auctions. The participants of these auctions are typically bidders (Google, Criteo, RTB House, and Trade Desk for instance) that participate on behalf of advertisers. In order to estimate the value of each display opportunity, they usually train advanced machine learning algorithms using historical data. In the labeled training set, the inputs are vectors of features representing each display opportunity, and the labels are the generated rewards. In practice, the rewards are given by the advertiser and are tied to whether a particular user converts. Consequently, the rewards are aggregated at the user level and never observed at the display level. A fundamental task that has, to the best of our knowledge, been overlooked is to account for this mismatch and split, or attribute, the rewards at the right granularity level before training a learning algorithm. We call this the label attribution problem. Methodology/results : In this paper, we develop an approach to the label attribution problem, which is both theoretically justified and practical. In particular, we develop a fixed point algorithm that allows for large-scale implementation and showcase our solution using a large-scale publicly available data set from Criteo, a large demand-side platform. We dub our approach the fixed point label attribution algorithm. Managerial implications : There is often a hidden leap of faith when transforming the advertiser’s signal into display labeling. Demand Side Platforms providers should be careful when building their machine learning pipeline and carefully solve the label attribution step.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Many logistical and financial challenges of facilitating an election lead election officials to consolidate polling locations. However, determining when it is appropriate to consolidate polling locations and how to consolidate polling locations, if necessary, is a difficult and high-stakes decision that influences voter participation. Methodology/results : We formalize the set of constraints and criteria that election officials should follow as the polling location consolidation problem (PLCP), which is formulated as an integer programming model. The PLCP simultaneously selects which polling locations will be used in the upcoming election, reassigns voter precincts to polling locations, and allocates critical resources to the selected polling locations. The PLCP minimizes the increased distance that voters must travel to their updated polling location. Because empirical research also demonstrates the importance of reducing the voters’ wait times, we require that most voters do not wait longer than a prespecified limit, such as 30 minutes, using a chance constraint. We prove that identifying a feasible solution to PLCP is NP-complete, which demonstrates the difficulty in making consolidation decisions, as well as the importance of optimization for this problem. Managerial implications : This paper introduces a structured and transparent approach to support election officials in making informed, data-driven decisions regarding how and when to consolidate polling locations that minimally impact voters and encourage voter participation. The approach could be used to develop preapproved contingency plans that could be employed if there are major disruptions to an election.

  abstract     = {Problem definition: We study the procurement decisions of a trade agent: The agent chooses a bid (unit price to pay) to procure the goods available from seller(s). If the agent wins the bid, the supply is used to meet the buyer’s demand. Methodology/results: The trade agent’s single-period, single-product problem is a new type of newsvendor problem. We analyze the agent’s optimal bid for a seller with yield uncertainty. We show that the bid outcome distribution needs to satisfy an easy-to-check condition but no conditions on the yield distribution are needed for a unique optimal bid to exist. We also show that the expected sales-to-supply ratio that measures scarcity affects the optimal bid. We investigate the monotonicity of the optimal bid with respect to economic parameters, demand, and distributions of bid outcome and yield. The agent’s problem with multiple sellers is also a novel newsvendor network problem. For the two-seller case, we show when diversification is optimal for the agent. We show that working with both sellers may not always be optimal despite the opportunity for risk pooling and bidding only at the unreliable seller may be optimal even when the other seller is reliable. Managerial implications: We make the following recommendations for the agent: (i) bid at a seller only when the expected sales-to-supply ratio for a seller is higher than the critical ratio, considering the agent’s cost of underage and overage, (ii) increase the bid if the bid outcome distribution increases in the reversed hazard rate order, and (iii) increase or decrease the bid depending on the demand-to-supply ratio when a seller’s expected yield increases. Inclusion of additional sellers lowers the optimal bids across the seller network, but it may not be optimal to bid at all sellers. For the two-seller problem, whether to diversify is a decision easily made by computing the expected benefit of bidding at each seller.

  abstract     = {Problem definition: We study a robust screening problem where a seller attempts to sell a product to a buyer knowing only the moment and support information of the buyer’s valuation distribution. The objective is to maximize the competitive ratio relative to an optimal hindsight policy equipped with full valuation information. Methodology/results: We formulate the robust screening problem as a linear programming problem, which can be solved efficiently if the support of the buyer’s valuation is finite. When the support of the buyer’s valuation is continuous and the seller knows the mean and the upper and lower bounds of the support for the buyer’s valuation, we show that the optimal payment is a piecewise polynomial function of the valuation with a degree of at most two. Moreover, we derive the closed-form competitive ratio corresponding to the optimal mechanism. The optimal mechanism can be implemented by a randomized pricing mechanism whose price density function is a piecewise inverse function adjusted by a constant. When the mean and variance are known to the seller, we propose a feasible piecewise polynomial approximation of the optimal payment function with a degree of at most three. We also demonstrate that the optimal competitive ratio exhibits a logarithmic decay with respect to the coefficient of variation of the buyer’s valuation distribution. Managerial implications: Our general framework provides an approach to investigating the value of moment information in the robust screening problem. We establish that even a loose upper bound of support or a large variance can guarantee a good competitive ratio. Funding: The research of S.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Multistage service is common in healthcare. One widely adopted approach to manage patient visits in multistage service is to provide patients with visit itineraries that specify personalized appointment time for each patient at each service stage. We study how to design such visit itineraries. Methodology/results : We develop the first optimization modeling framework to provide each patient with a personalized visit itinerary in a tandem (healthcare) service system. Due to interdependencies among stages, our model loses those elegant properties (e.g., L-convexity and submodularity) often utilized to solve the classic single-stage models. To address these challenges, we develop two original reformulations. One is directly amenable to off-the-shelf optimization software, and the other is a concave minimization problem over a polyhedron shown to have neat structural properties, based on which we develop efficient solution algorithms. In addition to these exact solution approaches, we propose an approximation approach with a provable optimality bound and numerically validated performance to serve as an easy-to-implement heuristic. A case study populated by data from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute shows that our approach makes a remarkable 28% cost reduction over practice on average. Managerial implications : Common approaches used in practice are based on simple adjustments to schedules generated by single-stage models, often assuming deterministic service times. Whereas such approaches are intuitive and take advantage of existing knowledge of single-stage models, they can lead to significant loss of operational efficiency in managing multistage services. A well-designed patient visit itinerary that carefully addresses the interdependencies among stages can significantly improve patient experience and provider utilization.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We consider a multiportfolio optimization problem in which nonlinear market impact costs result in a strong dependency of one account’s performance on the trading activities of the other accounts. Methodology/results : We develop a novel target-oriented model that jointly optimizes the rebalancing trades and the split of market impact costs. The key advantages of our proposed model include the consideration of clients’ targets on investment returns and the incorporation of distributional uncertainty. The former helps fund managers to circumvent the difficulty in identifying clients’ utility functions or risk parameters, whereas the latter addresses a practical challenge that the probability distribution of risky asset returns cannot be fully observed. Specifically, to evaluate the quality of multiple portfolios’ investment payoffs in achieving targets, we propose a new class of performance measures, called fairness-aware multiparticipant satisficing (FMS) criteria. These criteria can be extended to encompass distributional uncertainty and have the salient feature of addressing the fairness issue with the collective satisficing level as determined by the least satisfied participant. We find that, structurally, the FMS criteria have a dual connection with a set of risk measures. For multiportfolio optimization, we consider the FMS criterion with conditional value-at-risk being the underlying risk measure to further account for the magnitude of shortfalls against targets. The resulting problem, although nonconvex, can be solved efficiently by solving an equivalent converging sequence of tractable subproblems. Managerial implications : For the multiportfolio optimization problem, the numerical study shows that our approach outperforms utility-based models in achieving targets and in out-of-sample performance. More generally, the proposed FMS criteria provide a new decision framework for operational problems in which the decision makers are target-oriented rather than being utility maximizers and issues of fairness and ambiguity should be considered.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Medical operations require a large volume and variety of consumable supplies that are kept in hospital inventory and replenished on a regular basis. Stringent requirements on the availability of these supplies, together with high variability in their daily usage, contribute to the high inventory costs of the surgical departments in hospitals. We investigate the value of utilizing Advance Booking Information (ABI) on elective surgeries—which are often booked up to months in advance—in reducing inventory costs. Methodology/results : We study a single-item, periodic-review, stochastic inventory control problem, where the item demand in each period is driven by the number and type of surgeries requiring the item, and with the available information on elective surgeries integrated into the ordering decisions. Given that item usage from each case is uncertain and only realized after the surgery, ABI provides imperfect information on future demand. Through exact analysis of a simplified version of the problem, as well as extensive numerical experiments using synthetic and real data, enabled using a state aggregation technique, we provide insights on and quantify the value of using ABI as a function of the number of periods of ABI integrated into the ordering decisions. We identify a relevant parameter regime—namely, high backlog (relative to holding) costs and when surgeries are booked sufficiently in advance—where the value of using ABI could be significant and the majority of the benefits can be gained through incorporating only one period of ABI beyond the order lead time. In a case study conducted using real data, we observe up to 26% reduction in average inventory levels, without violating the service levels. Managerial implications : By incorporating readily available elective surgery schedules into replenishment decisions of surgical supplies, hospitals could significantly reduce inventory costs without compromising the availability of the supplies.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Split flow models, in which a physician rather than a nurse performs triage, are increasingly being used in hospital emergency departments (EDs) to improve patient flow. Before deciding whether such interventions should be adopted, it is important to understand how split flows causally impact patient flow and outcomes. Methodology/results : We employ causal inference methodology to estimate average causal effects of a split flow model on time to be roomed, time to disposition after being roomed, admission decisions, and ED revisits at a large tertiary teaching hospital that uses a split flow model during certain hours each day. We propose a regression discontinuity design to identify average causal effects, which we formalize with causal diagrams. Using electronic health records data ( n = 21,570), we estimate that split flow increases average time to be roomed by about 4.6 minutes (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 2.9, 6.2 minutes) but decreases average time to disposition by 14.4 minutes (95% CI: 4.1, 24.7 minutes), leading to an overall reduction in length of stay. Split flow is also found to decrease admission rates by 5.9% (95% CI: 2.3%, 9.4%) but not at the expense of a significant change in revisit rates. Lastly, we find that the split flow model is especially effective at reducing length of stay during low congestion levels, which mediation analysis partly attributes to early task initiation by the physician assigned to triage. Managerial implications : A split flow model can improve flow and may have downstream effects on admissions but not revisits.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We consider a surgery sequencing and scheduling problem with uncertain durations of surgeries in the context of an operating theater. From real data collected from a hospital, we observe the common practice, namely, “to follow,” in which surgeries are conducted sequentially and immediately one after another, according to a specific schedule. Methodology/results : Based on this practice, we propose a mathematical framework to balance the risk of delay and idling using the punctuality index, which takes into consideration both the probability and intensity of delay and idle time. We develop a computationally efficient procedure based on Benders decomposition to derive exact solutions for the problem. The scheduling problem is solvable in polynomial time when the sequence is given. The framework can also accommodate a robust setting when the underlying probability distribution is not fully available. For practical use, we propose two effective heuristics for sequencing decisions by approximating the model. Using real data, we demonstrate that our framework is significantly better than the risk-neutral and probability-maximizing approaches in both performance and computational efficiency. Moreover, the robust setting can effectively lessen the risk of extremely long delay and idle time, and the heuristics are efficient with only a small sacrifice of performance. Managerial implications : With the to-follow policy, our sequencing and scheduling model describes the actual practice better. The two heuristics can be applied easily and directly to help managers of operating theaters to make decisions. Funding: J.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Improving access to contraceptives is one of the most effective interventions to prevent unintended pregnancies and save the lives of women in least developed countries (LDCs), where the overwhelming majority of maternal deaths occur. However, access to reproductive health commodities is often limited in LDCs because of frequent stock-outs at last-mile health facilities. In this study, we evaluate and compare the effect of two distribution models on last-mile contraceptive availability and key public health outcomes (e.g., unintended pregnancies, maternal and newborn deaths). These distribution models are (i) the commonly used pull distribution model, in which health facilities are fully responsible for managing inventory, and (ii) an alternative model known as the informed push distribution model, which delegates inventory management tasks to external logistics providers. Methodology/results : We leverage the staggered transition from pull distribution to informed push distribution in Senegal, a country that redesigned its contraceptive distribution system. We conduct empirical analyses, including a triple differences estimation, on novel field data compiled from multiple sources to evaluate the effect of the transition. We find that the transition significantly reduces contraceptive stock-outs, frontline health worker workload, unintended pregnancies, and maternal and newborn mortalities and also improves client satisfaction, especially in health facilities with less mature inventory management practices and less developed road infrastructure. A comprehensive cost–benefit analysis shows that the aforementioned benefits are achieved in a cost-efficient manner at these facilities, making them prime candidates for the transition. However, for facilities with less mature inventory management practices but more developed road infrastructure, upgrading the inventory management system is a substantially more cost-efficient alternative than transitioning to a new distribution model without compromising the benefits. Managerial implications : Given the resource constraints faced by the public health sector in LDCs, it is imperative to understand how the operational and public health benefits of the transition to the informed push model vary based on facility characteristics. Our findings offer actionable insights for resource allocation by identifying health facilities that benefit the most from the transition.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Online food delivery (OFD) platforms have witnessed rapid global expansion, partly driven by shifts in consumer behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic. These platforms enable customers to order food conveniently from a diverse array of restaurants through their mobile phones. A core functionality of these platforms is the algorithmic matching of drivers to food orders, which is the focus of our study as we aim to optimize this driver-order matching process. Methodology/results : We formulate real-time matching algorithms that take into account uncertain food processing times to strategically “delay” the assignment of drivers to orders. This intentional delay is designed to create a “thicker” marketplace, increasing the availability of both drivers and orders. Our algorithms use machine learning techniques to predict food processing times, and the dispatching of drivers is subsequently determined by balancing costs for idle driver waiting and for late deliveries. In scenarios with a single order in isolation, we show that the optimal policy adopts a threshold structure. Building on this insight, we propose a new k -level thickening policy with driving time limits for the general case of multiple orders. This policy postpones the assignment of drivers until a maximum of k suitable matching options are available. We evaluate our policy using a simplified model and identify several analytical properties, including the quasi-convexity of total costs in relation to market thickness, indicating the optimality of an intermediate level of market thickness. Numerical experiments with real data from Meituan show that our policy can yield a 54% reduction in total costs compared with existing policies. Managerial implications : Our study reveals that incorporating food processing times into the dispatch algorithm remarkably improves the efficacy of driver assignment. Our policy enables the platform to control two vital market parameters of real-time matching decisions: the number of drivers available to pick up and deliver an order promptly, and their proximity to the restaurant. Based on these two parameters, our algorithm matches drivers with orders in real time, offering significant managerial implications.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : The rapid expansion of distributed energy resources (DERs) is one of the most significant changes to electricity systems around the world. Examples of DERs include solar panels, electric storage, thermal storage, and combined heat and power plants. Because of the small supply capacities of these DERs, it is impractical for them to participate directly in the wholesale electricity market. We study in this paper the question of how to integrate these DER supplies into the electricity market, with the objective of achieving full market efficiency. Methodology/results : We study four aggregation models, where there is an aggregator who, with the knowledge of DERs’ utility functions and generations, procures electricity from DERs, and sells them in the wholesale market. In the first aggregation model, a profit-maximizing aggregator announces a differential two-part pricing policy to the DER owners. We show that this model preserves full market efficiency, that is, the social welfare achieved by this model is the same as that when DERs participate directly in the wholesale market. In the second aggregation model, the profit-seeking aggregator is forced to impose a uniform two-part pricing policy to prosumers from the same location, and we numerically show that there can be large efficiency loss. In the third (fourth) aggregation model, a uniform (semiuniform) two-part pricing policy is applied to DER owners, whereas the aggregator becomes fully regulated but is guaranteed nonnegative (positive) profit. It is shown that these models again achieve full market efficiency. Furthermore, we show that DER aggregation also leads to a reduction in the market power of conventional generators. Managerial implications : DER aggregation via profit-seeking and/or regulated aggregators has been investigated by California Independent System Operator and New York Independent System Operator, among others, and the recent Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Order No. 2222 paved the way for aggregators to bid in the wholesale market. Our four aggregation models may shed light on how DERs should be included in the wholesale electricity market.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study the operations of electric vehicles (EVs) providing frequency regulation services to the electric grid in vehicle-to-grid (V2G) systems. In particular, individually owned EVs collaboratively bid in the regulation market, coordinated by a platform that operates the network of charging equipment. We study how the platform determines optimal pricing incentives for drivers to plug in their EVs, accounting for heterogeneous driving schedules. Methodology/results : We model the platform’s pricing optimization problem as a bilevel program: At the upper level, the platform determines hourly rebates for EV owners to plug in their EVs and capacity bids in the regulation market; at the lower level, individual travelers optimize their travel and charging schedules in response to pricing incentives. To account for uncertainties and heterogeneity in regulation market prices and travel patterns, we adopt distributionally robust optimization techniques to formulate the problem as a mixed-integer second-order cone program. We conduct a computational study based on the California Household Travel Survey data set and actual frequency regulation prices. Our results show that the ability to offer time-varying rebates and install workplace chargers can significantly improve the V2G platform’s expected profits. Managerial implications : As EV adoption progresses past the nascent stage, V2G business models become more viable. Successful implementation of V2G provides economic incentive for switching to EVs, potentially helps sustain adoption growth, and complements the growth of renewable power by helping stabilize the grid. Our findings shed light on the design of driver incentives for V2G systems. Funding: R. Tang acknowledges support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant 72201206].

Methodology/results: We use a differences-in-differences design, exploiting the staggered introduction of Tesla Supercharger stations across the United States. We combine data on Supercharger installations with mobile phone–based estimates of retailer foot traffic. We explore heterogeneity in the treatment effect, in terms of EV charger characteristics, visitor characteristics, establishment type, and local physical context. We estimate that establishments experience an average 4% increase in monthly visits following the installation of a Tesla Supercharger. These effects arise primarily for retailers that offer relatively quick services (e.g., fast food) and for those located very near to the charger (within 150 meters). The effects are also more pronounced when the Supercharger is one of the first EV chargers introduced into the local area.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Motivated by the prevalence of paid priority programs in practice, we study a service provider operating a system in which customers have random waiting costs and choose between two queues: regular (no cost) or priority (for a fee). We also consider a mechanism by which the provider redistributes a portion of priority revenue to compensate regular-queue customers for their longer waits. Methodology/results : To determine the waiting-cost-dependent equilibrium priority purchasing strategies, we establish structural results at a sample-path level and prove that they generalize. In models both with and without compensation, the equilibrium exhibits a cost-dependent, increasing-threshold structure. We also prove that compensation entails fewer priority purchases because compensating regular-queue customers makes priority less attractive. We then analyze system-wide performance. Despite the fewer priority purchases, for a fixed (low) priority fee, compensation can actually reduce equilibrium aggregate waiting cost by filtering low-waiting-cost customers out of the priority queue; however, this finding does not hold when comparing at the optimal fees. We then test our models in the laboratory. Key behavioral regularities are that low-cost subjects are overrepresented (underrepresented) in the priority (regular) queue compared with equilibrium, and subjects with low and high waiting costs tend to overbuy priority at high fees. Managerial implications : Our theoretical and behavioral results guide service providers in managing priority service systems. First, we find that compensation does not provide short-term performance benefits. Second, our experiments reveal that suboptimal customer decisions partially prevent efficient reordering of customers by waiting cost, leading to higher aggregate waiting cost than the equilibrium predicts, but still lower than under first-come, first-serve service. Finally, because customers tolerate higher fees than they should, a revenue-maximizing provider can set a higher priority fee and extract more revenue than it could if customers acted rationally.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We consider a periodic-review dual-sourcing inventory system with a regular source (lower unit cost but longer lead time) and an expedited source (shorter lead time but higher unit cost) under carried-over supply and backlogged demand. Unlike existing literature, we assume that the firm does not have access to the demand distribution a priori and relies solely on past demand realizations. Even with complete information on the demand distribution, it is well known in the literature that the optimal inventory replenishment policy is complex and state dependent. Therefore, we focus our attention on a class of popular, easy-to-implement, and near-optimal heuristic policies called the dual-index policy. Methodology/results : The performance measure is the regret, defined as the cost difference of any feasible learning algorithm against the full-information optimal dual-index policy. We develop a nonparametric online learning algorithm that admits a regret upper bound of O ( T log T ) , which matches the regret lower bound for any feasible learning algorithms up to a logarithmic factor. Our algorithm integrates stochastic bandits and sample average approximation techniques in an innovative way. As part of our regret analysis, we explicitly prove that the underlying Markov chain is ergodic and converges to its steady state exponentially fast via coupling arguments, which could be of independent interest. Managerial implications : Our work provides practitioners with an easy-to-implement, robust, and provably good online decision support system for managing a dual-sourcing inventory system.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Charities face tension when deciding whether to earmark donations, that is, allow donors to restrict the use of their donations for a specific purpose. Research shows that earmarking decreases operational performance because it limits charities’ flexibility to use donations. However, there is also a common belief that earmarking increases donations. Earmarking is assumed to increase donations through three mechanisms: by (i) giving donors control over their donations, (ii) increasing operational transparency of donations, and (iii) changing donors’ levels of altruism and warm-glow. To resolve this tension, we study how, when, and why earmarking affects donors’ decisions. We consider three important decisions donors make that impact the fundraising outcome: (i) preference between earmarking and nonearmarking, (ii) decision to donate or not (i.e., donor activation), and (iii) the donation amount. Methodology/results : We design three online experiments that allow us to quantify the effect of earmarking on donors’ decisions and to investigate the role of the three aforementioned mechanisms in fundraising. Our results reveal, for example, that earmarking activates more donors but it does not always increase donation amounts. In addition, we determine the conditions under which the three mechanisms affect the outcome of fundraising campaigns.

Faithfully modeling the energy conversion losses during battery charging and discharging renders this optimization problem nonconvex. Methodology/results : By exploiting a total unimodularity property of the uncertainty set and an exact linear decision rule reformulation, we prove that this nonconvex robust optimization problem with functional uncertainties is equivalent to a tractable linear program. Through extensive numerical experiments using real-world data, we quantify the economic value of vehicle-to-grid and elucidate the financial incentives of vehicle owners, aggregators, equipment manufacturers, and regulators.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Crowdfunding goes beyond raising funds. Entrepreneurs often use crowdfunding to solicit feedback from customers to improve their products and may therefore prefer to launch their crowdfunding campaigns using basic versions of their products with fewer features. However, customers may not be persuaded by a campaign if the product appears to be underdeveloped. In view of this tradeoff, a key question for entrepreneurs is how much to develop a product before launching a crowdfunding campaign. Methodology/results : Analyzing a game-theoretical model and testing its predictions empirically, we study (1) how the development level of a product at campaign launch, measured by the initial number of product features, influences whether customers will make comments that help entrepreneurs improve the product; (2) whether entrepreneurs continue to improve the product during the campaign; and (3) whether the campaign is successful. We show that, as the number of product features at campaign launch increases, the likelihood that customers will make comments and that the product will be improved during the campaign first increases but then decreases. Furthermore, the likelihood of campaign success first increases but then decreases with the number of product features at campaign launch. Finally, by analyzing the interactions between customer feedback, product improvement, and campaign success, we show that customer feedback motivates entrepreneurs to improve the product during the campaign. Moreover, entrepreneurs should take account of the initial number of features and customer feedback when improving the product, because otherwise product improvements can harm campaign success. Managerial implications : Our study provides practical insights on how entrepreneurs can use crowdfunding to aid product development and improvement. Specifically, entrepreneurs should avoid overdeveloping their products before crowdfunding campaigns because, as well as decreasing the chance of campaign success, this could hinder their ability to save development costs (e.g., market research costs) through involving customers in product development.

Hence, it is necessary to explore the potential of intraproject learning to further improve the performance of project scheduling. Because learning consumes time, firms may underinvest in intraproject learning if they do not recognize its value. Although the project scheduling literature discusses the potential value of using obtained information from learning within the same project, we formally model and optimize the use of intraproject learning in project scheduling. Methodology/results : We model the tradeoff between investing time in learning from completed tasks and achieving reduced durations for subsequent tasks to minimize the total project cost. We show that this problem is intractable. We develop a heuristic that finds near optimal solutions and a strong relaxation that allows some learning from partially completed tasks. Our computational study identifies project characteristics where intraproject learning is most worthwhile. In doing so, it motivates project managers to understand and apply intraproject learning to improve the performance of their projects. A real case is provided by a problem of the Consumer Business Group of Huawei Corporation, for which our model and algorithm provide a greater than 20% improvement in project duration. Managerial implications : We find consistent evidence that projects in general can benefit substantially from intraproject learning, and larger projects benefit more. Our computational studies provide the following insights. First, the benefit from learning varies with the features of the project network, and projects with more complex networks possess greater potential benefit from intraproject learning and deserve more attention to learning opportunities; second, noncritical tasks at an earlier project stage should be learned more extensively; and third, tasks that are more similar (or have more similar processes) to later tasks also deserve more investment in learning. Learning should also be invested more in tasks that have more successors, where knowledge gained can be used repetitively.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We model the development of effective agricultural supply chains (agri-chains) in emerging economies for better utilization of land and intermediate processing resources for harvested export-oriented goods. We study decisions made by farmers, intermediate processors, and government officials in agri-chains. The structure and management of supply chains and government minimum guaranteed prices to farmers affect the performance of these chains and are in the domain of our study. Methodology/results : We develop models of agricultural supply chains in which yields are correlated across regions, and farmers sell to competing capacitated processors. The models have two types of fundamental decisions: determining how much land to allocate for planting before the start of a growing season and, determining the prices offered by competing processors that purchase the harvest. We develop analytical results and algorithmic approaches for finding resulting equilibria that depend on the nature of decision making and on the structure of yield uncertainty. In particular, for all-or-nothing yields, we characterize the ranges of minimum guaranteed prices that lead to farmers’ no-production, under-production, full-production and over-production equilibria. Analytical results supported by numerical experiments allow us to conclude that appropriately setting minimum price guarantees, with the exact definition of such ranges dependent on agri-chain characteristics, can lead to first-best supply chain solutions. Managerial implications : The analysis also suggests that some farmer co-operation in land allocation or regional integration of farmer-processing assets, together with moderate minimum guaranteed prices, might be implementable pathways for achieving agri-chain efficiency in emerging economies. In an interesting result, farmlands with yields of positive correlation tend to inhibit over-production, whereas those with negative correlations tend to induce over-production.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : In a multistage model of a bilateral supply chain, we study two postponement strategies that the downstream retailer may adopt to mitigate the supply yield risk originating from the upstream production process. The retailer could either postpone the procurement payment until after the yield is realized and pay only for the delivered amount; postpone the pricing decision to better utilize the available supply; or do both. Although both strategies have been separately studied in literature, there is little research on their combined effect and system-wide implications in a decentralized setting. Methodology/results : Taking a game-theoretic approach, we formulate a Stackelberg game and solve for the equilibrium in four scenarios, respectively, in which the retailer uses different combinations of the postponement strategies. There are three main findings. First, when the production cost is low and the yield loss is highly likely, the retailer never strictly benefits from either postponement strategy; with relatively high production cost, the retailer is more likely to adopt payment, rather than pricing, postponement. Second, we uncover a situation where postponing payment and postponing pricing are strategic complements for the retailer. That is, the use of one strategy may increase the benefit of using the other. Third, we identify conditions under which the postponement strategies can be Pareto optimal to the entire supply chain, making the firms’ profits and the consumer surplus simultaneously higher. Managerial implications : These results can be applied in many practical settings to provide guidance for firms to better design the procurement contract and properly use marketing instrument (pricing) to effectively mitigate supply risk and increase profit.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Probabilistic selling (PS) is a business model whereby, in addition to selling transparent products, a firm sells an opaque good, which is unknown to buyers until after purchase. We examine how PS affects retailer-manufacturer interactions in markets for physical goods and how upstream competition impacts channel members’ incentives to facilitate PS. Methodology/results : Using a Hotelling-based model of a multiproduct retailer, we find that a retailer maximizes its profit by assigning equal probability to each product even when the products have different wholesale prices. We also find that PS mitigates the inefficiencies caused by the double-marginalization problem. Although the potential benefit from PS is greater for a decentralized channel than for a centralized one, the market conditions for which PS arises are narrower for a decentralized channel. Furthermore, PS shifts channel power toward the manufacturer. However, it is possible for a win-win-win outcome to arise in which the manufacturer, retailer, and consumers benefit from PS. As expected, upstream competition shifts channel profit toward the retailer. However, competition also has surprising effects: It shrinks, rather than expands, the viability of PS and makes it possible for each manufacturer to benefit from its rival’s cost reduction. Managerial implications : A manufacturer should induce the retailer to offer an opaque good if its production costs are sufficiently low and the products are sufficiently close substitutes. It is optimal for the manufacturer to increase (decrease) its wholesale prices in response to the retailer’s ability to offer opaque goods if product differentiation is low (modest). Setting a wholesale price below cost sometimes maximizes a manufacturer’s profit. Furthermore, a retailer can achieve a strategic advantage by using products from multiple manufacturers to construct opaque goods. However, the retailer’s ability to leverage this advantage is curtailed because its use of equal-probability assignments relaxes competition between manufacturers. Funding: S.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Large cities around the globe are facing an alarming growth in traffic congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, to which a significant contributor in recent years are on-demand cabs operated by ride-hailing platforms. Newly emerged pooled transportation options like shuttle services are cheaper and greener alternatives. However, those alternatives are still new to many customers and policy makers. The design of their promotion policies demands careful investigation. This paper studies how we can reduce the number of on-demand cabs on the road and, therefore, their GHG emissions by promoting pooled transportation such as shuttle services. Methodology/Results : In this work, we use detailed usage data and build a structural model to study customer preferences of price and service features when choosing between private cabs and a scheduled shuttle service. Using the estimated model, we identify and evaluate the efficacy of improving service features like reducing the walking distance to shuttle stops on customers’ choices of transport and, therefore, the number of ride-hailing vehicles on the road. We find that a 20% decrease in walking distance can achieve 40% of the benefits of commonly adopted congestion surcharge policies. It can also reduce up to 4.8 thousand tonnes of GHG emissions, which is worth over a million dollars per year. In addition, we demonstrate the implementability of walking distance reduction policies by adding stops on existing shuttle routes. Managerial implications : Reducing the number of ride-hailing vehicles on the road has become an important goal in many cities’ green transport policy design. For example, cities like New York have implemented congestion surcharge policies targeting ride-hailing vehicles in recent years. Our findings suggest that, by changing operations levers such as service features of pooled transport, cities can achieve a substantial amount of benefits from reducing congestion compared with congestion surcharge policies with essentially zero cost, leading to much more efficient green transport policies.

Methodology/results : Using data from 2003 to 2019, we find that inventory productivity is lower materially and statistically for firms located upstream in the supply network, and higher for high degree and more central firms. Firms with high inventory productivity show high equity valuations and abnormal returns, with both valuations and abnormal returns amplified for upstream, low degree, and peripheral firms. Moreover, the difference in valuations and abnormal returns between best and worst performing firms is greater upstream, suggesting that financial markets offer outsized rewards for improving inventory productivity to upstream firms. Managerial implications : We show that the information about firm’s upstreamness and centrality in the supply network is a valuable predictor of its inventory productivity and financial performance. Our methods for evaluating upstreamness are useful for that purpose. For operations managers and firm executives, our results highlight strong incentives for inventory productivity improvement upstream in the supply network.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Designing effective operational strategies requires a good understanding of customer behavior. The classic economic theory of customer choice has long been the paradigm in the operations literature. However, the rise of online marketplaces such as e-commerce has triggered considerable efforts in academia and industry to develop alternative models that not only provide a good approximation of customer behavior but also are easily scalable for large-scale implementations. In this paper, we consider a multiproduct dynamic pricing problem with limited inventories under the so-called cascade click model , which is one of the most popular click models used in practice and has been intensively studied in the computer science literature. Methodology/results : We present some fundamental results. First, we derive a sufficiently general characterization of the optimal pricing policy and show that it has a different structure than the optimal policy under the standard pricing model. Second, we show that the optimal expected total revenue under the cascade click model can be upper bounded by the objective value of an approximate deterministic pricing problem. Third, we show that two policies that are known to have strong performance guarantees in the standard revenue management setting can be properly adapted (in a nontrivial way) to the setting with cascade click model while retaining their strong performance. Finally, we also briefly discuss the joint ranking and pricing problem and provide an iterative heuristic to calculate an approximate ranking. Managerial implications : Taking into account customers’ click-and-search behavior leads to different structures of the optimal pricing policy, and some common insights under the standard pricing models may no longer hold. Moreover, our simulation studies show that pricing under a (misspecified) classic choice model that is oblivious to customers click-and-search behavior can severely impact profitability.

  abstract     = {Problem definition: Generating recommendations of compatible dating partners is a challenging task for online dating platforms because uncovering users’ idiosyncratic preferences is difficult. Thus, platforms tend to recommend popular users to others more frequently than unpopular users. This paper studies such popularity bias in an online dating platform’s recommendations and its consequences for users’ likelihood of finding dating partners. Methodology/results: Motivated by the empirical evidence that a user’s chance of being recommended by the platform’s algorithm increases significantly with the user’s popularity, we study an online dating platform’s incentive that generates popularity bias by modeling the platform’s recommendations and users’ subsequent interactions in a three-stage matching game. Our analysis shows that the recommendations that maximize the platform’s revenue and those that maximize the number of successful matches between users are not necessarily at odds, even though the former leads to a higher bias against unpopular users. Unbiased recommendations result in significantly lower revenue for the platform and fewer matches when users’ implicit cost of evaluating incoming messages is low. Popular users help the platform generate more revenue and a higher number of successful matches as long as these popular users do not become “out of reach.” We validate our theoretical results by running simulations of the platform based on a machine learning–based predictive model that estimates users’ behavior. Managerial implications: Our result indicates that an online dating platform can increase revenue and users’ chances of finding dating partners simultaneously with a certain degree of bias against unpopular users. Online dating platforms can use our theoretical results to understand user behavior and our predictive model to improve their recommendation systems (e.g., by selecting a set of users leading to the highest probabilities of matching or other revenue-generating interactions).

  abstract     = {Problem definition: Disputes on online labor platforms have traditionally been mediated by the platform itself, which is often viewed as unhelpful or biased. However, there are emerging platforms that promise to resolve disputes with a novel tribunal system and relegate dispute resolution to individual platform users through a voting mechanism. We aim to examine the dispute resolution systems used by traditional platforms (i.e., the centralized dispute system) and emerging platforms (i.e., the decentralized dispute system) in order to assess whether the latter has an advantage over the former. Methodology/results: We use game theory to analyze both the centralized and decentralized dispute systems, and we model the tribunal’s voting game using the global games framework. Our findings indicate that in order to achieve a fair voting outcome, it is crucial to have sufficient heterogeneity in the assessments of tribunal members. Moreover, the decentralized dispute system outperforms the centralized dispute system only when the freelancer’s skill level is sufficiently high. Lastly, the decentralized dispute system has the potential to induce a more socially optimal quality level from the freelancer. Managerial implications: Our findings provide insights on the optimal adoption and implementation of the decentralized dispute system. The decentralized dispute system is more effective for tasks that involve subjective evaluations, and platforms should avoid strategies that homogenize the assessments of tribunal members. Moreover, platforms should consider switching to the decentralized dispute system only if they are able to verify the skill level of freelancers through certification or other means. Lastly, the decentralized dispute system may be more appealing to policy makers because of its potential to induce a more socially optimal outcome.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : The job of any marketplace is to facilitate the matching of supply with demand in real time. Success is often measured using various metrics. The challenge is to design matching algorithms to balance the tradeoffs among multiple objectives in a stochastic environment, to arrive at a “compromise” solution, which minimizes say the ℓ p -norm–based distance function between the attained performance metrics and the target performances. Methodology/results : We observe that the sample average approximation formulation of this multiobjective stochastic optimization problem can be solved by an online algorithm that uses only gradient information from “historical” (i.e., past) sample information and not on the current state of the system. The online algorithm relies on a set of weight functions, which are updated adaptively over time, based on real-time tracking of the gaps in attained performance and the performance target. This allows us to recast the online algorithm as a randomized algorithm to solve the original stochastic problem. When the predetermined performance targets are attainable, our randomized policy achieves the targets with a near-optimal performance guarantee (measured by regret, or deviation away from the optimal performance). When the targets are not attainable, our policy generates a compromise solution to the multiobjective stochastic optimization problem, even when the efficient frontier for this stochastic optimization problem cannot be explicitly characterized a priori. We implement our model to address a challenge faced by a ride-sourcing platform that matches passengers and drivers in real time. Four performance metrics—platform revenue, driver service score, pick-up distance, and number of matched pairs—are simultaneously considered in the design of ride-matching algorithm, without prespecifying the weight on each performance metric. This mechanism has been extensively tested using synthetic and real data. Managerial implications : We show that, under appropriate conditions, all parties in the ride-sourcing ecosystem, from drivers, passengers, to the platform, can be better off under our compromise matching policy compared with other popular policies currently in use. In particular, the platform can obtain higher revenue and ensure better drivers (with higher service scores) are assigned more orders, and passengers are more likely to be matched to better drivers (albeit with a slight increase in the waiting time) compared with existing policies that focus on pick-up distance minimization. The ability to balance the conflicting goals in multiple objectives in a stochastic operating environment has the potential to contribute to the long-term sustainable growth of ride-sourcing platforms.

  abstract     = {Problem definition: Kidney paired donation programs allow patients registered with an incompatible donor to receive a suitable kidney from another donor, as long as the latter’s co-registered patient, if any, also receives a kidney from a different donor. The kidney exchange problem (KEP) aims to find an optimal collection of kidney exchanges taking the form of cycles and chains. Methodology/results: We develop the first decomposition method that is able to consider long cycles and long chains for projected large realistic instances. Particularly, we propose a branch-and-price framework in which the pricing problems are solved (for the first time in packing problems in a digraph) through multivalued decision diagrams. We present a new upper bound on the optimal value of the KEP, obtained via our master problem. Computational experiments show superior performance of our method over the state of the art by optimally solving almost all instances in the PrefLib library for multiple cycle and chain lengths. Managerial implications: Our algorithm also allows the prioritization of the solution composition, for example, chains over cycles or vice versa, and we conclude, similar to previous findings, that chains benefit the overall matching efficiency and highly sensitized patients.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Delays in admission to rehabilitation care can adversely impact patient outcomes. In addition, delayed patients keep occupying their acute care beds, making them unavailable for incoming patients. Admission delays are mainly caused by a lack of rehabilitation bed capacity and the time required to plan for rehabilitation activities, which we refer to as processing times . Because of non-standard bed allocation decisions and data limitations in practice, quantifying the magnitude of the two sources of delays can be technically challenging yet critical to the design of evidence-based interventions to reduce delays. We propose an empirical approach to understanding the contributions of the two sources of delays when only a single (combined) measure of admission delay is available. Methodology/results : We propose a hidden Markov model (HMM) to estimate the unobserved processing times and the status-quo bed allocation policy. Our estimation results quantify the magnitude of processing times versus capacity-driven delays and provide insights into factors impacting the bed allocation decision. We validate our estimated policy using a queueing model of patient flow and find that ignoring processing times or using simple bed allocation policies can lead to highly inaccurate delay estimates. In contrast, our estimated policy allows for accurate evaluation of different operational interventions. We find that reducing processing times can be highly effective in reducing admission delays and bed-blocking costs. In addition, allowing early transfer—whereby patients can complete some of their processing requirements in the rehabilitation unit—can significantly reduce admission delays, with only a small increase in rehab LOS. Managerial implications : Our study demonstrates the importance of quantifying different sources of delays in the design of effective operational interventions for reducing delays in admission to rehabilitation care. The proposed estimation framework can be applied in other transition-of-care settings with personalized capacity allocation decisions and hidden processing delays.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : For many information goods, longer publication cycles (or batches of information) are more economical, but often result in less timely—and, therefore, less valuable—information. Whereas the digitalization of publication processes has reduced fixed publication costs, making shorter publication cycles more economically viable, competing firms have adapted their publication cycles differently: some of them publish more frequently, whereas others publish less frequently. In the face of growing competition and digitalization, how should information providers change their publication frequency strategies? Methodology/results : In this paper, we build a game-theoretic model to determine how information providers should set their publication cycles and prices in a duopoly. We find that, compared with a monopolistic environment, competition gives rise to differentiation by cycles and expands product variety. Specifically, competing firms should seek to differentiate on their publication frequency when the fixed publication is high and their contents share a high degree of commonality, but not otherwise. Whereas a reduction in the fixed cost of publication tends to yield shorter publication cycles, it could also intensify the competitive dynamics, leading firms to further differentiate their publication cycles, hurting consumer surplus. However, this could be temporary, as firms may ultimately converge in their choices of publication cycles. Managerial implications : The digitalization of publication processes is disrupting many information provision industries (e.g., news, weather, financial). We show that competing firms should anticipate nonmonotone or abrupt changes in their publication strategy as their publication processes get digitalized and may actually be hurt—as well as consumers—in the process of digitalization.

  abstract     = {Problem definition: We consider pricing of services with strategic customers who have heterogeneous delay costs motivated by transportation systems. Customers are strategic decision makers who weigh the reward from the transport service against the waiting cost for the vehicle at a transportation station. Customers arrive at the station according to a Poisson process, and the vehicle visits the station according to a renewal process. We analyze the optimal price and the equilibrium for different levels of information available to customers. Methodology/results: We represent the service system as a stochastic clearing process, heterogeneity in delay cost as a random variable, and heterogeneity in rewards as a positive affine transformation of delay cost. For each information level, we identify the equilibrium behavior of customers and solve the revenue-maximization problem based on this equilibrium. The equilibrium turns out to be unique in each case, and it is of a threshold form in the sense that for each value of the information, it is best to join either for all types of customers, only for those who are sufficiently price sensitive, only for those who are sufficiently delay sensitive, or for none. The optimal fee is also unique in nontrivial cases. This enables us to perform comparisons across different information structures. Managerial implications: The effect of heterogeneity depends highly on model parameters as well as the available information. For a fixed fee, an increase in heterogeneity has a positive overall impact on the customer population, whereas the effect on the revenue can be positive (slow service at a high fee) or negative (fast service at a low fee). Unlike with fixed fee, for the optimal fee, an increase in heterogeneity can have a negative overall effect on customers. Ignoring heterogeneity can lead to a substantial opportunity loss for the system. Funding: A. Manou was supported by AXA Research Fund. P. G.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : A canonical model in service management assumes that consumers base the purchase of a service on its full price, that is, a linear combination of the monetary price and the expected time commitment. Although analytically convenient, when this assumption holds is an unexplored question. Methodology/results : We present a model of consumers allocating their time and money between working, overhead activities that do not provide utility, one continuous leisure activity, and one discrete service. Both continuous leisure activity and discrete service increase utility. Consumers can allocate any nonnegative amount of time or money to the leisure activity. Consumption of the discrete service requires a specific amount of time and money. We examine when the decision to purchase the discrete service depends only on its full price. We show that the full-price assumption does hold in specific cases. To be precise, it depends on how consumers are paid. If consumers completely control the amount of time that they work and earn a constant wage, they base their purchase decision on the full price. If, however, they must work a fixed shift length, then the assumption fails, and the full price is not sufficient to determine the consumer’s action. This leads to systematic differences in sellers’ strategies when they serve consumers with different compensation structures. If the consumers must work longer than would be optimal if they controlled their schedule and earned the same hourly wage, that is, the consumers are overemployed shift workers, then a seller restricts sales (relative to selling to consumers who control their work hours), and the system is less congested. The reverse holds if the consumers would prefer to work longer at the offered wage; that is, the consumers are underemployed shift workers. Managerial implications : We show that sellers who fail to take prevailing compensation structures of the community they serve into consideration experience significant revenue loss. In some cases, we see losses in consumer surplus and social welfare as well. Supplemental Material: The e-companion is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2022.0357 .},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Revenue management in railways distinguishes itself from that in traditional sectors, such as airline, hotel, and fashion retail, in several important ways. (i) Capacity is substantially more flexible in the sense that changes to the capacity of a train can often be made throughout the sales horizon. Consequently, the joint optimization of prices and capacity assumes genuine importance. (ii) Capacity can only be added in discrete “chunks” (i.e., coaches). (iii) Passengers with unreserved tickets can travel in any of the multiple trains available during the day. Further, passengers in unreserved coaches are allowed to travel by standing, thus giving rise to the need to manage congestion. Motivated by our work with a major railway company in Japan, we analyze the problem of jointly optimizing pricing and capacity; this problem is more-general version of the canonical multiproduct dynamic-pricing problem. Methodology/results : Our analysis yields four asymptotically optimal policies. From the viewpoint of the pricing decisions, our policies can be classified into two types—static and dynamic. With respect to the timing of the capacity decisions, our policies are again of two types—fixed capacity and flexible capacity. We establish the convergence rates of these policies; when demand and supply are scaled by a factor κ ∈ N , the optimality gaps of the static policies scale proportional to κ , and those of the dynamic policies scale proportional to log κ . We illustrate the attractive performance of our policies on a test suite of instances based on real-world operations of the high-speed “Shinkansen” trains in Japan and develop associated insights. Managerial implications : Our work provides railway administrators with simple and effective policies for pricing, capacity, and congestion management. Our policies cater to different contingencies that decision makers may face in practice: the need for static or dynamic prices and for fixed or flexible capacity.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Restaurant review platforms, such as Yelp and TripAdvisor, routinely receive large numbers of photos in their review submissions. These photos provide significant value for users who seek to compare restaurants. In this context, the choice of cover images (i.e., representative photos of the restaurants) can greatly influence the level of user engagement on the platform. Unfortunately, selecting these images can be time consuming and often requires human intervention. At the same time, it is challenging to develop a systematic approach to assess the effectiveness of the selected images. Methodology/results : In this paper, we collaborate with a large review platform in Asia to investigate this problem. We discuss two image selection approaches, namely crowd-based and artificial intelligence (AI)-based systems. The AI-based system we use learns complex latent image features, which are further enhanced by transfer learning to overcome the scarcity of labeled data. We collaborate with the platform to deploy our AI-based system through a randomized field experiment to carefully compare both systems. We find that the AI-based system outperforms the crowd-based counterpart and boosts user engagement by 12.43%–16.05% on average. We then conduct empirical analyses on observational data to identify the underlying mechanisms that drive the superior performance of the AI-based system. Managerial implications : Finally, we infer from our findings that the AI-based system outperforms the crowd-based system for restaurants with (i) a longer tenure on the platform, (ii) a limited number of user-generated photos, (iii) a lower star rating, and (iv) lower user engagement during the crowd-based system.

@article{ ,
  abstract     = {Problem definition : Last-mile delivery is a critical component of logistics networks, accounting for approximately 30%–35% of costs. As delivery volumes have increased, truck route times have become unsustainably long. To address this issue, many logistics companies, including FedEx and UPS, have resorted to using a “driver aide” to assist with deliveries. The aide can assist the driver in two ways. As a “jumper,” the aide works with the driver in preparing and delivering packages, thus reducing the service time at a given stop. As a “helper,” the aide can independently work at a location delivering packages, and the driver can leave to deliver packages at other locations and then return. Given a set of delivery locations, travel times, service times, jumper’s savings, and helper’s service times, the goal is to determine both the delivery route and the most effective way to use the aide (e.g., sometimes as a jumper and sometimes as a helper) to minimize the total routing time. Methodology/results : We model this problem as an integer program with an exponential number of variables and an exponential number of constraints and propose a branch-cut-and-price approach for solving it. Our computational experiments are based on simulated instances built on real-world data provided by an industrial partner and a data set released by Amazon. The instances based on the Amazon data set show that this novel operation can lead to, on average, a 35.8% reduction in routing time and 22.0% in cost savings. More importantly, our results characterize the conditions under which this novel operation mode can lead to significant savings in terms of both the routing time and cost. Managerial implications : Our computational results show that the driver aide with both jumper and helper modes is most effective when there are denser service regions and when the truck’s speed is higher (≥10 miles per hour). Coupled with an economic analysis, we come up with rules of thumb (that have close to 100% accuracy) to predict whether to use the aide and in which mode. Empirically, we find that the service delivery routes with greater than 50% of the time devoted to delivery (as opposed to driving) are the ones that provide the greatest benefit. These routes are characterized by a high density of delivery locations. Supplemental Material: The e-companion is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2022.0211 .},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We consider network revenue management problems with flexible products. We have a network of resources with limited capacities. To each customer arriving into the system, we offer an assortment of products. The customer chooses a product within the offered assortment or decides to leave without a purchase. The products are flexible in the sense that there are multiple possible combinations of resources that we can use to serve a customer with a purchase for a particular product. We refer to each such combination of resources as a route. The service provider chooses the route to serve a customer with a purchase for a particular product. Such flexible products occur, for example, when customers book at-home cleaning services but leave the timing of service to the company that provides the service. Our goal is to find a policy to decide which assortment of products to offer to each customer to maximize the total expected revenue, making sure that there are always feasible route assignments for the customers with purchased products. Methodology/results : We start by considering the case in which we make the route assignments at the end of the selling horizon. The dynamic programming formulation of the problem is significantly different from its analogue without flexible products as the state variable keeps track of the number of purchases for each product rather than the remaining capacity of each resource. Letting L be the maximum number of resources in a route, we give a policy that obtains at least 1 / ( 1 + L ) fraction of the optimal total expected revenue. We extend our policy to the case in which we make the route assignments periodically over the selling horizon.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Problem definition : Online retailers have to provide customers with an estimate of how fast an order can be delivered before they decide to make the purchase. Retailers can strategically adjust this delivery speed promise online without changing offline infrastructure, and doing so may fundamentally impact business outcomes. It can influence consumers’ purchasing decisions and postpurchase experiences, often in the opposite direction. On one hand, an aggressive (i.e., faster) delivery estimate could ensure that more customers meet their deadlines and thus, may increase their purchases ex ante. On the other hand, an aggressive estimate tends to overpromise, potentially leading to a longer than expected wait time, which can lower customer satisfaction and increase product returns ex post. In this research, we estimate the causal effect of retailers’ delivery speed promise on customer behaviors and business performance. Methodology/results : Collaborating with Collage.com , an online retailer that sells customized photo products across the United States, we exogenously varied the disclosed delivery speed estimates online while keeping the physical delivery speed unchanged. Using the difference-in-differences identification strategy, we find that a faster promise increases sales and profits, but it also increases product returns and reduces customer retention. In addition, we propose a data-driven model that uses the estimated parameters to optimize delivery promises to maximize customer lifetime value. Managerial implications : Our findings provide managerial insights and a data-driven policy that retailers can leverage to optimize and customize their delivery promises. Funding: T.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Assortment selection is one of the most important decisions faced by retailers. Most existing papers in the literature assume that customers select at most one item out of the offered assortment. Although this is valid in some cases, it contradicts practical observations in many shopping experiences, both in online and brick-and-mortar retail, where customers may buy a basket of products instead of a single item. In this paper, we incorporate customers’ multi-item purchase behavior into the assortment optimization problem. We consider both the uncapacitated and capacitated assortment problems under the so-called Multivariate MNL (MVMNL) model, which is one of the most popular multivariate choice models used in the marketing and empirical literature. Methodology/results : We first show that the traditional revenue-ordered assortment may not be optimal. Nonetheless, we show that under some mild conditions, a certain variant of this property holds (in the uncapacitated assortment problem) under the MVMNL model; that is, the optimal assortment consists of revenue-ordered local assortments in each product category. Finding the optimal assortment even when there is no interaction among product categories is still computationally expensive because the revenue thresholds for different categories cannot be computed separately. To tackle the computational complexity, we develop FPTAS for several variants of (capacitated and uncapacitated) assortment problems under MVMNL. Managerial implications : Our analysis reveals that disregarding customers’ multi-item purchase behavior in assortment decisions can indeed have a significant negative impact on profitability, demonstrating its practical importance in retail. We numerically show that our proposed algorithm can improve a retailer’s expected total revenues (compared with a benchmark policy that does not properly take into account the impact of customers’ multi-item choice behavior in assortment decision) by up to 14%.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : In this paper, we study a predisaster relief network design problem with uncertain demands. The aim is to determine the prepositioning and reallocation of relief supplies. Motivated by the call of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) to leave no one behind, we consider three important practical aspects of humanitarian operations: shortages, equity, and uncertainty. Methodology/results : We first employ a form of robust satisficing measure, which we call the shortage severity measure , to evaluate the severity of the shortage caused by uncertain demand in a context with limited distribution information. Because shortages often raise concerns about equity, we then formulate a mixed-integer lexicographic optimization problem with nonconvex objectives and design a new branch-and-bound algorithm to identify the exact solution. We also propose two approaches for identifying optimal postdisaster adaptable resource reallocation: an exact approach and a conservative approximation that is more computationally efficient. Our case study considers the 2010 Yushu earthquake, which occurred in northwestern China, and demonstrates the value of our methodology in mitigating geographical inequities and reducing shortages. Managerial implications : In our case study, we show that (i) incorporating equity in both predisaster deployment and postdisaster reallocation can produce substantially more equitable shortage prevention strategies while sacrificing only a reasonable amount of total shortage; (ii) increasing donations/budgets may not necessarily alleviate the shortage suffered by the most vulnerable individuals if equity is not fully considered; and (iii) exploiting disaster magnitude information when quantifying uncertainty can help alleviate geographical inequities caused by uncertain relief demands.

  abstract     = {Research problem : High turnover rates in long-term nursing facilities exacerbate the existing shortage of caregivers, a trend that will only worsen as the population of the United States ages. Part-time certified nursing assistants (CNAs) provide a significant amount of patient care in these facilities. CNAs also have high annual rates of turnover, which can harm health outcomes and increase the cost of care. In this study, we empirically analyze the effect of scheduling decisions on part-time CNA turnover. We explore three research questions that examine both how much and with whom a CNA is scheduled to work. We seek to empirically answer how (1) hours worked and (2) coworker variability influence turnover for part-time CNAs and if (3) coworker variability moderates the relationship between hours worked and CNA turnover. Methodology/results : Using novel data from one of the nation’s largest nursing home organizations, which includes data for 6,221 part-time CNAs at 157 facilities in the United States over a 26-month period, we identify two scheduling levers managers may be able to use to influence turnover. As hours worked increase, turnover first decreases and then increases, demonstrating a nonlinear U-shaped relationship between hours worked and turnover. We also find that high coworker variability increases turnover while also moderating the effects of hours worked on turnover. In post hoc analyses, we demonstrate that high CNA turnover has negative impacts on patient health. Managerial implications : These findings suggest that managers may be able to leverage part-time CNA scheduling to reduce turnover, improving both the quality and cost of care. Specifically, we demonstrate that managers can reduce CNA turnover by increasing hours worked, scheduling coworkers together consistently and doing both simultaneously.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Personalized medicine (PM) seeks the best treatment for each patient among a set of available treatment methods. Because a specific treatment does not work well on all patients, traditionally, the best treatment was selected based on the doctor’s personal experience and expertise, which is subject to human errors. In the meantime, stochastic models have been well developed in the literature for a lot of major diseases. This gives rise to a simulation-based solution for PM, which uses the simulation tool to evaluate the performance for pairs of treatment and patient biometric characteristics and, based on that, selects the best treatment for each patient characteristic. Methodology/results : In this research, we extend the ranking and selection (R&amp;S) model in simulation-based decision making to solving PM. The biometric characteristics of a patient are treated as a context for R&amp;S, and we call it contextual ranking and selection (CR&amp;S). We consider two formulations of CR&amp;S with small and large context spaces, respectively, and develop new techniques for solving them and identifying the rate-optimal budget allocation rules. Based on them, two selection algorithms are proposed, which can be shown to be numerically superior via a set of tests on abstract and real-world examples. Managerial implications : This research provides a systematic way of conducting simulation-based decision-making for PM. To improve the overall decision quality for the possible contexts, more simulation efforts should be devoted to contexts in which it is difficult to distinguish between the best treatment and non-best treatments, and our results quantify the optimal trade-off of the simulation efforts between the pairs of contexts and treatments.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Clients and service providers alike often consider one-on-one service delivery to be ideal, assuming, perhaps unquestioningly, that devoting individualized attention best improves client outcomes. In contrast, in shared service delivery, clients are served in batches and the dynamics of group interaction could lead to increased client engagement, which could improve outcomes. However, the loss of privacy and personal connection might undermine engagement. The engagement dynamics in one-on-one and shared delivery models have not been rigorously studied. To the extent that shared delivery may result in comparable or better engagement than one-on-one delivery, service providers in a broad array of contexts may be able to create more value for clients by delivering service in batches. Methodology/results : We conducted a randomized controlled trial with 1,000 patients who were undergoing glaucoma treatment over a three-year period at a large eye hospital. Using verbatim and behavioral transcripts from more than 20,000 minutes of video recorded during our trial, we examine how shared medical appointments (SMAs), in which patients are served in batches, impact engagement. On average, a patient who experienced SMAs asked 33.3% more questions per minute and made 8.6% more nonquestion comments per minute. Because there were multiple patients in an SMA, this increase in engagement at the individual patient level resulted in patients hearing far more comments in the group setting. Patients in SMAs also exhibited higher levels of nonverbal engagement across a wide array of measures (attentiveness, positivity, head wobbling, or “thalai aattam” in Tamil: a South Indian gesture to signal agreement or understanding, eye contact, and end-of-appointment happiness), relative to patients who attended one-on-one appointments. Managerial implications : These results shed light on the potential for shared service delivery models to increase client engagement and thus enhance service performance.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Increasing costs of healthcare highlight the importance of effective disease prevention. However, decision models for allocating preventive care are lacking. Methodology/results : In this paper, we develop a data-driven decision model for determining a cost-effective allocation of preventive treatments to patients at risk. Specifically, we combine counterfactual inference, machine learning, and optimization techniques to build a scalable decision model that can exploit high-dimensional medical data, such as the data found in modern electronic health records. Our decision model is evaluated based on electronic health records from 89,191 prediabetic patients. We compare the allocation of preventive treatments ( metformin ) prescribed by our data-driven decision model with that of current practice. We find that if our approach is applied to the U.S. population, it can yield annual savings of $1.1 billion. Finally, we analyze the cost-effectiveness under varying budget levels. Managerial implications : Our work supports decision making in health management, with the goal of achieving effective disease prevention at lower costs. Importantly, our decision model is generic and can thus be used for effective allocation of preventive care for other preventable diseases. Funding: M.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Do physicians exhibit predictable behavioral bias when making admission control decisions under patient diagnosis uncertainty with stochastic arrivals and lengths of stay? How can we structure feedback to help improve their decision making? Methodology/results : We use a behavioral model to theorize how a diagnosis anchoring and insufficient adjustment heuristic may lead to an over-rationing bias, and we hypothesize when this bias is greatest. We then propose that feedback for rejected patients—above and beyond feedback for admitted patients—is critical for mitigating this bias. This is because feedback for only admitted patients may suffer from a type of path dependency that prevents decision makers from receiving the most helpful disconfirming feedback. We provide evidence supporting these hypotheses using preregistered experiments in which medical students, Amazon Mechanical Turk workers, or Prolific workers manage admissions for simulated hospital units. Managerial implications : Our results (1) illuminate an important anchoring bias in admission control under diagnosis uncertainty, (2) identify rejected-patient feedback as a critical component for mitigating this bias, and (3) provide insight into the circumstances under which these phenomena are likely to be most significant.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Infectious disease screening can be expensive and capacity constrained. We develop cost- and capacity-efficient testing designs for multidisease screening, considering (1) multiplexing (disease bundling), where one assay detects multiple diseases using the same specimen (e.g., nasal swabs, blood), and (2) pooling (specimen bundling), where one assay is used on specimens from multiple subjects bundled in a testing pool. A testing design specifies an assay portfolio (mix of single-disease/multiplex assays) and a testing method (pooling/individual testing per assay). Methodology/results : We develop novel models for the nonlinear, combinatorial multidisease testing design problem: a deterministic model and a distribution-free, robust variation, which both generate Pareto frontiers for cost- and capacity-efficient designs. We characterize structural properties of optimal designs, formulate the deterministic counterpart of the robust model, and conduct a case study of respiratory diseases (including coronavirus disease 2019) with overlapping clinical presentation. Managerial implications : Key drivers of optimal designs include the assay cost function, the tester’s preference toward cost versus capacity efficiency, prevalence/coinfection rates, and for the robust model, prevalence uncertainty. When an optimal design uses multiple assays, it does so in conjunction with pooling, and it uses individual testing for at most one assay. Although prevalence uncertainty can be a design hurdle, especially for emerging or seasonal diseases, the integration of multiplexing and pooling, and the ordered partition property of optimal designs (under certain coinfection structures) serve to make the design more structurally robust to uncertainty. The robust model further increases robustness, and it is also practical as it needs only an uncertainty set around each disease prevalence. Our Pareto designs demonstrate the cost versus capacity trade-off and show that multiplexing-only or pooling-only designs need not be on the Pareto frontier. Our case study illustrates the benefits of optimally integrated designs over current practices and indicates a low price of robustness.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Effective hypertension management is critical to reducing the consequences of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, a leading cause of death in the United States. Clinical guidelines for hypertension can be enhanced using decision-analytic approaches capable of capturing complexities in treatment planning. However, model-generated recommendations may be uninterpretable/unintuitive, limiting their clinical acceptability. We address this challenge by investigating interpretable treatment plans. Methodology/results : We formulate interpretable treatment plans as Markov decision processes (MDPs) and analyze the problems of optimizing monotone policies, which prohibit decreasing treatment intensity for sicker patients, and class-ordered monotone policies , which generalize monotone policies. We establish that both policies depend on initial state distributions and that optimal monotone policies can be generated tractably for many treatment planning problems. Next, we propose exact formulations for optimizing interpretable policies broadly. Then, we analyze the price of interpretability , proving that the class-ordered monotone policy’s price of interpretability does not exceed the monotone policy’s price of interpretability. Finally, we formulate and evaluate MDPs for hypertension treatment planning using a large nationally representative data set of the U.S. population. We compare the structure and performance of optimal monotone policies and class-ordered monotone policies with optimal MDP-based policies and current clinical guidelines. At the patient level, optimal MDP-based policies may be unintuitive, recommending more aggressive treatment for healthier patients than sicker patients. Conversely, monotone policies and class-ordered monotone policies never deescalate treatment, reflecting clinical intuition. Across 66.5 million patients, optimized monotone policies and class-ordered monotone policies outperform clinical guidelines, saving over 3,246 quality-adjusted life years per 100,000 patients, with both policies paying a low price of interpretability. Sensitivity analysis illustrates that monotone policies and class-ordered monotone policies are robust to various definitions of “interpretability.” Managerial implications : Interpretable policies can be tractably optimized, drastically outperform existing guidelines, and perform near optimally—potentially increasing the acceptability of decision-analytic approaches in practice.

  abstract     = {Problem definition: We examine the environmental implications of shifting from in-person to virtual conference formats and identify the effects of such a shift on the value conferences provide to our societies. We extend work from other fields to present a more comprehensive comparison of the environmental impact and perceived value of different conference formats for the operations management/research communities. Methodology/results: We leverage a series of COVID-19–induced natural experiments to precisely evaluate the environmental footprint and societal value difference between in-person and virtual formats via life cycle assessment and survey techniques, respectively. Specifically, we focus on Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences, Production and Operations Management Society, and European Operations Management Association conferences that were conducted in both formats between 2019 and 2021. The environmental assessment reveals a huge impact reduction: for climate change, on average, from 941.9 kg CO 2eq per person for in-person formats to 1.0 for virtual. The value assessment emphasizes, instead, a detrimental utility loss with the overall perceived value derived from attendance moving—on a scale from 0 to 10—on average, from 7.9 to 4.0. When investigating the drivers of conference valuation, virtual formats show some merits, such as lower perceived costs and the added value of flexibility. The preference for in-person formats is unambiguous though, justified by the large performance gap related to socialization and networking, the two most important value drivers identified by our analysis. Managerial implications: These results highlight an inherent trade-off between virtual and in-person conferences. To overcome it, we discuss four strategies as to how our societies can reduce their environmental footprints and remain true to their essential purpose: (1) reduce in-person impact, (2) improve virtual design, (3) hybrid and decentralized formats, and (4) revise conferencing model and societies’ role.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : A significant percentage of online consumers place consecutive orders within a short duration. To reduce the total order arrangement cost, an online retailer may consolidate consecutive orders from the same consumer. We investigate how long the retailer should hold the consumer’s orders before sending them to a third-party logistics provider (3PL) for processing. In this order-holding problem, we optimize the holding time to balance the total order arrangement cost and the potential delay in delivery. Methodology/results : We model the order-holding problem as a Markov decision process. We show that the optimal order-holding decisions follow a threshold-type policy that is straightforward to implement: Hold any pending orders if the holding time is within a threshold or send them to the 3PL otherwise. Whenever the consumer places a new order, the holding time is reset, and the threshold is updated based on a cumulative set of the past consecutive orders in the consumer’s shopping journey. Using a consumer’s sequential decision model, we personalize the threshold by finding its closed-form expression in the consumer’s order features. We determine the model’s coefficients and evaluate the threshold-type policy using the data of the 2020 MSOM Data Driven Research Challenge. Extensive numerical experiments suggest that the personalized threshold-type policy outperforms two commonly used benchmarks by having fewer order arrangements or shorter holding times. Furthermore, personalizing the order-holding decisions is significantly more valuable for “enterprise” customers. Managerial implications : Our research suggests a higher threshold for consumers who are more likely to place consecutive orders within a short duration. The consumers’ demographic information has a significant effect on the threshold. Specifically, the threshold is higher for “plus” consumers, female consumers, and consumers in the age group of 16–25 years. The threshold for tier 1 cities is lower than that for tier 2 to tier 4 cities but higher than that for tier 5 cities.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We consider intertemporal pricing in the presence of reference effects and consumer heterogeneity. Our research question encompasses how to estimate heterogeneous consumer reference effects from data and how to efficiently compute the optimal pricing policy. Academic/practical relevance : Understanding reference effects is essential for designing pricing policies in modern retailing. Our work contributes to this area by incorporating consumer heterogeneity under arbitrary distributions. Methodology : We propose a mixed logit demand model that allows arbitrary joint distributions of valuations, responsiveness to prices, and responsiveness to reference prices among consumers. We use a nonparametric estimation method to learn consumer heterogeneity from transaction data. Further, we formulate the pricing optimization as an infinite horizon dynamic programming problem and solve it by applying a modified policy iteration algorithm. Results : Moreover, we investigate the structure of optimal pricing policies and prove the suboptimality of constant pricing policies even when all consumers are loss-averse according to the classical definition. Our numerical studies show that our estimation and optimization framework improves the expected revenue of retailers via accounting for heterogeneity. We validate our model using real data from JD.com, a large E-commerce retailer, and find empirical evidence of consumer heterogeneity. Managerial implications : In practice, ignoring consumer heterogeneity may lead to a significant loss of revenue. Furthermore, heterogeneous reference effect offers a strong motive for promotions and price fluctuations.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Mining for heterogeneous responses to an intervention is a crucial step for data-driven operations, for instance, to personalize treatment or pricing. We investigate how to estimate price sensitivity from transaction-level data. In causal inference terms, we estimate heterogeneous treatment effects when (a) the response to treatment (here, whether a customer buys a product) is binary, and (b) treatment assignments are partially observed (here, full information is only available for purchased items). Methodology/Results : We propose a recursive partitioning procedure to estimate heterogeneous odds ratio, a widely used measure of treatment effect in medicine and social sciences. We integrate an adversarial imputation step to allow for robust estimation even in presence of partially observed treatment assignments. We validate our methodology on synthetic data and apply it to three case studies from political science, medicine, and revenue management. Managerial implications : Our robust heterogeneous odds ratio estimation method is a simple and intuitive tool to quantify heterogeneity in patients or customers and personalize interventions, while lifting a central limitation in many revenue management data.
