  abstract     = {We theorize why and how strategists develop different types of theories when confronted with different types of problems by combining knowledge and imagination in different ways. We propose that strategists’ epistemic stances affect how they combine knowledge and imagination and whether they develop either analytic theories, or constructive theories of two types: reconfigurative and projective. We theorize how imagination complements knowledge in theory development to generate distinctive strategies and strategic advantages. We argue that analytic theories enable conjectural anticipation, which contributes to early timing of strategic actions; that reconfigurative theories posit novel value dimensions and enable industry shaping; and that projective theories articulate novel possibilities to shape desired and desirable futures. Our ideas advance research on how imagination is leveraged in theory development, future-oriented strategizing, and shaping strategies.},

In support of this view, recent empirical work has demonstrated both (a) the value of theories as well as (b) the importance of experimentation for testing and refining theories. Yet, the process by which entrepreneurs initially form these theories remains largely unobserved. To address this gap, we conduct a longitudinal study of nine consumer platform ventures over five years. Our primary contribution is to illuminate how entrepreneurs move from the spark of an initial idea to an actionable theory. This process begins with a thesis, which is an initial, poorly formed idea that guides subsequent learning and theorizing. To elaborate this thesis, entrepreneurs then knit together multiple distinct mental theorizing practices, as well as different approaches to generating new data. Extending prior work, we articulate the distinct roles these practices play in terms of adding novelty, identifying new subproblems, and explicating beliefs. We also add insight into the role of data generation in spurring further theorizing. Overall, we contribute empirical evidence and a rich processual understanding of how entrepreneurs articulate complex causal theories.

  abstract     = {We examine how formalization in cognitive processes (theorization) and evidence evaluation (experimentation) influence the type (frequency and radicalness) and nature (impetus, clarity, and coherence) of entrepreneurial pivots. We use a mixed-method research design to analyze rich data from over 1,600 interviews with 261 entrepreneurs within a randomized control trial in London. A quantitative analysis that complements human-coded and machine learning-coded measures reveals that conditional on pivoting, theorization and experimentation are complementary in their association with making single radical pivots. The extensive qualitative-case comparison further elucidates interactions between theorization and experimentation that generate differences in the nature of pivots that range from purposeful (clear and coherent rationale deriving from articulated theory and experimentation), postulatory (informed by articulated theory but not incorporating nuances or surprises generated from experimentation), and remedial (stemming from adjustments to preformed theories that drew on prior experiences) to reactive (driven by environmental stimuli absent a clear theory of value). These insights contribute to the theory-driven strategic decision-making literature and offer practical insights for entrepreneurs, incubators, and policymakers on the benefits of a scientific approach to entrepreneurship.

  abstract     = {An assumption of factor market efficiency is often used to grant primacy to firms’ existing unique and valuable resources as the source of economic rents. But this assumption is difficult to reconcile with observed market outcomes. For instance, five of the six companies with the highest global market capitalization in 2022 were upstarts in their industries with few resources at their origins. More surprising, three of these entrants were assisted by incumbents with vastly superior resources in assembling the resources they required. In this paper we explore how entrants compete with theories to secure resources from incumbents and capture rents. We introduce a modeling approach in which theories with causal logic generate awareness of valuable potential future states and shape the beliefs about payoffs and probabilities associated with these states. We combine work in the theory-based view and value capture theory to distinguish among three distinct sources of economic rents that are potentially available to entrants: awareness rents, confidence rents, and resource rents. We explore the circumstances under which these three types of rents are available. By exploring the role of theories and awareness in value creation and capture, our paper seeks to deepen our understanding of how entrants both attract resources and secure rents. Funding: T.

The theory-based view of strategy posits that decision makers hold key conjectures about their path to success and use theory to understand and test beliefs underlying those conjectures. This causal framework also has implications for entrepreneurial search: the process by which entrepreneurs uncover strategies to implement their ideas. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian model where entrepreneurs update their beliefs as they conduct entrepreneurial search. We find several optimal behaviors for Theory-based entrepreneurs such as reverting to a previous strategy after finding a relatively poor strategy and continuing to search after finding a relatively good strategy, which are missing when entrepreneurs lack such a theory-based approach. As our theoretical predictions align with examples of successful entrepreneurs, our findings both provide a method to empirically identify Theory-based entrepreneurs and demonstrate the usefulness of applying the theory-based view to entrepreneurial behavior more generally.},

It provides microfoundations of the theory-based view of the firm by showing that the strategic problem starts with the selection of theories rather than choosing actions and that theories are selected through experiments. The value of experimenting with theories increases with the number of theories and with their uncertainty. Moreover, uncertainty makes theories superadditive—that is, experimenting with a more uncertain theory increases the benefits of experimenting with other more uncertain theories. The paper also shows that decision makers should experiment with more “surprising” theories because in this case experiments are more informative and enable more learning.

Whether a theory proves useful to search, however, depends not just on its predictive precision. This essay argues that the internal structures of theories—their size, complexity, the extent of their elaboration, and the confidence that their users have in the assumptions—also influences how people search for solutions and the efficiency of their search processes. It offers several conjectures about how theory and theory structure influence search and about which types of theories prove most useful to success.},

We disagree. We argue that AI’s data-based prediction is different from human theory-based causal logic and reasoning. We highlight problems with the decades-old analogy between computers and minds as input–output devices, using large language models as an example. Human cognition is better conceptualized as a form of theory-based causal reasoning rather than AI’s emphasis on information processing and data-based prediction. AI uses a probability-based approach to knowledge and is largely backward looking and imitative, whereas human cognition is forward-looking and capable of generating genuine novelty. We introduce the idea of data–belief asymmetries to highlight the difference between AI and human cognition, using the example of heavier-than-air flight to illustrate our arguments. Theory-based causal reasoning provides a cognitive mechanism for humans to intervene in the world and to engage in directed experimentation to generate new data. Throughout the article, we discuss the implications of our argument for understanding the origins of novelty, new knowledge, and decision making under uncertainty.},

We illustrate how AI could augment existing SDM tools and provide empirical evidence from a leading accelerator program and a start-up competition that current large language models can generate and evaluate strategies at a level comparable to entrepreneurs and investors. We then examine implications for the key cognitive processes underlying SDM—search, representation, and aggregation. Our analysis suggests that AI has the potential to enhance the speed, quality, and scale of strategic analysis, while also enabling new approaches, like virtual strategy simulations. However, the ultimate impact on firm performance will depend on competitive dynamics as AI capabilities progress. We propose a framework connecting AI use in SDM to firm outcomes and discuss how AI may reshape sources of competitive advantage. We conclude by considering how AI could both support and challenge core tenets of the theory-based view of strategy.

Second, we consider whether a given experiment can be undertaken by a single actor or requires the joint effort and buy-in of other actors in the internal or external ecosystem of the firm, and, in turn, the extent to which persuasion becomes a critical role of theory. We show how these two properties—nonrepeatability and joint action—impact the nature of inference from strategic actions and the ability to benefit from learning. Further, these properties suggest a more deliberative calculus regarding the cost of experimentation and highlight the role of theory as a basis for both prediction and persuasion in the service of choosing how to initiate and learn from strategic acts in nonexperimental settings.},

We point to a normative agenda that emphasizes the need for decision makers—including managers, firms, entrepreneurs, and startups—to develop their own theories. Our argument is that decision makers should be like scientists and use the scientific method—theories, causal reasoning, and experimentation—to problem solve and generate new data and value. In this paper and special issue introduction, we discuss the foundations of the theory-based view (TBV), particularly as it relates to forward-looking reasoning and decision making under uncertainty. Rather than handing prescriptive theories to others, the goal of the TBV is to provide the scaffolding for economic actors themselves to develop their own, idiosyncratic theories. Theories are built on heterogeneous beliefs and causal reasoning that enable the generation of unique paths to value. We discuss the implications of this argument for key theories within strategy and economics, along with highlighting research opportunities at the nexus of the TBV and topics such as learning, entrepreneurship, finance, ownership and leadership. We also introduce the special issue papers and discuss their contributions to the TBV.

Although research has compared and contrasted the two, we study how they compete with one another. In particular, we focus on how competition from traditional platforms affects volunteers’ contributions to crowdsourced platforms. We propose a divergent effect: competition increases individual contributions from volunteers who were already active before the entry of any competitor (pre-entry contributors). However, competition also hinders recruitment and therefore leads to a decrease in total contributions from the set of volunteers who are new to the platform in a given time period (newly recruited contributors). We suggest the first effect is driven by pre-entry contributors’ ideological attachment, whereas the second is driven by lower awareness of the platform postcompetitive entry. To test our theory, we leverage and examine how the phased entry of Google Maps in different countries affects contributions to OpenStreetMap, a crowdsourced mapping platform. We find the hypothesized divergent effects and provide suggestive evidence of the underlying mechanisms. We contribute to research on crowdsourcing, volunteers’ willingness to contribute, platform competition, and on the effect of competition on organizations more broadly.

  abstract     = {Ratings of organizations and firms have become ubiquitous. These ratings, often produced by intermediaries (including private and public organizations), are designed to aid consumers and other stakeholders in their decision making while guiding rated organizations toward performance improvement or compliance. In doing so, these intermediaries introduce new information to markets. However, disparities may exist in the ability to strategically capture the value from such ratings, often due to differential access to complementary assets among stakeholders. Consequently, this differential ability can lead to outcomes contrary to the rating institutions’ intentions. Reflecting on this dynamic, we analyze how widespread access to a prevalent type of rating—school performance information, often produced to enhance transparency and equity in educational access—has affected existing economic and social disparities in America. We leverage the staged rollout of GreatSchools.org school ratings from 2006 to 2015 to answer this question. Across various outcomes and specifications, we find that the availability of school ratings has accelerated the divergence in housing values, income distributions, education levels, and racial and ethnic composition across communities. Affluent and more educated families were better positioned to strategically leverage this new information to capture educational opportunities in communities with top schools. The uneven benefits we observe highlight how ratings can unintentionally deepen existing inequalities, thereby complicating their intended impacts.

  abstract     = {Existing research shows that shareholder pressures can shorten firms’ investment horizons. Yet studies have so far been limited to the actions shareholders take directly toward a focal firm. Considering that shareholder pressures may spill over between organizations, we argue that firms shorten their investment horizons following shareholder-initiated lawsuits against their peers in an effort to boost their short-run performance and preempt being sued themselves. We further posit that the negative relationship between this form of litigation threat and a firm’s investment horizon is weakened among firms with more long-term shareholders or future-focused CEOs, both of which guard against managers becoming overly short-term oriented. An examination of 18 years of shareholder litigation data supports our theory. This study highlights shareholder litigation as a distinct form of shareholder voice and one that is sufficiently potent to create spillover effects between firms.},

These platforms can operate in environments where governance is intentionally or conventionally weak in favor of open access, frictionless transactions, or free speech. Such low- or no-governance environments leave room for illegitimate actors to penetrate platforms with illegitimate content or transactions. We propose that an external observer can employ transparency mechanisms to establish “soft” governance that allows participants in a low-governance environment to distinguish between sources of legitimate and illegitimate content. We examine how this might work in the context of disinformation Internet domains by training a machine learning classifier to discern between low-legitimacy from high-legitimacy content providers based on website registration data. The results suggest that an independent observer can employ such a classifier to provide an early, although imperfect, signal of whether a website is intended to host illegitimate content. We show that the independent observer can be effective at serving multiple platforms by providing intermediate prediction results that platforms can align with their unique governance priorities. We expand our analysis with a signaling game model to ascertain whether such a soft governance structure can be resilient to adversarial responses.

  abstract     = {This study develops a novel framework about how a firm’s financing outcome will be shaped by its communication under different types of uncertainty. Whereas prior work has largely focused on uncertainties that arise because of founders having a knowledge advantage over investors, we examine a firm’s communication in situations of more fundamental uncertainty when both founders and investors face knowledge problems. Our framework proposes that in situations where founders have a knowledge advantage over investors (i.e., when there is information asymmetry), firms that reduce uncertainty by sending signals of quality and express less uncertainty in their communications will enjoy better financing outcomes. However, we argue that in situations characterized by high unknowability, and where founders do not have a significant knowledge advantage over investors (i.e., when there is Knightian uncertainty), firms that acknowledge this unknowability by expressing more uncertainty in their communications will have more favorable financing outcomes. Studying the full population of special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) that sought to complete an initial public offering from the emergence of the sector in 2003–2019, we find support for our predictions. This study expands our understanding of the role of uncertainty in investment decisions, offers deeper insight into how language operates in financial markets, and sheds light on the increasingly popular, but understudied, SPAC vehicle.

Despite the increasing pervasiveness of BDA across industries and some preliminary evidence indicating that BDA adoption is positively related to firm productivity, previous studies have not fully investigated how BDA benefits actually materialize. To address this question, we explore the effect of BDA on the innovation process, a key determinant of firm productivity. Our findings indicate that both large and small firms can gain from BDA, yet size is a critical organizational attribute determining the most relevant performance gains captured: BDA benefits for value-added are particularly salient for large firms, whereas benefits for sales are more relevant in small firms. This suggests that the relative propensity to use BDA to decrease costs and enhance efficiency through process innovation vs. to increase sales through product innovation is increasing in firm size.

  abstract     = {Prior studies suggest that acquisitions can increase employee turnover. However, acquired workers are technically new hires, who are generally prone to turnover. Therefore, it is important to benchmark acquired workers against other new hires in the organization. One view suggests that compared with regular hires who select their employer based on a mutual vetting process, acquired workers can experience a poor fit with their new employer (e.g., culture clash), resulting in elevated rates of turnover. Meanwhile, as acquisitions represent a bundle of assets, acquired workers can possess complementarities accumulated with the target firm that reinforce worker–employer fit and thus their retention prospects. Using population-level data from the United States, I find empirical support for both perspectives. Acquired workers from startups exhibit significantly higher turnover rates than regular hires. Moreover, in conditions under which acquired workers’ complementarities are more likely to be preserved—specifically, individuals with longer prior tenure, teams in which the founders remain intact, and target organizations that are structurally separated rather than integrated into the acquirer—I find reduced turnover differences for acquired workers relative to regular hires. Together, these results elucidate whether and when firms can harness human capital through startup acquisitions (“acqui-hiring”).

Such interactions require attention to both the mental representations held by the management of the focal firm as well as the beliefs of that management about the representations held by rival management. When jointly determined outcomes are the primary input to the learning process, understanding rival beliefs—what we call strategic empathy—becomes a crucial factor driving performance. To illustrate these processes, we focus on mental representations that a manager has regarding market demand. In our simulation models, learning occurs through market observations, which recalibrate a manager’s representation about demand. But the flexibility allowed by this recalibration is also a way through which managers rationalize incorrect representations. We find these processes sometimes lead to distortions of initially correct representations and may result in superior relative performance by the firm whose manager holds less correct representations. Finally, we explore how superior knowledge of a rival’s demand representations can improve own performance through market actions that intentionally shape how a rival learns.

After replicating the industry experience–venture survival relationship, we identify several empirical puzzles if the underlying causal mechanism is leveraging industry-specific knowledge. In light of these puzzles, analysis of their robustness, and initial exploratory empirical investigations, we propose that other human capital characteristics that correlate with industry experience (i.e., overall experience and wages) are better explanatory factors. The analysis illustrates how the data-grounded steps of an inferred pattern analysis can guide future theoretical development and empirical investigations to identify the causal mechanism underlying a well-established empirical relationship in the literature.

This limits the possibility of replication exercises, which are a key step to refining and reinforcing the theories that are most supported in practice.

  abstract     = {Several literatures in strategy propose models of the displacement of incumbent firms by newer firms that adopt newer technologies. Although that pattern likely plays out often, it is also often the case that incumbents adopt new technologies less intensively than entrants and yet, are not displaced; the new and old firms coexist. We propose one explanation built on the fundamental notion in strategy of the importance of fit between activity system components. We combine three existing models from strategy in a way that allows us to generate novel predictions. When corroborated, these predictions suggest that the patterns we observe are likely the result of issues of multidimensional fit and cannot be explained by a simpler model. One model predicts that market segment choice is a function of the order of entry. A second suggests that organizational form must fit with market segment choice, and a third suggests that information technology adoption returns depend on organizational form. Jointly, these models produce a chain of logic explaining why early entrants might be less likely to adopt information technology. The combined model also yields a novel prediction about when we expect this pattern to emerge. Specifically, in settings without a sufficiently large scope for product customization or the possibility of variation in organizational form, we predict that the relationship between entry order and technology adoption is attenuated. We find patterns consistent with our predictions using rich employer-employee linked administrative data from Portugal.

The concept of a code, and the distinction between using a code versus expectations about the code others use, can be applied to study many different elements of culture both in terms of theorizing about them with precision and for empirical applications. Furthermore, we argue that a code-based perspective on culture is particularly useful from the normative, design-oriented stance that is characteristic of strategy. Using an example of creating stakeholder alignment around the problem of sustainability, a first-order challenge for business and society today, we show that the perspectives of culture as shared values and culture as a toolkit point to different interventions that are each likely to work under different conditions.

Data commons are and can be a significant resource for both innovating and innovation-adopting firms and individuals. First, the availability of free data and information from such commons reduces the innovation-specific private or open investment required to access the data and make the next innovative advance. Second, the fact that the data are freely accessible lowers transactions costs substantially. In this paper, we draw on the theory and empirical evidence regarding innovation commons in general and data commons in particular. Based on these foundations, we consider strategic decisions in the private and public domain: how can individuals, firms and societies profit from data commons? We first discuss the varying nature of and contents of data commons, their functioning, and the value they provide to private innovators and to social welfare. We next explore the several types of data commons extant today, and their mechanisms of action. We find that those who develop innovation-related information at private cost already have, surprisingly often, an economic incentive to freely reveal their information to a data commons. However, we also find and discuss important exceptions. We conclude with suggestions regarding needed innovation research, data commons “engineering”, and innovation policymaking that could together increase private and social welfare via enhancement of data commons.
