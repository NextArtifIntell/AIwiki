  abstract     = {Long-term decisions, such as decisions about carbon abatement, are usually based on the implausible assumption of constant social preference. This paper focuses on a specific case of market and nonmarket goods, and it investigates the optimal climate policy when social preference for them is also changed by climate policy in a seminal climate-economy model: the Dynamic Integrated Model of Climate and the Economy (DICE) model with a single objective to maximize market goods consumption. We amend DICE to study an optimization problem that trades off the values of market and nonmarket goods, considering endogenous preferences. The relative price of non-market goods grows over time because of increases in both relative scarcity and the appreciation that represents the preference of it. As nonmarket goods are increasingly valuable relative to market ones, climate damages on nonmarket goods are increasingly expensive. The social cost of carbon, which aggregated climate impact on both goods, is consequently higher. Because abatement decision affects the valuation of nonmarket goods in the utility function, unlike previous climate-economy models, we solve the model iteratively by taking the obtained abatement rates from the last run as inputs in the current run. The results in baseline calibration advocate a more stringent climate policy, where endogenous social preference to climate policy raises the social cost of carbon further by roughly 12%–18% this century. Moreover, neglecting changing social preference leads to an underestimate of nonmarket goods damages by 15%. Climate policy is self-reinforced if it favors the more expensive consumption good. The proposed method can be applied to other long-term problems with endogenous preferences. Funding: H.

  abstract     = {Sophisticated cyberattackers (commonly known as advanced persistent threats (APTs)) pose enormous risks to organizations such as financial institutions, industrial and commercial firms, government institutions, and power grids. This study presents a method and an index to measure the vulnerability of organizations to APT risk and shows why a one-size-fits-all solution to mitigate APT risk does not exist. Our vulnerability index is based on a model that describes the optimal behavior of a cyberattacker (APT) with research and development capabilities aspiring to attack a network that manages the organization and a network operator that deploys blocking and detection measures to protect its organization from the attack. We demonstrate how our vulnerability index, which accounts for the network’s structure and the APTs’ resources and strategy, can be used in realistic risk assessments and optimal resource allocation procedures and serve as a benchmark for organizations’ preparedness against APTs’ cyberattacks. We also propose that regulatory agencies of financial (and other) institutions provide the parameters that define an APT’s profile and request, as part of their periodic assessments of the organizations that they regulate, that our (or similar) vulnerability index will be reported to them by the regulated institutions. Finally, the viability of our index in modeling modern cybersecurity defense procedures shows that not only there is no silver bullet defense against all types of APTs, it is also imperative to account for APTs’ heterogeneity because detection and blocking measures can be complements, substitutes, or even degrade each other. For example, when the attacker’s (defender’s) budget is extremely large (small), the defender should deploy only detection measures, strongly advocating Zero Trust practices.

  abstract     = {Decision on what consumer reactions (support or boycott) to promote is important for nongovernmental organizations and policymakers looking to influence firms’ adoption of corporate social responsibility practices. We study how consumer reactions—paying more for certified products or boycotting in the event of responsibility violations—are effective in improving a firm’s uptake of responsibility practices in the sourcing domain. We first build a stylized model to study how consumer reaction affects a firm’s incentives toward responsible sourcing and find that only boycotting reactions by consumers reliably increases a firm’s sourcing from responsible suppliers. We then include behavioral aspects to our stylized model to derive a more nuanced understanding of how consumer reactions affect responsible sourcing. Through behavioral experiments, we first show that a supporting consumer reaction induces a dual-sourcing bias in firms’ sourcing decisions. We then develop a behavioral model of responsible sourcing, incorporating this dual-sourcing bias. Our analysis modifies the normative predictions of the stylized model by showing that a supporting reaction, irrespective of magnitude, always improves responsible sourcing if the boycotting reaction from the market is weak, and that promoting a boycotting reaction always improves responsible sourcing, irrespective of the product type. Our results lead us to a comprehensive and applicable insight for practice: in the supply chains of products with few brand substitutes, creating a supporting reaction in the market is the way to improve firms’ responsible sourcing, and in supply chains of products with many brand substitutes, promoting a boycotting reaction among consumers will lead to more responsible sourcing.},

  abstract     = {Problem statement : This paper addresses the challenge of effectively responding to the opioid epidemic stemming from prescription pills through a public health lens. It centers on the strategic distribution of resources across diverse interventions aimed at preventing and mitigating the consequences of opioid use disorder (OUD) and overdose occurrences. Methodology : This paper proposes a decision aid tool built on the expected utility theory that leverages a Susceptible-Infected-Removed compartmental model to simulate the dynamics of the epidemic in a population. This model then feeds into a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model to generate optimal policies upon the current state of the epidemic. The optimal policies allocate the intervention budget to primary preventive and mitigating interventions in each decision period by minimizing the cost of fatal overdoses relative to the population’s number of individuals with OUD, considering the impact magnitude of each intervention, based on the current state of the epidemic. A 10-year simulation of the epidemic’s progression is conducted to assess the dynamic efficacy of the proposed decision tool. Results : The findings reveal an average reduction of 29% in total costs compared to the scenario without interventions and a decrease of 12% in total costs on average compared to the scenario with a 50-50 allocation. The extensive sensitivity analysis of key parameters validates the decision aid tool. We observe that it is optimal to allocate a significant portion of the budget to prevention when the rate of opioid pill acquisition rises. Even with a heightened rate of fatal overdoses, it remains optimal to mostly invest in preventive interventions, as long as fatal overdose rates are lower than opioid access rates. Practical implications : This study provides practitioners with a tool to effectively address the opioid epidemic and enhance public health by deciding how to allocate their budget to various levels of intervention.},

  abstract     = {Bayesian statistical, risk, and decision analyses require that one addresses many uncertainties and preferences, modelling those that can be with subjective probabilities and utilities, perhaps supported by sensitivity explorations. Subjective probabilities need eliciting either in their entirety or partially via prior distributions that are updated in the light of data during the analysis. Some uncertainties, however, are not easily modelled probabilistically, either because they are deep or because they relate to uncertainties in the modelling process itself. Preferences also require elicitation, a process which in many cases constructs these by contextualising broader values to the issues at hand. We discuss broader issues of elicitation without getting into specific details of the elicitation process. We also briefly discuss communication because elicitation sets the context for all subsequent communications to the problem owners and stakeholders. In particular, we emphasise the need for the problem owners to be fully acquainted with all the residual uncertainties at the end of the analysis, not just those captured quantitatively within the modelling. Moreover, we also consider whose uncertainties and preferences should be elicited and addressed by the analysis, arguing that the answer may be different in the varied contexts of Bayesian statistical, risk, and decision analyses. Moreover, the model may be constructed from a synthesis of several people’s judgements.},

  abstract     = {We consider a variant of the hide-and-seek game in which a seeker inspects multiple hiding locations to find multiple items hidden by a hider. Each hiding location has a maximum hiding capacity and a probability of detecting its hidden items when an inspection by the seeker takes place. The objective of the seeker (respectively, hider) is to minimize (respectively, maximize) the expected number of undetected items. This model is motivated by strategic inspection problems, where a security agency is tasked with coordinating multiple inspection resources to detect and seize illegal commodities hidden by a criminal organization. To solve this large-scale zero-sum game, we leverage its structure and show that its mixed-strategy Nash equilibria can be characterized using their unidimensional marginal distributions, which are pure equilibria of a lower dimensional continuous zero-sum game. This leads to a two-step approach for efficiently solving our hide-and-seek game: First, we analytically solve the continuous game and derive closed-form expressions of the equilibrium marginal distributions. Second, we design a combinatorial algorithm to coordinate the players’ resources and compute equilibrium mixed strategies that satisfy the marginal distributions. We show that this solution approach computes a Nash equilibrium of the hide-and-seek game in quadratic time with linear support. Our analysis reveals novel equilibrium behaviors driven by a complex interplay between the game parameters, captured by our closed-form solutions.

  abstract     = {This study explores whether the government should implement a cost-sharing or penalty mechanism to control waste incineration pollution and investigates which policy can best incentivize incineration plants to invest in pollution control. We design two differential game models, one based on a cost-sharing approach and one on a penalty system, to model the interactions between the government and incineration plants. We then compare and analyze the equilibrium outcomes in both scenarios. Our findings reveal that when incineration pollution significantly impacts the government, both the cost-sharing and penalty mechanisms are effective in stimulating incineration plants to enhance their pollution control efforts. However, when incineration pollution significantly affects the incineration plants themselves, the cost-sharing mechanism proves to be more effective in terms of pollution control. Furthermore, we find that the government derives greater utility under the cost-sharing mechanism compared with the penalty mechanism, especially as the amount of municipal solid waste (MSW) increases. In contrast, incineration plants tend to generate higher profits under the cost-sharing mechanism. These findings and their accompanying managerial implications may provide valuable guidance for government agencies in formulating policies to manage incineration pollution and encourage waste incineration plants to invest in improving their pollution control systems.

  abstract     = {Limited information, time, or capacity may prevent customers from acting as utility maximizers when making purchase decisions. Rather, they would settle for a good enough option; that is, they stop searching and make a purchase as soon as they find an acceptable alternative. We incorporate this behavior in an assortment-optimization problem. Whereas different approaches to modeling customer choice are adopted in assortment planning, all assume customers are utility maximizers. Our work bridges the research streams of assortment planning and bounded rationality, particularly satisficing behavior. In addition, we define a limit for the search budget of customers, in which customers leave without purchase after examining a certain number of items. This assumption brings a new perspective to the assortment-planning literature, enabling us to capture the choice-overload effect. We prove that the firm’s problem of finding the optimal assortment is NP-hard. We further establish certain structural properties of the optimal decision, which allows us to reformulate the model as a mixed-integer program. We analytically derive a tight upper bound on the percentage loss in the firm’s expected profit for small instances when it assumes incorrectly that customers are utility maximizers. For larger instances, we take a numerical approach to determine the loss. Our results indicate that firms offering low-involvement products, among those dealing with satisficing customers, are more likely to face substantial profit loss if they ignore this behavior.

  abstract     = {Benefit–cost analyses are critical to support U.S. agencies’ programmatic decision making. These analyses are particularly challenging when one of the benefits is adversary deterrence. This paper presents a framework for calculating the value of deterrence related to countermeasures implemented to mitigate an attack by an adaptive adversary. We offer an approach for partitioning the benefit of countermeasures into three components: (1) threat reduction (deterrence), (2) vulnerability reduction, and (3) consequence mitigation. The benefit of a countermeasure is measured by the expected value of countermeasure implementation (EVCI) attributable to a specific countermeasure. It is based on the concept of expected value of imperfect control, defined as the difference in the expected values of alternatives with and without countermeasures. The EVCI represents all the benefits of implementing the countermeasure and is derived from three sources: (1) changes in attack probability (threat reduction from deterrence), (2) changes in detection probability (vulnerability reduction), and (3) changes in the distribution of attack outcomes (consequence mitigation). We partition the EVCI and estimate the portion attributable to each of these three sources to quantify the unique benefit of each. We provide two applications of the partitioning methodology using examples from the published literature that examine countermeasures designed to protect commercial aircraft against man-portable air defense systems. The proposed framework provides an approach for explicitly accounting separately for deterrence, vulnerability reduction, and consequence mitigation in benefit–cost analyses. It provides quantifiable insights into how countermeasures reduce terrorism risk.

  abstract     = {Noise traders are a central idea in the modern theory of asset markets, yet there is not a standard model of such agents in contrast to the well-established representation of rational agents as expected utility maximizers. We propose the Hurwicz criterion, a classical criterion in decision analysis for choice under uncertainty, as a foundation for noise traders in asset markets. Hurwicz agents trade on optimism and pessimism and do not trade on information. A binary asset market is introduced with asymmetric information and heterogeneity both in rationality and in ambiguity attitudes. In this environment, noise trader behavior is endogenously positively correlated, the market is more efficient in low sentiment periods, and the favorite-longshot bias holds in equilibrium. The analysis demonstrates that aggregate market properties such as positive trading volume and the favorite longshot bias can be derived from the micro behavior of individual agents that have an axiomatic foundation.},
