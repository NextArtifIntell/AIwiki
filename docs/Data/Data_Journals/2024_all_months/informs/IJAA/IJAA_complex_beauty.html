  abstract = {To optimize nurse staffing in the emergency department (ED), Hartford Hospital has been collaborating with academics and consultants to schedule nurse shifts over each six-week staffing cycle. We develop and implement two-phase optimization models: a robust optimization model to find optimal staffing levels given the uncertainty in patient demands, followed by a pair of mixed-integer problems to generate individual schedules including work, trainee, and preceptor shifts for each nurse. Our approach leads to less costly (5%–8%) staffing with better coverage of patient care (8%–25%) and higher nurse satisfaction (5%). Moreover, nurses can work fewer shifts on weekends (17%), holidays (14%), and overtime (85%), as well as be assigned to more diverse positions (3.6) and more daily training opportunities (0.95). We implement our framework into an automated end-to-end scheduling optimization software, deployed for use at Hartford Hospital since March 2023. The software collects preferences from more than 200 ED nurses and enables managers to optimize schedules with guided dynamic adjustments. This transformative implementation streamlines a previously labor-expensive staffing process (currently taking more than 88 manual hours per cycle) and delivers schedules that are more suitable for patients and nurses together, with an annual projected cost saving of around $720,000.

  abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, safely implementing in-person indoor instruction was a high priority for universities nationwide. To support this effort at Cornell University, we developed a mathematical model for estimating the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in university classrooms. This model was used to evaluate combinations of feasible interventions for classrooms at Cornell during the COVID-19 pandemic and identify the best set of interventions that allow for higher occupancy levels, matching the prepandemic numbers of in-person courses, despite a limited number of large classrooms. Importantly, we determined that requiring masking in dense classrooms with unrestricted seating when more than 90% of students were vaccinated was easy to implement, incurred little logistical or financial cost, and allowed classes to be held at full capacity. A retrospective analysis at the end of the semester confirmed the model’s assessment that the proposed classroom configuration was safe. Our framework is generalizable and was used to support reopening decisions at Stanford University. In addition, our framework is flexible and applies to a wide range of indoor settings. It was repurposed for large university events and gatherings, and it can be used to support planning indoor space use to avoid transmission of infectious diseases across various industries, from secondary schools to movie theaters and restaurants.

  abstract = {In the face of a worldwide shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we report on the challenge of supplying hard-to-forecast PPE demand in the state of West Virginia under challenging replenishment conditions. Part of the challenge included the lack of appropriate healthcare data in a largely rural state such as West Virginia. We describe the work of a joint interagency task force (JIATF) that assembled the data to implement a novel agent-based epidemiological model for forecasting PPE demand of patients with confirmed and suspected COVID-19, extending the capability of popular epidemiological models. On the supply side, we describe our extension of nonparametric approaches for setting inventory parameters necessitated by the combination of nonstandard lead-time distributions and autocorrelated demand. Our simulation studies, grounded in the practical need to replenish PPE stocks, demonstrate considerable improvements in both (a) forecast accuracy possible from our approach over extant epidemiological models, and (b) estimation improvement of our nonparametric inventory estimation approach over the extant approaches. We describe the detailed implementation of these methods under the aegis of the JIATF and discuss the relevance of our results beyond the COVID-19 pandemic to other public health emergencies and supply chain settings.

Our team studied questions to address the pandemic’s rapidly evolving current and near-future epidemiological state as well as short-term (a few weeks) and medium-term (several months) bed capacity demand. Frequent data input from and consultations with our public health and clinical partners allowed our academic team to apply dynamic data-driven approaches using time series and system dynamics modeling. Our portfolio of models provided decision makers with the ability to ask nuanced questions. It allowed them to explore and explain different aspects of the pandemic and make more informed capacity plans in the EoE and its subregions. Our novel time series models have already been applied to India in collaboration with Indian health authorities, and the system dynamics model has been used in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland. Therefore, our work may address future epidemiological crises beyond the EoE, especially when used in conjunction with other methods as an ensemble.

To improve market responsiveness and reduce operational costs, minimizing work-in-process (WIP) throughout the manufacturing process is crucial, especially for the bottleneck process because it determines the efficiency of the entire production system. To achieve this goal, we utilize optimization and statistical techniques based on real-world data to determine the optimal level and threshold bounds for managing the WIP of the bottleneck process.

A basic first-come-first-served policy for accepting package delivery requests to lockers results in lockers becoming full with standard shipping speed (3- to 5-day shipping) packages, leaving no space for expedited packages, which are mostly next-day or two-day shipping. This paper proposes a solution to the problem of determining how much locker capacity to reserve for different ship-option packages. Yield management is a much-researched field with popular applications in the airline, car rental, and hotel industries. However, Amazon Locker poses a unique challenge in this field because the number of days a package will wait in a locker (package dwell time) is, in general, unknown. The proposed solution combines machine learning techniques to predict locker demand and package dwell time with linear programming to maximize throughput in lockers. The decision variables from this optimization provide optimal capacity reservation values for different ship options. This resulted in a year-over-year increase of 9% in Locker throughput worldwide during the holiday season of 2018, impacting millions of customers. History: This paper was refereed.},

  abstract = {Amidst critical levels of nurse shortages, we partnered with Indiana University Health (IUH) to pioneer a novel suite of advanced data and decision analytics to support a new model of nurse staffing. This statewide program leverages a flexible pool of resource nurses who can move between the 16 IUH hospitals located in five diverse regions and serving more than 1.4 million residents. This program breaks the mold of traditional travel and resource nurses by adding flexibility to move nurses between hospitals to dynamically respond to short-term patient census fluctuations. This paradigm shift necessitated the development of analytics to execute these interhospital transfers. Specifically, we develop analytics to create a two-week advance on-call list for travel and a 24- to 48-hour call-in decision. Our Delta Coverage Analytics Suite was launched in October 2021 as a Microsoft PowerBI application and provides an integrated solution that has supported and continues to support this new staffing approach at a statewide scale. The suite contrasts with existing nurse scheduling tools that primarily cater to single hospitals or units. It incorporates (1) a novel patient census forecast based on a deep generative model capturing complex spatial-temporal correlations and avoiding error accumulation occurring in traditional time-series models and (2) a stochastic optimization that prescribes optimal on-call and deployment decisions. The pilot, conducted from May to June 2023, produced a remarkable reduction in understaffing, with estimated annual savings of $2.5 million to IUH and over $1.5 billion on a national scale compared with the conventional solution of hiring travel nurses. As the first program of its kind, our methods establish new benchmarks for evidence-based and data-driven nurse workforce management with the potential to transform how healthcare institutions approach the national nursing shortage crisis.

  abstract = {Cainiao proposes a novel business model that consolidates parcels ordered by the same consumer from one or more merchants during the fulfillment process. The objective is to increase delivery speed without incurring additional costs for merchants and consumers. To support this business model, we develop three analytics methods: (1) a two-phase online optimization algorithm to determine which of a consumer’s parcels constitute consolidated parcels and to select the shipping methods for the consolidated parcels that maximize the gains while satisfying the constraints (e.g., the 10-day on-time delivery rate of all consumer parcels created within a specified time should reach a target value), (2) a statistical method to calculate delivery time distributions to obtain on-time delivery rates within different days, and (3) a simulation-based optimization method to guide managers in setting appropriate target values for the constraints. In addition, we prove that the expected optimality gap and constraint violation of the online optimization algorithm have sublinear bounds, and we validate its effectiveness and robustness by testing instances generated from real-world data. Since 2020, Cainiao has utilized the system to consolidate numerous parcels shipped from China to more than 50 countries and regions, thus saving tens of millions of dollars annually and reducing delivery time by at least 50%.

  abstract = {Recent technological advances in the semiconductor industry have rapidly changed how products are designed and manufactured. Large “monolithic” designs, which integrate multiple functionalities in a single printed die, are being replaced with multidie products. To ensure the success of this transformation, it is critical to sort materials into categories and strategically build assemblies with maximum compatibility in mind. This enables manufacturing to be optimized to fulfill specific requirements for final products. However, it also means that more individual components must be managed, and decisions on how to assemble them must be made holistically. This creates a complex, nonlinear problem that combines qualities of both selective assembly and assembly routing problems. The result is named the sort-assemble-blend routing problem (SABR-P). Its solution approach is formulated using techniques including genetic algorithms, Monte Carlo simulations, linear programming, and machine learning. This framework has been successfully applied in practice, saving Intel Corporation more than $500 million thus far. It is the new standard for analyzing and optimizing Intel’s multidie products for the foreseeable future.

  abstract = {Hospitals are responsible for ensuring not only that the patients heal when in the hospital but also that the patients are not readmitted within 30 days of discharge. Additionally, the penalization of hospitals from the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program in the Affordable Care Act of 2010 and the emergence of value-based, patient-centered reimbursement models continue to pressure health organizations to minimize hospital readmissions. In the face of limited staffing resources, readmission strategies are driven by three foundational components: which patients to focus on, what type of intervention should occur, and when an intervention should occur. Previous modeling work has crudely grouped patients into a few segments. With the combination of advanced analytical modeling and widely used electronic health records (EHRs), patients’ risk levels and the timings of the readmission issues can be finely predicted. This provides an opportunity for creating personalized care plans (when and what intervention should occur) for patients. This study describes developing and implementing a predictive analytics-based system in a Midwestern hospital system for profiling readmission risk. Results indicate that models, such as the ones detailed in this article, that combine patient stratification and readmission risk timing can effectively extend a personalized care plan to determine when intervention timing should occur and optimize resource allocation of the care team. This comprehensive suite of predictive models would allow care teams across the continuum to offer personalized care transition plans and dynamically pivot strategies to address emerging events throughout a patient’s trajectory.

We model the constraints set forth by the institution so that we guarantee the validity of all produced plans. We formulate several different objectives to optimize the resulting plan, including the fastest completion time, course difficulty balance, and maximization of the expected student grade point average given the student’s performance in past courses. All resulting problems are mixed-integer linear programming problems with a number of binary variables, that is, the max number of terms times the number of courses available for the student to take. The resulting mathematical programming problem is solvable in less than 10 seconds on a modern commercial off-the-shelf PC, whereas the manual process used to take more than one hour of advising time for every student and, as measured by the objectives set forth, resulted in suboptimal schedules.

  abstract = {In this paper, we introduce the daily berth planning problem for Xiamen Hai-Tian Container Terminal (XHCT) at the Port of Xiamen, China, and propose the development and implementation of a berth planning system. The aim of the berth planning problem is to optimize daily berth plans by considering various decisions, including berth allocation, quay crane assignment, fairway traffic control, and berthing safety requirements. Among these decisions, the berthing safety requirement is a novel but practical problem in berth allocation that concerns the resource allocation related to berthing safety and interrelation with other decisions. A mathematical programming-driven methodological framework is designed with a 0-1 integer linear programming model for problem formulation and a highly efficient decomposition heuristic algorithm for solving the problem. This framework establishes the core for the berth planning system. The adoption of the berth planning system contributes to the increase of container throughput and berth capacity by transforming the planning process of XHCT. Moreover, the mathematical programming-driven daily berth planning informs further intelligent operations development in the Port of Xiamen and other container ports.

  abstract = {This article describes the development of a decision support tool for a Rich Vehicle Routing Problem (R-VRP) of a major do-it-yourself (DIY) retailer supplying its stores across Europe from multiple depots. The retailer uses external logistic service providers (LSPs) for the delivery to its stores and has two modes to choose from. In the first mode, the retailer proposes delivery tours to LSPs for execution. These tours are billed according to a nonlinear tariff with volume discounts depending on the delivery zones visited and the load carried. The LSPs accept the retailer’s tour proposal only if tour duration and distance restrictions are kept. The latter is ensured by a relative detour limit. In the second mode, the retailer assigns single shipments to common carriers that consolidate them with shipments from other customers and bill this based on load and destination. The resulting problem represents an open VRP with two delivery modes, carrier selection and a heterogeneous fleet. Multiple delivery modes are standard in DIY retailing and constitute a general industry problem. The literature on VRPs and current software applications in the industry predominantly considers modeling and solution approaches that rely on linear distance costs, neglecting that nonlinear zone-based tariffs with volume discounts are standard in the freight forwarding business. Our work addresses this issue by developing a decision support tool for the retailer based on an exact algorithm for solving R-VRPs with a nonlinear zone-based tariff scheme and a relative detour limit. The tool is based on an innovative three-component set partitioning algorithm working on a complete set of feasible tours to solve the problem. We show that our approach optimally solves the daily distribution problem of the industry partner with up to 150 stores. Furthermore, implementing the tool enables more comprehensive and structured planning for the retailer and an average of 8% transportation cost savings, translating to total savings of more than €1 million per year for this specific retailer compared with the status quo.

Although the U.S. media have reported such results for years, particularly for Major League Baseball, no such equivalent outlets backed by rigorous mathematical models exist in South Korea. Motivated by the hiatus in most international professional sports (with a notable exception being Korean baseball) during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, we derive inspiration for the generation of so-called magic numbers by modifying an existing set of integer-programming optimization models that had been developed for U.S. Major League Baseball; the modifications tailor these models to the Korean Baseball Organization League by considering unique rules such as the fact that a game can end in a draw. Our results, which are new to Korean media, have generated interest among Korean baseball fans curious about up-to-date, precise information regarding whether their team still has a chance of qualifying for postseason play or whether it has been eliminated.

This information is crucial for optimizing product management strategies and making decisions regarding inventory planning, pricing, and marketing. Many apparel companies rely on rule-based methods conducted by experienced sales managers, which consume significant time and energy from managers and often result in delayed information and low prediction accuracy. We propose a new ranking-based method to identify the product popularity that predicts regional and national rankings of products based on sales data at an early stage of a sales season. Our method enables companies to efficiently identify popular products within a remarkably short span of two to four weeks. To validate its efficacy, we compare the model’s predictions with actual orders from a fashion company in 2021, showcasing a notable 5.9% increase in sales volume when using our approach to guide order decisions.

To achieve this goal, we analyzed the judicial process using operational concepts that have been successfully implemented in other contexts, and we adapted them to the court process. We further collected data before and after the operational changes were implemented to assess the efficacy of the implementation. We exploited the distinctive structure of the judicial process and the fact that our operational changes targeted one part of that process to propose a variation of the difference-in-differences approach to measure the process improvement. The results suggest that the duration of the treated part of the process was reduced by 46.1% postimplementation. We further examined the effect of the treatment on the quality of the process, measured by appeal rate, and found no adverse effect. These analyses demonstrate the potential of using operational management tools and concepts to improve judicial processes and to contribute to the alleviation of court congestion.},

  abstract = {Traditional auditing has been commonly practiced by multinational companies to monitor their suppliers for sustainability violations. Based on a collaborative supplier sustainability performance improvement program at Koninklijke (Royal) Philips N.V., we introduce a framework that offers a paradigm shift to an improvement-based proactive approach that makes use of suppliers’ self-assessments. We refer to this framework as CARE, consisting of the following phases: collecting supplier sustainability data, assessing suppliers’ sustainability levels, reacting to future violations proactively, and enhancing sustainability performance. The framework integrates analytics techniques to understand the link between the general characteristics of the carefully assessed suppliers—such as location, size, and sector—and their sustainability profile, enabling large-scale supplier assessment and improvement. This information is then used to leverage machine learning techniques to predict current and future sustainability levels of suppliers and to determine best actions for sustainability improvement using mathematical programming. The utilization of analytics constitutes a pivotal element in this endeavor and notably makes CARE highly scalable because it harnesses limited supplier data—namely, only general supplier information—while there is a need to support decision making concerning thousands of suppliers. Philips makes use of this framework and reports that the overall 2021 year-on-year improvement in sustainability performance was 24% for suppliers that entered the program in 2020, indicating the efficacy of the suggested approach.

The system allows some students to attend in-person classes with social distancing while their peers attend online, and schedules vary by day. We consider two variations of this problem: one in which students have unique, individualized class enrollments and one in which they are grouped in teams that are enrolled in identical classes. We formulate both problems as mixed-integer programs. In the first setting, students who are scheduled to attend all classes in person on a given day may, at times, be required to attend a particular class on that day online because of social distancing constraints. We count these instances as “excess.” We minimize excess and related objectives and analyze and solve the relaxed linear program. In the second setting, we schedule the teams so that each team’s in-person attendance is balanced over days of the week and spread out over the entire term. Our objective is to maximize interaction between different teams. Our program was used to schedule more than 2,500 students in student-level scheduling and about 790 students in team-level scheduling from the fall 2020 through summer 2021 terms at Columbia Business School.

  abstract = {Improving fulfillment efficiency is critical for long-term sustainability of online grocery retailing. In this paper, we study reducing order fulfillment cost by order consolidation. Motivated by the observation that a significant percentage of buyers place multiple orders within a short time interval, we propose a scheme that attempts to consolidate such “multiorders” to reduce the number of parcels and hence, the shipping cost. At the same time, it cannot significantly disturb the existing order fulfillment process or undermine the customer service level. Successful execution of the scheme requires a prediction of multiorder probabilities and a control policy that selectively prioritizes order processing. For the prediction task, we formulate a binary classification problem and use machine-learning algorithms to predict in real time the probability of a multiorder. For the control task, our proposal is to hold arriving orders in a temporary order pool for potential consolidation and to determine the release timing by a dynamic program. The proposed solution is estimated to capture 92.8% of all the multiorders at the cost of holding the orders for about 20.3 minutes on average. This translates to more than 10 million U.S. dollars of order fulfillment cost saving annually. History: This paper was refereed.},

The main objective is to ensure that the clinic operates safely while COVID-19 restrictions are in place and to improve its providers’ utilization rate. The model simulates people’s movement in the clinic, monitors the congestion level in four common areas, and identifies the peak hours during a day. We also study various overbooking and telehealth policies to overcome high cancelation or no-show rates and low utilization for providers. Simulation results using AnyLogic have helped the management decide to reopen the in-person services during the COVID-19 pandemic based on the safe congestion level demonstrated by the simulation.

  abstract = {Every 10 years, U.S. states redraw their congressional and state legislative district plans. This process decides the political landscape for the subsequent 10 years. Prior to the 2021 redistricting cycle, Missouri enacted new criteria for state legislative districts. The Missouri League of Women Voters (LWV-MO) contacted the authors to analyze the potential impact of these new criteria on the map-drawing process. We apply recombination (a spanning tree method) within a local search optimization framework to analyze the interplay between political geography, constitutional requirements, and political fairness in Missouri. We use this framework to produce district plans that satisfy the new criteria and prioritize different aspects of fairness. The results, quantified by several measures of fairness, reveal an inherent Republican advantage in Missouri because of the state’s political geography and constitutional requirements. We conclude that Missouri’s political geography and constitutional requirements prevent the optimization framework from substantially improving political fairness in state legislative plans. In contrast, the framework can substantially improve political fairness in Missouri congressional plans, which are not subject to the new requirements. The LWV-MO used this work to advocate for fairness and transparency in their testimonies for the Missouri redistricting commission’s public hearings. History: This paper was refereed.

  abstract = {Volkswagen Group Logistics (VWGL) is responsible for the logistics and supply processes of the automotive brands of the Volkswagen Group. In this context, supplier development is vital for efficient and reliable material flows between the process partners. In recent years, VWGL implemented a collaborative approach for supplier development in logistics wherein it is crucial to identify disrupting suppliers and apply improvement measures to increase their logistics performance. Against this background, VWGL initiated a project to examine how supplier development measures can be implemented efficiently to improve the overall logistics performance of VWGL’s supply base. This paper presents the developed operations research approach, which integrates Monte Carlo simulation and a knapsack model on the specific problem of supplier development. The approach consists of three stages: (1) data preparation, (2) measure evaluation, and (3) measure allocation. The approach is validated based on 18 existing less-than-truckload networks of VWGL. We find that, on average, considerable cost savings of 31% can be achieved throughout the networks compared with VWGL’s previous procedure. A new workflow facilitates our approach to lift its potential in practical application sustainably. History: This paper was refereed.},

  abstract = {Socially missioned nonprofit organizations exist to connect at-risk populations to critical healthcare, food, and financial services. However, these organizations face several internal (resource infrastructure, management capability) and external (multiple stakeholders, client demographics and capabilities) constraints within which they must work to attain their goal of helping people in need. The extant academic literature offers a variety of solutions to such allocation problems for use in for-profit organizations. Yet noted differences in the operational systems of for-profit and nonprofit operations limit practitioners’ capabilities to readily leverage these tools. Thus, in this paper, we extend the applicability of classic resource allocation principles to the context of nonprofit operations’ outreach efforts. We describe a detailed case study analysis at one nonprofit organization (SC Thrive) wherein we implemented the theory of constraints–linear programming framework to help maximize the effectiveness of outreach initiatives carried out by the organization. Based on the results from our stepwise, nonlinear yield model, SC Thrive is now capable of doubling the annual number of applications submitted by potential beneficiaries for assistance services.

  abstract = {The Audit Office of the Republic of Cyprus conducted the first-ever audit of the country’s public debt, seeking answers to two key questions. Is government debt sustainable, and is debt financing efficient and effective in securing the lowest cost with acceptable risks? The audit’s findings were discussed by the parliament and can have significant ramifications for public finance. However, public debt management is quite complex, and the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions suggests that sufficient technical knowledge is essential in undertaking an audit, including an understanding of the uncertain macroeconomy, financing conditions, and government fiscal stance. We use a risk management model based on scenario trees in conducting the audit. The model determines optimal debt financing strategies to benchmark the performance of the country’s Public Debt Management Office and answer the audit questions. We also incorporate an integrated assessment model to examine the risks from climate change. The auditor general presented the findings to the Parliamentary Audit Committee in the presence of the Minister of Finance, and his recommendations are expected to have a significant impact on the debt operations of the country.

  abstract = {Meituan pioneered an on-demand food delivery service in China, which allows consumers to place food orders online for fast delivery. Leveraging its minute-level delivery network and boasting more than five million active couriers, Meituan delivers more than 60 million orders daily, ranking it as the world’s largest in terms of order volume and courier count. It has transformed itself into one of China’s most critical delivery infrastructure providers. To meet its service commitment to customers and improve the working experience of its couriers, Meituan must continuously optimize its order assignment decisions. Thus, it developed a real-time intelligent dispatch system, including a set of algorithms based on operations research and machine learning techniques, to precisely model the assignment problem in a dynamic and uncertain environment, and solved this NP-hard problem in seconds generating a high-quality solution. Since implementing this dispatch system in 2019, Meituan has realized a decrease of 20.96% in average order delivery time and 23.77% in average courier traveling distance per order. In addition, the system contributes to cost reductions of about $0.23 billion annually. Moreover, the dispatch system enabled other new digital economy business formats, such as Meituan Instashopping and Meituan Grocery, to thrive.},

This change was the first documented implementation of a ridesharing matching algorithm that can learn and improve in real time. We evaluated the new approach during weeks of switchback experimentation in most Lyft markets and estimated how it benefited drivers, riders, and the platform. In particular, it enabled our drivers to serve millions of additional riders each year, leading to more than $30 million per year in incremental revenue.

  abstract = {The rapid evolution of cloud computing technologies has instigated a paradigm shift across various traditional industries, with the live streaming sector standing as a compelling exemplification of this transformation. Huawei Cloud, which has become an influential player in the business-to-business live streaming arena, with its services spanning over 60 countries since 2020, is at the forefront of this shift. Amid the flourishing live streaming market, Huawei Cloud faces the dual challenge of satisfying the escalating demand, while managing the mounting operational costs, predominantly associated with the network bandwidth. To offer premium services while minimizing the bandwidth cost, we developed a dynamic traffic allocation system called GSCO . This system was engineered using an array of operations research methodologies such as continuous optimization, integer programming, graph theory, scheduling, and network-flow problem solving, along with state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. The GSCO system has been proven highly effective in cost optimization, reducing network bandwidth expenses by about 30% and leading to savings exceeding $49.6 million from Q1 2020 to Q3 2022. In addition, it has significantly bolstered Huawei Cloud’s market share, amplifying peak bandwidth from an initial 1.5 terabits per second (Tbps) to a substantial 16 Tbps.},

Its transportation planners perform routing, bidding, and improvement tasks for many business projects. Prospective customers require DHL to compete to win their business by solving their delivery problems, improving existing supply chain designs, and guaranteeing savings by using fewer trucks or less fuel. Our new transport network optimization (TNO) software suite gives DHL a significant edge in these bidding and improvement tasks. The four modules in the TNO software are as follows: (1) freight optimization, (2) fleet (sizing) optimization, (3) connection hub or pool point-related optimization, and (4) round-trip optimization. We use innovative integer programming approaches in the TNO software, which we developed and implemented in collaboration with Ohio State University, including a new type of two-color ant colony search to efficiently address outsourcing in the first module and the use of dynamic programming for subproblems. Over 2.5 years since 2020, TNO has led to over $117 million in estimated savings for DHL Supply Chain North America and its customers, contributing a 20% win-rate increase and reducing CO 2 emissions by at least 0.1 megatons.},
