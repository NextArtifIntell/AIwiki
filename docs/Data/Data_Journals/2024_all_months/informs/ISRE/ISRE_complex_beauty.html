  abstract     = {Information systems (IS) scholars have pursued phenomenon-specific research to meaningfully engage with and contribute to addressing societal grand challenges (GCs). Although such efforts are invaluable, a broader framework that identifies generalized organizing problems in tackling GCs and reveals promising pathways for digital technologies to add value in addressing them could help establish an agenda for impactful IS research. In this article, we offer such a framework by drawing on Ostrom’s principles of public value creation and management research on organizational design. We identify a set of eight organizing design tensions that arise from employing global and local perspectives in addressing GCs. We consider digital approaches to resolving each of these design tensions and delineate a rich and diverse agenda for future research. We acknowledge prevailing socio-political structures and factors that may constrain the effectiveness of digital solutions and adopt a socio-technical design perspective to suggest alternative arrangements of digital and socio-political elements in GC settings. Our discussion foreshadows the considerable opportunity for IS research to contribute to the broader dialog on GCs by integrating existing IS theoretical perspectives and concepts with complementary theories from management and beyond. Our framework also informs and enriches GC phenomenon-specific IS research by helping to generalize the research questions and allowing for cross-phenomenon mapping of critical study insights. More broadly, the pursuit of the research agenda proposed here, along with entering a broader GC conversation with other disciplines and stakeholders, may speed the identification and enactment of effective solutions to grand challenges.

  abstract     = {Although some scholars raise alarm about societal harm emerging from Big Data practices, critical social theory (CST) Information Systems research on the structures and dynamics driving Big Data practices is rare. In this research commentary, we interrogate how tech firms use social practices and platform design to strategically manipulate individuals into accepting datafication and data assetization that accrue positive data network effects for themselves and mostly negative data network effects (economic loss, social and privacy harm) for individuals. We draw on the ideas of Heidegger and Marcuse to critically question the Big Data paradigm in order to develop better understanding of the social implications for individuals and society. Using the concepts of false consciousness , digital entrapment , and Faustian bargains , we critically inquire into the Big Data practices that keep us tethered to digital platforms. Specifically, we interrogate sociomaterial structures that socially condition individuals into a digital habitus and to identify themselves as homo digitalis , who view all their “ relations ” (social and economic) as digital . This social conditioning reproduces a false consciousness that constricts our worldview, undermines our rational choices, and enables the risky compromises we make with tech companies that manipulate and exploit us with their increasingly oppressive Big Data practices and related dark patterns. We critically analyze the case of Microsoft Viva to provide an illustration of how mundane digital tools can condition our reality and entrap us into an open prison. We argue that if we do not critically interrogate our false consciousness of the digital and understand how digital giants colonize our social systems by structurally embedding Big Data practices, we will continue to be susceptible to manipulation and digital entrapment. Ongoing risky compromises with tech firms will erode the very foundations of the “good life,” freedom, liberty, and personal privacy, and they will institutionalize the open prison. The CST explanation we propose and the research agenda we outline are meant to encourage research into solutions to the digital entrapment problem.

  abstract     = {This paper examines the role of information in two-sided matching markets where preference mismatch is present. Two-sided markets are characterized by different preferences of the parties involved, and a match occurs when both sides show a preference for each other. In practice, however, there is often a preference mismatch. In this study, we use a large data set from an online dating website to provide empirical evidence for preference mismatch in the field. We also develop empirical models to investigate the impact of information under preference mismatch by analyzing variations in the amount of available information. Specifically, we compare partial and complete information contained in the users’ short and long profiles, respectively. We find that more information about the other side does not necessarily improve the likelihood of a match. In fact, the side making the proposal has a better chance of matching if the decision is based on the information contained in the short profile rather than the long profile. This suggests that users are better off seeing partial rather than complete information about the candidates, a phenomenon we refer to as the “less information is more” effect. Our empirical analysis shows that this effect is driven by the mismatched preferences of the two sides. These results imply that there is an optimal amount of information that one side should possess about the other before making a proposal. Our study highlights the importance of optimal information design strategies to determine the appropriate amount of information that should be provided to each side. Our findings also offer managerial implications regarding information provision strategies for online platforms in general. History: Pei-Yu Chen, Senior Editor; Xitong Li, Associate Editor.

  abstract     = {Innovation is vital for the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). However, SMEs face deficiencies that hinder their innovation output. This study examines how information technology (IT) helps SMEs address two salient deficiencies: technological deficiency (deficiency in internal technical knowledge and skills) and government support deficiency (deficiency in favorable government policies and incentives). Although IT can be used in a closed manner (within the firm’s boundary) or open manner (beyond the firm’s boundary) to enable innovation, closed and open approaches to IT-enabled innovation pose advantages and challenges for SMEs, resulting in a tension regarding which approach better addresses these two deficiencies. In this study, we investigate how IT Use for Closed Innovation Activities ( ITC ) and IT Use for Open Innovation Activities ( ITO ) help SMEs overcome these two deficiencies to achieve innovation output. Drawing on the theoretical concepts of internal and external absorptive capacity metaroutines, we hypothesize that ITC and ITO reduce the harmful effects of technological deficiency and government support deficiency on innovation output. Further, we hypothesize that ITC is more effective than ITO in reducing the harmful effect of technological deficiency on innovation output. In contrast, we hypothesize that ITO is more effective than ITC in reducing the harmful effect of government support deficiency on innovation output. Our empirical analysis of a unique multiyear archival data set of 319 manufacturing SMEs in Mexico broadly supports our hypotheses. We conduct a further exploratory analysis that sheds light on several underlying mechanisms included in our theorization. Our main contributions lie in addressing the tension between ITC and ITO and highlighting that neither approach to IT-enabled innovation outperforms the other in combating the technological deficiency and government support deficiency of SMEs; rather, SMEs achieve greater innovation output by appropriately orienting their IT-enabled innovation efforts in a closed or open manner to address specific deficiencies.

  abstract     = {Delivery speed is an essential component of the service provided by online delivery platforms. Because improving actual delivery speed is expensive, platforms can instead create a perception of faster delivery by showing a conservative estimate of the delivery duration when a customer places an order. We use detailed transaction-level data from a major food delivery platform to examine the effects of setting conservative delivery speed expectations on customers’ likelihood of future purchases and restaurant choices. When delivery is slower (faster) than expected, we find that customers are less (more) likely to purchase again from the platform and the focal (same) restaurant they ordered from. A reduction in purchases from the platform is expected to reduce purchases from nonfocal (other) restaurants as well; however, we find no significant impact. This is possibly because of a spillover effect, as customers may switch their purchasing to these restaurants. Our findings thus highlight the effect of setting conservative expected delivery times in a platform setting. Additionally, we provide evidence that customers with a consistent past delivery experience are less responsive to a single instance of positive or negative delivery performance. We further find heterogeneous effects of slower/faster than expected delivery on new versus existing customers and orders with zero versus nonzero delivery charges. These results suggest that the strategy to set conservative expected delivery times can be judiciously implemented for consumer segments for whom future demand is more likely to improve with a better delivery experience. Finally, we examine the trade-off between current and future demand with the setting of a conservative estimated delivery time. We do additional analysis and also conduct an experiment on Amazon Mechanical Turk to show that the gain in future demand is more than the loss in current demand, thus establishing the efficacy of our suggested strategy.

  abstract     = {Legal professionals have access to many different sources of knowledge, including user-generated Wikipedia articles that summarize previous judicial decisions (i.e., precedents). Although these Wikipedia articles are easily accessible, they have unknown provenance and reliability, and therefore using them in professional settings is problematic. Nevertheless, Wikipedia articles influence legal judgments, as we show using a first-of-its-kind randomized control trial on judicial decision making. We find that the presence of a Wikipedia article about Irish Supreme Court decisions makes it meaningfully more likely that the corresponding case will be cited as a precedent by judges in subsequent decisions. The language used in the Wikipedia article also influences the language used in judgments. These effects are only present for citations by the High Court and not for the higher levels of the judiciary (Court of Appeal and Supreme Court). The High Court faces larger caseloads, so this may indicate that settings with greater time pressures encourage greater reliance on Wikipedia. Our results add to the growing recognition that Wikipedia and other frequently accessed sources of user-generated content have profound effects on important social outcomes and that these effects extend farther than previously seen—into high-stakes settings where norms are supposed to restrict their use.

  abstract     = {The rapid advancement and adoption of blockchain technology have heralded an explosive growth of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) as a new and popular fundraising approach for blockchain start-ups. To motivate blockchain individuals to invest in the subsequent ICO, a growing number of blockchain-based project founders employ the airdrop campaign, through which they distribute a specific amount of free official tokens or promotional tokens to potential investors on the blockchain with or without their permission. Of paramount concern to the founders contemplating whether to launch an airdrop campaign are whether the airdrop campaign has a positive effect on the potential investors’ investment behaviors in their ICOs and how the efficacy of the airdrop may vary with investors. To address these critical questions, we implement a regression discontinuity design by leveraging the quasi-randomization of a blockchain project’s promotional airdrop campaign on the Ethereum platform. We find that the promotional airdrop leads to a 2.3 times increase in the potential investors’ ICO investment probability, as well as a significant and positive effect on their investment amount. We further find that the airdrop is more effective in increasing the investment for individuals with transacted projects dissimilar to the focal project than those with similar ones, which supports the diversification perspective in investment. We also find that the airdrop can motivate token receivers to stick with the focal project for a longer period. We show the generalizability of our findings by leveraging the randomized token airdrop strategies of multiple ICO projects. Our study contributes to the literature on ICOs and marketing strategy for financial instruments and provides important implications to blockchain start-ups on whether and how to launch an airdrop campaign.

  abstract     = {The consumption of services inherently requires a process to achieve the desired outcome. For nonexperiential services (e.g., healthcare and education) primarily valued for their end outcomes, their consumption typically involves lengthy processes that are not designed for enjoyment (e.g., wound care and lecture attendance). Consequently, there exists a prominent tension between the processes (means) and outcomes (ends) of these services, which is largely ignored in the prior literature on user-generated content (UGC) that predominantly focuses on products (e.g., books and electronics) or experiential services (e.g., dining and lodging). To bridge this gap, we investigate the distinct roles of process- and outcome-oriented reviews in influencing consumers’ decisions to pursue healthcare services, leveraging a comprehensive data set collected from an online platform for cosmetic procedures. By separating process- and outcome-oriented reviews through visual content analysis, we show that the effect of outcome-oriented reviews in boosting the sales of healthcare services is almost twice stronger than that of process-oriented reviews on average. However, the relative effectiveness of these two types of reviews varies substantially across different types of healthcare services. Specifically, we find that process-oriented reviews are more influential in affecting consumers’ purchases of services with higher complexity, in contrast to outcome-oriented reviews that are more impactful for services with lower complexity. Moreover, the impact of process-oriented reviews is stronger for less popular services, whereas the impact of outcome-oriented reviews is stronger for more popular services. These nuanced findings show that consumers resort to different types of UGC while considering different types of healthcare services. Our work has important implications both theoretically and practically. History: Xiaoquan (Michael) Zhang, Senior Editor; Khim Yong Goh, Associate Editor.

In this paper, we study the problem of background music recommendation for short videos on short video sharing platforms. In our recommendation setting, the item (music) is not recommended directly to the user, but to the video created by the user. When making music recommendations for videos, we consider three important players: users, videos, and music. We define a unique background music recommendation problem and design a novel background music recommendation model to address the problem. We propose a model based on the deep learning framework to effectively address the distinctive three-way relationships among users, videos, and music. Our model considers not only the conventional user–music alignment, but also the alignment between videos and music. To evaluate our model, we conduct comprehensive experiments on real-world data collected from one of the most popular short video sharing platforms. Our proposed model significantly outperforms other existing models in recommendation performance. The superiority of our proposed model remains consistent across various scenarios, including cold-start recommendations, data sets with varying density levels, and data sets spanning diverse video categories.

By tracking a consumer’s facial expressions in response to various visual objects in real time, the system learns the consumer’s individual preferences toward different ads, searches the ad pool, and selects and subsequently displays a new ad that is most likely to elicit positive attitudinal and behavioral responses. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed system with two empirical studies. The results show that by tracking a consumer’s facial responses to only one ad or even part of an ad, our proposed system is able to make reasonably accurate inferences about a consumer’s ad preferences, with or without using information about other consumers. These inferences are used to make personalized recommendations that help enhance consumers’ ad viewing experiences and elicit favorable responses.

  abstract     = {Visualized narratives have been broadly employed to help individuals understand complex environmental issues, increase green awareness, and encourage sustainable behaviors. However, sustainability awareness only sometimes translates to actual green practices. In this study, we develop and test a model that explains how eco-driving behaviors and attitudes toward efficient driving can be promoted with post-trip visualized narratives. Drawing on human-computer interaction research, we integrate the mental construal literature to reveal feasibility and desirability perceptions as underlying mechanisms. We test our hypotheses in two experiments involving eye-tracking and driving simulation. Results show that pairwise animated illustration and prospective narratives elevated eco-driving behaviors and attitudes toward efficient driving. In the meantime, static illustration and retrospective narratives influenced attitudes toward efficient driving. In addition, feasibility and desirability perceptions were significant mediators. Overall, this study contributes to information systems literature, human-computer interaction literature, and the construal level theory by unraveling the effects of post-trip visualized narratives on promoting ecological practices and attitudes.

  abstract     = {Societal externalities stemming from digital multisided platforms on nonparticipants have received increasing attention from scholars in recent years. In this paper, we investigate one such spillover, how the emergence of home-sharing platforms (viz., Airbnb) affects noise complaints in densely populated urban areas. Urban noise is a stalwart social problem in urban living, and anecdotal evidence has suggested that the entry of home-sharing platforms has significantly exacerbated urban noise. We empirically examine the relationship between the entry of Airbnb and noise complaints in New York City (NYC). Leveraging the phased expansion of Airbnb into different locations at different times and a difference-in-differences approach, we find that the arrival of Airbnb is associated with a significant decrease in the rate at which city residents file residential noise complaints. Furthermore, we find that the decrease in noise complaints is intensified (i) in locations where more tourist attractions exist and (ii) when occupancy rates of rentals are lower. This suggests that the effect is driven by limited physical occupancy, via either tourist stays or unmet capacity. Our work contributes to broader scholarship by addressing the myth and merit of Airbnb disturbance and informing regulators who are considering the cumulative impact of home-sharing platforms on quality of life in urban areas.

We adopt a classical economical approach to modeling how utility-maximizing consumers select content pieces to view on a C2C media platform through a sequential inspection process and investigate how a platform in pursuit of market performance can devise an optimal policy on content length limit to induce desired viewer behaviors. First, we show that when content on the platform are longer, viewers set a higher standard of match value in selecting content to view, leading to a lower click-through rate of contributed content on the platform. This finding suggests that a tight limit on content length increases click-through rate. Second, we show that extended content length on the platform first enhances platform performance but then hurts its performance, following an inverted U-shape curve. This pattern holds true for short-term performance measured by viewer traffic and total viewing time, as well as for long-term performance measured by total consumer surplus. This finding suggests the existence of an optimal content length. Third, we find that the optimal content length that maximizes viewer traffic is smaller than that maximizes total viewing time, which is further smaller than that maximizes consumer surplus. As such, a platform that switches the strategic focus from short-term advertising revenue to long-term growth will benefit from extending content length limit.

  abstract     = {Despite the increasing interest in gamified systems and excitement about their potential positive impact on user engagement, a few studies have started to note gamification failures, which can result from user maladaptive behaviors, or behaviors directed at misappropriating gamified systems. In this research, we examine how such maladaptive behaviors can result from design issues of gamified systems and how such behaviors impact task performance. To date, little is known about design issues which may drive users to maladapt, and why they maladapt gamified systems. We systematically conceptualize gamified system maladaptive behaviors (GSMB) as having two dimensions: technology maladaptation and gamified task maladaptation. Based on goal-setting theory and self-determination theory, we develop a research model of GSMB. The model depicts three drivers of GSMB: game-task goals misalignment, game-task complexity, and gamification structure injustice, and how they fulfill or frustrate psychological innate needs (i.e., needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness), which in turn drive GSMB. We conducted two studies using different contexts. We tested the model with Study 1 empirically examining users of a gamified system, Pocket Points. With Study 2, we employed a within-subject experiment. By manipulating the design issues, we assessed the fulfillment of psychological needs induced by the gamified system. The results largely support our conceptualization of GSMB and the research model, highlighting the design issues as the main drivers of GSMB, and that the greater the GSMB, the greater the negative impact on task performance. Findings from this research have implications for both information systems research and gamification practices. History: Suprateek Sarker, Senior Editor; David (Jingjun) Xu, Associate Editor.

  abstract     = {Machine learning is commonly used to estimate the heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) in randomized experiments. Using large-scale randomized experiments on the Facebook and Criteo platforms, we observe substantial discrepancies between machine learning-based treatment effect estimates and difference-in-means estimates directly from the randomized experiment. This paper provides a two-step framework for practitioners and researchers to diagnose and rectify this discrepancy. We first introduce a diagnostic tool to assess whether bias exists in the model-based estimates from machine learning. If bias exists, we then offer a model-agnostic method to calibrate any HTE estimates to known, unbiased, subgroup difference-in-means estimates, ensuring that the sign and magnitude of the subgroup estimates approximate the model-free benchmarks. This calibration method requires no additional data and can be scaled for large data sets. To highlight potential sources of bias, we theoretically show that this bias can result from regularization and further use synthetic simulation to show biases result from misspecification and high-dimensional features. We demonstrate the efficacy of our calibration method using extensive synthetic simulations and two real-world randomized experiments. We further demonstrate the practical value of this calibration in three typical policy-making settings: a prescriptive, budget-constrained optimization framework; a setting seeking to maximize multiple performance indicators; and a multitreatment uplift modeling setting.

  abstract     = {Disasters usually induce sudden changes to the work and home environment with significant consequences for workers’ labor market outcomes (i.e., unemployment, work absence, and layoff). Prior literature suggests that female workers tend to be more affected by such changes (e.g., the limited availability of childcare and/or domestic services) as female workers often (or are expected to) shoulder more childcare and/or household responsibilities. As a result, disasters tend to affect female workers more because of their higher needs/preferences for flexibility and time to cope with the changes induced by disasters, leading to increased gender inequality during disasters. In such a case, telework adjustment has emerged as a silver lining by providing workers with more flexibility and helping them meet their needs/preferences. This paper investigates if there is any gender difference in telework adjustment as a response to the disaster and whether and to what extent telework adjustment can reduce the gender inequality induced by disasters, taking the COVID-19 disaster as an example. Our analysis shows that (1) comparing workers in the same industry and holding the same occupation, we find that female workers’ telework adjustment rate is more responsive to external constraints and is 7% higher than that of male workers. (2) Telework adjustment helps reduce gender inequality in labor market outcomes via two means: (i) the higher telework adjustment rate among female workers (which reduces gender inequality by 25.48%) and (ii) the stronger marginal effect of telework adjustment on female workers (which reduces gender inequality by 31.94%). (3) Better digital infrastructure can enhance the mitigating effect of telework adjustment. Our findings are robust to alternative measures of constraints or telework, which suggests the generalizability of our results to other disasters or disruptions that induce changes and increase workers’ needs/preferences for flexibility and time. Our study advances the literature on how information technologies can be leveraged to mitigate disaster-induced gender inequality in the labor market.

  abstract     = {Online brand communities often use social plug-in features, such as the Like button, to facilitate social interactions and engage users with the communities and brands. However, whether and how such a community feature affects the purchase decisions of users remain open questions. Leveraging the staggered adoption of the Like feature by users in an online brand community, we empirically investigate how the purchase behavior of users changes after the adoption of this feature. Surprisingly, we find that the order number and expenditure of an average user decrease by 4.1% and 25.0%, respectively, after the user starts to use this feature. Specifically, after the adoption of the Like feature, users’ order number and expenditure preeminently decrease by 3.4% and 21.1% online, respectively, and slightly decrease by 0.7% and 4.7% offline, respectively. The treatment effect of the adoption is not always negative but varies over time and across users. First, the Like feature adoption has a positive effect on users’ purchases in the first two months (primarily through enhancing their community participation), and the treatment effect turns negative in subsequent months, leading to the overall negative treatment effect on purchases. Second, the negative treatment effect likely stems from unflattering social comparison and can become weaker or even positive when users accrue more Likes from other users. However, only a small proportion of users receive sufficient Likes from other community users to be motivated to purchase more. We further conduct a scenario-based online experiment to corroborate our findings and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Our results caution against potential downsides of the Like feature in online communities and provide valuable managerial implications.

  abstract     = {Absorptive capacity, or the organizational capability to identify, assimilate, and apply new knowledge for commercial ends, is a key determinant of how organizations successfully generate value from external sources of knowledge and sustain a competitive advantage. Crowdworking—a novel form of digitally mediated work—allows organizations to hire on-demand highly skilled external experts to leverage their knowledge, skills, and networks. The approach of integrating crowdworking into organizations is increasingly gaining traction among large corporations seeking to harness the knowledge in external communities for value generation. Building on an in-depth embedded case study in a large organization that relies on two established crowdwork platforms, we explore how the organization developed its crowdworking-related absorptive capacity to generate value from external experts. We find that the crowdworking-related absorptive capacity phenomenon is a particular instance of expert-centric absorptive capacity that organizations develop by retaining on-demand external experts. We also find that this capacity can be developed through two idiosyncratic configurations of orchestrated and distributed routines that integrate external experts and utilize their knowledge in the host organization. These findings offer new insights into the prevailing modus operandi related to harnessing external knowledge in today’s organizations.

  abstract     = {Research studies have shown that recommender systems’ predictions that are observed by users can cause biases in users’ postconsumption preference ratings. This can happen as part of the standard, normal system use, where biases are typically caused by the system’s inherent prediction errors (i.e., because of the less-than-perfect accuracy of recommendation methods). Because users’ preference ratings are typically fed back to the system as training data for future predictions, this process is likely to influence the performance of the system in the long run. We use a simulation approach to study the longitudinal impact of preference biases (and their magnitude) on the dynamics of recommender systems’ performance. Our simulation results show that preference biases significantly impair the system’s prediction performance (i.e., prediction accuracy) as well as users’ consumption outcomes (i.e., consumption relevance and diversity) over time. The impact is nonlinear to the size of the bias, that is, large bias causes disproportionately large negative effects. Also, items that are less popular and less distinctive (in terms of their content) are affected more by preference biases. Furthermore, given the impact of preference bias on the recommender systems’ performance, we explore the problem of debiasing user-submitted ratings. We empirically demonstrate that relying solely on historical rating data is unlikely to be effective in debiasing. We also propose and evaluate two debiasing approaches that take into account additional relevant information that can be collected by recommendation platforms. Our findings provide important implications for the design of recommender systems. History: Olivia Liu Sheng, Senior Editor; Huimin Zhao, Associate Editor.

  abstract     = {Online gaming platforms are inevitably subject to system loopholes such as bugs. Some players may take advantage of these bugs to gain benefits illegitimately, being viewed as rule breakers by platforms. Online platforms face a dilemma between disciplining rule breakers with the risk of being perceived as unfair to the rule breakers—because rule breaches are, after all, caused by the game software’s technical glitches and belong to a “gray area”—and not disciplining rule breakers with the risk of being perceived as unfair to the observers. Different recovery measures may result in significantly different economic impacts. In this study, we use the unique field data of an online gaming platform to examine the effects of players’ rule-breach behavior due to system bugs and the platform’s different recovery measures on players’ subsequent engagement. Using various empirical models, we find that the occurrence of bugs negatively impacts the observing players’ in-game online duration and consumption. Surprisingly, although the platform is responsible for the bugs, not punishing rule breakers leads to even larger reductions in observing players’ platform engagement than punishing them. We thus suggest that the primary driver of the engagement reduction is the platform’s inappropriate recovery measure, rather than the bugs, and call online platforms’ attention to designing effective rules and recovery measures under the situation of a rule breach. Our findings enrich the literature and theories concerning the relationships between online platform loophole exploitation, associated recovery measures, and sustained user engagement.

  abstract     = {Employees’ precautionary security behaviors are vital to the effective protection of organizations from cybersecurity threats. Despite substantial security training efforts, employees frequently do not take security precautions. This study draws from trust theory and mindfulness theory to investigate how the bright- and dark-side effects of two conceptualizations of trust in organizational information security impact employees’ precaution taking. Insights drawn from a survey of 380 organizational employees suggest that employees who trust their organization’s security practices are more committed and less complacent in protecting their organization and more likely to take security precautions. In contrast, we find evidence of the dark-side effect of employees’ trust in organizational protective structures by showing that such trust can lead to complacency regarding security. Analyses indicate that security mindfulness mediates the influence of security complacency and security commitment on precaution taking. These results highlight the crucial roles of security commitment, security complacency, and security mindfulness in shaping employees’ precaution taking. This study contributes to information security research by providing empirical evidence concerning the simultaneous bright- and dark-side effects of employees’ trust in organizational information security, thereby creating valuable opportunities for researchers to theorize about the ways in which trusting beliefs shape employees’ security behaviors.

  abstract     = {Review spammers can harm the trustworthy environment of online platforms by purposefully posting unauthentic ratings and comments for products or online merchants, with the aim of gaining improper benefits. Although many methods have been proposed to resolve the spammer detection problem, several challenges, such as collusion recognition, label scarcity, and biased distributions, are still persistent and call for further investigation. Building on prevalent collusive spamming behaviors and the network homophily theory, we introduce a reviewer network to account for explicit coreview relations, and then, we propose a semisupervised probabilistic collaborative learning model to capture both reviewers’ individual behavioral features and the reviewer network. Our model features integrating partial label propagation with a pseudolabeling strategy and feature-based learning for reviewer network modeling, which is proved theoretically to be a weighted logistic regression on a network-derived synthetic data set. The rich parameters that characterize the importance of network information, the strength of network homophily, and the value of unlabeled data make our model more transparent. The empirical evaluations on two distinctive real-life data sets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our model and the significance of unlabeled data, in which the reviewer network after proper trimming demonstrates notable homophily effects and plays a vital role. In particular, the proposed model exhibits robustness against label scarcity and biased label distribution. History: Ahmed Abbasi, Senior Editor; Xiaobai Li, Associate Editor.

  abstract     = {Social trading is an emerging market in the sharing economy, allowing inexperienced investors (followers) to automatically follow the trades of experts (leaders) in real time. We use a separable temporal exponential random graph model to analyze the formation and dissolution of links in a large social trading network. In contrast to traditional social networks, social trading networks are characterized by the rapid dissolution of links, thereby increasing the importance of studying network dissolution. We investigate how social communication, along with financial performance and demographics, affects dynamic network evolution and address the existing dependence in the leader-follower links. The determinants of link formation and dissolution are asymmetric. Different types of social communication, such as posts and comments, have different implications for link formation and dissolution. Our results show that financial performance and demographic characteristics also become important determinants of link formation. However, once a link is formed, followers focus mainly on financial performance, in addition to social communication, and not on demographic characteristics. Thus, our findings have important implications for both investors and social trading platforms. History: Ram Gopal, Senior Editor; Martin Bichler, Associate Editor. Funding: M.

  abstract     = {We compare the career outcomes of MBA graduates with attractive and plain-looking faces. Our findings reveal that attractive MBA graduates have a higher probability of holding more desirable jobs compared with their plain-looking counterparts 15 years after obtaining their MBA degree, resulting in a 15-year attractiveness premium of 2.4%. This premium corresponds to an annual salary differential of $2,508. Additionally, we observed an “extreme” attractiveness premium of over 11% for the top 10% most attractive graduates, leading to a yearly salary differential of $5,528. Notably, this attractiveness premium is accumulated persistently over a decade. Moreover, the attractiveness premium is more pronounced among arts undergraduate graduates and those in managerial roles or the management industry, as opposed to those with IT backgrounds or working in technical jobs or the IT industry post-MBA. To achieve these results, we devised a robust methodological framework that combines custom machine learning (ML) models. These models generate a time series of an individual’s attractiveness by morphing a single profile picture and determine career success by ranking job titles based on revealed preferences in job transitions. Additionally, we employed a quasi-experiment design using propensity score matching to ensure the accuracy and reliability of our analysis.

  abstract     = {Emotion artificial intelligence (AI) or emotion recognition AI may systematically vary in its recognition of facial expressions and emotions across demographic groups, creating inconsistencies and disparities in its scoring. This paper explores the extent to which individuals can compensate for these disparities and inconsistencies in emotion AI considering two opposing factors; although humans evolved to recognize emotions, particularly happiness, they are also subject to cognitive biases, such as the anchoring effect. To help understand these dynamics, this study tasks three commercially available emotion AIs and a group of human labelers to identify emotions from faces in two image data sets. The scores generated by emotion AI and human labelers are examined for inference inconsistencies (i.e., misalignment between facial expression and emotion label). The human labelers are also provided with the emotion AI’s scores and with measures of its scoring fairness (or lack thereof). We observe that even when human labelers are operating in this context of information transparency, they may still rely on the emotion AI’s scores, perpetuating its inconsistencies. Several findings emerge from this study. First, the anchoring effect appears to be moderated by the type of inference inconsistency and is weaker for easier emotion recognition tasks. Second, when human labelers are provided with information transparency regarding the emotion AI’s fairness, the effect is not uniform across emotions. Also, there is no evidence that information transparency leads to the selective anchoring necessary to offset emotion AI disparities; in fact, some evidence suggests that information transparency increases human inference inconsistencies. Lastly, the different models of emotion AI are highly inconsistent in their scores, raising doubts about emotion AI more generally. Collectively, these findings provide evidence of the potential limitations of addressing algorithmic bias through individual decisions, even when those individuals are supported with information transparency.

  abstract     = {Millions of users on the Internet have fallen into phishing website traps. Detection tools are designed to warn users against such attacks but often fail to achieve this purpose due to usability issues. To address these issues and increase user self-protection against such attacks, we propose an ontology-based intelligent interface personalization (OBIIP) design for the warning interfaces of phishing website detection tools. Our design involves two phases: proof-of-concept and proof-of-value. The proof-of-concept phase consists of developing an ontology of warning interface elements (OWIE) based on the ontology approach in design science, expert feedback, and inputs from multiple populations through three rounds of surveys with 1,297 participants. OWIE is then used in the design and creation of an OBIIP prototype. The proof-of-value phase involves a controlled laboratory experiment (with 596 participants) to assess OBIIP’s value in terms of users’ self-protection performance as well as a posthoc online data collection (with 191 participants) and analysis to reveal the role of the design element categories in users’ trust and perceived personalization in OBIIP. The assessment results show the significant value of OBIIP in improving self-protection performance as well as the pervasive impact of OBIIP in improving users’ relationship with the security tool in terms of trust in and use of the tool. This work also identifies categories of design elements that matter in the OBIIP process. History: Suprateek Sarker, Senior Editor; David (Jingjun) Xu, Associate Editor.

  abstract     = {The digitalization of organizational settings can provide seemingly unprecedented visibility into knowledge work practices through trace data. Although trace data could be a boon for monitoring knowledge work that has traditionally eluded detailed oversight, the broader literature on data suggests that increasing behavioral visibility through trace data can also motivate reactions that reduce the transparency of work practices and question the validity of the data. To reconcile these contrasting views, we draw from performativity and conduct an in-depth case study of trace data production in a learning management and analytics system at an international business school. We find that once knowledge workers become aware of trace data in the system, they start to shape not only their own actions against the anticipated uses of the data but also the actions of their colleagues, subordinates, and even their students. We conceptualize the changes as first- and second-order prefiguration and discuss how prefigurative changes go beyond gaming, impression management, and transfiguration work discussed in the literature. Finally, we theorize configuration work as metawork that emerges from the need to pay constant attention to how knowledge work practices produce trace data and to keep aligning the practices with data-based monitoring. The results contribute to the literature by shedding light on when, how, and to what effect trace data from knowledge work are performed.

  abstract     = {Manipulative content and propaganda are an information quality concern on social media. Although attention has been turned toward mis- and disinformation, government-controlled social media pages have been able to quietly share information to encourage users toward beliefs without sharing content that may be clearly labeled as false. To combat the effect of quiet foreign government persuasion attempts, Facebook debuted a “state-controlled media” label in June 2020 to alert users that a post originates from a page associated with selected governments, including Russia and China. We conduct two online randomized experiments to better understand the causal impact of these labels on intentions to engage with content on Facebook. We augment our experiments by analyzing field data from Facebook before and after these labels were implemented and studying actual engagement. We find that labels are effective in reducing engagement on social media if users notice the labels and if the label is associated with a country that is perceived negatively. More users notice the label if trained. The combination of these studies suggests that these labels can successfully reduce engagement with posts by Russian and Chinese state-controlled pages but may even increase engagement for other countries perceived positively like Canada.

  abstract     = {Although the effects of algorithmic product recommendations on product sales are understood, the differential effects of retargeted recommendations (recommended products a user has previously viewed) versus generic recommendations (recommended products a user has not previously viewed) are unclear. We conduct a field experiment to empirically examine the relative effect of retargeted versus generic recommendations on product sales at different stages of users’ purchase funnel. The product recommendations can affect sales by influencing the number of product impressions and their conversion rates (purchase probability conditional on impression). We separately estimate the effect of retargeted and generic recommendations on product impressions and conversion rates. We find that (i) generic recommendations increase conversion rates only in the early purchase funnel stage, but retargeted recommendations do not affect conversion rates, and (ii) both recommendations result in a higher number of impressions of recommended products. Overall, retargeted (generic) recommendations result in higher recommended and total product sales in the late (early) purchase funnel stage. We also conducted a controlled experiment on Amazon MTurk to unveil that retargeting (showing previously viewed products to users) drives the effect of retargeted recommendations. Our counterfactual simulations show that the retailer can obtain up to three percent higher product sales by applying our findings to the existing recommendation systems. Our research has implications for online retailers and the design of algorithmic product recommendation systems. History: Param Singh, Senior Editor; Idris Adjerid, Associate Editor.

  abstract     = {Recommender systems are widely used by online merchants to find the products that are likely to interest consumers, but existing dynamic methods still face challenges regarding diverse behaviors, variability in interest shifts, and the identification of psychological dynamics. Premised on the marketing funnel perspective to analyze consumer shopping journeys, this study proposes a novel machine learning approach for product recommendation, namely, multistage dynamic Bayesian network (MS-DBN), to model the generative processes of consumers’ interactive behaviors with products in light of stage transitions and interest shifts. This approach features a dynamic Bayesian network model to overcome the problem of diverse behaviors and extract generalizable regularity of consumers’ psychological dynamics, two latent layers to depict variability in consumers’ interest shifts across multiple stages, and the identification strategies that dynamically detect the invisible stages and interests of consumers. Extensive experiments on large-scale real-world data and comprehensive robustness checks manifest the superior performance of the proposed MS-DBN approach over baseline methods.

  abstract     = {Many e-commerce platforms have launched reviewer incentive programs, in which the platforms send free samples to experienced reviewers in exchange for feedback on the samples. This study focuses on an unexplored aspect of this practice: the impact of free samples on reviewers’ ratings of subsequently purchased products (i.e., regular ratings). We theorize that free samples can increase regular ratings through two mechanisms: uncertainty reduction and reciprocity . We collect observational data from Amazon.com and find that after beginning to receive free samples from a platform-initiated reviewer incentive program (i.e., Vine ), reviewers’ regular ratings increased by 2.25% on average (i.e., 0.093 more stars on the five-star scale). Our follow-up analyses at a granular product-category level reveal that the increase in regular ratings occurs primarily for purchased products that share common attributes with free samples that reviewer has received previously. To further delve into the mechanisms at work, we conduct a randomized controlled experiment in which participants are asked to purchase one cookie among three flavor options. Before the cookie purchase, participants either receive nothing in advance (i.e., control group) or receive one of four free samples (i.e., four treatment groups). The results indicate that uncertainty reduction (via the common attribute between the free sample and the options for purchase) significantly mediates the impact of the free sample on the ratings of the purchased cookie. We conclude that platform-initiated free samples can help consumers understand products with similar attributes, thereby reducing prepurchase uncertainty and leading to higher regular ratings. We discuss the managerial and scholarly implications of the findings. History: Ravi Bapna, Senior Editor; Zhenhui (Jack) Jiang, Associate Editor.

  abstract     = {We consider districts that invest in critical IT infrastructure, which spill over to other districts. IT infrastructure is considered critical if its disruption can cause significant damage to security, the economy, public health, or safety. Districts choose whether to participate in a coalition noncooperatively, and the coalition subsequently makes resource investment decisions cooperatively. Districts “inside” the coalition have superior interoperability in the spillovers relative to “outside” districts. Inside districts also benefit from a coalition economy of scale and a discounted resource investment cost, and they face diseconomies of scope in the number of coalition members and their investment levels. Coalition structures include grand, partial (varying in size), minimal (two members), and singleton, and we consider the formation of only one coalition. We find that inside districts’ resource levels decrease with coalition size. Even with homogeneous districts, any size coalition can be an equilibrium depending on the coalition economy of scale and the relative interoperability of resources in inside versus outside districts. The equilibrium coalition size is increasing in the economy of scale and decreasing in relative interoperability. Similarly, any size coalition can be socially optimal depending on the coalition economy of scale and relative interoperability. The socially optimal coalition size is also increasing in the economy of scale and decreasing in relative interoperability. In most cases, the socially optimal coalition size is larger than the equilibrium coalition. A subsidy or tax can incentivize the equilibrium coalition size and district resource levels to be socially optimal, providing a general solution to the provisioning of critical IT infrastructure. We use the European Union’s Digital COVID Certificate program providing vaccine status information and the U.S. Government’s Direct Project that supports the establishment of nationwide health information exchanges to illustrate elements of our model.

  abstract     = {Digital platforms facilitate the flow of information and the execution of transactions. This study investigates the impact of signals from platform-provided online information regarding search and experience attributes of products on the prices of their offline transactions. We situate our theorizing and empirical work in the context of digital real estate platforms. Our results suggest that online information pertaining to properties’ experience attributes has a significant influence on the prices of offline property transactions. The amount of online information relating to experience attributes—specifically, length of textual property description and the number of photos—positively influences the sale price of a property. In contrast, the amount of online property information related to search attributes—specifically, facts and features—has no significant influence on the property’s sale price. In addition, online property information on experience attributes has a significant impact on the sale price of uncommon properties (those valued significantly above or below their neighborhood averages), whereas its impact on the price of common properties (those valued close to their neighborhood averages) is insignificant. The findings are robust to various model specifications and across property transactions in different years, seasons, and geographical regions. They are also neither subject to confounding effect of real estate agents’ service quality nor driven by unobserved property heterogeneities. The findings shed light on how signals from online property information are used by home buyers and sellers for different types of properties. The insights have implications for how real estate professionals can better utilize digital platforms to convey signals regarding properties and facilitate property transactions and for how the platforms can be designed to support the exchange of information that provides signals on the quality of offline goods that are highly risky and experiential.

  abstract     = {We develop a parametric model that investigates the development trajectories of blockchain platforms, accounting for the feedback between blockchains’ utility change and people’s adoption and abandonment behavior. A typical blockchain participant is considered to simultaneously play three roles on the platform, user, investor, and laborer, each contributing a unique element to blockchains’ multifaceted utility. The model predicts a three-phase development trajectory for blockchain platforms: a chaotic initial stage, a rapid growth stage, and a mature stage of stable market cycles. The roles have different functions at different developmental stages, and their interactions determine phase transitions. The model was used to match 112 token price series, demonstrating robust performance across different fitting setups and outperforming existing models. The study identifies two temporal parameters—the time delay in quitting the platform and the holding time of the platform’s token—that significantly differentiate blockchains’ development trajectories. We also extend the model to study forking events, finding that fork launch time is more important than forking amplitude in influencing the main chain’s subsequent development and that forking can increase the exposure of the forked platform.

  abstract     = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to an increase in cases of racial discrimination against Asians, especially Chinese people. Despite an emerging stream of studies investigating various aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic, research on the behavioral consequences of racial discrimination during the pandemic remains scarce. In this work, we examined how racial discrimination stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent anti-discrimination were manifested on online platforms. By combining difference-in-differences analyses on two large-scale panel data sets from Yelp.com and SafeGraph and two controlled experiments, we explored the impact of COVID-19 on Chinese restaurants relative to non-Chinese restaurants at different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that the COVID-19 pandemic led to an immediate increase in racial discrimination, which was reflected in a significant drop in the customer patronage frequency of Chinese restaurants as compared with that of non-Chinese restaurants. Furthermore, analyses using multiple behavioral indicators generated by text mining and machine learning techniques consistently suggested that increased discrimination triggered anti-discrimination actions of customers on online platforms after the COVID-19 outbreak. This study contributes to the literature on racial discrimination by investigating a subtle but more factual form of racial discrimination evidenced by the customer patronage of Chinese restaurants as well as user-generated content by demonstrating that consumers can fight discrimination on online platforms.

  abstract     = {Variety seekers are those customers who easily get bored with the products they purchased before and, therefore, prefer new and fresh content to expand their horizons. Despite its prevalence, variety-seeking behavior is hardly studied in recommendation applications because of various limitations in existing variety-seeking measures. To fill the research gap, we present a variety-seeking framework in this paper to measure the level of variety-seeking behavior of customers in recommendations based on their consumption records. We validate the effectiveness of our framework through user questionnaire studies conducted at Alibaba, where our variety-seeking measures match well with consumers’ self-reported levels of their variety-seeking behaviors. Furthermore, we present a recommendation framework that combines the identified variety-seeking levels with unexpected recommender systems in the data mining literature to address consumers’ heterogenous desire for product variety, in which we provide more unexpected product recommendations to variety-seeking consumers and vice versa. Through off-line experiments on three different recommendation scenarios and a large-scale online controlled experiment at a major video-streaming platform, we demonstrate that those models following our recommendation framework significantly increase various business performance metrics and generate tangible economic impact for the company. Our findings lead to important managerial implications to better understand consumers’ variety-seeking behaviors and design recommender systems. As a result, the best-performing model in our proposed frameworks has been deployed by the company to serve all consumers on the video-streaming platform.

  abstract     = {Financial regulators often focus on containing risks in financial services; however, they may not simultaneously pay adequate attention to regulation’s adverse effects. This study examines how the economic development of borrowers was affected by China’s suppressive regulation of peer-to-peer (P2P) lending in 2018, which unexpectedly switched from an “all-in” policy to an “all-shutdown” policy, leading to a massive closure of P2P lending companies and the eventual shutdown of the entire industry by 2021. Leveraging data on individuals’ credit applications, we show that this one-size-fits-all regulation obstructed borrowers’ economic development potential, especially for underprivileged and underserved borrowers, as reflected by their credit scores and their selection of financial channels. To alleviate the unintended adverse effects, we advocate using artificial intelligence (AI) to stipulate personalized regulation as a PolicyTech solution. We demonstrate that by restricting some borrowers’ access to P2P lending according to their AI-predicted financial risk, it is possible to protect borrowers’ overall economic development opportunity, while containing credit risks. This work yields significant theoretical and societal implications. History: Olivia Sheng, Senior Editor; Huaxia Rui, Associate Editor.

  abstract     = {Boosted by greater demand for convenience and then turbocharged by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, online food delivery (OFD) has witnessed rapid growth over the past several years. Despite such growth, however, it is still unclear how incentives and payoffs of various parties are affected by the three-sidedness of the OFD market, which involves consumers, restaurants, and gig drivers—beyond the traditional two-sided setting. In this paper, we study the OFD platforms’ optimal choices in a competitive setting where the platforms compete on both prices and service quality. Our analysis shows that conventional insights from two-sided platforms do not completely carry over to OFD markets. Specifically, we find that the three-sidedness may either soften or intensify the price competition in the buyer-seller market, consequently altering the subsidizing conditions of OFD platforms. Although two-sided platforms generally get hurt by network effects because of the pressure to induce participation, OFD platforms are able to mitigate such negative impact by flexibly adjusting their service strategies. Yet, OFD platforms may not always be better off by introducing gig labor because additional leverage for competing platforms could lead to a prisoner’s dilemma situation. We show further how the platforms’ pricing and service strategies critically depend on the strength of network effects. With the rising of the gig economy, the question of employment status for gig workers has become an increasingly controversial issue in the United States and elsewhere. We address this by showing that the introduction of minimum wage regulation, although benefiting the gig drivers, may be welfare diminishing to society at large. Our results can thus provide guidance to policy makers seeking a compromise between the interests of gig workers and society as a whole.

  abstract     = {To reduce the availability of hacking tools for use in cybersecurity offenses, many countries have enacted computer misuse acts (CMAs) that criminalize the production, distribution, and possession of such tools with criminal intent. However, the dual-use nature of cybersecurity technology complicates the legal process of recognizing such computer misuse tools and of predicting harmful intent based on mere possession. This predicament introduces the possibility of unfounded prosecution that may produce a chilling effect on the provision of techniques otherwise valuable in maintaining cybersecurity and defending against hackers. This study establishes a theoretical foundation for the potentially chilling effect of such legal enforcement by adopting theories about choice under uncertainty. Leveraging an external shock in publicly accessible online hack forums, we examined the impact of CMA enforcement on users’ contributions to cybersecurity-relevant topics that are not targeted by the law. We found that CMA enforcement reduces the quantity and the extent of relevance to cybersecurity in discussions in hack forums. We further identified the mechanisms of this chilling effect by delving into users’ heterogeneity in responding to the uncertainty of false prosecution imposed by CMA enforcement as well as users’ proactivity undertaken to alleviate such uncertainty. Our study reveals this chilling effect is not just about restraining individuals from lawful acts but also about how they refrain from acts not intended as targets of the law.

  abstract     = {Many organizations have adopted internet monitoring to regulate employees’ cyberloafing behavior. Although one might intuitively assume that internet monitoring can be effective in reducing cyberloafing, there is a lack of research examining why the effect can occur and whether it can be sustained. Furthermore, little research has investigated whether internet monitoring can concurrently induce any side effects in employee behavior. In this paper, we conducted a longitudinal field quasi-experiment to examine the impacts of internet monitoring on employees’ cyberloafing and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). Our results show that internet monitoring did reduce employees’ cyberloafing by augmenting employees’ perceived sanction concerns and information privacy concerns related to cyberloafing. The results also show that internet monitoring could produce the side effect of reducing employees’ OCB. Interestingly, when examining the longitudinal effects of internet monitoring four months after its implementation, we found that the effect of internet monitoring on cyberloafing was not sustained, but the effect on OCB toward organizations still persisted. Our study advances the literature on deterrence theory by empirically investigating both the intended and side effects of deterrence and how the effects change over time. It also has important broader implications for practitioners who design and implement information systems to regulate employee noncompliance behavior.

  abstract     = {With growing popularity of e-commerce, nearly every prominent retailer is aiming to turn omni-channel. One crucial decision in this pursuit is the identification of the joint assortment. Despite the importance of this decision, few studies have addressed this issue. In this study, we contribute by examining joint assortment and product prices for a retailer that sells products through both brick-and-mortar and online channels using the locational choice model. We consider two classes of customers such that customers in one class prefer the brick-and-mortar channel and customers in the other class prefer the online channel. Our analysis indicates that the optimal assortment should be thought of as a portfolio of two types of products: customized and omni-channel. Customized products are priced in such a way that they are targeted toward customers who prefer to shop from the channel the products are sold through. In contrast, omni-channel products are priced attractively so that all customers consider buying them. The relative mix of these products depends on how flexible customers are in shopping from the channel they do not prefer and the size of each class. Additionally, we investigate whether the conventional wisdom of selling niche products through the online channel is always optimal. We find that this suggestion may be suboptimal when the online channel has greater cost of including a product in the assortment and fewer preferring customers compared with the brick-and-mortar channel. We also develop insights on price selection. As more and more retailers are converting from single-channel to omni-channel, they need to reexamine their assortment strategy across existing and new channels. The models, results, and insights presented in this paper would help them in designing a joint assortment policy across channels. History: Ram Gopal, Senior Editor; Jianqing Chen, Associate Editor.

  abstract     = {We examine the coopetition relationship between a ride-sharing platform and a car-rental firm. A distinctive aspect of this coopetition relationship is that they operate under two different business models. The platform, exploiting information technology (IT) capabilities, controls its demand and supply sides by setting rider price and driver wage in real time based on demand and supply conditions. In contrast, the car-rental firm operates under the traditional model with a fixed supply and cost structure. Both the IT-driven platform and the car-rental firm compete for riders seeking for transportation. If the two engage in coopetition, they cooperate to allow a (secondary) driver to rent from the rental firm and drive for the platform. In the absence of coopetition, only those with their own vehicles (i.e., primary drivers) are allowed to drive for the platform. We show that such supply-side (i.e., driver-side) cooperation intensifies the demand-side (i.e., rider-side) price competition and decreases total revenue. Therefore, coopetition is mutually beneficial only when it leads to a significant decrease in the supply, or driver, cost. Moreover, when coopetition is mutually beneficial, the benefit arises solely because of the improved profit margin from riders who switch from the rental firm to the platform and from those who are switched from primary to secondary drivers. We find that the platform and the rental firm are likely to form a coopetition relationship when the total rider market size is not high, the degree of rider substitutability between the platform and the rental firm is low, or the platform has a significant market-size advantage over the rental firm. Coopetition between the platform and the rental firm benefits riders and hurts drivers, but benefits society overall. The incentive to form the coopetition relationship is enhanced if cross-side network effects are present on the platform or if each player serves a loyal rider segment in addition to the competitive rider segment that considers the two as substitutes.

  abstract     = {Many online communities that rely on effortful, voluntary content contributions offer additional content curation tools to facilitate social interactions and encourage user contributions. Any platform that offers two or more heterogeneous content types (e.g., expert knowledge and social posts) faces a choice about the presentation format: whether to display the content types separately or in an integrated information feed. We leverage a natural experiment on Zhihu, a Q&amp;A platform that offers a social-interaction-oriented functionality called Ideas . Zhihu initially presented answers (expert knowledge content) and ideas (social posts) in two different information feeds, but the platform integrated ideas into the same information feed as answers in June 2019. We find that information feed integration significantly decreased user engagement with and contribution of both ideas and answers . We hypothesize that users decreased their engagement because the juxtaposition of incongruous types of content increased mindset switching and cognitive strain. This hypothesis is supported by an additional laboratory experiment. We also present evidence showing that contributions decreased both because of the decrease in engagement (weaker social recognition incentives) and because integration heightened concerns that posting ideas would dilute the contributor’s professional image. Our findings have important theoretical and practical implications for any platform that hosts heterogeneous content.

We consider a quasinatural experiment: states’ entry into the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact, wherein the entry events facilitate healthcare providers to adopt telehealth technology. By analyzing a representative sample of providers, we first establish the Compact entry shock’s validity and its positive effect on the supply of medical services. We then report evidence that there are service and payment shifts from rural providers to urban providers (i.e., urban providers are more likely to benefit from the Compact entry financially). Relying on patients’ telehealth reimbursement claim data, we observe two mechanisms contributing to the revenue redistribution: the substitution and gateway effects of telehealth. Finally, we show that telehealth readiness and service quality moderate the impact of telehealth adoption. These findings speak to both potentially positive and negative consequences for welfare.

Using a leads-and-lags difference-in-differences model, we find that entry of an online food delivery platform significantly increased the female employment rate in the three years following the platform’s entry, and the results still hold after excluding employment in the food and beverage sector. Our further analyses show that such digital platforms offered a pathway for women to break free from traditional household roles, thus granting them more time and the opportunity to decide whether to join the labor market or stay at home. We examine the positive externalities generated by the online food delivery platform and find that this new technology-induced female employment accounted for 0.27% of South Korea’s GDP, or 17 times the platform’s direct revenue.

  abstract     = {Review-in-review (RIR) is a feature that allows viewers to generate positive or negative evaluations for primary quality evaluations of a product (e.g., ratings and reviews). This feature has the potential to reshape primary quality evaluations; specifically, it can cause social desirability bias in ratings, as raters (i.e., reviewers) who desire social recognition might be driven to provide ratings that are expected to gain more “helpful” and avoid unhelpful RIRs. This study aims to isolate this bias. Specifically, we develop and estimate a partially ordinal discrete choice model that allows rating responses to reflect a mixture of a conditional multinomial discrete choice model that captures the RIR-induced social desirability incentive and an ordinal discrete choice model that reflects the baseline incentive of quality perception. From the estimation results, we find evidence that individuals rate, in part, to satisfy social desirability, designing the rating to be more helpful, less unhelpful, and generate more text replies. This suggests a social desirability bias in ratings attributable to the expected RIRs. The raters, on average, attribute approximately 7.4% of the rating likelihood to the social desirability incentive, but the attribution varies across individuals, depending on their social characteristics. We further conduct various simulations under counterfactual RIR system designs to present the social desirability bias in ratings caused by each system and provide guidance on how to design an RIR system to alleviate such bias. Our robustness check suggests the presence of RIR-induced social desirability bias in the sentiment of the review. History: Ravi Bapna, Senior Editor; Sunil Wattal, Associate Editor.

Through a field experiment that each participant experience different weather conditions in two different treatment periods under the gain or loss interventions, we found that the effects of gain or loss interventions across sunny and cloudy weather are not uniformly distributed. Loss intervention induces higher levels of fulfillment of exercise goals than gain intervention in sunny weather, whereas gain interventions are more effective than loss interventions in cloudy weather. We also provided empirical evidence to uncover the underlying mechanisms and rules out alternative explanations. The follow-up experiment reveals that weather-based intervention can be used repeatedly over time without losing its effectiveness. Moreover, our result suggests that the observed effect is more evident for people with a lower exercise level and living in areas of lower income.

  abstract     = {The growing online retail market has led to the prevalence of multichannel retailing. Meanwhile, retailers are increasingly combining multichannel retailing with a multibranding strategy. Although this can further increase the retailer’s sales, it brings new advertising challenges. Multibrand, multichannel retailers usually launch advertising campaigns for different brands on multiple media. Thus, the retailer’s advertising efforts fall into a set of brand-media units. Each unit’s advertising efforts can affect the sales of all brands on all channels. Therefore, retailers need to coordinate the advertising efforts of different units to maximize advertising efficiency in propelling sales. So far, the optimization problem of multibrand, multimedia advertising has not been analyzed in the literature, and our study aims to bridge this gap. We develop a stochastic differential equation model to estimate the impact of multimedia advertising on sales in a multibrand, multichannel context. Using the data from a jewelry retailer in the United States, we show that our model is effective in predicting future sales driven by advertising. Afterward, we formulate the advertising optimization problems under four coordination strategies: (i) noncoordination, (ii) brand coordination, (iii) media coordination, and (iv) global coordination. By solving the problem for each strategy, the retailers can obtain the optimal expenditure for each unit under that strategy. Finally, we compare the retailer’s profits under four strategies. Interestingly, we find that brand or media coordination may result in a profit lower than noncoordination. Our findings provide insights regarding the selection of coordination strategies for multibrand, multichannel retailers with multimedia advertising campaigns, especially when they cannot do global coordination.

  abstract     = {Although information technology (IT) is increasingly replacing human labor, the IT-labor relationship is more nuanced than it appears. We examine the IT-labor relationship in terms of various levels of education, intensities of routine tasks, and exposure to artificial intelligence (AI). Making use of an industry-level data set covering 60 U.S. industries from 1998 to 2013, we adopt an innovative measure of elasticity of substitution that enables us to capture the asymmetric price impact between IT and labor. Our findings indicate that IT generally complements high-education labor (master’s degree or above), while substituting for low-education labor (high school degree or below). For middle-education labor (bachelor’s or associate’s degree), however, the IT-labor relationship is more nuanced: They are complements in non-routine-intensive industries, but substitutes in routine-intensive industries. We also find that IT is a complement (substitute) with high-education labor in industries with lower (higher) AI exposure and remains a net substitute for low- and middle-education labor, regardless of their AI exposure. Our findings suggest that even college-educated labor has now become susceptible to IT displacement, whereas labor with graduate education largely remains a strong complement to IT (with an exception in high-AI-exposure industries).

  abstract     = {We develop a framework to measure the value of free goods and services available on the internet. The conventional method of measuring consumer surplus based on monetary expenditures is ineffective because these goods’ prices are predominantly zero. Our proposed method addresses this challenge by quantifying the economic value of the time that consumers devote to consuming these free goods. Using data on consumers’ time and monetary expenditures, we calibrate an economic model of the allocation of individuals’ time among internet, television, leisure, and work. We measure the consumer surplus of free goods on the internet as the reduction in gross domestic product (GDP) required to create an equivalent welfare loss to that which would occur if these free goods were no longer available. We find that the average incremental welfare gain from the internet between 2002 and 2011 was about $38 billion per year in the United States, equivalent to approximately 0.29% of the annual GDP. In contrast, if we had not considered the value of time, then the estimated annual incremental welfare gain would have been significantly smaller at about $2.7 billion, only 7% of the estimate derived from our proposed time-based model. Our approach can be readily extended to the valuation of other zero-priced goods and services, such as television. In addition, our results show the importance of not only quantity but also quality (e.g., internet speed) in determining the welfare contributions of free goods.

  abstract     = {The rising diffusion of information systems (IS) throughout society poses an increasingly serious threat to privacy as a social value. One approach to alleviating this threat is to establish transparency of information privacy practices (TIPP) so that consumers can better understand how their information is processed. However, the design of transparency artifacts (e.g., privacy notices) has clearly not followed this approach, given the ever-increasing volume of information processing. Hence, consumers face a situation where they cannot see the “forest for the trees” when aiming to ascertain whether information processing meets their privacy expectations. A key problem is that overly comprehensive information presentation results in information overload and is thus counterproductive for establishing TIPP. We depart from the extant design logic of transparency artifacts and develop a theoretical foundation (TIPP theory) for transparency artifact designs useful for establishing TIPP from the perspective of privacy as a social value. We present TIPP theory in two parts to capture the sociotechnical interplay. The first part translates abstract knowledge on the IS artifact and privacy into a description of social subsystems of transparency artifacts, and the second part conveys prescriptive design knowledge in form of a corresponding IS design theory. TIPP theory establishes a bridge from the complexity of the privacy concept to a metadesign for transparency artifacts that is useful to establish TIPP in any IS. In essence, transparency artifacts must accomplish more than offering comprehensive information; they must also be adaptive to the current information needs of consumers.

While much of the current debate focuses on disclosing the nonhuman identity of AI-based technologies (e.g., chatbots), the question of whether to also disclose the involvement of human employees working behind the scenes has received little attention. We address this gap by examining how such a disclosure affects customer interactions with a hybrid service agent consisting of an AI-based chatbot and human employees. Results from a randomized field experiment and a controlled online experiment show that disclosing human involvement before or during an interaction with the hybrid service agent leads customers to adopt a more human-oriented communication style. This effect is driven by impression management concerns that are activated when customers become aware of humans working in tandem with the chatbot. The more human-oriented communication style ultimately increases employee workload because fewer customer requests can be handled automatically by the chatbot and must be delegated to a human. These findings provide novel insights into how and why disclosing human involvement affects customer communication behavior, shed light on its negative consequences for employees working in tandem with a chatbot, and help managers understand the potential costs and benefits of providing transparency in customer–hybrid service agent interactions.

  abstract     = {The terms theory and theoretical contributions evoke mixed reactions in the information systems discipline, especially among empirical researchers in the economics of information systems (Econ-IS) area. Although some see such contributions as the raison d’etre for academic scholars engaged in research, others feel that the discipline has developed a fetish for theory, with reviewers and editors often demanding an unreasonable level of theoretical contributions for empirical manuscripts to succeed in the review process. Moreover, there exists a great deal of diversity in the conception of what constitutes a reasonable theoretical contribution, especially within empirical work, across editors and reviewers, leading to frustration with the review process and disappointment with editorial decisions. Given the different types of theoretical contributions that may be suitable for a given manuscript and recognizing the changing nature of empirical work within Econ-IS, we attempt to shed some light on theoretical contributions within empirical Econ-IS research, paying attention to their nature, types, and impact. Specifically, we start by reflecting on the typical theory-related comments we have seen in review packets that we generalize to a set of critiques often related to empirical papers. Subsequently, we provide a working definition of a theoretical contribution and the components that make up such a contribution. We then propose a taxonomy of theoretical contributions typically observed in Information Systems Research ( ISR ). Based on this taxonomy of contributions, the typical critiques observed in empirical Econ-IS papers, and a set of published papers, we provide some broad guidelines for how authors may craft an effective theoretical contribution for submission to ISR . We also discuss a pathway for manuscripts that do not (seek to) offer significant theoretical contributions. Such manuscripts are welcome, but we believe that a very high bar of practical impact must be met for them to succeed in the review process. Based on the guidelines and suggestions made here, our hope is that authors and evaluators will participate in the review process with a shared understanding of the elusive notion of theoretical contributions.},

  abstract     = {In today’s world, where online information is proliferating in an unprecedented way, a significant challenge is whether to believe the information we encounter. Ironically, this flood of information provides us with an opportunity to combat false claims by understanding their nature. That is, with the help of machine learning, it is now possible to effectively capture the characteristics of false information by analyzing massive amounts of false claims published online. These methods, however, have neglected the nature of human argumentation, delegating the process of making inferences of the truth to the black box of neural networks. This has created several challenges (namely latent text representations containing entangled syntactic and semantic information, an irrelevant part of text being considered when abstracting text as a latent vector, and counterintuitive model explanation). To resolve these issues, based on Toulmin’s model of argumentation, we propose a computational framework that helps machine learning for false information identification (FII) understand the connection between a claim (whose veracity needs to be verified) and evidence (which contains information to support or refute the claim). Specifically, we first build a word network of a claim and evidence reflecting their syntaxes and convert it into a signed word network using their semantics. The structural balance of this word network is then calculated as a proxy metric to determine the consistency between a claim and evidence. The consistency level is fed into machine learning as input, providing information for verifying claim veracity and explaining the model’s decision making. The two experiments for testing model performance and explainability reveal that our framework shows stronger performance and better explainability, outperforming cutting-edge methods and presenting positive effects on human task performance, trust in algorithms, and confidence in decision making. Our results shed new light on the growing field of automated FII. History: Ahmed Abbasi, Senior Editor; Xiaobai Li, Associate Editor.

The multipurposing of SEVs beyond the traditional scope of mobility services can boost utilization and profitability for fleet operators while also facilitating the integration of variable rate renewable energy sources. This SEV setting embodies the problem of real-time multiproduct resource allocation via smart markets. We develop an approach that leverages highly digitalized real-time markets and intelligent decision making to enable dynamic multiproduct resource allocation. The tool continuously evaluates market attractiveness and strategically places iterative bids on the resource owner’s behalf until all resources have been committed for a specific period. Our key contributions are to provide a blueprint for similar multiproduct resource allocation settings and show its efficacy in the domain of SEV fleets by developing tailored analytics and machine learning-based solutions.

  abstract     = {The recent years have witnessed a tremendous increase in Internet advertising, especially location-based advertising on mobile devices. At the same time, search-driven and display advertising on more traditional media such as personal computers continues to be strong. This study examines the interaction between top-of-funnel advertising (e.g., search or display advertising) and bottom-of-funnel advertising (e.g., using a mobile application on a smart phone). We are particularly interested in the phenomenon of geoconquesting : the bottom-of-funnel advertising efforts of a firm to poach (or lure away) customers that have come to a competing firm’s physical store as a result of top-of-funnel advertising efforts by the firm. Geoconquesting efforts by a competing firm should reduce a focal firm’s incentive to invest in top-of-funnel efforts. Thus, a key challenge for an agent like Google that provides both top-of-funnel and bottom-of-funnel advertising services is to balance the inherent conflict between the two to maximize the total revenue collected from the two forms of advertising. We develop a game-theoretic model for this phenomenon. The model is from the perspective of an advertising agent that wishes to maximize the revenue earned from both kinds of advertising services, under the absence or the presence of an outside option that can be used by advertisers to obtain geoconquesting services. A key result is that sometimes the agent benefits from not offering geoconquesting, but instead promises, after collecting a fee, to protect the advertisers from poaching on each other’s search traffic. Interestingly, such a protection service becomes more lucrative for the agent when a cheaper outside option for geoconquesting is available to the advertisers.

  abstract     = {Although the impacts of helpful online reviews on customers’ purchase decisions and product sales have been widely investigated, review helpfulness has been commonly measured relying on quantitative indicators at the review level. Helpful reviews qualified by such simple indicators, however, may not necessarily yield accurate sales predictions, owing to the ever-evolving review information quality, customer demand, and product attributes. Positing that reviews with higher customer attention should be more influential to customers’ purchase intention and product sales, we propose to leverage customer attention to better realize the potential of multimodal reviews for sales prediction. We conceptualize customer attention at the holistic review set, review subset, individual review, and review element levels, respectively, and induce four indicators of customer attention, that is, timeliness, semantic diversity, voting awareness, and varying multimodal interaction. We then propose a deep learning method, which incorporates these customer attention indicators using neural network attention mechanisms specifically designed for multimodal review–based sales prediction. Empirical evaluation based on a large data set in a case study predicting hotel sales (specifically, monthly occupancy rate) shows that, in terms of both prediction performance and representation learning performance, our proposed method outperformed benchmarked state-of-the-art deep learning methods.

  abstract     = {The rapid growth in the adoption of mobile payments has already begun to reshape bank payment practices. Utilizing a unique data set from a leading bank in Asia that records credit card transactions of its customers before and after the launch of Alipay mobile payment, the largest mobile payment platform in the world, this study aims to understand the impact of mobile payment adoption on bank customer credit card activities and the change of this impact after the mobile payment expansion. To do so, we employ the difference-in-differences method coupled with matching to estimate the effects. We find that mobile payment adoption not only increases customer credit card activities at the focal bank through both off-line and online channels, but also enhances customer loyalty to the bank by reducing churn. Specifically, the total credit card transaction amount and frequency of our focal bank increased by 9.4% and 10.7%, respectively. Moreover, we examine the change in the treatment effect after the mobile payment expansion and find an increase in adopters’ credit card activities and a reduction in their churn after the expansion. Next, we discuss the underlying mechanisms and show that mobile payment acts as a substitute for physical card payment in the off-line channel, and this supports the key underlying mechanism of the reduced transaction cost. However, a certain complementary effect exists between personal computer and mobile payments, likely driven by the coadoption of the two. Finally, we provide empirical evidence on conditions that facilitate the use of mobile payments, following the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology.

  abstract     = {Many companies use real-time feedback applications to increase employee engagement with their performance evaluation programs and disseminate the results. Yet beyond giving and receiving employee feedback, important dynamics such as feedback-seeking behavior and feedback rating are not well addressed in the literature. To fill this gap, we examine employee behavior related to two dimensions of real-time feedback: (i) seeking performance feedback from supervisors, peers, and direct reports and (ii) evaluating the helpfulness of received performance feedback. Specifically, we examine the effects of feedback-seeking and rate-the-feedback behaviors on in-kind evaluations. After analyzing nearly 11,000 feedback instances from employees at four major organizations that use real-time performance feedback applications, we find that seeking feedback enhances constructive communication among colleagues. We show that feedback receivers who sought feedback receive lower feedback scores, have a higher likelihood of receiving comments, and receive longer, more positive, and more subjective comments. Feedback givers who opt not to provide comments or opt to provide shorter comments to feedback seekers choose to provide feedback anonymously. We document that feedback seekers care less about the high feedback scores and prefer longer comments when they rate received feedback. Low feedback scores received motivate feedback seekers to continue to seek feedback in the future. To address the endogeneity issues, we use identification approaches such as instrumental variable, matching, and Heckman-type analysis. Sought feedback may be more useable than unsolicited feedback because text-based feedback responses may provide sufficient insight for the recipient to act on. Hence, managers and organizations should promote a culture of constructive feedback through this feedback-seeking dynamic and orientation. When implementing feedback applications that allow for seeking and rating feedback, managers should be aware that feedback ratings can be informative, but feedback results might be notably lower when feedback is sought. Thus, based on our results, we identify several managerial insights that firms could use to manage feedback mechanisms. History: Ravi Bapna, Senior Editor; Yili (Kevin) Hong, Associate Editor.

  abstract     = {Online learners often experience a lack of sustained motivation given the self-paced nature of online learning, resulting in inefficiency and a high dropout rate. Therefore, it is important to explore options that help users optimize their learning behavior and improve their learning performance. This study proposes that on-the-hour time points as external temporal cues can significantly influence online learning outcomes. Using a multimethod approach (i.e., archival data analysis, laboratory experiments, and framed field experiments), we show that (a) starting learning sessions at on-the-hour time points activates users’ implemental mindset, which supports them in building greater learning persistence and achieving better learning performance, and (b) social presence significantly attenuates the effects of on-the-hour time points in online learning. Our findings add to the literature on the design of online learning systems by clarifying the effects of temporal cues in user-system interactions, which provides implications for notification and reminder strategies that can be implemented to further enhance the effectiveness of online learning.

This research question is important as online marketplaces are increasingly incorporating questioning and answering (Q&amp;A) capabilities. However, the economic implications of these Q&amp;A capabilities have yet to be explored and discussed in the literature. We use a difference-in-differences approach to empirically examine the effect of questions and answers that exist on only one platform on the sales of experience goods. Interestingly, we find that answers, particularly the depth of answers, have a positive impact on sales. In addition, the fraction of questions with at least one answer has a positive and significant impact on product sales as well. Our further analyses on textual content suggest that fit-oriented questions and quality-oriented questions impact sales differently and that positive answers and negative answers also impact sales in different ways. Our findings suggest that platform sellers should pay particular attention to questions that their products receive, as answered questions increase product sales.

This “privacy paradox” could be better understood by uncovering the neural processes underlying the privacy calculus: weighing the risks against the benefits of disclosure. We assess the neural processes shaping privacy tradeoffs to characterize the neural mechanisms underlying privacy tradeoffs to design behavioral interventions that help people make better decisions that align with their privacy preferences. In Study 1, we used functional MRI (fMRI) to identify the neural correlates of the privacy calculus while participants integrated information about the benefits and risks of sharing information. fMRI results revealed that activation in the medial prefrontal cortex and the caudate nucleus tracked the perceived attractiveness of the benefits, while activation in the insula, amygdala, lateral prefrontal cortex, and temporoparietal junction tracked the perceived intrusiveness of sensitive privacy questions. The lateral prefrontal and dorsomedial prefrontal cortices integrate these signals to guide information disclosure, and this prefrontal-parietal network was previously implicated in directing one’s attention. Interestingly, these fMRI findings suggest that attentional processes at the time of choice guide people’s decisions whether to disclose private information. We leveraged these brain insights to design and test a neurally informed behavioral intervention to help people protect their privacy (Study 2). Our results show that altering the timing when information is presented precisely at the time of decision (specifically within a second) directs attention to privacy risks versus benefits, therefore discouraging participants from liberally disclosing their private information. Identifying the underlying neural processes of privacy helps elucidate the privacy calculus and sheds light on the privacy paradox and guides the design of neurally informed behavioral interventions to help people protect their privacy.

  abstract     = {Online health communities are growing rapidly as more individuals seek health information online. Given the importance of doctor engagement, some online health communities have introduced informal payments to doctors to encourage knowledge sharing. This study empirically examines how informal payments in the form of monetary gifts affect doctor engagement. We leverage the launch of a gifting feature by a leading online health community as a natural experiment that exogenously provides doctors with extra monetary incentives. By adopting multiple strategies to strengthen the causal identification, we find that the introduction of the gifting feature negatively affects doctors’ responses to medical consultations. Our results indicate a crowding-out effect of informal payments on doctors’ intrinsic motivation to engage in such consultations. Interestingly, our consultation-level analysis suggests that monetary and nonmonetary gifts play distinct roles in motivating doctor responses, with nonmonetary gifts having a more significant carryover effect on follow-up interactions and better promoting the doctor-patient relationship. We also find that social status moderates the impact of digital gifting on online engagement. Our study has important implications for research and practice. In addition to contributing to the literature on informal payments, our results provide useful implications for online health communities that have implemented or are planning to implement digital gifting to stimulate user engagement.

  abstract     = {Transportability is a structural causal modeling approach aimed at “transporting” a causal effect from a randomized experimental study in one population to a different population where only observational data are available. It offers a way to overcome the practical constraints in inferring causal relationships, such as endogeneity concerns in observational data and the infeasibility of replicating certain experiments. Although transportability holds significant promise for research and practice, it has thus far seldom been implemented in practice, likely because of the lack of practical guidelines for application of transportability theory or the lack of guidance on handling the statistical challenges that might arise. Using a practical problem as an illustration—estimating the effect of telecommuting on worker productivity—we attempt to bridge the theory-practice gap and delineate some challenges faced when putting transportability theory to practice. We offer a detailed procedure for transporting a causal effect across different populations, and we discuss some practical considerations for its implementation, including how to conceptualize causal diagrams, determine the feasibility of transport, select an appropriate diagram, and evaluate its credibility. We also discuss the current limitations, challenges, and opportunities for future research on transportability that would make it more amenable for broad practical use.

  abstract     = {Product shipping is an indispensable but costly operation in online retailing. Although several initiatives are underway to reduce the shipping cost, an important innovation is the membership-based free shipping (MFS) program, in which a retail platform that allows third-party sellers to sell their products for a commission bears the shipping costs for purchases made by members who have paid an up-front fee. We identify several strategic impacts of MFS programs that are the key drivers to their success from the platform’s or other stakeholders’ perspectives. For example, we find that the membership fee collected by the platform does not cover its shipping cost, which suggests the MFS program benefits members and hurts the platform if the program is evaluated based on direct operational considerations only. However, we also show that the MFS program actually benefits the platform and hurts consumers when the shipping cost is less than a threshold. Moreover, the platform’s benefit from the MFS program follows an inverted U shape with respect to the shipping cost, suggesting that the program enjoys the greatest benefit for products with a moderate shipping cost. Even though the MFS program enhances the overall consumer demand and consumption, it could hurt society because the MFS program stimulates demand from consumers who have a low consumption utility relative to the shipping cost. Our results demonstrate that the MFS program is not just a shipping cost-transfer mechanism; rather, it is a strategic initiative by online retail platforms to exploit the need for product shipping to their advantage.

The scope of software patent protection and the social and private value of software patenting are hence central to recent policy debates. The landmark 2014 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Alice Corp v. CLS Bank had a profound impact on software patenting, drastically narrowing the scope of patent protection on software innovation. We theorize and provide empirical evidence that a narrower scope of software patent protection is associated with a greater degree of open-source activities and improved sales in software firms. We also evaluate how individual firm’s ex ante software patent stock may moderate the proposed relationships. These findings offer insights into the roles of patent scope for software innovation in the digital economy and have important implications for the software patent and digital innovation literatures. They also have compelling implications for patent policies on software and software-related inventions, such as artificial intelligence, blockchains, cloud computing, and other emerging digital innovations.

This study examines the influence of peers on the choice a management student makes to pursue a career in the IT industry. Such a choice may be informed and driven not only by the student’s own motivation and ability but also by information gained through peers. Specifically, we analyze data on student networks at a leading business school in India, where students are exogenously assigned to peer groups, and link these to students’ choices regarding postprogram careers in the IT industry. We find that being part of a group that includes peers who have worked in IT reduces the likelihood of receiving and accepting an offer in the IT industry. If a student has had no IT experience, however, having IT peers ameliorates this effect to a certain degree. We also find differential peer effects for male and female students. Our findings are consistent with the notion that IT peers provide (largely discouraging) information about the IT industry to non-IT peers. History: T. S.

  abstract     = {Extant research has revealed that direct communication between buyers and sellers on digital platforms facilitates transaction completion. However, the understanding of how direct communication influences the matching quality of these two-sided transactions is still limited. This study uses a multimethod approach to provide a perspective on how direct communication contributes to matching quality. In an observational study in the context of a peer-to-peer platform for long-term real estate rental properties, the study shows that longer direct phone communication between the renter (i.e., buyers) and the host (i.e., sellers) enables the renter to choose a relatively more unique alternative within her consideration set (i.e., an alternative that is distant from the average attribute levels of the consideration set) for the transaction. Also, we find that the relationship between having direct phone communication and ex post transaction satisfaction is stronger when a relatively more unique alternative is chosen. The implication is that direct phone communication allows the renter to collect supplemental information that is not observable online. Consequently, the renter can better leverage the breadth of her search results (i.e., the consideration set) in making her choice decision. We complement the observational study with a field survey to verify this informational mechanism. Furthermore, we conduct two randomized experiments to verify the motivation for engaging in direct phone communication and for choosing unique alternatives within the consideration set. Taken together, these insights extend the existing understanding of the benefits of direct communication on digital platforms. History: Eric Zheng, Senior Editor; Sunil Wattal, Associate Editor.

  abstract     = {Large firms are leaders in disaster response and communication. We study how firms communicate on social media during various disasters and the relationship between their communication and public engagement using a computationally intensive theory construction framework. The framework incorporates a novel natural language processing (NLP) approach, Semantic Projection with Active Retrieval (SPAR), as a key component of the method lexicon. Drawing on the two dimensions ( internal versus external and stable versus flexible ) of the Competing Values Framework (CVF) as our theoretical lexicon, we examine Facebook posts of Russell 3000 firms on multiple disasters between 2009 and 2022. We find that social media messages that are internal- and stable-oriented, or emphasize operational continuity, are more likely to elicit engagement from the public during biological disasters. By contrast, messages that are external- and flexible-oriented, or stress the innovations to adapt to the disaster, induce more engagement in weather-related disasters. The study offers theoretical implications and methodological support for the research and design of social media messages in disasters and other contexts.

  abstract     = {Digital tracing alerts have emerged as an effective means to share information with agility in responding to disaster outbreaks. Governments are able to instantaneously coordinate the available information to provide information related to the disaster and promote preventive actions. However, despite the opportunities granted by these innovative technologies in managing disasters, privacy concerns can arise regarding how much of individuals’ private information should be collected and disclosed. With these considerations, we examine the extent to which instant digital tracing alerts and the information included in the alerts affect people’s actions toward disaster management in the context of South Korea. We leverage 4,029,696 subdistrict and hour level data set, including population movement and digital tracing alert transmission information. Our results show that digital tracing alerts are effective in inducing population movement out of the infected area and decreasing the population density. Specifically, instant messaging induces movement among 2.45% of an infected district’s population to other administrative areas in a given hour and decreases population density by 3.68%. Furthermore, the effectiveness of digital tracing alerts hinges on the inclusion of different private information of individuals on case confirmation. We find the heterogeneous effect of digital alerts, with the effects being more pronounced among young and male individuals and in business-centric areas. Further analysis reveals that digital tracing alerts are particularly effective at the early stage of the disaster. In addition, sending more than three messages within a day has a valid counter-effect (i.e., fatigue effects), whereas messages sent when the cumulative number of confirmed cases is high exert a less positive effect than when the verified cases are low (i.e., desensitization effects). Our results provide policymakers and law enforcement with novel insights into whether and how the use of information technology can facilitate disaster management and to what extent they should collect and expose private information to effectively safeguards public health and safety during a crisis.

  abstract     = {Disaster relief organizations (DROs) utilize social media to provide information rapidly and broadly. Many DROs post content via multiple social media accounts within a single platform, on which each account represents a distinct entity (e.g., national headquarters, local branch). According to crisis communication theory, an organization’s communication channels can coordinate by “speaking with one voice.” In a disaster context, this can be facilitated by accounts within the same DRO producing convergent content through the match of their content creation decisions (e.g., targeting the same audience). Using Twitter data collected in partnership with the Canadian Red Cross, we show that content creation decisions by accounts within the same DRO are intertwined, unveiling at least an implicit level of coordination. Our results also indicate that engagement improves by 4.3% from a match only when uncertainty and urgency are at their highest (i.e., the response phase). Strikingly, a divergence of content creation decisions, or mismatch, yields 29.6% more engagement when uncertainty subsides (i.e., the recovery phase). We, thus, reveal that the recommended coordination strategy from crisis communication theory does not uniformly hold across the disaster management cycle. Moreover, we demonstrate that the effect magnitudes of a match versus a mismatch on engagement vary between accounts representing national and local level entities. Our findings extend crisis communication theory and provide actionable guidelines for DROs’ internal coordination of social media content generation, which, ultimately, help DROs meet the needs of those affected by disasters.

  abstract     = {When managing major disasters, authorities may ask residents to comply with certain guidelines that change community members’ daily routines. In these situations, authorities often appeal to resilience, which refers to the ability to recover from challenges. In this study, we examine whether embedding resilience-related words (resilience messaging) in governors’ social media posts increases community compliance with government guidelines in the context of the COVID-19 disaster. First, we conducted a secondary data analysis using a panel data set of U.S. states. This analysis included community mobility data, governors’ tweets, official county tweets, approval ratings, new COVID-19 cases, and states’ response data for the period between February 2020 and August 2021 (81 weeks). We measure community compliance using the time residents spent at home and the time they spent at retail places, according to community mobility data. We also conducted an online controlled experiment to complement our secondary data analysis in order to identify the underlying mechanism. We show that governors’ resilience messaging increases community compliance (12.5% increase in time spent at home and 11% increase in avoiding unnecessary trips). We also find that the effect of resilience messaging on community compliance is mediated by residents’ perceptions of inspirational leadership.

This research note studies whether lenders’ use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the lending process can, through reducing delinquency, benefit borrowers who experience natural disasters. Collaborating with a leading credit-scoring company, we track borrowers’ loan applications and lenders’ use of customized AI solutions in assessing loan risks. We find that borrowers who apply to AI-empowered lenders fare better in reducing delinquency rates after experiencing natural disasters. Notably, such a disaster mitigation effect is more pronounced for borrowers with lower credit scores. We explore the possible mechanisms at play and discuss the implications of our findings.

  abstract     = {Catastrophe insurance is an important element of disaster management. Yet the historical presence of inequalities in insurance, from redlining to pricing disparity, has had a devastating impact on minority communities. Whereas the fairness of insurance ratemaking is studied in general, we identify a unique challenge for catastrophe insurance that sets it apart from other lines of insurance. Drawing upon the recent advances in machine learning for fair data valuation, we reveal striking connections between the two seemingly unrelated problems and lean on insights from machine learning to mathematically and empirically study the fairness of ratemaking methods for catastrophe insurance. Our results indicate the potential existence of disparate impact against minorities across existing methods and point to a unique mathematical solution that can satisfy a few commonly assumed properties of fair ratemaking for catastrophe insurance.

  abstract     = {We study, using three sequential field experiments, collaborative problem solving in knowledge work enabled by information technology within the context of the customer support function in a leading high-technology firm. Experiment one examines the performance change after introducing a new collaborative problem-solving process, specifically whether the use of a team of experts across departments to solve problems can help reduce problem-solving costs. In addition to the extant process of supporting customers using problem solvers within a specific department, the experiment allowed two forms of engaging problem solvers outside the department: (1) formal handover (transferring the task to experts in an external department) and (2) using a new, collaborative process in which experts across two departments jointly work on the task. Interestingly, we find that the cost reduction occurs not because the collaborative process is always superior to formal handover, but because there is a shift of intradepartmental customer support work toward the new collaborative process. Building upon the findings of experiment one, experiment two aims to identify the conditions under which the new collaborative process works or fails. We discover that task features, such as novelty and time constraints, play a significant role in determining the appropriate mode of engaging an external department for problem solving. These findings are then utilized to develop an information system that provides recommendations on how to seek help through either formal handover or collaboration. In experiment three, we examine how users react to the recommendation. We find that local (department level) incentives can cause problem solvers to deviate from machine recommendations. We analyze the underlying reasons for this deviation and demonstrate how global (firm level) incentives can be aligned with local incentives to increase compliance with machine recommendations. The findings of this study offer practical implications for firms that aim to develop and implement information systems to support knowledge-intensive problem-solving tasks.

  abstract     = {As more businesses are turning to crowdsourcing platforms for solutions to business problems, determining how to manage the sourcing contests based on their objectives has become critically important. Existing research, both theoretical and empirical, studies the impact of a variety of contest and contestant characteristics on the outcomes of these contests. Aside from these static design parameters, a lever organizations (clients) can use to dynamically steer contests toward desirable goals is the feedback offered to the contestants (solvers) during the contest. Although a handful of recent studies focuses on the effects of feedback at a high level (e.g., volume, valence), to the best of our knowledge, none has examined the effects of the information contained in the feedback. Furthermore, the focus of the existing studies is solely on the quality of the submissions and not on other critical contest outcomes, such as the diversity of the submissions, which is found to be significant in the creativity and innovations literature. In this study, first, using the psychology literature on the theory of feedback intervention, we classify client feedback into two types: outcome and process. Second, using data from almost 12,000 design contests, we empirically examine the effects of the two types of feedback on the convergence and diversity of submissions following feedback interventions. We find that process feedback, providing goal-oriented information to solvers, fosters convergent thinking, leading to submissions that are similar. Although outcome feedback lacks the informative value of process feedback, it encourages divergent thinking, which is the ability to produce a variety of solutions to a problem. Furthermore, we find that the effects are strengthened when the feedback is provided earlier in the contest rather than later. Based on our findings, we offer insights on how practitioners can strategically use an appropriate form of feedback to either generate greater diversity of solutions or efficient convergence to an acceptable solution.

  abstract     = {A digital platform (DP) generates value by facilitating direct interactions between two or multiple platform sides. While previous studies have expounded upon how platform sides can be coordinated at a collective level (i.e., by pricing strategy and modular architecture), digital platform owners must not neglect the dynamics within the platform sides and their interactions. Through an in-depth case study of one of the largest e-commerce platforms worldwide, we develop a process model that explains digital platform coordination in terms of the mechanisms that describe the emergence of coordination issues as a result of the enactment of the platform sides’ agency and how these issues can be circumvented. This study makes two contributions. First, this study challenges the existing DP literature concerning the assumption of exogenous platform sides, highlighting the agency of the sides as a source of misalignment that must be managed. Second, the model complements the platform coordination literature focusing on enabling/constraining the actions of sides by conceptualizing a digital orienting mechanism. By adopting a meta-organizational view of digital platforms, this empirical work is among the few studies that report from the inside of a digital platform organization and adopt a processual account.

  abstract     = {We consider a marketplace where a recommender system provider (the firm) offers incentives to acquire prospective consumers by leveraging information that a market intermediary collects about these consumers. We investigate a model of consumer acquisition that incorporates several factors affecting acquisition decisions, including the value that a consumer contributes to the recommender system, the cost of participation to the consumer (e.g., privacy loss), and the value that a consumer can derive from the system due to network externality created by existing consumers. Our model is dynamic in nature, where the firm iteratively decides the next acquisition target based on previously realized acquisition outcomes. We propose flexible data-driven procedures to estimate some of the key parameters in the model using consumers’ data collected by the market intermediary, for example their historical consumption data or the consumption data of other similar consumers. We also design an algorithm to compute the dynamic acquisition sequence and the corresponding incentives to offer. We conduct simulation-based empirical evaluations on two canonical recommendation tasks: movie recommendation based on numerical ratings and product offer recommendation based on browsing (clicking) behaviors and benchmark our acquisition model with random acquisition sequences with respect to (i) firm utility, (ii) recommender system performance, and (iii) consumer surplus. We find nuanced relationships between the firm’s choice of incentive strategies and acquisition outcomes. Specifically, neither a constant strategy (setting the same incentive for all consumers) nor a fully greedy strategy (extracting all cumulative network externality) is optimal on all acquisition outcomes. Under a moderately greedy strategy, where the firm only partially extracts the cumulative network externality from consumers, the dynamic acquisition sequence can outperform random sequences on three acquisition outcomes simultaneously. Our work contributes a novel theoretical framework, practical insights, and design artifacts to facilitate effective consumer acquisition in recommender systems.

  abstract     = {We use high-resolution mobile phone data with geolocation information and propose a novel technical framework to study how social influence propagates within a phone communication network and affects the offline decision to attend a performance event. Our fine-grained data are based on the universe of phone calls made in a European country between January and July 2016. We isolate social influence from observed and latent homophily by taking advantage of the rich spatial-temporal information and the social interactions available from the longitudinal behavioral data. We find that influence stemming from phone communication is significant and persists up to four degrees of separation in the communication network. Building on this finding, we introduce a new “influence” centrality measure that captures the empirical pattern of influence decay over successive connections. A validation test shows that the average influence centrality of the adopters at the beginning of each observational period can strongly predict the number of eventual adopters and has a stronger predictive power than other prevailing centrality measures such as the eigenvector centrality and state-of-the-art measures such as diffusion centrality. Our centrality measure can be used to improve optimal seeding strategies in contexts with influence over phone calls, such as targeted or viral marketing campaigns. Finally, we quantitatively demonstrate how raising the communication probability over each connection, as well as the number of initial seeds, can significantly amplify the expected adoption in the network and raise net revenue after taking into account the cost of these interventions.

  abstract     = {We consider an ad firm that acts on behalf of advertisers to execute mobile, in-app, ad campaigns. The firm commits to provide an advertiser a specified number of ad placements (impressions) on mobile apps, usually in a specified location, and within a specified time horizon. The supply for ad space arrives, in real time, in the form of bid requests from one or more mobile ad exchanges. The ad firm needs to bid on each impression in such a way that the goals of several ongoing campaigns are met at minimum cost. The ad firm needs to execute multiple campaigns simultaneously and get its supply (for ad space, or impressions) from multiple mobile ad exchanges. By working with more than one ad exchange, the direct cost of procuring the necessary impressions can be lowered. However, this lower cost needs to be balanced with the cost of the additional computing resources needed to work with multiple mobile ad exchanges and the (possible) extra cost of meeting the minimum spend (or participation fee) imposed by each ad exchange. Here, there are two key decisions that the firm needs to make. First, it needs to select the set of mobile ad exchanges to obtain its supply; each mobile ad exchange is characterized by specific supply uncertainties, location dependent bid curves, and a participation fee. Second, for each ad exchange and location, the ad firm needs to determine its bidding policy, that is, how much to bid for each bid request. We show that the proposed near-optimal bidding strategy, the strategy to bid at each exchange-location combination, is state independent. We first solve a general problem of selecting among multiple nonidentical ad exchanges. We next analyze the special case with identical mobile ad exchanges and show that, depending on the particular parameter setting, the near-optimal number of ad exchanges and the near-optimal bid amount can be weak complements or substitutes. Finally, we propose a cloud-based architecture to procure impressions where the ad firm uses a selective bidding strategy that can further lower procurement costs. The ideas of this paper are applied to a real problem and the savings from our approach (about 33% lower cost) are demonstrated.

This work also helps to fill the knowledge gap on the role of funding schemes. Leveraging an unannounced site change at a leading crowdfunding platform, we estimated the impact of introducing the donation scheme by developing and applying a novel two-step matching and difference-in-differences technique for cohorted quasi-experimental settings. We find that the introduction of the donation scheme increased the success rate of reward campaigns by 19%. The increased success occurred mainly in reward campaigns with prosocial causes. Further analyses of underlying mechanisms reveal that the increased campaign success came mainly from campaigns that received donations. The added donation channel not only had a primary effect, as evidenced by a third of campaigns attracting donations, but also a secondary “crowd-in” effect on the reward channel, as shown by a positive impact of early donations on subsequent contributions through the reward channel, beyond the known effects of early contributions. Our findings suggest that, for reward campaigns with prosocial causes, the addition of a donation channel not only provides a better fit for some backers of reward campaigns, but also inspires others to be more willing to contribute through the reward channel.

  abstract     = {Ubiquitous mobile technologies have been producing massive swaths of consumer location data, giving rise to an elaborate multibillion-dollar ecosystem. In this ecosystem, some consumers share personal data in exchange for economic benefits, including personalized recommendations; data aggregators curate and monetize data by sharing data with advertisers, and advertisers often utilize such data for location-based marketing. While these various entities can benefit from such data sharing, privacy risks can prevail. This creates an opportunity for data aggregators to implement an effective privacy preserving framework to balance potential privacy risks to consumers and data utilities to advertisers before sharing data with advertisers. We hence propose a personalized and flexible framework that quantifies personalized privacy risks, performs personalized data obfuscation, and flexibly accommodates a variety of risks, utilities, and acceptable levels of risk-utility trade-off. Leveraging machine learning methods, we illustrate the power of the framework with two privacy risks and two utilities. Validating the framework on one million consumer trajectories, we demonstrate potential privacy risks in the absence of data obfuscation. Outperforming ten baselines from the latest literature, the proposed framework significantly reduces each consumer’s privacy risk while preserving an advertiser’s utility.

  abstract     = {Predictive algorithmic scores can significantly impact the lives of assessed individuals by shaping decisions of organizations and institutions that affect them, for example, influencing the hiring prospects of job applicants or the release of defendants on bail. To better protect people and provide them the opportunity to appeal their algorithmic assessments, data privacy advocates and regulators increasingly push for disclosing the scores and their use in decision-making processes to scored individuals. Although inherently important, the response of scored individuals to such algorithmic transparency is understudied and therefore demands further research. Inspired by psychological and economic theories of information processing, we aim to fill this gap. We conducted a comprehensive experimental study with five treatment conditions to explore how and why disclosing the use of algorithmic scoring processes to (involuntarily) scored individuals affects their behaviors. Our results provide strong evidence that the disclosure of fundamentally erroneous algorithmic scores evokes self-fulfilling prophecies that endogenously steer the behavior of scored individuals toward their assessment, enabling algorithms to help produce the world they predict. Occurring self-fulfilling prophecies are consistent with an anchoring effect and the exploitation of available moral wiggle room. Because scored individuals interpret others’ motives for overriding human expert and algorithmic scores differently, self-fulfilling prophecies occur in part only when disclosing algorithmic scores. Our results emphasize that isolated transparency measures can have considerable side effects with noticeable implications for the development of automation bias, the occurrence of feedback loops, and the design of transparency regulations.

  abstract     = {Radical, terroristic organizations pose threats to business, government, and society. The ubiquity of the modern Web and its participatory architecture have enabled such groups to become full-blown online propaganda machines. Today, radicalization that eventually leads to acts of terror occurs predominantly on the Web. Radical ideologies can be spread, in many cases unchecked, by malicious actors who take advantage of the frequently lax surveillance apparatus of online social platforms. This paper argues that an overlooked, essential first step to interdicting this threat is the large-scale, structured collection of knowledge regarding these ideologies in open machine-readable formats. Using Collective Action Framing Theory, this study develops a trio of design artifacts: the Terror Beliefs Ontology (TBO) for a general ontology of terroristic ideology, the Frame Discovery System (FDS) to automatically populate this ontology, and the Frame Resonance Detection System (FRDS) to accurately identify online personae or postings that espouse a radical ideology known to TBO. With a comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate how these three instantiated design artifacts, working in concert, can automatically construct a knowledge representation of heterogeneous terroristic ideologies and accurately detect radical online postings. We offer the first design that can assign Web text to any radical ideology without the use of a hand-labeled training corpus. History: Olivia Sheng, Senior editor; Huimin Zhao, Associate Editor.

  abstract     = {Supply chain agility has been recognized as a key capability for firms working to achieve superior performance in uncertain business environments. Supply chain agility is challenging to achieve, however, because it requires the firm and its supply chain partners to collaborate closely yet flexibly across organizational boundaries. Extending the boundary object literature to the supply chain context, this study unveils the mechanism through which interorganizational systems (IOS), widely deployed to span organizational boundaries through interfirm digital connections, promote supply chain agility in uncertain environments. The concept of supply chain collaboration is introduced as the mediating mechanism between two key IOS characteristics (i.e., standardization and adaptability) and supply chain agility. Environmental uncertainty is incorporated as the contextual condition through contextualized theorization of IOS as boundary objects. The resulting hypotheses are tested via a two-wave, match-paired survey study on business and information technology executives in 156 manufacturing firms. Empirical findings provide general support to most hypotheses, and implications for theory development and professional practice are discussed.

  abstract     = {Online communities (OCs) have become common, both in work settings and in the personal lives of individuals. Communication among members of OCs is similar in many ways to communication among members of work and nonwork teams (e.g., both synchronous and asynchronous communication are possible). Historically, knowledge repositories have been the focus of OCs, but as OCs add more synchronous communication, it is important to understand how different communication capabilities influence user commitment, individual growth, and knowledge contribution. We developed a theoretical model that argues that the five media capabilities of media synchronicity theory influence the two information technology (IT)-enabled public goods of communality (in the form of knowledge repositories) and connectivity (in the form of direct user-to-user interactions) and that these two in turn affect task outcomes such as community commitment, individual growth, and knowledge contribution. We tested this model using three waves of data collection (two surveys and one set of archival behavioral data) from the same 452 members of a popular OC. Our results show that four of the five media capabilities have strong influences on connectivity and communality and through them on task outcomes. Connectivity (direct user-to-user interaction) has a stronger influence on knowledge contribution than communality (knowledge repositories). Our model explains large effect sizes for connectivity and communality and medium to large sizes for task outcomes, suggesting its value to OC theory and practice.

  abstract     = {Darknet markets have been used increasingly for the transaction of drugs in the last decade. The growth of illicit drug transactions on darknet markets has led enforcement agencies to invest a greater proportion of time and effort to monitor and crack down on criminal activities on darknet websites. Whereas large-scale site-shutdown efforts involving policing agencies across various countries can help in slowing down the growth of these markets, such enforcement strategies may not be sustainable in the long run given the cost and time they require to coordinate. Thus, there is a need for alternative, cost-efficient strategies to police darknet markets on a regular basis. In response, this study attempts to empirically evaluate and quantify the effectiveness of selectively targeting large drug vendors on darknet sites. Using data from the three largest darknet markets, we employ a difference-in-differences procedure to assess the impact of the arrest of a major drug dealer on subsequent darknet activities. Specifically, we contrast various outcomes from the policed site (Silk Road 2) with those from nonpoliced sites (Agora and Evolution) and find that enforcement efforts on the policed site reduced subsequent transaction levels and the number of remaining vendors. The enforcement was not only effective in deterring users in the same country as the arrestees, but also had a spillover effect on darknet participants who were beyond the prosecutorial jurisdictions of the arrestees. Test results on heterogeneous effects further suggest that small darknet drug vendors were most deterred by the arrest event and drug vendors selling dangerous drugs were more deterred relative to those selling less dangerous drugs. Our findings have policy and theoretical implications for law makers, enforcement agencies, and academics. History: Kai-Lung Hui, Senior Editor; Debabrata Dey, Associate Editor.

  abstract     = {This paper presents methods to choose individuals to test for infection during a pandemic such as COVID-19, characterized by high contagion and presence of asymptomatic carriers. The smart-testing ideas presented here are motivated by active learning and multi-armed bandit techniques in machine learning. Our active sampling method works in conjunction with quarantine policies, can handle different objectives, and is dynamic and adaptive in the sense that it continually adapts to changes in real-time data. The bandit algorithm uses contact tracing, location-based sampling and random sampling in order to select specific individuals to test. Using a data-driven agent-based model simulating New York City we show that the algorithm samples individuals to test in a manner that rapidly traces infected individuals. Experiments also suggest that smart-testing can significantly reduce the death rates as compared with current methods, with or without vaccination. While smart testing strategies can help mitigate disease spread, there could be unintended consequences with fairness or bias when deployed in real-world settings. To this end we show how procedural fairness can be incorporated into our method and present results that show that this can be done without hurting the effectiveness of the mitigation that can be achieved.

These sites allow users to publish recommendations given by other users to supplement their profile information and add credibility to the information provided. OPN recommendations provide a rich source of information to recruiters. Unlike recommendations shared in other ways (non-OPN recommendations), OPN recommendations are publicly accessible, and candidates have full control over which recommendations they show to others. Despite the role OPN profiles play in the recruiting process, there has been a lack of research into the specific effect of OPN recommendations, how the impact of OPN recommendations differs from non-OPN recommendations, and how they can best be used to maximize the likelihood of candidates receiving interviews. First, we theoretically conjecture why recommendations that reveal a candidate’s weakness will have different effects on the likelihood of interview depending on whether the weakness is expected or unexpected and how that difference depends on how the recommendation is presented (OPN versus non-OPN). Then, we establish that the effectiveness of a recommendation is higher when presented as a non-OPN recommendation than as an OPN recommendation and show that OPN recommendations benefit more from discussing an expected weakness than non-OPN recommendations.

  abstract     = {In the current professional environment, recruiters are using online professional networks at an increasing rate to find qualified candidates for job openings. Online professional recommendations on these sites can provide valuable information; however, because of the medium by which they are provided, their effectiveness may suffer from lower levels of trust. We theoretically conjecture why including a discussion of a candidate’s weakness (termed, scope of improvement) can lead to a higher likelihood of a recruiter being willing to interview a candidate. We theorize that the effect of scope of improvement will depend on the nature of the weakness discussed and the physical attractiveness of the candidate, which is only relevant in an online context where that information is known. Analysis of the data we collected from industry professionals indicates that for average candidates, scope of improvement has a positive effect when the scope discussed does not counter expectations derived from common gender stereotypes (referred to as gender-expected scope), and a negative effect when it does. For attractive candidates, any discussion of scope has a negative effect. A theoretical contribution is our explaining the process of how different types of scope effect the likelihood of interview across different levels of attractiveness. Another theoretical contribution was the counterfactual performed in a second study to show how reinforcement of gender-expected strengths can attenuate the penalty of gender-expected scope for attractive candidates. Findings indicate that the penalty observed for attractive candidates can be avoided by reinforcing traits commonly associated with their gender. Data for both studies were collected from industry professionals involved in the hiring process, allowing us to offer practical guidelines to users of online professional networks.

  abstract     = {Technological advancements and the COVID-19 pandemic have catapulted process virtualization across many industries, including healthcare, where telehealth has enabled significant digital transformation of care delivery. Although telehealth has been proposed as a potential solution to improve access to care and restrain runaway healthcare costs, it can increase spending if telehealth use leads to new types of resource utilization. Drawing on the lens of process virtualization theory, we study the impact of telehealth on healthcare utilization by examining visit-level patient data of telehealth use in facilitating e-visits with healthcare providers. On average, a telehealth visit reduces the number of future outpatient visits by 13.6% (or 0.15 visits), equal to a reduction of $239 in total cost within 30 days after the visit. Our results suggest that the benefits of telehealth use are observed primarily among diseases with high virtualization potential. Specifically, patients with mental health, skin, metabolic, and musculoskeletal diseases exhibit a significant reduction of 0.21 outpatient visits per quarter (an equivalent cost reduction of $179) when they are treated via telehealth, suggesting a substitution effect with respect to traditional clinic visits. Our research identifies the boundary conditions that determine the nuanced impact of telehealth on care utilization and shows that its effectiveness depends on the process virtualization potential of different diseases. Our findings have several practical and theoretical implications for fostering telehealth use in a value-based healthcare environment, especially for diseases with high virtualization potential where telehealth use should be promoted to bend the cost curve.

  abstract     = {Prior research has differentiated intrafirm information technology (IT) capabilities that reduce internal coordination costs and interfirm IT capabilities that reduce external transaction costs. However, the influence of developing these capabilities on business value has not been explored in the realm of institutional governance—the regulatory context that defines the rules of the game for firms. We suggest that the value of a firm’s investments in different types of IT capabilities development (ITCD) is evaluated by the financial market contingent on the firm’s regulatory context. Our study is situated in the U.S. electric utility industry undergoing a market restructuring process to understand the impacts of intrafirm and interfirm ITCD on market value conditional on a firm’s regulatory context characterized by the extent to which its business is located in states that allow consumer choice (i.e., deregulation), as well as the extent to which its business is located in states that deliberate regulations regarding price control, value chain configuration, and information control (i.e., regulatory uncertainty). We find that intrafirm ITCD for enhancing efficiency is rewarded in a firm’s market valuation under a high level of deregulation. We further find that under a high level of regulatory uncertainty, interfirm ITCD for fostering flexibility can hedge against regulatory uncertainty and increase firm value. A key contribution of our work is demonstrating external institutional governance can influence the market value that firms accrue from different types of ITCD, thereby elaborating the complementarity in theoretical explanations of IT capabilities and institutional governance.

  abstract     = {Although facial recognition (FR) payment technology can be more convenient for customers, it is still not consistently used by many customers in retail. Using transaction data from three retail chains, we develop econometric models and an estimation strategy for examining the social presence and herding effects that affect FR payment technology use. Our key findings are as follows: (1) Customers are less likely to use FR payment technology when more customers are in line behind them, waiting and potentially watching—the social presence effect. (2) Customers are more likely to use FR payment technology when more preceding customers use FR payment technology—the herding effect. (3) Customers with more experience using FR payment technology are subject to a weaker social presence effect. The marginal social presence effect can result in a 4.75% reduction in the probability of the focal customer using FR payment technology, and the potential social presence effect can be as high as 48.42%. When the focal customer has one additional experience in using FR payment technology, the social presence effect is reduced by 7.79%. The herding effect can result in a 20.90% increase in the probability of the focal customer using FR payment technology. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed.

  abstract     = {Whereas modern medicine has enabled humans to live longer and more robust lives, recent years have seen a significant increase in chronic care costs. The prevention of threats to mobility, such as falls, freezing of gait, and others, is critical for chronic disease management. Researchers and physicians often analyze data from wearable motion sensor–based information systems (IS) to prevent falls because of their convenience, low cost, and user privacy protection. However, prior studies on fall prevention often achieve suboptimal performance because of their limited capacities in modeling data distributions. In this study, we adopt the computational design science paradigm to develop a novel fall prevention framework, which includes the hidden Markov model with generative adversarial network (HMM-GAN) that extracts temporal and sequential patterns from sensor signals and recognizes snippet states, and a logistic regression that utilizes the snippet states and determines whether and when to trigger protective devices to prevent fall injuries. Drawing upon the HMM, deep learning, and a new expectation-maximization instantiation, the proposed framework addresses limitations of existing methods by automatically extracting features from motion sensor data, accounting for both independent and sequential information in data snippets, operating on sensor signals with varying distributions and sharp peaks and valleys, allowing lead times, and being applicable in both semisupervised and supervised modes. We evaluate the proposed fall prevention framework against prevailing fall prevention models and the HMM-GAN component against state-of-the-art sensor analytics models on selected large-scale ground truth data sets containing thousands of falls and normal activities. Through an in-depth case study, we demonstrate how the proposed framework can lead to significantly reduced potentially catastrophic falls by senior citizens and produce more than $33 million of economic benefits over competing models. Besides practical health information technology contributions, HMM-GAN offers methodological contributions to the IS knowledge base for scholars designing novel information technology artifacts for healthcare applications.
