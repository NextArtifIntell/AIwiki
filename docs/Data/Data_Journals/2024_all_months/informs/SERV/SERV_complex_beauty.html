Drawing data from university students in Ghana, a demographic highly susceptible to secondhand goods in retail markets, we employ structural equation modeling techniques. The findings reveal that, within the context of retail markets, young adults’ perceptions significantly impact the decision-making process when it comes to secondhand goods. Four key antecedents emerged: perceived popularity, perceived image, perceived love, and perceived loyalty. Notably, perceived love exhibits a substantial effect on customers’ purchasing decisions, mediated by perceived loyalty. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that 72% of the variations in the outcome variable (buying decision) can be attributed to the identified perceptions associated with secondhand goods. This suggests that these perceptions effectively predict the consumer purchase decisions. Consequently, in secondhand retailing markets, marketing practitioners should prioritize understanding and appealing to consumers’ perceptions associated with the goods. The implications for both theory and practice are thoroughly discussed.},

  abstract     = {In the data transaction process, where a single supplier collects and sells data to heterogeneous data buyers, its transaction strategy relies on the data’s value. In this paper, we measure the value of data in terms of volume and currency and analyze the whole process from data collection and update management to sales. The data supplier determines the maximum amount of data to be collected based on the willingness to pay and the cost of collection and decides the optimal update frequency based on the update cost paid to improve the data utility. Because data sets can be replicated and split nearly costlessly, data suppliers maximize revenue by combining data sets of different sizes. In the information asymmetry scenario, contract theory is applied to obtain the optimal data collection quantity, update frequency, and packaging combination scheme to maximize the profit of data suppliers under data buyer incentive compatibility and individual rationality and compare them with the information symmetry scenario. The results show that data suppliers will only provide personalized data sets to some data buyers, and the needs of some buyers will not be met. Information asymmetry causes data suppliers to reduce the number of data collections and the actual purchases by data buyers, and data suppliers’ profits tend to decrease. The surprising conclusion is that data suppliers should set up more frequent update strategies in the information asymmetry case than in the information symmetry case to sustain the decrease in data utility caused by insufficient quantity.

  abstract     = {This research investigates the effect of reference dependence on waiting times in service systems which formerly used a first-in-first-out (FIFO) service but have introduced a priority line with a fee. Our model combines reference-dependent gain-loss utility with standard customer utility, and we posit that customers are pleased with shorter-than-expected waiting times, whereas longer-than-expected times lead to dissatisfaction and an increased likelihood of balking. The study explores two scenarios: a captive customer system (CCS) and a noncaptive customer system (NCCS), with a focus on optimal pricing and segmentation strategies for revenue and social welfare maximization. The results reveal that, in a CCS, the service provider should implement observed and unobserved customer segmentation to optimize revenue and social welfare, respectively. In an NCCS, the impact of customer segmentation on revenue maximization depends on the value of regular customers, their loss reference-dependent preferences, and the system’s offered load. Alternatively, if the service provider seeks to maximize social welfare, the provider’s use of customer segmentation relies solely on the system’s offered load and customers’ reference-dependent preferences. Our findings also indicate that reference dependence can have varying impacts under different conditions, suggesting the effectiveness of tailored service and pricing strategies. Notably, a CCS generates more revenue than does an NCCS because of its captive nature, and, surprisingly, increasing the service rate can decrease revenue while improving social welfare. These insights have significant implications for service management strategies for a CCS and an NCCS. Funding: J.

  abstract     = {The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented damage to restaurant businesses, especially indoor dining services, because of the widespread fear of coronavirus exposure. In contrast, the online food ordering and delivery services, led by DoorDash, Grubhub, and Uber Eats, filled in the vacancy and achieved explosive growth. As a result, the restaurant industry is experiencing dramatic transformations under the crossfire of these two driving forces. However, these changes are not fully exposed because of the lack of firsthand data, let alone their potential consequences and implications. This study, thus, leverages foot traffic data to reveal and understand the trends of restaurant service demand through the pandemic. We devise a mixture model to decompose the aggregate foot traffic by dwelling time patterns into dine-in and takeout volumes. The transitions of demand structures are then identified for various restaurant sectors by service types, price levels, and locations. We observe that limited-service and budget restaurants saw a significantly faster recovery than full-service counterparts given their comparative advantages in adapting toward takeout channels. But, in the long run, our results suggest more robust demands for dine-in services at full-service restaurants, particularly those that provide more premium dining experiences. Comparatively, the off-line channels at limited-service restaurants appeared vulnerable to the cannibalization from online ordering and delivery channels, which strengthened even after society moved out of lockdown. Regionally, exurban restaurants seem to trend toward the takeout mode, whereas urban areas did not see a notable modal migration between dine-in and takeout from restaurants.},

  abstract     = {Competitive Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) do not only sell equipment, but also provide service contracts that ensure proper functioning and uptime of equipment after the sale. This makes OEMs responsible for a large part of an equipment’s life cycle. Therefore, OEMs aim to minimize the total life cycle costs of their equipment, in particular by commonality and reliability level decisions during the design phase. We consider these decisions for one component occurring in a family of systems. The commonality decision is about choosing a common component or dedicated components for the systems. The life cycle costs consist of design and production costs of all components, repair costs, inventory holding costs of service parts, and logistic downtime costs (i.e., downtime costs due to insufficient spare parts inventory). At many OEMs, the design department tends to exclude service parts considerations for the commonality and reliability level decisions. Excluding service parts leads to a simpler decision model, however, this may lead to non–optimal decisions. We compare two approaches for the commonality and reliability decisions: the anticipating approach, which includes inventory holding costs of service parts and logistic downtime costs, and the nonanticipating approach, which excludes these costs. Since the cost function under the anticipating approach is intractable, we first derive a cost function that approximates the actual costs via an asymptotic analysis. Next, we show that the anticipating approach selects the common component more frequently in comparison with the nonanticipating approach. For many problem instances, the nonanticipating approach leads to decisions that have a much higher overall cost than using the anticipating approach. The relative cost difference can become arbitrarily large when the family of systems consists of many systems. Funding: J.

  abstract     = {Digital platforms share their customers’ data with social planners, who may utilize it to improve socioeconomic infrastructure. This may benefit customers because of the experience of improved infrastructure. On the contrary, it may lead to privacy concerns among them (as these data sets may include sensitive information). In this paper, we analyze the game-theoretic model to characterize the granularity of data sharing between firms and the social planner and the investments by the social planner to improve public infrastructure. In order to analyze the impact of regulation on data sharing strategy, we consider the cases when data sharing is regulated (decided by the social planner) and unregulated (strategically decided by firms). Our analysis reveals that the firms as well as the social planner decrease the granularity of data with an increase in privacy concerns among customers. To analyze the impact of regulation, we compare the granularity of data shared under unregulated and regulated scenarios. We find that when the firm is monopolist, it shares data with a higher level of granularity in the unregulated scenario. Interestingly, we find that under market competition, the data granularity may be higher or lower compared with the regulated scenario. Specifically, we find that if firms jointly determine the granularity of data to be shared, they share data with higher granularity under the unregulated scenario; however, if they do not collaborate and individually decide on data sharing, we find that regulation leads to higher granularity of data to be shared. Finally, we find that firms’ payoffs and customer surplus are higher under the unregulated data-sharing setup if they jointly determine the granularity of data; however, if they do not collaborate on data sharing, their payoffs, as well as customer surplus, are higher under regulation.

  abstract     = {Underground passageways for the transport of goods and people have fascinated mankind throughout the centuries. Recent initiatives in different parts of the world aim at rekindling the freight tunnel concept for urban logistics. According to this concept, freight is lifted into a tunnel, moved via electrically powered vehicles, rail cars, or maglev shuttles toward inner-city microhubs, and finally delivered with environmentally friendly vehicles to urban recipients. The main justification for this concept to outweigh the huge tunnel boring cost is a substantial reduction of road-based urban freight traffic. To warn about unfulfilled expectations, however, we show that the combination of time-critical goods, small inner-city hubs with restricted storage capacity, and the wrong booking procedure can hinder a loading of tunnel vehicles to capacity. To do so, we consider a polynomially solvable scheduling problem where due date-restricted shipments are to be assigned to tunnel vehicles and delivered to a given set of microhubs with limited storage capacity. Scarce hub capacities, tight due dates, and the wrong booking policy may not only lead to unused tunnel capacity but also to shipments that cannot be feasibly transported through the tunnel. If they are handed over to trucks as a fallback option, we show that a Braess-like paradox can occur: The time-critical, small-lot transports of the leftover shipments can produce even more surface traffic than trucking all shipments right from the start without the tunnel.

We further investigate how ESG can help manage a crisis by examining the period before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results reveal that ESG can indeed enhance hotels’ efficiency. Specifically, the social and environmental aspects are the most important factors that contribute to the operational efficiency of hotel firms. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, hotel firms with the best ESG practice can be more efficient than others, especially those that have very high environmental and social scores. Overall, our findings suggest that hotel firms should consider ESG investment, not only as an effective and sustainable strategy during normal times but also as a crisis management strategy to overcome unexpected crises that may arise in the future.

Knowledge can transfer between sites and generations, yet prior research has studied both types of knowledge transfer in isolation. Understanding their combined effect is essential because many manufacturing and service organizations have multiple sites and generations. In contrast to prior research, we study both types of knowledge transfer simultaneously in a high-tech after-sales service organization. In doing so, we provide new insights into the learning processes of high-tech firms providing global after-service. We leverage 10 years of weekly observations of after-sales service experience and performance of a firm in the semiconductor industry to test learning curve models with cross-site and cross-generation knowledge transfer and temporal distance between generations. Our empirical model tests the impact of these different sources of experience on the downtime performance of five machine generations serviced by 30 globally distributed service sites. We find knowledge transfer across sites and generations, except for cross-site knowledge transfer from newer to older generations. That is, the introduction of new products disturbs the cross-site learning process of older products. Furthermore, cross-generation knowledge transfer is conditional to the temporal distance between product generations. Knowledge transfer decreases when the temporal distance increases.

  abstract     = {In the sports industry, governing bodies often have regulations for political and societal purposes. Despite their well-meaning intentions, the regulations often tend to be detrimental to stakeholders, including players and sports clubs. This study investigates the impact of the Football Association’s homegrown regulation on the operational efficiency of football clubs in the English Premier League (EPL). Using data envelopment analysis, we calculate the efficiency scores of 10 EPL clubs and compare them before and after the implementation of the regulation. Our results show that the efficiency of EPL football clubs decreased after the regulation was implemented, supporting the adverse effects of the homegrown rule. Our results further reveal that clubs were affected by the regulation to varying degrees. The distinct patterns of efficiency score changes in some clubs are explained by their unique managerial circumstances, such as ownership changes. Compliance costs, which vary depending on the level of each club’s youth academy system, also moderate the impact of the regulation. The findings of this study imply that imposing homegrown regulation on clubs unanimously without considering clubs’ different conditions leads to operational inefficiencies, generating adverse effects. This study has rich implications with respect to the productivity management of team sports. It also provides deep insights for the governing bodies trying to develop better policies.

  abstract     = {Cyber insurance is becoming an essential tool for managing cybersecurity risks. In this study, we analyze how having the option to subscribe to cyber insurance services affects firms’ risk prevention and mitigation decisions. We model the scenario where the firm purchases cyber insurance in a competitive insurance market and compare it against the case when it does not purchase cyber insurance. When there is a breach, cyber insurance can help cover mitigation expenses and breach losses. Consistent with the prior literature, we find that in most cases cyber insurance exacerbates ex ante moral hazard by decreasing expected risk prevention. However, it enhances ex post efforts by increasing expected risk mitigation, which can lead to more positive outcomes for the insured firm. The mechanism involves designing the contract with a delicate calibration of the coverage of breach losses and the coinsurance rate. Moreover, the findings highlight the importance of a healthy risk mitigation service market in managing cybersecurity risks.

  abstract     = {Most current reservation systems include only time slots as reservation information. Customers need only to make a reservation by choosing a proper time. The value generated by a reservation is unknown until the customers are served. Therefore, an important shortcoming of current reservation systems is that they require limited information from customers, engendering a loss of social welfare. We surmise that an innovative reservation system including space value can produce more desired outcomes by considering various factors, such as social distancing during a pandemic. Based on that supposition, we adopt the Vickrey–Clarke–Groves (VCG) mechanism to achieve social welfare maximization and strategy-proofness. To offset VCG mechanism shortcomings in practical applications, we converted the VCG mechanism to a multistage online VCG mechanism that can do timely processing of customers’ reservations and can thereby maximize social welfare. The multistage online VCG mechanism generates higher social welfare than most current reservation systems, which use a first-come, first-served mechanism. Additionally, we demonstrate that, by adjusting the VCG mechanism bid number to a practical level, the reservation process can be improved considerably with a probability of more than 99% for satisfying the strategy-proofness of the VCG mechanism.

  abstract     = {This paper considers orders that arrive one-by-one over time to a fulfillment center. Each order requests a product with some degree of customization that needs to be delivered expeditiously to a nearby location using a delivery vehicle. However, each vehicle can batch multiple orders together for delivery within a single trip. The benefits of batching include more efficient capacity utilization, lower total vehicle ownership requirements, and reduced environmental impact. The main drawback of batching is the consequent reduced average quality of service due to associated delivery delays when waiting for additional orders to arrive and executing a delivery route. To address this trade-off, we consider a set of threshold policies for batching and dispatching groups of orders, and characterize the associated long-run average cost per unit time for each policy that explicitly accounts for the customer’s total order lead time, including the time between order dispatch and delivery to the customer which, in turn, depends on route sequencing policies. For the threshold policies, our state variable may not only include the number of outstanding orders, but may also incorporate information on order arrival times and delivery locations. We model the stochastic dynamics of the system and obtain the long-run average cost per unit time, which we compute using a renewal-reward approach. We also consider different delivery sequencing approaches, including first-come, first-served and shortest traveling salesperson. In addition, we evaluate the effectiveness of accounting for all order information in the decision-making process, as opposed to just the number of outstanding orders or the time in the system for each order. Our analysis shows that a generalized class of cost- and quantity-based threshold policies often outperforms existing policies in the literature with the additional benefits of being robust to overestimates of the optimal cost threshold value and achieving strong delay cost performance.

  abstract     = {Customer arrival patterns observed in the real world typically exhibit strong seasonal effects. It is therefore natural to ask, can a nonhomogeneous Poisson process (NHPP) with a rate function that is the simple sum of sinusoids provide an adequate description of reality? If so, how can the sinusoidal NHPP be used to improve the performance of service systems? We empirically validate that the sinusoidal NHPP is consistent with arrival data from two settings of great interest in service operations: patient arrivals to an emergency department and customer calls to a bank call centre. This finding provides rigorous justification for the use of the sinusoidal NHPP assumption in many existing queuing models. We also clarify why a sinusoidal NHPP model is more suitable than the standard NHPP when the underlying arrival pattern is aperiodic (e.g., does not follow a weekly cycle). This is illustrated using data from a car dealership and also via a naturalistic staffing simulation based on the call centre. On the other hand, if the arrival pattern is periodic, we explain why both models should perform comparably. Even then, the sinusoidal NHPP is still necessary for managers to use to verify that the arrival pattern is indeed periodic, a step that is seldom performed in applications. Code for fitting the sinusoidal NHPP to data is provided on GitHub. History: This paper has been accepted for the Service Science/Stochastic Systems Joint Special Issue. Funding: N.

Based on social identity theory, this paper builds a research framework that is empirically tested using a sample of 465 patients or their families from one of the largest high-level hospitals in China. Structural equation modeling and a bootstrapping method were adopted to test the model and the mediation effects. Results of data analysis reveal that customer–organization identification has a direct positive influence on customer citizenship behavior, and customer–employee identification and customer–employee trust have positive mediation effects between customer–organization identification and customer citizenship behavior.

The accelerated development of bed-and-breakfasts (B&amp;Bs) in the context of a rural revitalization strategy implies a shift in people’s demand from standardized to personalized accommodation. From the first establishment to the well-developed industry, the competition among diverse B&amp;Bs is getting fiercer, and it is essential for business operators to understand their customers deeply and timely. Therefore, online reviews posted by customers freely and in real time were adopted to explore key dimensions reflecting customer experience and examine their relationship with customer satisfaction, which is a vital antecedent for customer loyalty, repurchase intention, etc. A total of 8,691 reviews from Ctrip were collected and then used for extracting relative insights and cognition by qualitative and quantitative analysis. Consequently, several implications for future research development and practical application are discussed for service promotion and development of the B&amp;B industry.

  abstract     = {Emerging on-demand service platforms (OSPs) have recently embraced teamwork as a strategy for stimulating workers’ productivity and mediating temporal supply and demand imbalances. This research investigates the team contest scheme design problem considering work schedules. Introducing teams on OSPs creates a hierarchical single-leader multi-follower game. The leader (platform) establishes rewards and intrateam revenue-sharing rules for distributing workers’ payoffs. Each follower (team) competes with others by coordinating the schedules of its team members to maximize the total expected utility. The concurrence of interteam competition and intrateam coordination causes dual effects, which are captured by an equilibrium analysis of the followers’ game. To align the platform’s interest with workers’ heterogeneous working-time preferences, we propose a profit-maximizing contest scheme consisting of a winner’s reward and time-varying payments. A novel algorithm that combines Bayesian optimization, duality, and a penalty method solves the optimal scheme in the nonconvex equilibrium-constrained problem. Our results indicate that teamwork is a useful strategy with limitations. Under the proposed scheme, team contest always benefits workers. Intrateam coordination helps teams strategically mitigate the negative externalities caused by overcompetition among workers. For the platform, the optimal scheme can direct teams’ schedules toward more profitable market equilibria when workers have inaccurate perceptions of the market.

  abstract     = {As a result of rapid advancements in urban infrastructure and technology, transportation is transforming a variety of innovative and emerging services. This paper introduces the concept of transportation-enabled services (TRENS), which is a service model that uses transportation systems to enable and enhance the delivery, accessibility, and effectiveness of nontransportation services. We establish a general framework in which the transportation-enabled services involve four key stakeholders: customers, suppliers, TRENS providers, and transportation carriers. Within this general framework, we present five specific service models: a one-sided market, three variants of two-sided markets, and a three-sided market, each characterized by the interactions among suppliers, TRENS providers, and transportation carriers. Taking different models of transportation-enabled services into consideration, we highlight crucial research opportunities to enhance understanding of the planning, operations, evaluation, and regulation of transportation-enabled services. These research opportunities include demand and supply management, transportation system management and operations, coordination among stakeholders, and the evaluation and regulation of transportation-enabled services. We believe that the emergence, widespread adoption, and popularity of transportation-enabled services will significantly enhance and reshape many services and thus contribute to the overall improvement of future mobility in the broader context of smart cities.
