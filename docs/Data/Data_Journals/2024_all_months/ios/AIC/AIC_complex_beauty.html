  abstract     = {Human action recognition has been widely used in fields such as human–computer interaction and virtual reality. Despite significant progress, existing approaches still struggle with effectively integrating hierarchical information and processing data beyond a certain frame count. To address these c hallenges, we introduce the Multi-AxisFormer (MAFormer) model, which is organized in terms of spatial, temporal, and channel dimensions of the action sequence, thereby enhancing the model’s understanding of correlations and intricate structures among and within features. Drawing on the Transformer architecture, we propose the Cross-channel Spatio-temporal Aggregation (CSA) structure for more refined feature extraction and the Multi-Axis Attention (MAA) module for more comprehensive feature aggregation. Moreover, the integration of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) boosts the model’s extrapolation and generalization abilities. MAFormer surpasses the known state-of-the-art on multiple skeleton-based action recognition benchmarks with the accuracy of 93.2% on NTU RGB+D 60 cross-subject split, 89.9% on NTU RGB+D 120 cross-subject split, and 97.2% on N-UCLA, offering a novel paradigm for hierarchical modeling in human action recognition.},

  abstract     = {Diversity plays a major role when a student is looking for a tutor to better understand some concepts or an entire course. In fact, algorithms for recommending potential tutors have to take into account several aspects of diversity that may be critical to successful tutoring. The tutor must have th e appropriate competencies in the subject matter. In addition, he/she must be able to convey the knowledge and skills associated with the tutoring topic. Moreover, the personality traits of the tutee and the tutor can facilitate or hinder the learning process during tutoring. This study presents the experience of ‘SOS TUTORÍA UC’, a responsive web application aimed at facilitating academic assistance among students. Special emphasis is placed on the importance of incorporating dimensions of diversity that can inform the artificial intelligence algorithms of the potential tutor recommendation system. Indeed, competence in the topic tutored is the first diversity criterion for recommending more knowledgeable potential tutors. In addition, the tutee has to choose whether to look for tutors with personalities that are “different”, “similar” or “indifferent” to his or her own preferences for academic assistance on the specific topic. To achieve this, ‘SOS TUTORÍA UC’ is integrated with the WeNet platform, which provides user management services and user recommendation algorithms. The results of the testing of the recommendation system were positive with regard to the criterion of competence, while the criterion of personality should be addressed for improvement. In order to improve the tutor-tutee matching process, participants emphasized the importance of considering the criterion of personality traits in addition to competence. They also requested additional information and parameters to facilitate tutor selection.},

  abstract     = {Swin Transformers have been designed and used in various image super-resolution (SR) applications. One of the recent image restoration methods is RSTCANet, which combines Swin Transformer with Channel Attention. However, for some channels of images that may carry less useful information or noise, C hannel Attention cannot automatically learn the insignificance of these channels. Instead, it tries to enhance their expression capability by adjusting the weights. It may lead to excessive focus on noise information while neglecting more essential features. In this paper, we propose a new image SR method, RSVTCANet, based on an extension of Swin2SR. Specifically, to effectively gather global information for the channel of images, we modify the Residual SwinV2 Transformer blocks in Swin2SR by introducing the coordinate attention for each two successive SwinV2 Transformer Layers (S2TL) and replacing Multi-head Self-Attention (MSA) with Efficient Multi-head Self-Attention version 2 (EMSAv2) to employ the resulting residual SwinV2 Transformer coordinate attention blocks (RSVTCABs) for feature extraction. Additionally, to improve the generalization of RSVTCANet during training, we apply an optimized RandAugment for data augmentation on the training dataset. Extensive experimental results show that RSVTCANet outperforms the recent image SR method regarding visual quality and measures such as PSNR and SSIM.},

To address this issue, A multi-average based pseudo nearest neighbor classifier (M APNN) rule is proposed. In the proposed MAPNN rule, k(k−1)/2 (k&gt;1) local mean vectors of each class are obtained by taking the average of two points randomly from k nearest neighbors in every category, and then k pseudo nearest neighbors are chosen from k(k−1)/2 local mean neighbors of every class to determine the category of a query point. The selected k pseudo nearest neighbors can reduce the negative impact of outliers in some degree. Extensive experiments are carried out on twenty-one numerical real data sets and four artificial data sets by comparing MAPNN to other five KNN-based methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MAPNN is effective for classification task and achieves better classification results in the small-size samples cases comparing to five relative KNN-based classifiers.},

Therefore, the issue of open-world object detection has attracted significant attention. Open-world object detection faces two major challenges: “neglecting unknown obj ects” and “misclassifying unknown objects as known ones.” In our study, we address these challenges by utilizing the Region Proposal Network (RPN) outputs to identify potential unknown objects with high object scores that do not overlap with ground truth annotations. We introduce the reselection mechanism, which separates unknown objects from the background. Subsequently, we employ the simulated annealing algorithm to disentangle features of unknown and known classes, guiding the detector’s learning process. Our method has improved on multiple evaluation metrics such as U-mAP, U-recall, and UDP, greatly alleviating the challenges faced by open world object detection.},

  abstract     = {Under the foggy environment, lane line images are obscured by haze, which leads to lower detection accuracy, higher false detection of lane lines. To address the above problems, a multi-layer feature fusion dehazing network based on CycleGAN architecture is proposed. Firstly, the foggy image is enh anced to remove the fog in the image, and then the lane line detection network is used for detection. For the dehazing network, a multi-layer feature fusion module is used in the generator to fuse the features of different coding layers of U-Net to enhance the network’s recovery of information such as details and edges, and a frequency domain channel attention mechanism is added at the key nodes of the network to enhance the network’s attention to different fog concentrations. At the same time, to improve the discriminant effect of the discriminator, the discriminator is extended to a global and local discriminator. The experimental results show that the dehaze effect on Reside and other test data sets is better than the comparison method. The peak signal-to-noise ratio is improved by 2.26 dB compared to the highest GCA-Net algorithm. According to the lane detection of fog images, it is found that the proposed network improves the accuracy of lane detection on foggy days.},

  abstract     = {When the sensor dynamically collects point cloud data for object or map reconstruction, the registration effect is poor and reconstruction application is difficult with a too low overlap rate of the collected point cloud data. The reason is that the objects are covered, the sensor rotation angle is too large and the speed of movement is too fast. Because of these problems, this paper proposes a point cloud registration algorithm based on FPFH feature matching, combined with second-order spatial measures. Firstly, using the FPFH feature extraction algorithm, the features of each point are extracted, and then feature matching is performed to generate the set of feature point pairs. Secondly, the second-order spatial measure is used to calculate the set of feature point pairs to obtain the second-order spatial measure matrix scores and sort them. Finally, the dichotomy method is used to find the appropriate second-order spatial measure scores for distinguishing the inner points (points in the overlap region) from the outer points (points that do not belong to the overlap region as well as the mismatched points and some disturbances). The contrast experiments between this algorithm and three common point cloud registration algorithms, FPFH-ICP, 4PCS-ICP, and NDT-ICP, on the Stanford dataset and 3DMatch dataset shows that the registration accuracy of the other algorithms decreases significantly with a low overlap rate. But this algorithm still has a high registration accuracy and is less affected by outliers than the other algorithms. Besides, this algorithm can still maintain a good registration effect on different data sets.},

Block deordering is a variant of plan deordering that encapsulates coherent actions into blocks t o eliminate further ordering constraints from a partial-order plan (POP) and is useful in many applications (e.g., generating macro-actions and improving the overall plan quality). The existing block deordering strategy is formulated in propositional encodings. Finite-domain state variable encodings (e.g., SAS+ representation), in contrast with propositional encodings, can capture the internal structure and the behavior of state variables of a planning instance through concise constructs such as causal graphs (CGs) and domain transition graphs (DTGs). This work redefines the semantics of block deordering terminologies and related plan deordering concepts in finite domain representation (FDR). Our proposed semantics also resolves some limitations of the existing block semantics and further enhance plan flexibility. In addition, this work exploits block deordering to eliminate redundant actions from a POP. A comparative analysis is also performed on block deordering with various deordering/reordering techniques using explanation-based order generalization (EOG) and MaxSAT. Our experiments on the benchmark problems from International Planning Competitions (IPC) show that our FDR formalism of block deordering significantly improves the plan execution flexibility while maintaining good coverage and execution time.},

To address these issues, we propose a novel hybrid framework HSTGCN for pedestrian intent prediction that combines spatio-temporal graph convolutional neural networks (STGCN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. The proposed framework utilizes the strengths of both models by fusing multiple features, including skeleton pose, trajectory, height, orientation, and ego-vehicle speed, to predict their intentions accurately. The framework’s performance have been evaluated on the JAAD benchmark dataset and the results show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The proposed framework has potential applications in developing intelligent transportation systems, autonomous vehicles, and pedestrian safety technologies.

  abstract     = {We present an approach to autonomous drone racing inspired by how a human pilot learns a race track. Human pilots drive around the track multiple times to familiarise themselves with the track and find key points that allow them to complete the track without the risk of collision. This paper propos es a three-stage approach: exploration, navigation, and refinement. Our approach does not require prior knowledge about the race track, such as the number of gates, their positions, and their orientations. Instead, we use a trained neural pilot called DeepPilot to return basic flight commands from camera images where a gate is visible to navigate an unknown race track and a Single Shot Detector to visually detect the gates during the exploration stage to identify points of interest. These points are then used in the navigation stage as waypoints in a flight controller to enable faster flight and navigate the entire race track. Finally, in the refinement stage, we use the methodology developed in stages 1 and 2, to generate novel data to re-train DeepPilot, which produces more realistic manoeuvres for when the drone has to cross a gate. In this sense, similar to the original work, rather than generating examples by flying in a full track, we use small tracks of three gates to discover effective waypoints to be followed by the waypoint controller. This produces novel training data for DeepPilot without human intervention. By training with this new data, DeepPilot significantly improves its performance by increasing its flight speed twice w.r.t. its original version. Also, for this stage 3, we required 66% less training data than in the original DeepPilot without compromising the effectiveness of DeepPilot to enable a drone to autonomously fly in a racetrack.},

One of these challenges is the enormous amount of data collected by the different sensors in our society, namely in management processes such as Wastewater Treatment Plants (W WTPs). These infrastructures comprise several processes to treat wastewater and discharge clean water in water courses. Therefore, the concentration of pollutants must be below the allowable emissions limits. In this work, anomaly detection models were conceived, tuned and evaluated to monitor essential parameters such as nitrate and ammonia concentrations and pH to improve WWTP management. Four Machine Learning models were considered, particularly Local Outlier Fraction, Isolation Forest, One-Class Support Vector Machines and Long Short-Term Memory-Autoencoders (LSTM-AE), to detect anomalies in the three parameters mentioned. Through the different experiments, it was possible to verify that, in terms of F1-Score, the best candidate model for the three analyzed parameters was LSTM-AE-based, with a value consistently higher than 97%.},

As a result, the absence of information about the dynamics in these node representations can harm the accuracy and increase processing time of machine learning tasks related to these applications. Aiming at fill the gap regarding the inability of static methods to capture evolving processes on dynamic networks, we propose a biased random walk method named Evolving Node Embedding (EVNE). EVNE leverages the sequential relationship of graph snapshots by incorporating historic information when generating embeddings for the next snapshot. It learns node representations through a neural network, but differs from existing methods as it: (i) incorporates previously run walks at each step; (ii) starts the optimization of the current embedding from the parameters obtained in the previous iteration; and (iii) uses two time-varying parameters to regulate the behavior of the biased random walks over the process of graph exploration. Through a wide set of experiments we show that our approach generates better embeddings, outperforming baselines by up to 20% in a downstream node classification task. EVNE’s embeddings achieve better performance than others, based on experiments with four classifiers and five datasets. In addition, we present seven variations of our model to show the impact of each of EVNE’s mechanisms.},

Conventionally, both loss functions are combined by a weighted sum, whose weights are usually chosen manually. It is known that balancing between different loss terms can make the training process more efficient. In addition, it is necessary to find the optimal architecture of the neural network in order to find a hypothesis set in which is easier to train the PINN. In our work, we propose a multi-objective optimization approach to find the optimal value for the loss function weighting, as well as the optimal activation function, number of layers, and number of neurons for each layer.

Hence, we propose a new a rgumentation framework where arguments are built from a n-ary multi-modal logic. It allows to express different kinds of operators, e.g. nullary choice or moral worth operators, dyadic deontic operators or mental states. However the standard attacks based on logical contradictions are no longer sufficient to catch an intuitive meaning for attacks. Hence, we enrich standard attacks by characterizing how oppositions between modal operators arise. Furthermore we show the standard logic-based attacks have a quasi-symmetry property, i.e. when an argument attacks another, this argument is necessarily attacked by another one. Our modal attacks do not have this property, which is highly relevant to decide a dilemma.},

However, these operations may require to express some uncertainty or some disjunction in the result, which is not representable in classical AFs. For this reason, some of these earlier works require a set of AFs or a set of extensions as the outcome of the operation, somehow to represent a “disjunction” of AFs or extensions. In parallel, the notion of Incomplete AFs (IAFs) has been developed recently. It corresponds to AFs where the existence of some arguments or attacks may be uncertain. Each IAF can be associated with a set of classical AFs called completions, that correspond to different ways of resolving the uncertainty. While these IAFs could be good candidates for a compact representation of a disjunction of AFs, we prove that this model is not expressive enough. Then we introduce Constrained IAFs, that include a propositional formula allowing to select the set of completions used for reasoning. We prove that this model is expressive enough for representing any set of AFs, or any set of extensions. Moreover, we study the complexity of various decision problems related to the verification of extensions and the acceptability of arguments. While some of them are one level higher in the polynomial hierarchy (compared to their counterpart with standard IAFs), most of them have the same complexity than in the case of IAFs. Finally, we show that CIAFs can be used to model a new form of extension enforcement, where the possible evolutions of an AF are taken into account and modeled by the completions of the CIAF.},

  abstract     = {The increasing demand for mobility in our society poses various challenges to traffic engineering, computer science in general, and artificial intelligence in particular. Increasing the capacity of road networks is not always possible, thus a more efficient use of the available transportation infra structure is required. Another issue is that many problems in traffic management and control are inherently decentralized and/or require adaptation to the traffic situation. Hence, there is a close relationship to multiagent reinforcement learning. However, using reinforcement learning poses the challenge that the state space is normally large and continuous, thus it is necessary to find appropriate schemes to deal with discretization of the state space. To address these issues, a multiagent system with agents learning independently via a learning algorithm was proposed, which is based on estimating Q-values from k-nearest neighbors. In the present paper, we extend this approach and include transfer of experiences among the agents, especially when an agent does not have a good set of k experiences. We deal with traffic signal control, running experiments on a traffic network in which we vary the traffic situation along time, and compare our approach to two baselines (one involving reinforcement learning and one based on fixed times). Our results show that the extended method pays off when an agent returns to an already experienced traffic situation.},

  abstract     = {A cooperative is a business entity with the primary objective of providing benefits, services, and goods to its members, who both own and exercise democratic control over it. In the context of a cooperative, a fleet typically consists of vehicles owned by self-concerned individually rational owners who prioritize their own efficiency and the fairness of the system. This fairness refers to how their individual gain aligns with the gain of others. In this paper, we focus on the routing of such cooperative fleets. Considering only the fleet’s efficiency in terms of minimising its overall cost, the studied problem corresponds to the multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (mTSP). However, our interest lies in finding both efficient and fair solutions, so we propose two new variants of this problem that integrate and maximise the fleet’s egalitarian and elitist social welfare. Additionally, to enhance the balance between fleet efficiency and fairness, we propose the systematic elitist and systematic egalitarian social welfare optimisation algorithm. Through simulation results, we observe a wide diversity of routes depending on the approach considered. Therefore, a cooperative may choose a model that best balances its fleet’s efficiency and fairness based on its specific requirements.},

  abstract     = {Connected Autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are expected to improve the safety and efficiency of traffic by automating driving tasks. Amongst those, lane changing is particularly challenging, as it requires the vehicle to be aware of its highly-dynamic surrounding environment, make decisions, and enact th em within very short time windows. As CAVs need to optimise their actions based on a large set of data collected from the environment, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been widely used to develop CAV motion controllers. These controllers learn to make efficient and safe lane changing decisions using on-board sensors and inter-vehicle communication. This paper, first presents four overlapping fields that are key to the future of safe self-driving cars: CAVs, motion control, RL, and safe control. It then defines the requirements for a safe CAV controller. These are used firstly to compare applications of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to CAV lane change controllers. The requirements are then used to evaluate state-of-the-art safety methods used for RL-based motion controllers. The final section summarises research gaps and possible opportunities for the future development of safe MARL-based CAV motion controllers. In particular, it highlights the requirement to design MARL controllers with continuous control for lane changing. Moreover, as RL algorithms by themselves do not guarantee the level of safety required for such safety-critical applications, it offers insights and challenges to integrate safe RL methods with MARL-based CAV motion controllers.},

  abstract     = {Traffic systems play a key role in modern society. However, these systems are increasingly suffering from problems, such as congestions. A well-known way to efficiently reduce this kind of problem is to perform traffic light control intelligently through reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. In t his context, extracting relevant features from the traffic environment to support decision-making becomes a central concern. Examples of such features include vehicle counting on each queue, identification of vehicles’ origins and destinations, among others. Recently, the advent of deep learning has paved to way to efficient methods for extracting some of the aforementioned features. However, the problem of identifying vehicles and their origins and destinations within an intersection has not been fully addressed in the literature, even though such information has shown to play a role in RL-based traffic signal control. Building against this background, in this work we propose a deep learning pipeline for extracting relevant features from intersections based on traffic scenes. Our pipeline comprises three main steps: (i) a YOLO-based object detector fine-tuned using the UAVDT dataset, (ii) a tracking algorithm to keep track of vehicles along their trajectories, and (iii) an origin-destination identification algorithm. Using this pipeline, it is possible to identify vehicles as well as their origins and destinations within a given intersection. In order to assess our pipeline, we evaluated each of its modules separately as well as the pipeline as a whole. The object detector model obtained 98.2% recall and 79.5% precision, on average. The tracking algorithm obtained a MOTA of 72.6% and a MOTP of 74.4%. Finally, the complete pipeline obtained an average error rate of 3.065% in terms of origin and destination counts.},

  abstract     = {The majority of existing rotating target detectors inherit the horizontal detection paradigm and design the rotational regression loss based on the inductive paradigm. But the loss design limitation of the inductive paradigm makes these detectors hardly detect effectively tiny targets with high acc uracy, particularly for large-aspect-ratio objects. Therefore, in view of the fact that horizontal detection is a special scenario of rotating target detection and based on the relationship between rotational and horizontal detection, we shift from an inductive to a deductive paradigm of design to develop a new regression loss function named Gauss–Wasserstein scattering (GWS). First, the rotating bounding box is transformed into a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution, and then the regression losses between Gaussian distributions are calculated as the Wasserstein scatter; By analyzing the gradient of centroid regression, centroid regression is shown to be able to adjust gradients dynamically based on object characteristics, and small targets requiring high accuracy detection rely on this mechanism, and more importantly, it is further demonstrated that GWS is scale-invariant while possessing an explicit regression logic. The method is performed on a large public remote sensing dataset DOTA and two popular detectors and achieves a large accuracy improvement in both large aspect ratio targets and small targets detection compared to similar methods.},

For accessing the quality measure of each gait, a gait covariate invariant generative adversarial network (GCI-GAN) is proposed to generate normal gait (canonical condition) irrespective of covariates (carrying, and viewing conditions) while preserving the subject identity. In particular, GCI-GAN connects to gradient weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAMs) to obtain an attention mask from the significant components of input features, employs blending operation to manipulate specific regions of the input, and finally, multiple losses are employed to constrain the quality of generated samples. We validate the approach on gait datasets of CASIA-B and OU-ISIR and show a substantial increase in authentication rate over other state-of-the-art techniques.},

Policy reuse and other multi-policy reinforcement learning techniques can learn multiple tasks but may generate many policies. This paper presents two novel contributions, namely 1) Lifetime Policy Reuse, a model-agnostic policy reuse algorithm that avoids generating many policies by optimising a fixed number of near-optimal policies through a combination of policy optimisation and adaptive policy selection; and 2) the task capacity, a measure for the maximal number of tasks that a policy can accurately solve. Comparing two state-of-the-art base-learners, the results demonstrate the importance of Lifetime Policy Reuse and task capacity based pre-selection on an 18-task partially observable Pacman domain and a Cartpole domain of up to 125 tasks.},

The development of large datasets and the regression of convolutional models have enabled effective training of very large semantic model. Nevertheless, higher capacity indicates a higher computational problem, thus preventing real -time operation. Yet, due to the limited annotations, the models may have relied heavily on the available contexts in the training data, resulting in poor generalization to previously unseen scenes. Therefore, to resolve these issues, Enhanced Gated Pyramid network (GPNet) with Lightweight Attention Module (LAM) is proposed in this paper. GPNet is used for semantic feature extraction and GPNet is enhanced by the pre-trained dilated DetNet and Dense Connection Block (DCB). LAM approach is applied to habitually rescale the different feature channels weights. LAM module can increase the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The performance of proposed method is validated using Google Colab environment with different datasets such as Cityscapes, CamVid and ADE20K. The experimental results are compared with various methods like GPNet-ResNet-101 and GPNet-ResNet-50 in terms of IoU, precision, accuracy, F1 score and recall.

Moreover, to solve the problem regarding inadequate utilisation of relation information in entity alignment, a novel GCN-based model, joint Unsupervised Relation Alignment for Entity Alignment (URAEA), is proposed. The model first employs a novel method for calculating relation embeddings by using entity embeddings, then constructs unsupervised seed relation alignments through these relation embeddings, and finally performs entity alignment together with relation alignment.

The methodology used to implement the text2alm syste m was originally outlined by Lierler, Inclezan, and Gelfond (In IWCS 2017 – 12th International Conference on Computational Semantics – Short Papers (2017)) via a manual process of converting a narrative to an ALM model. We refine that theoretical methodology and utilize it in design of the text2alm system. This system relies on a conglomeration of resources and techniques from two distinct fields of artificial intelligence, namely, (i) knowledge representation and reasoning and (ii) natural language processing. The effectiveness of system text2alm is measured by its ability to correctly answer questions from the bAbI tasks published by Facebook Research in 2015. This tool matched or exceeded the performance of state-of-the-art machine learning methods in six of the seven tested tasks. We also illustrate that the text2alm approach generalizes to a broader spectrum of narratives. On the path to creating system text2alm, a semantic role labeler text2drs was designed. Its unique feature is the use of the elements of the fine grained linguistic ontology VerbNet as semantic roles/labels in annotating considered text.

  abstract     = {Swarm intelligence optimization algorithm has been proved to perform well in the field of parameter optimization. In order to further improve the performance of intelligent optimization algorithm, this paper proposes an improved and adaptive tunicate swarm algorithm (IMATSA) based on tunicate swarm algorithm (TSA). IMATSA improves TSA in the following four aspects: population diversity, local search convergence speed, jumping out of local optimal position, and balancing global and local search. Firstly, IMATSA adopts Tent map and quadratic interpolation to initialize population and enhance the diversity. Secondly, IMATSA uses Golden-Sine algorithm to accelerate the convergence of local search. Thirdly, in the process of global development, IMATSA adopts Levy flight and the improved Gauss disturbance method to adaptively improves and coordinates the ability of global development and local search. Then, this paper verifies the performance of IMATSA based on 14 benchmark functions experiment, ablation experiment, parameter optimization experiments of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), Wilcoxon signed rank test and image multi-threshold segmentation experiment with the performance metrics are convergence speed, convergence value, significance level P-value, Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Standard Deviation (STD). Experimental results show that IMATSA performs better in three kinds of benchmark functions; each component of IMATSA has a positive effect on the performance; IMATSA performs better in parameter optimization experiments of SVM experiment and GBDT; there is significant difference between IMATSA and other algorithms by Wilcoxon signed rank test; in image segmentation, the performance is directly proportional to the number of thresholds, and compared with other algorithms, IMATSA has better comprehensive performance.},
