  abstract     = {The Zebra Optimization Algorithm (ZOA) mimics the social behavior of zebras and is susceptible to the interference of local optimal solutions, leading to poor optimization and premature convergence. In this paper, we propose an improved zebra optimization algorithm (IZOA) that integrates several ad vanced strategies to overcome these problems. First, IZOA introduces a Lévy flight strategy in the foraging phase of the zebra population to expand the search range and improve the quality of individuals. At the same time, the “PZ” mechanism updates the other individuals based on the value of the leading zebra in each generation, which accelerates the optimization process and improves the searching ability. In addition, IZOA integrates a nonlinear convergence factor based on the COS function, which improves the convergence speed and balances the exploration and development phases. A Cauchy variation strategy is used to enhance the global search capability and help the population escape from local extremes. In CEC2017 and CEC2022 benchmarking and rolling bearing design applications, IZOA is compared with 12 mainstream and improved ZOA algorithms (CZOA and IIZOA), and shows better performance. Finally, IZOA is combined with LSTM network for wind power prediction to show its application advantages in real engineering design problems.},

Firstly, the processing operation tree of the product is mapped into an operation genealogy table, and an encoding method based on multi-child probability selection is proposed. Then, crossover methods based on descendant nodes, parent nodes, and positions are respectively introduced to ensure the legality of the generated offspring individuals. Additionally, two mutation methods, namely the single point mutation method based on movable range and the recoding mutation method based on a single node, are proposed to enhance population diversity. Lastly, a pre-decoding method driven by migration time and a forward-to-reverse scheduling scheme conversion strategy based on completion time reversal is resented. This paper conducts two sets of comparative experiments based on rules and based on metaheuristics, comparative experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other comparative algorithms in terms of solution quality.},

In other words, misjudgments occurring by the ambiguity with these various unlabeled traffic in situation ass essment of Industrial Internet need to solve urgently for above complex network scenario. In this paper, a new self-supervised situation assessment method FCVnet (FCM-CNN-ViT Net) is proposed to reduce the misjudgement probability. An enhanced fuzzy c-means clustering method EFCM (Enhanced Fuzzy C-means Clustering), is designed for the unlabelled traffic data. Meanwhile the self-supervised pre-training is carried out by improving initial cluster centre selection to obtain more accurate labels. In order to capture more global features for better feature representation, MCFV (Multi-Convolutional Fusion and Vision Transformer) module combining Multi-Convolutional Neural Network and Vision Transformer (ViT) is designed to capture and fuse features from local details to broader context. Experimental results show that the precision and recall of the proposed FCVnet are improved by 7.51% and 15.16% on average with two data sets.},

To address the above problems, we propose a Joint Reasoning-based Embedded Multi-hop KGQA (JREM-KGQA) method, which addresses these issues through three key innovations: 1) Early Joint Embedding. We construct a Question Answering-Knowledge Graph-Collaborative Work Diagram (QA-KG-CWD) and train the diagram using a knowledge graph embedding (KGE) model. This not only alleviates the knowledge graph sparsity but also effectively enhances the model’s long-path reasoning ability. 2) Semantic Fusion Module. We narrowed the semantic gap between the question modality and the knowledge graph modality through the semantic fusion module to achieve more effective reasoning. 3) Node Relevance Scoring. We employ three node relevance scoring strategies to ensure that the best answer is selected from the huge knowledge graph. We evaluated our model on MetaQA as well as PQL datasets and compared it with other methods. The results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms existing methods in terms of long-path reasoning ability, effective mitigation of knowledge graph sparsity, and overall performance.

  abstract     = {In recent years, the establishment of competitive markets has led researchers to pay more attention to the subject of supply chain design and competition in their studies. In this research, a multi-objective mathematical model is proposed for the design of a dynamic, integrated network in a competi tive, sustainable, and resilient closed-loop supply chain for perishable goods under disruptions. In this model, competition between two chains is examined with a focus on economic, environmental, social, and resilience considerations. To solve this competitive model, a two-stage approach is used. In the first stage, game theory is employed to determine equilibrium values in competitive decisions, and considering the complexities of the model, the Multi Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) metaheuristic algorithms are used to solve the supply chain design problem. To evaluate the efficiency of the model and the proposed solution approach, the performance of each algorithm is analyzed based on five criteria: computation time, distance, average distance from the ideal solution, diversity, and the number of solutions examined, using random numerical examples. The results are analyzed graphically and statistically. In comparison to the NSGA-II algorithm, the MOPSO algorithm demonstrates better performance in terms of all criteria, with average improvements of 36.5% in distance, 33.9% in average distance from the ideal solution, 20.8% in diversity, and 79.6% in the number of solutions examined. The results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and model in designing sustainable and resilient supply chain networks under competition for perishable goods.},

The development is based on a machine vision system, through a camera mounted on the rob ot, capturing scenes from different environments within a residential home to identify its current location. PROBLEM:Robotic navigation’s kinematics are usually implemented in spatial coordinates of an unknown environment, thus limiting the human-robot interaction to a naive completion of commands by ignoring the potential behind the environmental context in which the robot behaves. The integration of artificial vision into robotic navigation is expected to enhance a robot’s performance in supporting domestic environment tasks. METHODOLOGY:To achieve the identification of the robot’s location and its direction of movement, a convolutional neural network is employed, which has two branches that identify different aspects of the environment from the robot’s perspective. Once a destination is set within the environment, a branched exploration algorithm is implemented, allowing the robot to navigate while knowing its location. RESULTS:Mobile robotic algorithms for path planning and obstacle avoidance were implemented along with a 98.33% accuracy CNN measured on its capacity to identify residential rooms from the robot’s first-person perspective. These algorithms’ incorporation resulted in the successful guidance of a tracked differential mobile robot through the rooms of a virtual residential environment, avoiding obstacles in the process and identifying locations through which the robot crosses.},

  abstract     = {Deep Hashing is a technique used for retrieving images on a large-scale, encoding the latent code of images into binary codes, which significantly reduces computational and storage costs in image retrieval. This enables fast similarity comparison and search. However, this technique encounters two s ignificant challenges: the extraction of discriminating category-specific image features and the conflict between metric learning and quantization learning. The latter challenge often results in the binary representation of latent codes being considerably ambiguous. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a novel Cross-Scale Fusion Deep Hash Network. The model is built upon a dual-branch framework, aiming to capture the most representative retrieval features. One branch employs Spatial Pyramid Pooling layers and a self-attention mechanism for local information extraction, whereas the other branch uses a sliding window methodology for capturing global information. Upon obtaining the local and global information, the Cross Feature Synergy Module proposed in this paper integrates these data points to form a comprehensive feature vector, ultimately generating a complete representation of the image. In order to address the conflict between metric learning and quantization learning, as well as improve the binary codes further, this paper introduces a meticulously designed, threshold-dependent Hash-Guided Metric Loss (HGM-Loss). The novel network proposed in this paper demonstrates superior retrieval performance in standard benchmark tests on multiple datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and MS-COCO, outperforming the existing hash methods.},

One of the most popular methods to attenuate the adverse effects of these is reconfiguration in RRPVA. However, the conventional reconfiguration only a ims to maximize power output. Hence, this paper proposes a multi-objective pelican optimization algorithm (MOPOA) to improve efficiency and extend the switching life for RRPVA. Comparing the reconfiguration results of the particle swarm algorithm (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA), the mismatch loss, power loss, performance ratio, and power enhancement percentage of RRPVA under different shading situations are calculated for each of the three algorithms. This paper simulates and analyzes 4×4 symmetric RRPVA and 4×3 asymmetric RRPVA. The results show that MOPOA is 8.4%, 8.5%, 11.2%, 11.5% better than PSO; and 3.8%, 3.5%, 7.6%, 5.6% better than GA in terms of percentage power enhancement (Pen) in 4×4 symmetric RRPVA. In the 4×3 asymmetric RRPVA, the Pen of MOPOA is 5.6%, 9.0%, 10.5%, 9.4% better than PSO, and 4.2%, 2.6%, 3.6%, 2.8% better than GA, respectively.

The algorithm is applied to solve a high-dimensional classification feature selection problem. Firstly, the algorithm’s global exploration and local exploitation ability can be dynamically balanced by introducing inertia weight coefficients w based on multiple learning strategies. Secondly, using the updated speed position formula of the sine-cosine acceleration strategy, individual butterflies’ autonomous search ability and convergence speed can be further improved. Finally, according to the fitness value of each butterfly individual, the moving step length and direction of the butterfly individual are automatically adjusted better to fit the actual search process of the butterfly individual, increase the search ability in the global range, and avoid the algorithm from falling into the local optimum. To verify the algorithm’s effectiveness, 18 high-dimensional classification numbers are selected to carry out simulation and comparison experiments between HBOA-SCV and traditional BOA algorithm, five improved BOA algorithms and other comparative algorithms for high-dimensional classification data successively. The experimental results show that the average fitness value and classification accuracy of the HBOA-SCV algorithm are better than the comparison algorithm, thus verifying the superiority of the HBOA-SCV algorithm.},

This limitation has spurred a research trend in Few-shot image Semantic Segmentation (FSS), which makes it possible to segment objects of new categories using only a few labeled samples. Although more and more FSS methods are emerging and gradually integrated into practical applications, a deep understanding of its achievements and issues is still missing. In this survey, we focus on the recent developments of FSS, specifically on FSS methods based on meta-learning. According to different network architectures, we summarize the related research into three classes, that are Convolutional Neural Network-based (CNN-based) models, Graph Neural Network-based (GNN-based) models, and Transformer-based models. Then, we explore the specific implementations of these models, including parameter-based methods, metric-based methods, attention-based methods, and optimization-based methods. Furthermore, we illustrate datasets and analyze the experimental results of various kinds of methods. Toward the end of the paper, we discuss the limitations of FSS and present its applications and challenges to provide further research directions.},

  abstract     = {Detecting behavioral changes associated with suicidal ideation on social media is essential yet complex. While machine learning and deep learning hold promise in this regard, current studies often lack generalizability due to single dataset reliance. Traditional embedding techniques struggle with s emantic analysis,leading to challenges in achieving high accuracy models and conventional validation methods have data drift limitations. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel evaluation approach using natural language processing across diverse platforms like Twitter and Reddit. By integrating BERT embedding, adept at handling semantic nuances, with an optimized Stacked Classifier combining different base classifiers and XGBoost as the meta-classifier, the model excels in swiftly detecting signs of suicidal ideation compared to the Voting Classifier, i.e., the combination of Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boost and XGBoost and several machine learning models. Additionally, the study explores advanced embedding techniques like MUSE and LLM, and deep learning models including Bi-LSTM, Bi-GRU, and Text-CNN for comparison.This ensemble approach aims to create a model that is not only interpretable but also robust, reducing computational complexity and enhancing resilience against noisy data—common challenges faced in text classification tasks. Through K-fold validation, which involves partitioning the dataset into k equal-sized subsets or &quot;folds&quot; and training the model k times, using k-1 folds for training and one-fold for testing each time, the proposed model achieves impressive accuracy rates of 97% on Reddit and 96% on Twitter datasets, underscoring its effectiveness in identifying suicidal ideation across social media platforms.},

In this paper the A3C algorithm has been applied to integrate strategy learning and value learning for the circuit structure optimization. This integration can facilitate continuous interaction with the environment, enabling automatic adjustment of circuit structures to meet the complex design requirements. Gain, bandwidth, latency, and power consumption have been set as the optimization objectives, and the actions of the intelligent agent, which include adding, deleting, modifying connection lines, and adjusting component parameters have been introduced in detail. Once the Actor and Critic networks have been established, multiple agents can operate concurrently, translating optimization objectives into reward signals and providing direction and motivation for agent learning. Then with the proposed method, the circuit structure of one switch audio power amplifier has been designed in a simulation environment. The structure optimization results demonstrated that the gain can reach 78.4 dB at convergence of the A3C algorithm, while the bandwidth can reach 156.2 MHz at convergence, and both the circuit delay and power consumption have been reduced significantly. Obviously, the application of the A3C algorithm can effectively optimize the circuit structures through offering more flexible and efficient solutions.},

  abstract     = {Network security situation prediction is a complex task that typically requires extensive retraining of deep-learning models on vast amounts of sample data to achieve optimal performance. This paper proposes an innovative approach that integrates Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) with Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (BiGRU) to address these challenges. Our method harnesses the BiGRU model’s capability to learn from both preceding and succeeding conditions within network security prediction data, effectively extracting temporal information essential for prediction. This is complemented by Stochastic Gradient Descent for parameter updates, enhancing the model’s adaptability and learning efficiency. Furthermore, the MAML algorithm is incorporated to facilitate the BiGRU model’s swift adaptation to new tasks, thereby improving its generalization capabilities. The parameters are refined through a meta-learning process that calculates the sum of losses across multiple training instances and employs quadratic gradient descent for optimization. The empirical results of our approach demonstrate significant advancements, with goodness-of-fit decision coefficients of 0.926983 and 0.934452, representing a marked improvement of at least 18.0% and 15.8% over conventional deep learning models in the domain of network security situation prediction. This research novelty lies in the synergistic combination of MAML and BiGRU, which not only reduces the dependency on large datasets for retraining but also enhances the model’s predictive accuracy and generalization to novel network security scenarios. It contributes a robust and efficient solution to the critical problem of network security situation prediction and paves the way for future advancements in cybersecurity defense mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {As a powerful tool for learning high-dimensional data representation, graph neural networks (GNN) have been applied to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of rolling bearings. Existing GNN-based RUL prediction methods predominantly rely on constant pre-constructed graphs. However, the degradati on of bearings is a dynamic process, and the dependence information between features may change at different moments of degradation. This article introduces a method for RUL prediction based on dynamic graph spatial-temporal dependence information extraction. The raw signal is segmented into multiple periods, and multiple features of each period data are extracted. Then, the correlation coefficient analysis is conducted, and the feature connection graph of each period is constructed based on different analytical results, thereby dynamically mapping the degradation process. The graph data is fed into graph convolutional networks (GCN) to extract spatial dependence between the graph node features in different periods. To make up for the shortcomings of GCN in temporal dependence extraction, the TimesNet module is introduced. TimesNet considers the two-dimensional changes of time series data and can extract the temporal dependence of graph data within and between different time cycles. Experimental results based on the PHM2012 dataset show that the average RUL prediction error of the proposed method is 17.4%, outperforming other comparative methods.},

The registration rate in point cloud registration with low overlap specifically increased by 1.87%, while Error (R) was reduced by 12.75%, and there was a decrease of 5.86% in loss error.},

The objective of this work is to propose a process for assessing data risks in Cloud Computing. The process is based on fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) for qualitative reasoning. Risk assessment is a crucial aspect of Cloud Computing. Our proposed system involves three main steps based on expert knowledge. In the first step, a global FCM was built and validated to identify threats at the Cloud Computing level. Then the second step was devoted to calculate the consequences by inference using FCM Expert. The obtained results show that the FCM has a remarkable capacity to deal with the uncertainty of the data; by doing so, it becomes possible to model the real system more accurately. The last step is to simulate, analyze the results of the second step in Matlab Simulink and also develop recommendations to reduce the risks in order to improve and increase the security of Cloud data.},

In this paper, we propose the Fusing Semantic and Syntactic Information for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (FSSI) model, which incorporates both syntactic structure and semantic relevance in the context. Specifically, we construct a syntactic graph convolutional network to obtain comprehensive syntactic structure information and a semantic graph convolutional network to obtain global semantic relevance of sentences using the self-attention mechanism.

  abstract     = {The body size parameter of cattle is an important index reflecting the growth and development and health condition of cattle. The traditional manual contact measurement is not only a large workload and difficult to measure, but also prone to problems such as affecting the normal life habits of catt le. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a contactless body size measurement method for cattle based on machine vision. Firstly, the cattle is confined to a fixed space using a position-limiting device, and images of the body of the cattle are taken from three directions: top, left, and right, using multiple cameras. Secondly, the image is segmented using a fuzzy clustering algorithm based on neighborhood adaptive local spatial information improvement, and the image is processed to extract the contour images of the top view and side view. The key points of body measurements were extracted using interval division and curvature calculation for the side view images, and the key point information was extracted using skeleton extraction and pruning for the top view images, which realized the measurements of body height(BH), rump height(RH), body slanting length(BSL), and abdominal circumference(AC) parameters of the cattle. The correlation between body size and weight data obtained by contactless methods was investigated and the modeled using one-factor linear regression, one-factor nonlinear regression, multivariate stepwise regression, RBF network fitting, BP neural network fitting, support vector machine, and particle swarm optimization-based support vector machine methods, respectively. Information on body size parameters was collected from 137 cattles, and the results showed that the maximum errors between the measured and actual values of BH, RH, BSL and AC were 5.0%, 4.4%, 3.6%, and 5.5%, respectively. Correlation of BH, RH, BSL and AC with weight obtained by non-contact methods was &gt; 0.75. The BH parameter can be selected in the single-factor growth monitoring. The multi-body scale can reflect the growth status of cattle more comprehensively, in which RH, BSL and AC are important detection parameter; the multi-factor nonlinear model can reflect the growth characteristics of cattle more comprehensively. The contactless measurement method proposed in the paper can effectively improve the work efficiency and reduce the stress reaction of cattle, which is a long-term and effective monitoring method, and is of great significance in promoting accurate and welfare cattle rearing.},

There is a growing trend in utilizing deep learning and machine learning techniques for emotion recognition through EEG (electroe ncephalogram) signals. This paper presents an investigation based on a real-time dataset that comprises 15 subjects, consisting of 7 males and 8 females. The EEG signals of these subjects were recorded during exposure to video stimuli. The collected real-time data underwent preprocessing, followed by the extraction of features using various methods tailored for this purpose. The study includes an evaluation of model performance by comparing the accuracy and loss metrics between models applied to both raw and preprocessed data. The paper introduces the EEGEM (Electroencephalogram Ensemble Model), which represents an ensemble model combining LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to achieve the desired outcomes. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the EEGEM model, achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 95.56%. This model has proven to surpass the performance of other established machine learning and deep learning techniques in the field of emotion recognition, making it a promising and superior tool for this application.},

The limitations of traditional QFD methods lead to imprecise quantification of CRs and difficult y in accurately mapping customer needs. To address these issues, this paper introduces an innovative QFD approach that integrates extended hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets (EHFLTSs), CRITIC, and cumulative prospect theory. The method expresses the subjectivity and hesitancy of decision makers when evaluating the relationship between ECs and CRs using EHFLTSs, considering the conflicts among CRs. The CRITIC is used to comprehensively evaluate the comparison strength and conflict between indicators, and the cumulative prospect theory is utilized to derive the prioritization of ECs. A case study is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Hence, t his paper proposes data-driven robust maximum fairness consensus models (RMFCMs) to address these. First, this paper uses the robust optimization method to construct multiple uncertainty sets to describe the uncertainty of the DMs’ unit adjustment cost and proposes the RMFCMs. Subsequently, based on the DMs’ historical data, the DMs’ weights in the CRP are determined by a data-driven method based on the kernel density estimation (KDE) method. Finally, this paper also applies the proposed models to the carbon emission reduction negotiation process between governments and enterprises, and the experimental results verify the rationality and robustness of the proposed consensus model.},

It leverages deep learning techniques to transform molecular graphs into numerical vectors. Graph Transformer architecture is commonly used for molecular graph representation learning. Neverthele ss, existing methods based on the Graph Transformer fail to fully exploit the topological structural information of the molecular graphs, leading to information loss for molecular representation. To solve this problem, we propose a novel molecular graph representation learning method called MTS-Net (Molecular Topological Structure-Network), which combines both global and local topological structure of a molecule. In global topological representation, the molecule graph is first transformed into a tree structure and then encoded by employing a hash algorithm for tree. In local topological representation, paths between atom pairs are transcoded and incorporated into the calculation of the Transformer attention coefficients. Moreover, MTS-Net has intuitive interpretability for identifying key structures within molecules. Experiments on eight molecular property prediction datasets show that MTS-Net achieves optimal results in three out of five classification tasks, the average accuracy is 0.85, and all three regression tasks.},

MISSA improves the global search ability by impro ving the discoverer position update operator and introducing the sine cosine algorithm; adopts the adaptive number of vigilantes and adaptive adjustment step size to improve the convergence speed; introduces the Levy flight variation strategy to reduce the probability of falling into any local optimal solution; optimizes the boundary handling mechanism to prevent the loss of population diversity at a later stage; finally, uses the large-scale neighborhood search strategy and path smoothing mechanism for path optimization to further improve the path quality. The superiority-seeking ability of MISSA was verified by 12 standard test functions, and then 30 simulation experiments were conducted in grid maps with two specifications of 20×20 and 30×30. The experimental results showed that, by using MISSA, the path length was reduced by 44.1% and 63.1%, the number of turns was reduced by 68.4% and 78.4%, and the risk degree was reduced by 61.3% and 77.2%, which verifies the superiority of MISSA in path planning.

In this study, a new approach for fault diagnosis in unbalanced data sets is proposed using the Gramian angular field (GAF) method. Firstly, the GAF method is employed to convert one-dimensional data into two-dimensional data, which enhances the feature extraction process. Secondly, to balance the sample distribution, fault data is generated using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Finally, the Residual neural network (ResNet) with an attention mechanism is utilized to improve the accuracy of fault diagnosis. The proposed method is experimentally validated using open-source bearing datasets that are published by Case Western Reserve University and the University of Ottawa. The experimental results show that the proposed method has greatly improved fault diagnosis performance in cases of data distribution imbalance, surpassing that of the compared methods.},

  abstract     = {Imbalanced Learning is a significant issue in machine learning, affecting the performance and accuracy of binary or multi-classification algorithms, especially in large-scale data handling and classification. There are some popular techniques to covert this imbalanced data into a balanced one such as undersampling, under-sampling with tomek links, randomized oversampling, synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), and adaptive synthetic generation (ADASYN). Generally, the ADASYN algorithm could be used to propagate minority sample points to rise the imbalanced ratio between majority and minority sample points, but in some cases, it may conflict with decision boundary points and noisy points. This paper proposed a Refitted AdaSyn Algorithm (RAA) with Gaussian Distribution (GD). So that new minority samples are distributed much closer to the center of the minority sample to spotlight the conflicts. The classification accuracy has improved with RAA over formal ADASYN. For examining the proposed work the imbalanced benchmark datasets like European, Banksim, Paymentcard, and UCI credit card are considered. Vanilla Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a deep learning model used to classify fraud and non-fraud transactions, demonstrating significant differences between balanced and imbalanced learning approaches and achieving an accuracy of 97.5% on dataset DS4.},

Due to the small proportion of pixels, low resolution, less semantic information, and susceptibility to complex scenes, tiny text detection often results in many missed detections. To address this issue, this paper draws inspiration from small object detection methods and proposes TiTDet, a detection algorithm more suitable for tiny text. Firstly, this paper incorporates a context extraction module and an attention-guided module. These modules guide contextual information learning through a self attention mechanism, while eliminating the possible negative impact caused by redundant information. Regarding multi-scale feature fusion, this paper proposes a fine-grained effective fusion factor, making the fusion process emphasize small object learning more and highlight the feature expression of tiny texts. In terms of post-processing, this paper proposes a differentiable binarization module, incorporating the binarization process into model training. Leveraging the implicit information in the data to drive model improvement can enhance the post-processing effect. Lastly, this paper proposes a scale-sensitive loss, which can handle tiny texts more fairly, fully considering the positional relationship between the predicted and real regions, and better guiding the model training. This paper proves that TiTDet exhibits high sensitivity and accuracy in detecting tiny texts, achieving an 86.0% F1-score on ICDAR2015. The paper also compares the superiority of the method on CTW1500 and Total-Text.},

  abstract     = {Instance-Based Learning, such as the k Nearest Neighbor (kNN), offers a straightforward and effective solution for text classification. However, as a lazy learner, kNN’s performance heavily relies on the quality and quantity of training instances, often leading to time and space inefficiencies. Thi s challenge has spurred the development of instance-reduction techniques aimed at retaining essential instances and discarding redundant ones. While such trimming optimizes computational demands, it might adversely affect classification accuracy. This study introduces the novel Selective Learning Vector Quantization (SLVQ) algorithm, specifically designed to enhance the performance of datasets reduced through such techniques. Unlike traditional LVQ algorithms that employ random vector weights (codebook vectors), SLVQ utilizes instances selected by the reduction algorithm as the initial weight vectors. Importantly, as these instances often contain nominal values, SLVQ modifies the distances between these nominal values, rather than modifying the values themselves, aiming to improve their representation of the training set. This approach is crucial because nominal attributes are common in real-world datasets and require effective distance measures, such as the Value Difference Measure (VDM), to handle them properly. Therefore, SLVQ adjusts the VDM distances between nominal values, instead of altering the attribute values of the codebook vectors. Hence, the innovation of the SLVQ approach lies in its integration of instance reduction techniques for selecting initial codebook vectors and its effective handling of nominal attributes. Our experiments, conducted on 17 text classification datasets with four different instance reduction algorithms, confirm SLVQ’s effectiveness. It significantly enhances the kNN’s classification accuracy of reduced datasets. In our empirical study, the SLVQ method improved the performance of these datasets, achieving average classification accuracies of 82.55%, 84.07%, 78.54%, and 83.18%, compared to the average accuracies of 76.25%, 79.62%, 66.54%, and 78.19% achieved by non-fine-tuned datasets, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Visualization-based malware detection gets more and more attention for detecting sophisticated malware that traditional antivirus software may miss. The approach involves creating a visual representation of the memory or portable executable files (PEs). However, most current visualization-based mal ware classification models focus on convolution neural networks instead of Vision transformers (ViT) even though ViT has a higher performance and captures the spatial representation of malware. Therefore, more research should be performed on malware classification using vision transformers. This paper proposes a multi-variants vision transformer-based malware image classification model using multi-criteria decision-making. The proposed method employs Multi-variants transformer encoders to show different visual representation embeddings sets of one malware image. The proposed architecture contains five steps: (1) patch extraction and embeddings, (2) positional encoding, (3) multi-variants transformer encoders, (4) classification, and (5) decision-making. The variants of transformer encoders are transfer learning-based models i.e., it was originally trained on ImageNet dataset. Moreover, the proposed malware classifier employs MEREC-VIKOR, a hybrid standard evaluation approach, which combines multi-inconsistent performance metrics. The performance of the transformer encoder variants is assessed both on individual malware families and across the entire set of malware families within two datasets i.e., MalImg and Microsoft BIG datasets achieving overall accuracy 97.64 and 98.92 respectively. Although the proposed method achieves high performance, the metrics exhibit inconsistency across some malware families. The results of standard evaluation metrics i.e., Q, R, and U show that TE3 outperform the TE1, TE2, and TE4 variants achieving minimal values equal to 0. Finally, the proposed architecture demonstrates a comparable performance to the state-of-the-art that use CNNs.},

The counting system can alleviate the betrayal performance in the crowded areas. Most of the existing methods developed for tracking and counting face serious challenges in detection due to high densities of the target. This condition urged the researchers to update the existing systems. The present methodology was designed to address such issues. In the present methodology, the contrast was initially enhanced between the objects and their backgrounds using a Double Plateau Histogram Equalization (DPHE). Then, the motion was estimated for the contrast-enhanced image to identify the moment of the object using the modified Adaptive Distance Covariance Rood Pattern Search (ADCRPS) algorithm. After that, the morphological operation was deployed to sharpen the images by removing all the unwanted things. Then, the features were extracted and important features were selected using the modified Chaotic Tent Shuffled Shepherd Optimization (CTSSO) Algorithm. With the selected features object, detection was done using the proposed Scaled Non-Monotonic Cauchy Dense Convolutional Neural Network (SNMC-DenCNN). The detected object was then tracked with the aid of Channel and Spatial Reliability Tracker (CSRT). Finally, the objects were counted by intersection over union (IOU) by explicitly computing the association between detected and tracked objects. Also, the experimental results showed the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed system with enhanced accuracy.},

This study investigates the effectiveness of machine learning (ML) techniques in maritime transportation. Using a dataset of 581 samples with 8 input variables and 1 output variable (arrival time), ML models are constructed. The Pearson correlation matrix reduces input variables to 7 key factors: freight forwarder, dispatch location, loading and discharge ports, post-discharge location, dispatch day of the week, and dispatch week. The ranking of ML performance for predicting the arrival time of container ships can be arranged in descending order as GB-PSO &gt; XGB &gt; RF &gt; RF-PSO &gt; GB &gt; KNN &gt; SVR. The best ML model, GB-PSO, demonstrates high accuracy in predicting the arrival time of container ships, with R2 = 0.7054, RMSE = 7.4081 days, MAE = 5.1891 days, and MAPE = 0.0993% for the testing dataset. This is a promising research outcome as it seems to be the first time that an approach involving the use of minimal and easily collectible input factors (such as freight forwarder, dispatch time and place, port of loading, post port of discharge, port of discharge) and the combination of a machine learning model has been introduced for predicting the arrival time of container ships.},

It is reported by different agencies that there a re 16 types of PAHs in which BaP (Benzo[a] pyrene), BaA (Benz[a]anthracene), BbF(Benzo [b] fluoranthene), Chr (Chrysene) are considered to be carcinogenic and it can occur due to different processes. In processed food it occurs due to various processing methods like overheating, incomplete burning, drying etc. The presence of PAH in food is conventionally found through analytical, traditional, and semi-automatic methods. These methods are found to be valuable but expensive and time-consuming. Further, these methods are used only for the detection of PAHs and the toxicity level is measured or identified based on expert knowledge of researchers and the Standards. Therefore, in this research, a simple harmfulness index system has been developed using Fuzzy Logic System(FLS). The proposed system has been designed based on the PAH values of different food and food products. Hence to initiate the study and to determine the significance of the results, PAH data have been collected from different articles that have investigated food products experimentally. These PAH data were analyzed using statistical measures such as Min, Mean, Max, Standard Deviation, Variance and Kurtosis method. Based on the observations from the results, the fuzzy sets were designed with four membership functions for each PAH and the rules were framed. The strength output from the inference engine has been associated with harmfulness index such as normal, low risk, medium risk, and high risk. From the evaluation, it can be observed that 89.72% of the food samples were recognized along with their degree of harmfulness. Also it can be inferred that 11% of the misclassified samples showed clear metrics of their harmfulness with PAH variations.},

  abstract     = {Reservoir structure optimization of echo state networks (ESN) is an important enabler for improving network performance. In this regard, pruning provides an effective means to optimize reservoir structure by removing redundant components in the network. Existing studies achieve reservoir pruning by removing insignificant neuronal connections. However, such processing causes the optimized neurons to still remain in the reservoir and thus hinder network inference by participating in computations, leading to suboptimal utilization of pruning benefits by the network. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an adaptive pruning algorithm for ESN within the detrended multiple cross-correlation (DMC2) framework, i.e., DMAP. On the whole, it contains two main functional parts: DMC2 measure of reservoir neurons and reservoir pruning. Specifically, the former is used to quantify the correlation among neurons. Based on this, the latter can remove neurons with high correlation from the reservoir completely, and finally obtain the optimal network structure by retraining the output weights. Experiment results show that DMAP-ESN outperforms its competitors in nonlinear approximation capability and reservoir stability.},

To address this issue, this paper introduces Ghost Attentional Down network, a lightweight human pose estimation network based on HRNet. This network leverages the fusion of features from high-resolution and low-resolution branches to boost performance. Additionally, GADNet utilizes GaBlock and GdBlock, which incorporate lightweight convolutions and attention mechanisms, for feature extraction, thereby reducing the parameter count and computational complexity of the network. The fusion of relationships between different channels ensures the optimal utilization of informative feature channels and resolves the issue of feature redundancy. Experimental results conducted on the COCO dataset, with consistent image resolution and environmental settings, demonstrate that employing GADNet leads to a reduction of 60.7% in parameter count and 61.2% in computational complexity compared to the HRNet network model, while achieving comparable accuracy levels. Moreover, when compared to commonly used human pose estimation networks such as Cascaded Pyramid Network (CPN), Stacked Hourglass Network, and HRNet, GADNet achieves high-precision detection of human keypoints even with fewer parameters and lower computational complexity, our network has higher accuracy compared to MobileNet and ShuffleNet.},

  abstract     = {The semantic segmentation of high-resolution remote sensing images has broad application prospects in land cover classification, road extraction, urban planning and other fields. To alleviate the influence of the large data volume and complex background of high-resolution remote sensing images, the usual approach is to downsample them or cut them into small pieces for separate processing. Even if combining the two methods can improve the segmentation efficiency, it ignores the differences between the middle and the edge regions. Therefore, we consider the characteristics of large and irregular region in high-resolution remote sensing images, and then propose an irregular adaptive refinement network to locate the irregular edge region, which will be refined adaptively. Specifically, on the basis of effectively preserving the global and local information, the prediction confidence is calculated to locate pixel points that are poorly segmented, so as to form irregular regions requiring further refinement, avoiding to ‘over-refine’ intermediate region with good segmentation. At the same time, considering the difference in the refinement degree of different pixels, we propose to adaptively integrate the local segmentation results to refine the coarse segmentation results. In addition, in order to bridge the gap between the two extreme ends of the scale space, we introduce a multi-scale framework. Finally, we conducted experiments on the Deepglobe dataset showing that the proposed method performed 0.37% to 0.87% better than the previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of mean Intersection over Union (mIoU).},

  abstract     = {Emotional state recognition is an important part of emotional research. Compared to non-physiological signals, the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals can truly and objectively reflect a person’s emotional state. To explore the multi-frequency band emotional information and address the noise problem of EEG signals, this paper proposes a robust multi-frequency band joint dictionary learning with low-rank representation (RMBDLL). Based on the dictionary learning, the technologies of sparse and low-rank representation are jointly integrated to reveal the intrinsic connections and discriminative information of EEG multi-frequency band. RMBDLL consists of robust dictionary learning and intra-class/inter-class local constraint learning. In robust dictionary learning part, RMBDLL separates complex noise in EEG signals and establishes clean sub-dictionaries on each frequency band to improve the robustness of the model. In this case, different frequency data obtains the same encoding coefficients according to the consistency of emotional state recognition. In intra-class/inter-class local constraint learning part, RMBDLL introduces a regularization term composed of intra-class and inter-class local constraints, which are constructed from the local structural information of dictionary atoms, resulting in intra-class similarity and inter-class difference of EEG multi-frequency bands. The effectiveness of RMBDLL is verified on the SEED dataset with different noises. The experimental results show that the RMBDLL algorithm can maintain the discriminative local structure in the training samples and achieve good recognition performance on noisy EEG emotion datasets.},

  abstract     = {Breast cancer has been life-threatening for many years as it is the common cause of fatality among women. The challenges of screening such tumors through manual approaches can be overcome by computer-aided diagnosis, which aids radiologists in making precise decisions. The selection of significant features is crucial for the estimation of prediction accuracy. This work proposes a hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Honey Badger Algorithm (HBA) based Deep Neural Network (DNN), HGAHBA-DNN for the concurrent optimal features selection and parameter optimization; further, the optimal features and parameters extracted are fed into the DNN for the prediction of the breast cancer. It fuses the benefits of HBA with parallel processing and efficient feedback with GA’s excellent global convergent rate during the processing stages. The aforementioned method is evaluated on the Wisconsin Original Breast Cancer (WOBC), Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC), and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) datasets. Subsequently, the performance is validated using several metrics like accuracy, precision, Recall, and F1-score. The experimental result shows that HGAHBA-DNN obtains accuracy of 99.42%, 99.84%, and 92.44% for the WOBC, WDBC, and SEER datasets respectively, which is much superior to the other state-of-the-art methods.},

Integrating the decentralized, independent, open, traceable and tamper-proof features of the blockchain into the supply chain can effectively improve the pro blems of unstable supply chain structure, low security, low privacy, low collaboration ability and high operating costs. Establishing probabilistic double hierarchy linguistic multi-attribute decision-making (PDHL-MADM) model to evaluate the performance of blockchain is an effective measure to optimize blockchain performance and improve supply chain stability. Therefore, this thesis first takes the processing efficiency, cost, security performance, update and improvement ability as evaluation attributes. Then the IDOCRIW weight method is used to calculate the objective weight of attributes. Based on Aczel-Alsina t-norm (AATN) and Aczel-Alsina t-conorm (AATCN), four operations of probabilistic double hierarchy linguistic term set (PDHLTS) are defined, and PDHLAAWA operator, PDHLAAOWA operator, PDHLAAHA operator, PDHLAAHM operator, PDHLAAWHM operator and their dual operators are proposed, and a series of corresponding PDHL operator models are constructed. In addition, the sensitivity and stability of this series of operator models are analyzed in depth. Finally, the new model proposed in this thesis is compared with the existing model to verify its scientific and superiority.},

  abstract     = {Recovering low-quality waste heat using industrial waste heat is challenging, and the reuse technology needs to erupt. Moreover, the gas source of low-quality waste heat is relatively volatile, which makes it challenging to keep the actual working condition of the plant stable. Therefore, it is ins piring to research the robustness of root-waste heat power generation processed measurement and control system to improve the stability of the plant operation. Hence, in this paper, we have applied uncertainty theory to analyze it and formulate the uncertainty model based on the Bode diagram. We also proposed a control method based on the uncertainty model, which combines robust control and internal model control to make the roots waste heat power generation system operate stably under the effect of external disturbances and changes of internal structure or parameters in actual operation. Experimental results show that the robust internal model control method has a speed deviation of no more than 7.9 r/min compared with the PID control method. The adjustment time to track the set value does not exceed 73.1 seconds within the allowed fluctuation range. The fluctuation variance is 30.95% of that of the PID controller. The dynamic performance is better, with strong anti-interference capability and significantly improved tracking performance. It ensures the stability of the roots-type waste heat utilization system, which is essential for future intelligent grid-connected power generation.},

Combined with the operating characteristics of the loom, the causes of SRM torque pulsation are analyzed from the point of view of SRM control strategy, and combined with the spindle control indexes, the voltage chopper control and torque distribution function are introduced to construct the SRM control strategy scheme for the loom. On this basis, an optimization strategy based on the fusion of fuzzy control algorithm, particle swarm algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm is proposed to optimize the torque distribution function, and the algorithmic process of SRM control strategy is verified through comparative tests. The results show that the control strategy can make its torque pulsation reduced to less than 10%, the speed rise time is less than 0.1 s, and the relative error of the speed is less than 0.05%, which meets the index requirements of the spindle drive. This proves that the SRM torque pulsation can be reduced by the multi-algorithm fusion control strategy without increasing the hardware cost, which provides a useful reference for solving the SRM torque pulsation problem under the requirement of low cost.},

Firstly, the concept of feature vector of Pythagorean fuzzy number (PFN) is presented by taking into account five parameters of PFN, and some new methods to compute the similarity measure of PFNs by applying the feature vector are proposed. Furthermore, a fuzzy similarity matrix by utilizing similarity measure of PFNs is established. Later, the fuzzy similarity matrix is transformed into a fuzzy equivalent matrix which is utilized to establish a novel Pythagorean fuzzy clustering algorithm. Based on the proposed clustering algorithm, a novel multiple attribute decision making (MADM) method under Pythagorean fuzzy environment is presented.

Second, the exponential similarity measure of CCFCSs is proposed in the scenario of FMs. Third, a PPE model is developed based on the proposed similarity measure of CCFCSs in the FM scenario. Finally, the developed model is applied to a piano performance competition organized by Shaoxing University in China as an actual evaluation example, and then the rationality and validity of the proposed model in the scenario of FMs are verified through sensitivity and comparison analysis.},

However, these approaches still have two major challenges. One is that their search space is limited due to the out-of-voc abulary (OOV) problem. The other is that the NMT-based APR models tend to ignore past translation information, which often leads to over-translation and under-translation. To address the above challenges, we propose MNRepair, a new NMT-based APR approach that combines multiple mechanisms to fix bugs in source code. Specifically, we devise an encoder-decoder NMT framework with the attention mechanism. Our framework combines the copy mechanism to overcome the OOV problem that occurs with source code. To deal with the over-translation and under-translation, we utilize a coverage mechanism to record past translation information. MNRepair is able to capture a wide range of repair operators and fix 26 bugs in Defects4J. Our evaluation shows the effectiveness of multiple mechanisms in the repair process.},

  abstract     = {Buying decisions are influenced by a variety of factors that can give rise to impulsive, unplanned, or even irrational purchases. Research has examined the motivational factors that foster organic food consumption, but no study has explored the relative weights of these factors and whether their effects vary depending on the type of food. This study adopted the cognitive-affective perspective to examine the antecedents of online impulsive buying of organic food using a sample of 452 consumers living in Baghdad, Iraq. The fuzzy AHP and fuzzy TOPSIS methods were used to rank five organic food alternatives. The results revealed that the effects of cognitive factors on organic food purchases differ from those of affective factors.},

  abstract     = {The XOR operator is a simple yet crucial computation in computer science, especially in cryptography. In symmetric cryptographic schemes, particularly in block ciphers, the AddRoundKey transformation is commonly used to XOR an internal state with a round key. One method to enhance the security of b lock ciphers is to diversify this transformation. In this paper, we propose some straightforward yet highly effective techniques for generating t-bit random XOR tables. One approach is based on the Hadamard matrix, while another draws inspiration from the popular intellectual game Sudoku. Additionally, we introduce algorithms to animate the XOR transformation for generalized block ciphers. Specifically, we apply our findings to the AES encryption standard to present the key-dependent AES algorithm. Furthermore, we conduct a security analysis and assess the randomness of the proposed key-dependent AES algorithm using NIST SP 800-22, Shannon entropy based on the ENT tool, and min-entropy based on NIST SP 800-90B. Thanks to the key-dependent random XOR tables, the key-dependent AES algorithm have become much more secure than AES, and they also achieve better results in some statistical standards than AES.},

One smart farming activity, fruit classification, has broad applications and impacts across agriculture, food production, health, research, and environmental conservation. Accurate and reliable fruit classification benefits various stakeholders, from farmers and food producers to consumers and conservationists. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis to assess the performance of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model in conjunction with four transfer learning models: VGG16, ResNet50, MobileNet-V2, and EfficientNet-B0. Models are trained once on a benchmark dataset called Fruits360 and another time on a reduced version of it to study the effect of data size and image processing on fruit classification performance. The original dataset reported accuracy scores of 95%, 93%, 99.8%, 65%, and 92.6% for these models, respectively. While accuracy increased when trained on the reduced dataset for three of the employed models. This study provides valuable insights into the performance of various deep learning models and dataset versions, offering guidance on model selection and data preprocessing strategies for image classification tasks.},

Although traditional machine learning algorithms based on physical modeling methods and convolutional neural networks have recently been introduced into melt pool state identification, these methods rely on complex artificially designed features or cannot simultaneously detect defects in multiple dimensions. In this paper, a novel bilateral stream neural network was designed for melt pool identification, which performs defect identification in two label dimensions simultaneously. Two sets of single-channel experiments were designed to collect the dataset captured by a high-speed camera. By cutting the metal parts and marking them with professional equipment operated by professionals, the dataset was labeled according to the bonding condition and dilution rate criteria. Without an additive model structure, the model achieved 95.2% accuracy in identifying defects in the bonding condition and 92.8% in determining deficiencies in the dilution rate. In order to explain the identification mechanism of the model, the CAM method was utilized for the visual display of the model recognition process, which provides a potential application solution for the online monitoring method of the L-DED.},

Therefore, based on intelligent Fuzzy clustering algorithm and Ant colony optimization algorithms, this paper studied a new multi-objective investment decision model, and proved the advantages of this method through comparative analysis of experiments. The experimental results showed that the improved Ant colony optimization algorithms has significantly reduced the system’s construction costs, operating costs and financial costs, all of which were controlled below 41%.

  abstract     = {The increasing demand for electrical energy is a result of advancing technologies and changing lifestyles worldwide. Meeting this escalating energy need poses a substantial challenge, especially the difficulty in constructing new conventional power plants due to limited fossil fuel resources. To ad dress this, demand-side management (DSM) in smart grid (SG), integrated with solar photovoltaic energy (SPE) have emerged as a crucial tool for effectively managing electricity demand, ensuring flexibility and reliability. DSM achieves optimal electricity utilization by rescheduling the operation schedules of consumer appliances and carefully adjusting their demand profiles. Integrating DSM into a smart grid framework is highly advantageous for the power industry’s pursuit of sustainable energy goals. While various heuristic-based optimization techniques have been employed for DSM, the focus on SPE has been limited to small-scale residential loads. This study utilizes the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm to tackle a day ahead DSM minimization problem, considering SPE in areas with large number of appliances. The DSM minimization problem falls into the category of discrete combinatorial problems, making it well-suited for ACO optimization. The self-healing, self-protection, and self-organizing attributes of ACO make it particularly effective for DSM solutions. Residential, commercial, and industrial loads, with and without SPE integration, are considered to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed ACO algorithm. Simulation results are compared with other studies in the literature, including Evolutionary Algorithm (EA), Moth Flame Optimization (MFO), and Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO), in terms of reducing consumer’s cost of energy (CCE) and utility peak load (UPL). The findings indicate that the proposed ACO algorithm outperforms the other algorithms considered in the current context.},

However, most researches focus on extracting features from the high-layer of network while ignoring the middle-layer features, some important details are overlooked frequently. To address this issue, we propose a Multi-Scale and Multi-Patc h Feature Fusion Network(MSPF). We employ modified OSFA to extract, align, and fuse the feature maps in the middle-layer of network, which can compensate for the lack of detailed information in the high-level network features. To obtain richer detailed global features of pedestrian, we construct a multi-patch feature fusion module(MPF). We concatenate the global features extracted from modified OSFA and MPF to obtain global features with richer detailed representations. Cross-entropy loss, triplet loss and center loss are combined to constrain our model. We evaluate the performance of our model on Market-1501, CUHK03_labeled and DukeMTMC. The results prove that our method is superior to the state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {The commonly used high utility itemsets mining method for massive data is the intelligent optimization algorithm. In this paper, the WHO (Whale-Hawk Optimization) algorithm is proposed by integrating the harris hawk optimization (HHO) algorithm with the beluga whale optimization (BWO) algorithm. Additionally, a whale initialization strategy based on good point set is proposed. This strategy helps to guide the search in the initial phase and increase the diversity of the population, which in turn improve the convergence speed and algorithm performance. By applying this improved algorithm to the field of high utility itemsets mining, it provides new solutions to optimization problems and data mining problems. To evaluate the performance of the proposed WHO, a large number of experiments are conducted on six datasets, chess, connect, mushroom, accidents, foodmart, and retail, in terms of convergence, recall rates, and runtime. The experimental results show that the convergence of the proposed WHO is optimal in five datasets and has the shortest runtime in all datasets. Compared to PSO, AF, BA, and GA, the average recall rate in the six datasets increased by 32.13%, 49.95%, 12.15%, and 16.24%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Compared with large enterprises, the development scale and organizational structure of small and medium-sized enterprises are insufficient, which brings certain limitations to the development of small and medium-sized enterprises in China. In order to promote the long-term development of small and medium-sized enterprises in the new era, it is necessary to require enterprise leaders to innovate marketing plans, strengthen risk management of enterprises, and enhance their strength in market competition. The market risk evaluation of small and medium sized enterprises (SMSEs) in the new era is a multiple-attribute decision-making (MADM). The IVIFSs are employed as the tool for portraying uncertain information during the market risk evaluation of SMSEs in the new era. In this paper, the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy (IVIF) Hamacher interactive power geometric (IVIFHIPG) technique is addressed based on IVIF Hamacher interactive weighted geometric (IVIFHIWG) technique and power geometric (PG) technique. Some properties of IVIFHIPG technique were addressed. Then, the IVIFHIPG technique is employed to manage MADM under IVIFSs. Finally, an example for market risk evaluation of SMSEs in the new era is employed to verify the IVIFHIPG technique. Thus, the main contributions of this paper are addressed: (1) the IVIFHIPG technique is addressed based on IVIFHIWG technique and PG technique; (2) the IVIFHIPG technique is came up with to manage the MADM under IVIFSs; (3) a numerical example for market risk evaluation of SMSEs in the new era has been came up with to show the IVIFHIPG technique; and (4) some comparative analysis is addressed to verify the I IVIFHIPG technique.},

In this paper, we construct a hierarchical attribute structure based on literature review and text mining of reports and news. The hierarchical attribute structure includes human, equipment, environment and management level. The correlations among these attributes are analyzed. The assessment standards of attributes are described in details. Different evaluation grades associated with attributes are transformed to a unified one by the given rules. As for the assessment approach, the evidential reasoning approach is applied for uncertain information fusion. Group analytical hierarchical process is used to generate attribute weights from a group of experts, where process aggregation method and result aggregation method are combined in a comprehensive way. The importance of expert is computed by the uncertainty measure of expert’s subjective judgment. A drilling platform is finally assessed by the proposed attribute structure and assessment approach to illustrate the effectiveness of the assessment framework.},

  abstract     = {In the process of digital transformation and development in various industries, there are more and more large-scale optimization problems. Currently, swarm intelligence optimization algorithms are the best method to solve such problems. However, previous experimental research has found that there i s still room for improvement in the performance of using existing swarm intelligence optimization algorithms to solve such problems. To obtain the high-precision optimal value of whale optimization algorithm (WOA) for solving large-scale optimization problems, the optimization problem knowledge model is studied to guide the iterative process of WOA algorithm, and a novel whale optimization algorithm based on knowledge model guidance (KMGWOA) is proposed. First, a population update strategy based on multiple elite individuals is proposed to reduce the impact of the local optimal values, and the knowledge model to guide population update is constructed by combining the proposed population update strategy with the population update strategy based on global optimal individual. Second, a collaborative reverse learning knowledge model with multiple elite and poor individuals in the solution space is proposed to prevent long-term non-ideal region search. The above two knowledge models guide the iterative process of WOA algorithm in solving large-scale optimization problems. The performance of the KMGWOA algorithm guided by the proposed knowledge models is tested through the well-known classical test functions. The results demonstrate that the proposed KMGWOA algorithm not only has good search ability for the theoretical optimal value, but also achieves higher accuracy in obtaining the optimal value when it is difficult to obtain the theoretical optimal value. Moreover, KMGWOA algorithm has fast convergence speed and high effective iteration percentage.},

However, the performance of some existing traditional feature extraction methods and detection methods based on convolutional neural network (CNN) is poor, and the information provided by the features extracted from the network is limited and single. In this paper, an end-to-end ringed residual U-Net is proposed to detect image splicing forgery by blending features of non-natural regions. Some regions with significant differences from the image background are defined as non-natural regions(such as the irregular border at the splicing of images). In this paper, a feature enhancement module for non-natural regions is constructed, which the image through the pooling of four different scales, and these features are then combined with the original image and input to the backbone network for processing, aiming to highlight regions of the image that differ significantly from the background. Therefore, after adding the feature enhancement module for non-natural regions to the end-to-end ring residual U-Net, more attention will be paid to the tampering regions in the feature extraction stage, image manipulation detection and localization will also become more accurate. Compared with some mainstream methods, this method achieves better performance on the three standard datasets(CASIA2.0, NIST2016, COLUMBIA). In addition, it has excellent robustness under JPEG compression attack and noise corruption attack.},

We study a many-to-many matching problem between shared private idle parking spaces and their demanders. A novelty is that the demanders are allowed to use different parking spaces successively in parking relocation service support. This can further reintegrate the idle time of the parking spaces and improve their utilization rate. A multi-objective optimization model is constructed to maximize the number of matched demanders, the total priority of the parking spaces, and the total priority of the demanders. More importantly, the priorities of the parking spaces and the demanders are innovatively considered. Each of the parking spaces and the demanders is given a priority for the matching and the priority of a parking space or a demander will be increased if the parking space or demander rarely gets matched successfully. This helps reduce the withdrawal of parking spaces and the demanders from the parking platform. In addition, an NSGA-II algorithm is designed to solve the model efficiently. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed method is illustrated via an example.},

  abstract     = {In the face of increasingly complex data forms and decision-making problems, the uncertainty of information poses a major challenge to multi-attribute decision-making methods. How to effectively organize information and serve realistic decision-making problems has attracted extensive attention in the academic circles. In view of this, based on the distribution law of random variables, we put forward the basic concept of probability numbers and construct a general framework, including the concepts of type, order, item, isomorphism and isomerism, same domain and same distribution of probability numbers. On this basis, we further define the expectation and variance formula of probability numbers, and its operation rules are defined for the same type of probability numbers. To compare the dominance and inferiority of probability numbers further accurately, we put forward the concepts of dominance degree and comparability degree of probability numbers, so that decision makers can realize the ranking of probability numbers by calculating the comprehensive dominance degree. In view of the related concepts of probability numbers, we summarize the properties and theorems of probability numbers and prove them. In addition, a probability numbers-based multi-attribute decision-making framework model is proposed to solve the multi-attribute decision-making problem. Decision makers can select appropriate sub-models to construct personalized multi-attribute decision-making methods according to actual needs. At the end of the paper, we apply the method to the multi-attribute decision case of campus express stations evaluation and verify the scientificity and rationality of the evaluation method. The concept of probability numbers and its decision model proposed in this paper extend the concept category of numbers, enrich the multi-attribute decision-making method based on probability numbers, and have certain reference significance for further research of uncertain decision theory and method.},

Product styling design is based on this market demand, combining the aesthetic and functional aspects of the product to create a personaliz ed product appearance, in order to better attract consumers, improve the competitiveness and added value of the product. Usually, product styling design involves multiple elements such as product form, color, proportion, etc. The quality evaluation of product styling design is a MAGDM problems.

The resulting model, called uncertain least square support vector regressi on (ULSSVR), incorporates chance constraints and simplified parameter selection, which are critical to handle imprecise observations. A numerical algorithm called the conjugate residual method (CR) is introduced to reduce the computational complexity of the model solution. The experimental results using both small and medium-sized datasets demonstrate the superior performance of ULSSVR in terms of prediction accuracy and generalization ability compared to other models such as uncertain support vector regression (USVR), uncertain linear lodel, uncertain polynomial model, and uncertain growth models. ULSSVR not only improves prediction accuracy by at least 28.49% but also demonstrates faster computational speed. Overall, ULSSVR presents a promising solution for data science and internet applications where dealing with imprecise and low-quality data is a common challenge.},

  abstract     = {Multi-granularity rough sets facilitate knowledge-based granular computing, and their compromised models (called CMGRSs) outperform classical optimistic and pessimistic models with extremity. Three-level CMGRSs with statistic-optimization-location effectively process hierarchical granularities with attribute enlargements, and they are worth generalizing for general granularities with arbitrary feature subsets. Thus, three-level CMGRSs on knowledge, approximation, and accuracy are established for arbitrary granularities by using three-way decision (3WD). Corresponding 3WD-CMGRSs adopt statistic-optimization-3WD by adding optimistic and pessimistic bounds to the representative location, so they resort to optimal index sets to acquire the multi-granularity equilibrium and decision systematicness. As a result, multiple CMGRSs emerge within the three-level and three-way framework, they improve the classical MGRSs and enrich 3WD as well as three-level analysis, and exhibit the good simulation, extension, effectiveness, improvement, and generalization. Firstly at the knowledge level, cardinality statistic-optimization improves previous label statistic-optimization for equilibrium realization, so CMGRSs are improved for hierarchical granularities while 3WD-CMGRSs are proposed for arbitrary granularities. Then at the approximation and accuracy levels, measure statistic-optimization determines optimal index sets, so 3WD-CMGRSs are similarly proposed to complete the simulation and extension. Furthermore, mathematical properties and computational algorithms of relevant models are investigated. Finally, three-level 3WD-CMGRSs are illustrated by table examples and are validated by data experiments.},

Convolutional neural networks are introduced to automatically construct the visual communication interface, a recommendation algorithm is used to develop the system’s recommendation function, and machine translation is used to translate the language description text. The study method’s efficacy was evaluated. According to the experimental results, the research method’s runtime in a color environment was only about 37.7 seconds at 4k resolution; in a non-color environment, the method’s F1 value was 0.87 at a recommended list length of 35, which was higher than that of other methods; and when it came to the interface solutions in real terms, the research method produced 526 at 30 buttons. The aforementioned findings demonstrate that the suggested approach can successfully increase the visual communication’s design speed and performance in online learning materials and offer a suitable answer to the needs of real-world applications.},

  abstract     = {The contemporary real-world datasets often suffer from the problem of class imbalance as well as high dimensionality. For combating class imbalance, data resampling is a commonly used approach whereas for tackling high dimensionality feature selection is used. The aforesaid problems have been studi ed extensively as independent problems in the literature but the possible synergy between them is still not clear. This paper studies the effects of addressing both the issues in conjunction by using a combination of resampling and feature selection techniques on binary-class imbalance classification. In particular, the primary goal of this study is to prioritize the sequence or pipeline of using these techniques and to analyze the performance of the two opposite pipelines that apply feature selection before or after resampling techniques i.e., F + S or S + F. For this, a comprehensive empirical study is carried out by conducting a total of 34,560 tests on 30 publicly available datasets using a combination of 12 resampling techniques for class imbalance and 12 feature selection methods, evaluating the performance on 4 different classifiers. Through the experiments we conclude that there is no specific pipeline that proves better than the other and both the pipelines should be considered for obtaining the best classification results on high dimensional imbalanced data. Additionally, while using Decision Tree (DT) or Random Forest (RF) as base learner the predominance of S + F over F + S is observed whereas in case of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression (LR), F + S outperforms S + F in most cases. According to the mean ranking obtained from Friedman test the best combination of resampling and feature selection techniques for DT, SVM, LR and RF are SMOTE + RFE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique and Recursive Feature Elimination), Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) + SMOTE, SMOTE + Embedded feature selection using RF and SMOTE + RFE respectively.},

The tourism landscape planning design scheme evaluation based on the virtual reality technology a typical multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) problem. With the complexity of economic activities, uncertain information has an increasing impact on production activities. However, due to the ambiguity and uncertainty of human cognition, the factors affecting the risk of things cannot be accurately expressed. Therefore, selecting spherical fuzzy sets (SFSs) can make the expression of information more accurate and complete. On basis of the TODIM method and the PROMETHEE method, in this study, spherical fuzzy number TOMIM-PROMETHEE (SFN-TOMIM-PROMETHEE) method is implemented to solve the MAGDM problem under SFSs. Furthermore, CRITIC method under SFSs is implemented to determine relative weights. Then a numerical example for tourism landscape planning design scheme evaluation based on the virtual reality technology is selected to illustrate the effectiveness and practicality of the method. Finally, the comparative analysis shows that the SFN-TOMIM-PROMETHEE method under SFSs is an effective method to deal with MAGDM problems. The main contribution of this paper is managed: (1) the TODIM and PROMETHEE technique was extended to SFSs; (2) CRITIC technique is employed to manage the weight values under SFSs.

However, the current research challenge lies in addressing the need for high accuracy rates and real-time processing requirements. In this study, we propose a convolutional neural network based on the YOLOv8 algorithm to overcome the aforementioned research challenge. Our approach involves generating a custom dataset with diverse traffic sign images, followed by conducting training, validation, and testing sets to ensure the robustness and generalization of the model. Experimental results and performance evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Nowadays, technology-based small and medium-sized enterprises have developed many technological innovation achievements through continuous technological innovation, and have created a large number of high-tech products and services. Technological innovation has been proven to effectively improve the core competitiveness and economic benefits of technology-based small and medium-sized enterprises.

  abstract     = {The multi-feature and imbalanced nature of network data has always been a challenge to be overcome in the field of network intrusion detection. The redundant features in data could reduce the overall quality of network data and the accuracy of detection models, because imbalance could lead to a dec rease in the detection rate for minority classes. To improve the detection accuracy for imbalanced intrusion data, we develop a data-driven integrated detection method, which utilizes Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) for feature selection, and screens out features that are conducive to model recognition for improving the overall quality of data analysis. In this work, we also apply the Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (ADASYN) method to generate the input data close to the original dataset, which aims to eliminate the data imbalance in the studied intrusion detection model. Besides, a novel VGG-ResNet classification algorithm is also proposed via integrating the convolutional block with the output feature map size of 128 from the Visual Geometry Group 16 (VGG16) of the deep learning algorithm and the residual block with output feature map size of 256 from the Residual Network 18 (ResNet18). Based on the numerical results conducted on the well-known NSL-KDD dataset and UNSW-NB15 dataset, it illustrates that our method can achieve the accuracy rates of 86.31% and 82.56% in those two test datasets, respectively. Moreover, it can be found that the present algorithm can achieve a better accuracy and performance in the experiments of comparing our method with several existing algorithms proposed in the recent three years.},

  abstract     = {As significant carriers of the application of fuzzy set theories, fuzzy systems have been widely used in many fields. However, selecting fuzzifications, fuzzy reasoning engines, and defuzzifications is subjective for Mamdani fuzzy systems, and the fuzzy rule of Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy systems is less of a linguistic interpretation. Regarding these shortcomings, this paper proposes a fuzzy system based on vague partitions processing information directly from the fuzzy rule base, in which fuzzy rules have explicit semantics. Firstly, the n -dimensional vague partition of the n -dimensional universe is defined based on 1-dimensional vague partitions and the aggregation function, and its properties are discussed. Based on these, we design the new fuzzy system, and investigate its approximation properties which is the theoretical guarantee for applying the fuzzy system. As an application, we combine the fuzzy system with PID control system to deal with autonomous vehicle path tracking control problems. A series of experiments are constructed, and experimental results indicate that the fuzzy system based on vague partitions makes the fuzzy PID control system strong robustness, and has obvious advantages compared with other traditional fuzzy systems for path tracking control problems.},

  abstract     = {Medical image classification is an essential task in the fields of computer-aided diagnosis and medical image analysis. In recent years, researchers have made extensive work on medical image classification by computer vision techniques. However, most of the current work is based on deep learning me thods, which still suffer from expensive hardware resources, long time consuming and a lot of parameters to be optimized. In this paper, a multi-granularity ensemble algorithm for medical image classification based on broad learning system is proposed, which is an end-to-end lightweight model. On the one hand, the proposed method is designed to address the problem of weak image feature learning ability of broad learning system. The convolution module with fixed weights based on transfer learning is introduced as a feature extractor to extract fusion features of medical images. On the other hand, the multi-granularity ensemble framework is proposed, which learn the fusion features of medical images from fine-grained to coarse-grained respectively, and the prediction results at different granularity levels are integrated by ensemble learning. In this way, the bottom local features can be sufficiently considered, while the global features can also be taken into account. The experimental results show that on the MedMNIST dataset (containing 10 sub-datasets), the proposed method can shorten the training time by tens of times while having similar accuracy to deep convolutional neural networks. On the ChestXRay2017 dataset, the proposed method can achieve an accuracy of 92.5%, and the training time is also significantly better than other methods.},

  abstract     = {The mining belt conveyor is one of the most important modules in coal mine, whose safety always be threatened by the foreign objects. Although the traditional target detection methods achieve promising results in various computer vision tasks, the performance heavily depends on sufficient labelled data. However, in real-world production scenario, it is difficult to acquire huge number of images with foreign objects. The obtained datasets lacking of capacity and diversity are not suitable for training supervised learning-based foreign objects detection models. To address this concern, we propose a novel method for detecting the foreign objects on the surface of underground coal conveyor belt via improved GANomaly. The proposed foreign objects detection method employs generative adversarial networks (GAN) with attention gate to capture the distribution of normality in both high-dimensional image space and low-dimensional latent vector space. Only the normal images without foreign object are utilized to adversarially train the proposed network, including a U-shape generator to reconstruct the input image and a discriminator to classify real images from reconstructed ones. Then the combination of the difference between the input and generated images as well as the difference between latent representations are utilized as the anomaly score to evaluate whether the input image contain foreign objects. Experimental results over 707 images from real-world industrial scenarios demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.864 and is superior to the previous GAN-based anomaly detection methods.},

Hence, it is important to present a novel method to compute them quickly, which is our motivation for this paper.

To cope with the above problems, this paper presents a method for hypernym discovery based on Extended Patterns and Box Embeddings (EP-BoxE). Firstly, to acquire more hypernymy relation entity pairs, we identify co-hyponyms of a given term and use their hypernyms as the candidate hypernym set for the given term; Secondly, by analyzing the text corpus, we find that the language patterns also provide additional information for hypernym discovery, which also solves the deficiency of the box embedding methods in identifying specific hypernyms. Finally, experimentations on two domain-specific datasets reveal that EP-BoxE surpasses the performance of popular methods on the majority of evaluation metrics.},

This paper proposes a long-tail customer stratification model based on clustering ensemble to address the problems of insuf ficient attention to long-tail customers in previous studies and the low accuracy and lack of accuracy testing of single clustering algorithms. First, the Bayesian information criterion is used to determine the optimal number of clusters. Then, an ensemble framework integrating the Gaussian mixture model, spectral clustering, Two step clustering and K-means algorithm is constructed, and the stacking and bagging ensemble methods are used for the cluster ensemble. Finally, three different indicators are used to evaluate the algorithm performance. Experimental results indicate that compared with single clustering algorithms, the Stacking algorithm increases the silhouette coefficient by 14.77% to 27.11%, the Calinski-Harabasz index by 38.83% to 122.18%, and the Davies-Bouldin Index by 19.38% to 98.04%. This indicates that each clustering has high cohesion and separation, with samples within a category being more closely related and those between categories having clear boundaries. It shows that the Stacking algorithm more accurately stratifies long-tail customers with similar consumption behaviors into different categories, achieving customer stratification.},

In order to connect physical objects with the universe of digital using a variety of networks and communication technologies, an IoT, the cutting edges technological and effective soluti on, is deployed. Mobile ad hoc networks (MANET) interact with the IoTin smart settings, enhancing its user appeal and boosting its commercial viability. The new system of MANET based IoT and IT-network may be created by integrating wireless sensor and MANET with the Internet of Things. A solution like this increases user mobility while lowering network deployment costs. However, it also raises new, difficult problems in terms of networking considerations. In this, we presented a novel DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)-Blockchain structure for MANET-IoT security. The network is secured through Multi-Factor PUF (MF-PUF) authentication scheme. With all authorized nodes, the network is segregated into cluster topology. For trusted data transmission, we proposed Jelly Fish Optimization (JFO) algorithm with the consideration of multiple criteria. For deep packet inspection, we proposed a Fully Connected Recurrent Neural Network (FCRNN). Through deep packet inspection, the intrusions are detected and mitigated through blocking system.With help of merged algorithm, the suggested method obtained improved ability in the PDR (Packet Delivery Ratio), production, analysis of time, detection accuracy also security levels. The comparison results clearly indicate that the proposed study outperforms all previous studies in various aspects. Particularly, the suggested methods for cluster creation, data aggregation, routing, encryption, and authentication significantly improve the system of DAG-IDS. Additionally, the planned task exhibits an exceptionally low standard deviation, making the suggested approach highly suitable for a WSN-IoT environment.},

Thus, an accurate and early assessment of the CS of concrete can minimize time, labor, and cost. This paper investigated the ability of the Radial Basis Function (RBF) to handle the prediction of CS. The nonlinearities raised from the novel utilized admixtures between the input variables and output CS is tried to be conducted with the RBF model. In order to make a flexible framework combination of the RBF model with the African Vulture Optimization (AVOA) and Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA) techniques are considered. The results achieved from the RBF-AVOA model indicated good agreement between the actual and predicted values. The proposed model provides a very accurate HPC compressive strength prediction. In addition, the correlation coefficient R 2 is equal to (0.997), and the values of mean absolute error (MAE) (0.1917 MPa), root mean square error (RMSE) (0.937 MPa), and variance account coefficient (VAF) (99.73%) are low. The performance of the RBF-AVOA model, compared to other models, provided the desired advantage and more stable predictions. AVOA plays a key role in modeling results, improving generalization capabilities, avoiding redundant data, and decreasing uncertainty.},

  abstract     = {Business investments are prone to market risks, so pre-analysis is mandatory. The type of risk, its period, sustainability, and economic impact are the analyzable features for preventing loss and downfall. In recent years, mathematical models have been used for representing business cycles and anal yzing the impacting risks. This article introduces a Decisive Risk Analytical Model (DRAM) for identifying spur defects in business investments. The proposed risk analytical model exploits the investments, returns, and influencing factors over the various market periods. The risk model is tuned for identifying the influencing factors across various small and large investment periods. The model is tuned to adapt to different economic periods split into a single financial year. In the process of tuning and training the mathematical analysis model, deep learning is used. The learning paradigm trains the risks and modifying features from expert opinion and previous predictions. Based on these three factors, the risk for the current investment is forecasted. The forecast aids in improving the new investment feasibilities with minimal risks and model modifications. The frequent market status is identified for preventing unnecessary risk-oriented forecasts using the training performed. Therefore, the proposed model is reliable in identifying risks and providing better investment recommendations.},

  abstract     = {The global incidence of skin cancer has been rising, resulting in increased mortality and morbidity if left untreated. Accurate diagnosis of skin malignancies is crucial for early intervention through excision. While various innovative medical imaging techniques, such as dermoscopy, have improved the way we examine skin cancers, the progress in medical imaging for identifying skin lesions has not kept pace. Skin lesions exhibit diverse visual features, including variations in size, shape, boundaries, and artifacts, necessitating an efficient image-processing approach to assist dermatologists in decision-making. In this research, we propose an automated skin lesion classifier called GreyNet, which utilizes optimized convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or shift-invariant networks (SIN). GreyNet comprises three components: (i) a trained fully deep CNN for semantic segmentation, relating input images to manually labeled standard scans; (ii) an enhanced dense CNN with global information exchange and adaptive feature salvaging module to accurately classify each pixel in histopathological scans as benign or malignant; and (iii) a binary grey wolf optimizer (BGWO) to improve the classification process by optimizing the network’s hyperparameters. We evaluate the performance of GreyNet in terms of lesion segmentation and classification on the HAM10000 database. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that GreyNet outperforms existing lesion segmentation methods, achieving improved dice similarity score, volume error, and average processing time of 1.008±0.009, 0.903±0.009%, and 0.079±0.010 s, respectively. Moreover, GreyNet surpasses other skin melanoma classification models, exhibiting improved accuracy, precision, specificity, sensitivity, false negative rate, false positive rate, and Jaccard similarity score (JSS) of 96.5%, 97%, 96.2%, 92.1%, 3.8%, 3%, and 89.5%, respectively. Based on our experimental analysis, we conclude that GreyNet is an efficient tool to aid dermatologists in identifying skin melanoma.},

This study examines the efficiency of DMUs in two scenarios and proposes models for adjustment coefficient. The pessimistic and optimistic efficiencies are adjusted to the lower and upper bounds of the DMUs based on the adjustment coefficient, enabling determination of efficiency intervals for all DMUs, as well as evaluation and ranking. A Hurwicz criterion-based approach is introduced and applied to compare and rank the interval efficiencies of DMUs. Two numerical examples are examined using the proposed DEA adjustment coefficient models to demonstrate its potential application and validity.},

  abstract     = {Tuberculosis (TB) stands as the second leading global infectious cause of death, following closely behind the impact of COVID-19. The standard approach to diagnose TB involves skin tests, but these tests can yield inaccurate results due to limited access to healthcare and insufficient diagnostic re sources. To enhance diagnostic accuracy, this study introduces a novel approach employing a Bipolar Fuzzy Utility Matrix Inference System (BFUMIS) and a Bipolar Mamdani Fuzzy Inference System (BMFIS) to assess TB disease levels. By considering factors associated with the causation of TB, the study devises suitable membership functions for bipolar fuzzy sets (BFS) using both triangular and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. Using a point factor scale, the study clusters the rules systematically and assesses the level of uncertainty within these grouped rules by utilizing bipolar triangular fuzzy numbers (BTFN). To handle the BTFN, this study proposes converting bipolar triangular fuzzy into bipolar crisp score (CBTFBCS) algorithm as a defuzzification method. The optimal bipolar fuzzy utility sets (BFUS) are determined from the bipolar fuzzy utility matrix to identify patients’ TB disease levels. These sets play a pivotal role in characterizing the severity of TB disease levels in patients. Additionally, rigorous validation of the utility framework is accomplished through measures of bipolar fuzzy satisfactory factors and sensitivity analyses. Furthermore, the study introduces the BMFIS, which presents a novel perspective on the conventional fuzzy inference system. This innovative system integrates the Mamdani fuzzy inference system (MFIS) into a bipolar fuzzy context, enriching the diagnostic process with enhanced insights. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods, extensive validation is carried out using actual clinical data. The performance metrics used in this validation effectively demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach.},

Power consumption forecasting is of vital importance for the sustainable management and operation of SG. Methodology:In this work, the aim is to apply clustering for dividing a smart residential community into several group of similar profile energy user, which will be effective for developing and training representative deep neural network (DNN) models for power load forecasting of users in respective groups. The DNN models is composed of convolutional neural network (CNN) followed by LSTM layers for feature extraction and sequence learning respectively. The DNN For experimentation, the Smart Grid Smart City (SGSC) project database is used and its energy users are grouped into various clusters. Results:The residential community is divided into four groups of customers based on the chosen criterion where Group 1, 2, 3 and 4 contains 14 percent, 22 percent, 19 percent and 45 percent users respectively. Almost half of the population (45 percent) of the considered residential community exhibits less than 23 outliers in their electricity consumption patterns. The rest of the population is divided into three groups, where specialized deep learning models developed and trained for respective groups are able to achieve higher forecasting accuracy. The results of our proposed approach will assist researchers and utility companies by requiring fewer specialized deep-learning models for accurate forecasting of users who belong to various groups of similar-profile energy consumption.},

We give the classification method of Fβ-C approximation spaces with the help of homeomorphism mapping, propose a new method to construct topology induced by Fβ-C operator and investigate the properties in the topological spaces further.

  abstract     = {The Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP) is an extension of the classical Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSP). The research objective of the traditional FJSP mainly considers the completion time, but ignores the energy consumption of the manufacturing system. In this paper, a mathematical mode l of the energy-efficient flexible job shop scheduling problem is constructed. The optimization objectives are completion time, delay time, and total equipment energy consumption. To solve the model, an improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (CT-NSGA-II) is proposed to obtain the optimal scheduling solution. First, the heuristic rules of GLR were used to generate the initial population with good quality and diversity. Second, different crossover and variation operators are designed for the process sequencing and equipment selection parts to enhance the diversity of the evolutionary population. The sparsity theory is introduced to find sparse solutions and three neighborhood structures are designed to perform local search on sparse solutions to improve the uniformity of the optimal solution set distribution. Finally, a competitive selection strategy based on the bidding mechanism is proposed for the Pareto optimal solution set to obtain a better scheduling scheme. The experimental results show that the proposed improved algorithm is feasible and effective in the FJSP problem considering energy consumption, and the algorithm has some application value in improving the efficiency of smart shop operation.},

  abstract     = {Quality function deployment (QFD) is a customer-driven product development technique that converts customer requirements (CRs) into design attributes (DAs) of a product and service. Nevertheless, in real situations, the traditional QFD method has been found that possesses some deficiencies, such as the accuracy assessment of relationships between CRs and DAs, and the inter-relationships among DAs. To fill in the above gaps, this study develops a new QFD approach by a CoCoSo-based ranking method under Pythagorean fuzzy environment. To begin with, an extended Pythagorean fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method is proposed to identify the relationships within DAs. Second, the aggregation method of the weighted average method and objective penalty function are propounded to construct the programming models for calculating the importance of DAs under Pythagorean fuzzy setting. Third, a new CoCoSo-based ranking method for Pythagorean triangular fuzzy numbers (PTrFNs) is proposed to obtain the ranking of DAs. Lastly, a case regarding “Ping An Health” mobile medical App is carried out to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed QFD approach. The results show that the top DA is perceptibility. Therefore, perceptibility should be focus on firstly in the “Ping An Health” App design, such as system fluency, interface comfort and network stability. Additionally, the results show that the new QFD can express experts’ hesitant assessment information, deal with the interrelations among DAs, and yield more precise rankings of DAs in QFD.},

  abstract     = {The concept of endorsing AI in embedded systems is growing in all sectors including the development of Accident Avoidance Systems. Although real-time road crash prediction is vital for enhancing road user safety, there has been limited focus on the analysis of real-time crash events within ensemble and deep learning fused systems. The main aim of this paper is to design an advanced Accident Avoidance System established on a deep learning and ensemble fusion strategy in order to acquire more performant crash predictions. As such, four highly optimized models for crash prediction have been designed based on the popular ensemble techniques: CatBoost, AdaBoost and Bagging and the deep learning CNN. Additionally, four categories of features, including driver inputs, vehicle kinematics, driver states and weather conditions, were measured during the execution of various driving tasks performed on a driving simulator. Moreover, given the infrequent nature of crash events, an imbalance-control procedure was adopted using the SMOTE and ADASYN techniques. The highest performances results have been acquired using CatBoost along with ADASYN on almost all the adopted metrics during the different weather conditions, and more than 50% of all crashes have occurred in rainy weather conditions, whereas 31% have been exhibited in fog patterns. The sensitivity analysis results indicate that the fusing all the acquired features has the highest impact on the prediction performance. To our knowledge, there has been a limited interest, if not at all, at adopting a fused ensemble deep learning system examining the real-time impact of the adopted features’ combinations on the prediction of road crashes while taking into account class imbalance. The findings provide new insights into crash prediction and emphasize the relevance of the explanatory features which can be endorsed in designing efficient Accident Avoidance Systems.},

  abstract     = {Lung sound (LS) signals are a vital source of information for the identification of pulmonary disorders. Heart sound (HS) is the most common contaminant of lung sounds during auscultation from the chest walls. This directly affects the efficiency of lung sound processing in diagnosing lung diseases . In this work, Adaptive Variational Mode Decomposition (AVMD) technique is proposed to remove heart sound contaminants from lung sounds. The proposed AVMD method initially breakdown the noisy lung sound signal into a collective of bandlimited modes called variational mode functions (VMF). Then, based on the frequency spectrum, the HS is filtered out from the LS. The real time lung sound data is collected from 95 participants and the performance of VMD technique is evaluated using the statistical metrics measures. Thus, the proposed topology exhibits Higher SNR (29.6587dB, lowest Root Mean Square (RMSE) of 0.0102, lowest normalized Mean Absolute Error (nMAE) of 0.0336, and highest percentage in correlation coefficient Factor (CCF) of 99.79% respectively. These experimental results are found to be superior and outperform all other recently proposed techniques.},

  abstract     = {The distribution system plays a pivotal role in connecting power generation sources to vital facilities like nuclear reactors. In this intricate network, losses occur while supplying electricity, demanding a reduction for enhanced performance. The quality of power reaching the nuclear plant is impe rative due to the susceptibility of sensitive equipment to poor power conditions. This study presents a reconfiguration strategy to bolster dependability and curtail power losses in distribution networks. Leveraging the Modified Genetic Optimization Algorithm (MGOA), the reconfiguration conundrum is tactfully addressed to determine optimal switch operation schemes. The MGOA-based reconfiguration not only minimizes energy wastage but also refines voltage profiles, elevating operational efficiency. The effectiveness of this approach is substantiated through its successful application to radial distribution systems comprising 33, 69, and 136 buses. Embracing diverse scenarios encompassing normal and abnormal operating states, as well as varying loads, the method’s robustness is showcased. The validity of the proposed methodology is reinforced by comprehensive simulation results, underscoring its reliability and potential for real-world implementation.},

Chinese vocabulary is the foundation for understanding and using language, and any language has developed on the basis of Chinese vocabular y. Many studies have shown that there are many factors that affect the acquisition of Chinese vocabulary, and the impact on Chinese vocabulary acquisition is also different. Among them, the influencing factors of Chinese vocabulary acquisition have gradually become a research hotspot, and a large number of related empirical studies have emerged. Based on the big data technology and the random effect model, this paper comprehensively analyzes whether the influencing factors of Chinese vocabulary acquisition as a second language are significant and investigates the effects of internal and external influencing factors, delayed post-test, specific factors and experimental interval time on the learning effect. External factors significantly impact Chinese vocabulary acquisition, including learning style, input factors and input methods. Through the subgroup analysis of the experimental interval, we find that the effect of Chinese vocabulary acquisition decreases with the extension of the experimental interval. Therefore, this paper holds an inverse relationship between the experimental interval and the development of Chinese vocabulary acquisition.},

  abstract     = {China has now embraced the information era, which has had a significant impact on everyday life, employment, and educational practices. Information technology has also had a significant impact on the growth of the education sector, resulting in a fast-paced and resource-rich setting for student int eraction. Through the network platform, various interactive software can improve students’ learning methods, especially language teaching software. English audio-visual speaking is software for training English language listening and speaking, which can carry out relevant oral activities and topic discussions according to the imported materials. As a result, you can assist pupils in using the vocabulary and knowledge associated with the subject, which will increase their interest in learning. English teachers can fully prepare for speaking and listening tasks in the classroom by using audio-visual speaking. At the same time, through the learning of TV and movie trailers, English audio-visual speaking can provide readers with background knowledge, which is ready for readers to fully understand the language and content in the video materials. Based on information technology, this paper constructs English audio-visual and oral mobile teaching software, which depends on interactive digital media algorithms. Through the mobile teaching software for English audio-visual speaking, students can form good English listening and reading habits, which will provide important help for English language learning.First, this essay examines the value and benefits of mobile applications for providing English instruction orally and visually, which might help to illustrate the need for software development. The research then suggests various algorithms for English that are related to audio, visual, and oral input that can detect, assess, and correct students’ learning mistakes. Finally, this work develops the fundamental methodology of the audio-visual and verbal mobile software for instruction in English.},

  abstract     = {Visual attention has emerged as a prominent approach for improving the effectiveness of image captioning, as it enables the decoder network to focus selectively on the most salient regions in the image content, thereby facilitating the generation of precise and informative captions. Although visual attention achieves the improvement, the small numerical values of its input have a negative impact on its softmax, decreasing its effectiveness. To address this limitation, we propose a refined visual attention (RVA) framework that internally reweights visual attention by leveraging the language context of previously generated words. We first feed the language context into a fully connected layer to obtain appropriate dimensions for the visual features. Then, we use a sigmoid function to obtain a probability distribution to reweight the softmax’s input by applying the multiplication process. Experiments conducted on the MS COCO dataset demonstrate that RVA outperforms traditional visual attention and other existing image captioning methods, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing the accuracy and informativeness of image captions.},

  abstract     = {The development of an accurate electricity demand forecasting model is of paramount importance for promoting global energy efficiency and sustainability. Nonetheless, the presence of outliers and inappropriate model training can result in suboptimal performance. To tackle these challenges, this stu dy explores the potential of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and active learning theory as forecasting solutions, offering high efficiency and advantages for long time series. In this study, a hybrid model that combines Isolation Forest (IF), Outlier Reconstruction (OR), CNN and Random Forest (RF) is conducted to mitigate computational complexity and enhance the accuracy of electricity demand forecasting in the presence of outliers. IF is employed to detect outliers in electricity demand time series, while OR is used to reconstruct subsequences based on calendrical heterogeneity for training. CNN is applied for both training and forecasting, and the final output is combined using RF. The effectiveness of the proposed IF-OR-CNN-RF model is validated using electricity data collected from recent sources in Australia at different sampling frequency. The experimental results demonstrate that, in comparison with other popular CNN-based electricity demand forecasting models, IF-OR-CNN-RF model outperforms with significantly improved performance metrics. Specifically, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared values are 77.92, 179.18 and 0.9769 in 5-minute frequency; 162.67, 353.96 and 0.9775 in 10-minute frequency; 841.27, 1374.79 and 0.9622 in 30-minute frequency; 2746.01, 3824.00 and 0.9262 in 60-minute frequency; 9106.08, 12269.04 and 0.8044 in 120-minute frequency.

However, there are still challenges to the existing MAGDM methods in modeling uncertain linguistics of decision-makers’ (DMs’) cognitive information and objectively obtaining weights. Therefore, this paper aims to develop a new MAGDM method considering incomplete known weight information under spherical uncertain linguistic sets (SULSs) to model uncertain information in MAGDM problems. The method mainly includes the following aspects. Firstly, a new concept, which enables an intuitive evaluation of neutral membership and hesitancy degrees at the linguistic evaluation, has been is first developed for capturing the more uncertain information. Secondly, the cosine similarity measure (CSM) and cross-entropy measure (CEM) are widely used to measure ambiguous information because of their robustness of measurement results. The CSM and CEM are extended to SULSs to calculate the DMs’ and attributes weights quantitively, respectively. Thirdly, in terms of effective integration of fuzzy information to obtain more accurate decision results, the Hamy mean (HM) and dual Hamy mean (DHM) operators are valued due to their consideration of the interrelationships between inputs. Two extension operators, named spherical fuzzy uncertain linguistic weight HM and DHM, are proposed to integrate spherical fuzzy uncertain linguistic information in the third stage. In the experiment, a decision case is presented to illustrate the applicability of the proposed method, and results show the effectiveness, flexibility and advantages of the proposed method are demonstrated by numerical examples and comparative analysis.},

  abstract     = {The next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation, in recent years, has attracted an extensive amount of attention from the academic community. RNN-based methods cannot establish effective long-term dependencies among the input sequences when capturing the user’s motion patterns, resulting in inadequ ate exploitation of user preferences. Besides, the majority of prior studies often neglect high-order neighborhood information in users’ check-in trajectory and their social relationships, yielding suboptimal recommendation efficacy. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel Double-Layer Attention Network model, named DLAN. Firstly, DLAN incorporates a multi-head attention module that can combine first-order and high-order neighborhood information in user check-in trajectories, thereby effectively and parallelly capturing both long- and short-term preferences of users and overcoming the problem that RNN-based methods cannot establish long-term dependencies between sequences. Secondly, this paper designs a user similarity weighting layer to measure the influence of other users on the target users leverage the social relationships among them. Finally, comprehensive experiments are conducted on user check-in data from two cities, New York (NYC) and Tokyo (TKY), and the results demonstrate that DLAN achieves a performance in Accuracy and Mean Reverse Rank enhancement by 8.07% -36.67% compared to the state-of-the-art method. Moreover, to investigate the effect of dimensionality and the number of heads of the multi-head attention mechanism on the performance of the DLAN model, we have done sufficient sensitivity experiments.},

Timely and accurate disease detection is crucial for effective disease management and minimizing crop losses. In recent years, hyperspectral imaging has emerged as a promising technology for non-destr uctive and early disease detection in crops. This research paper presents an advanced deep learning approach for enhancing crop disease detection using hyperspectral imaging. The primary objective is to propose a hybrid Autoencoder-Generative Adversarial Network (AE-GAN) model that effectively extracts meaningful features from hyperspectral images and addresses the limitations of existing techniques. The hybrid AE-GAN model combines the strengths of the Autoencoder for feature extraction and the Generative Adversarial Network for synthetic sample generation. Through extensive evaluation, the proposed model outperforms existing techniques, achieving exceptional accuracy in crop disease detection. The results demonstrate the superiority of the hybrid AE-GAN model, offering substantial advantages in terms of feature extraction, synthetic sample generation, and utilization of spatial and spectral information. The proposed model’s contributions to sustainable agriculture and global food security make it a valuable tool for advancing agricultural practices and enhancing crop health monitoring. With its promising implications, the hybrid AE-GAN model represents a significant advancement in crop disease detection, paving the way for a more resilient and food-secure future.},

  abstract     = {Every decision-making process particularly those involving real-life issues is disproportionately plagued by uncertainty. It is also unavoidable and obvious. Since its conception are several ways for representing uncertainty have been proposed by numerous academics to cope with uncertainty. Fuzzy s ets and hierarchical such as picture fuzzy sets stand out among them as excellent representation techniques for modeling uncertainty. However, there are several significant drawbacks to the current uncertainty modeling techniques. Due to its vast versatility and benefits we here embrace the idea of the spherical fuzzy set, an extension of the picture fuzzy set. On the other hand amid uncertainty in real life the multi-objective plays a critical role. In this research paper determining a Multi-Objective Linear Programming Problem of Spherical fuzzy sets serves to stimulate nous. The score function corresponding to the degree positive, negative and neutral is the foundation upon which the suggested approach is developed. Additionally we apply the suggested strategy to the solution of the multi-objective linear programming problem to demonstrate its superiority through certain numerical examples. Maximization or Minimizing of the cost is the primary goal of the multi-objective linear programming problem. Using an explicitly defined score function the suggested solution transformed the Spherical Fuzzy Multi-Objective Linear Programming Problem into a Crisp Multi-Objective Linear Programming Problem (CMOLPP). We establish some theorems to show that the efficient solution of CMOLPP is likewise an efficient solution of SFMOLPP. The CMOLPP is then further simplified into a single-objective Linear Programming Problem (LPP) thus we revamp the modified Zimmermann’s approach in the environment of a nonlinear membership function with the aid of the suggested technique. It is possible to simply solve this single-objective LPP using any software or standard LPP algorithm. The suggested approach achieves the fuzzy optimum result without altering the nature of the issue. An application of the suggested approach has been used to illustrate it and its results have been distinguished from those of other preexisting methods found in the literature. To determine the importance of the suggested technique which adjudicate thorough theorem and result analysis is conducted.},

  abstract     = {The proliferation of mobile technology has given rise to a multitude of applications, among them those designed with malicious intent, aimed at compromising the integrity of mobile devices (MDs). To combat this issue, this study introduces an innovative anomaly application detection system leveragi ng Federated Learning in conjunction with a Hyperbolic Tangent Radial-Deep Belief Network (FL-HTR-DBN). This system operates through two distinct phases: training and testing. During the training phase, the system first extracts log files and transforms them into a structured format, harnessing the power of the Hadoop System. Subsequently, these structured logs are converted into vector representations using the Updating Gate-BERT (UG-BERT) technique, thereby facilitating feature extraction. These features are then annotated utilizing the Symmetric Kullback Leibler Divergence squared Euclidean distance-based K Means (SKLD-SED K Means) algorithm. The FL-HTR-DBN model is subsequently trained using these labelled features. The detected anomalies are hashed and securely stored within an index tree, alongside their corresponding hashed Media Access Control (MAC) addresses. In the testing phase, log files are cross-referenced with the hashed index tree to identify potential anomalies. Notably, this novel approach outperforms many valuable outcomes in comparison with the existing approaches ConAnomaly, QLLog and LogCAD in terms of precision 97.5, recall 97.1, accuracy 95.9, F-measure 93.9, sensitivity 94.8 and specificity 95.9.},

  abstract     = {Association rule mining (ARM) is an important research issue in the field of data mining that aims to find relations among different items in binary databases. The conventional ARM algorithms consider the frequency of the items in binary databases, which is not sufficient for real time applications . In this paper, a novel hash table based Type-2 fuzzy mining algorithm (T2FM) with an efficient pruning strategy is presented for discovering multiple fuzzy frequent itemsets from quantitative databases. The algorithm employs a hash table based structure for efficient storage and retrieval of item/itemset which reduces the search efficiency to O(1) or constant time. Previously, type-2 based Apriori and FP-growth based fuzzy frequent itemsets mining were proposed, which required large amounts of computation and a greater number of candidate generation and processing. Meanwhile, the proposed approach reduces a huge amount of computation by finding the common keys before the actual intersection operation takes place. An efficient pruning strategy is proposed to avoid unpromising candidates in order to speed up the computations. Several experiments are carried out to verify the efficiency of the approach in terms of runtime and memory for different minimum support threshold and the results show that the designed approach provides better performance compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The IoMT (Internet of Medical Things) has allowed for uninterrupted, critical patient observation, improved diagnosis precision, and efficient therapy. However, despite the usefulness of such medical things (devices), they also raise a lot of confidentiality and security issues since they provide p otential entry points for hackers to exploit. Therefore, there is a pressing need for a technique for detecting network intrusions that combines precision, flexibility, and consistency. Addressing diverse information sources is challenging for finding negligible intrusions in sophisticated network systems, a core problem for current Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). In this research, we propose a deep learning-based method for efficient network IDS in cases when data is unevenly distributed. Therefore, to address the poor identification rate of intrusions, we present a unique CGAN-CNN (Conditional Generative Adversarial Network-Convolutional Neural Network) IDS approach that oversamples from the unbalanced information based on the CGAN paradigm to overcome the functional deterioration induced by such unbalanced data, especially during intrusion detection. In addition, the sub-networks’ critic and generator each get additional constraints as part of the CGAN’s standard operating procedure, which helps to reduce the amount of leeway in the convergence process and speeds up the impact of convergence. To validate the effectiveness of the suggested model, we conducted an investigation using the most contemporary publicly available datasets, namely NIDS (Network Intrusion Detection System), and the CICDDoS2019 (Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity Distributed Denial of Service 2019) dataset from the Canadian Institution for Cybersecurity, and for healthcare-oriented image datasets Kaggle, respectively. The experimental findings validated the superiority of the CGAN-CNN approach described in this research. Notified as more trustworthy indications, F1-score and precision performed at 97.88%, and 97.15%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Multiple-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) technique is often used to make decisions when several optimal options are under consideration. It can be difficult to select a reasonable optimal option for the decision maker under consideration of insufficient information. The theory of Hamy mean (HM) operators are used to express correlation among different input arguments and provide a smooth approximation during the decision-making process. Recently, Aczel Alsina aggregating expressions gained a lot of attention from numerous mathematicians under different fuzzy circumstances. This article aims to illustrate the notion of a Pythagorean fuzzy (PyF) set (PyFS) with some restricted constraints, such as a sum of the square of truth membership value and falsity membership value. We developed a series of new approaches under consideration of the HM tools, including PyF Aczel Alsina Hamy mean (PyFAAHM), and PyF Aczel Alsina weighted Hamy mean (PyFAAWHM) operators. Further, we also extend the theory of Dual Hamy mean (DHM) operators and derived a series of new methodologies such as PyF Aczel Alsina Dual Hamy mean (PyFAADHM) and PyF Aczel Alsina weighted Dual Hamy mean (PyFAAWDHM) operators. To demonstrate the flexibility of our derived approaches, we illustrate an application of a multinational company considering the MAGDM technique. An experimental case study is also illustrated to evaluate a reasonable option from a group of options. We see the advantages and compatibility of our findings by comparing the results of existing approaches with the results of currently discussed methodologies.},

If m = 3 and p1 = 3,  p2 = 2,  p3 = 1, it is called an L (3,  2,  1)-labeling which is widely stu died in the literature. In this paper, we define an L (3,  2,  1)-path coloring of G as a labeling g : V (G) → Z+ such that between every pair of vertices there exists at least one path P where in the labeling restricted to this path is an L (3,  2,  1)-labeling. Among the labels assigned to any vertex of G under g, the maximum label is called the span of g. The L (3,  2,  1)-connection number of a graph G, denoted by k3c (G) is defined as the minimum value of span of g taken over all such labelings g. We call graphs with the special property that k3c (G) = |V (G) | as L (3,  2,  1)-path graceful. In this paper, we obtain k3c (G) of graphs that possess a Hamiltonian path and carry forward the discussion to certain classes of graphs which do not possess a Hamiltonian path, which is novel to this paper. Although different kinds of labeling are studied in the literature with different mathematical constraints imposed, the idea of showing the existence of a graph with a given number as its minimum labeling number has rarely been addressed. We show that given any positive integer, there always exists an L (3,  2,  1)-path graceful graph with the given integer as its k3c (G), thus addressing the inverse question. Finally exploiting the fact that there is no gap on the k3c (G) number line, we give an application of path colorings for secure communication on social networking sites. Efforts to deploy graph coloring in task scheduling, interference-free transmission, etc have been dealt by earlier researchers. In this paper, we deploy the L (3,  2,  1)-path coloring technique defined by us for secure communication in social networks, which has not been dealt with so far.},

  abstract     = {Under the rapid process of urbanization, many early renovated urban villages have also encountered many problems. Due to the rapid development of urban construction and the continuous changes in spatial functions, early renovated urban villages have already encountered problems such as unreasonable commercial distribution, lack of parking spaces, reduced commercial vitality, and commercial activities crowding out affecting the normal lives of villagers. There is a serious contradiction between the need for development and the quality of life of villagers. Due to the fixed nature of architectural space, only by fully understanding the essential morphological characteristics of the space can we find the optimal solutions for different space usage functions, and obtain the matching of the optimal solutions in the existing space requirements. The social ecological evaluation of the spatial form of old urban blocks is a multi-attribute group decision making (MAGDM). Recently, the grey relational analysis (GRA) and CRITIC method has been used to cope with MAGDM issues. The dual probabilistic linguistic term sets (DPLTSs) are used as a tool for characterizing uncertain information during the social ecological evaluation of the spatial form of old urban blocks. In this manuscript, the dual probabilistic linguistic GRA (DPL-GRA) method is built to solve the MAGDM under DPLTSs. The CRITIC method is used to obtain the attributes weights. In the end, a numerical case study for social ecological evaluation of the spatial form of old urban blocks is given to validate the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Selecting a sustainable facility location is a crucial strategy for manufacturing companies to achieve long-term success in today’s competitive environment. Various quantitative and qualitative criteria with different importance in a multiple level structure must be considered and aggregated to ass ist the company in decision-making. How to determine these criteria weights and select the sustainable manufacturing facility locations have become research questions. To resolve this problem, this paper proposes a total distance ranking approach to fuzzy analytic hierarchical process (AHP)-based multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) method. Currently, the membership functions of fuzzy weighted ratings in the MCDM with a multilevel structure cannot be developed. A ranking method is needed to defuzzify those fuzzy numbers used for fuzzy AHP and qualitative criteria in the MCDM for better executing decision-making procedure. The total distance ranking method related to the centroid on x-axis, centroid on y-axis and the distances of centroids point to the two tangent lines of a fuzzy number are considered in the proposed ranking approach. Formulas of the proposed approach will be presented, and some properties will be investigated to derive formulas for trapezoidal and triangular fuzzy numbers. A comparison with relevant ranking methods will be made to show the advantages of the proposed ranking approach. The proposed ranking approach is then applied to defuzzify the fuzzy numbers used in fuzzy AHP and linguistic values under qualitative criteria to obtain the criteria weights under multi-level structure and crisp values under qualitative criteria, respectively. The final scores of alternatives can be obtained by aggregating crisp criteria values and their corresponding weights by simple additive weighting method to obtain the ranking result. A numerical example will be conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed model. Finally, a comparison with Best-Worst method (BWM) will be presented to show the persuasiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The two-sided matching (TSM) decision-making is an interdisciplinary research field encompassing management science, behavioral science, and computer science, which are widely applied in various industries and everyday life, generating significant economic and social value. However, in the decision -making process of real-world TSM, the complexity of the decision-making problem and environment lead to the preference information provided by the two-sided agents being ambiguous and uncertain. The purpose of this study is to develop a new fair and stable matching methodology to resolve the TSM problem with multiple hesitant fuzzy element (HFE) information. The decision-making process is as follows. First, the TSM problem with four kinds of HFEs is described. To solve this problem, the HFE value of each index is normalized and then is transformed into the closeness degree by using the bidirectional projection technology. Second, based on the closeness degree, the weight of each index is calculated by using the Critic method. Then, the agent satisfaction is obtained by aggregating the closeness and the weights. Next, a fair and stable TSM model to maximizing agent satisfactions under the constraints of one-to-one stable matching is constructed. The best TSM scheme can be obtained by solving the TSM model. Finally, an example of logistics technology cooperation is provided to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the presented model and methodology. The proposed methodology develops a novel fuzzy information presentation tool and constructs a TSM model considering the fairness and stability, which is of great significance to investigate the TSM decision-making and the resolution of real-life TSM problems under the uncertain and fuzzy environments. One future research direction is to consider multiple psychological and behavioral factors of two-sided agents in TSM problems.},

  abstract     = {To achieve the carbon neutrality goal, enterprises should consider not only the development of new low-carbon emission projects but also the adjustment of the existing high-carbon emission projects. This paper discusses a multi-period project adjustment and selection (MPPAS) problem under the carbo n tax and carbon quota policies. First, we propose an uncertain mean-chance MPPAS model for maximizing the profit of the project portfolio under the carbon tax and carbon quota policies. Then, we provide the deterministic equivalent of the proposed model and conduct the theoretical analysis of the impact of carbon tax and carbon quota policies. Next, we propose an improved adaptive genetic algorithm to solve the proposed model. Finally, we give numerical experiments to verify the proposed algorithm’s performance and show the proposed model’s applicability.

  abstract     = {Predicting the landslide-prone area is critical for various applications, including emergency response, land planning, and disaster mitigation. There needs to be a thorough landslide inventory in current studies and appropriate sampling uncertainty issues. Landslide risk mapping has expanded signif icantly as machine learning techniques have developed. However, one of the primary issues in Landslide Prediction is data imbalance (DI). This is problematic since it is challenging or expensive to generate an accurate inventory map of landslides based on previous data. This study proposes a novel landslide prediction method using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for generating the synthetic data, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) for overcoming the data imbalance problem, and Bee Collecting Pollen Algorithm (BCPA) for feature extraction. Combining 184 landslides and ten criteria, including topographic wetness index (TWI), aspect, distance from the road, total curvature, sediment transport index (STI), height, slope, stream, lithology, and slope length, a geographical database was produced. The data was generated using GAN, a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) technique to populate the dataset. The proposed DCNN-BCPA approach findings were merged with current machine learning methods such as Random Forests (RF), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN), Decision Trees (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR). The model’s accuracy, precision, recall, f-score, and RMSE were measured using the following metrics: 92.675%, 96.298%, 90.536%, 96.637%, and 45.623%. This study suggests that harmonizing landslide data may have a substantial impact on the predictive capabilities of machine learning models.},

  abstract     = {The expeditious advancement and widespread implementation of intelligent urban infrastructure have yielded manifold advantages, albeit concurrently engendering novel security predicaments. Examining current patterns in the security of smart cities is paramount in comprehending nascent risks and for mulating efficacious preventative measures. The present study suggests the utilization of Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) as a means to scrutinize and reveal implicit semantic associations within a collection of textual materials pertaining to the security of smart cities. Through the process of gathering and pre-processing pertinent textual data, constructing a matrix that represents the frequency of terms within documents, and utilizing techniques that reduce the number of dimensions, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) has the ability to uncover concealed patterns and associations among concepts related to security. This study proposes five recommendations for future research that employ a topic modeling technique to investigate the often-explored subjects related to smart city security. This discovery provides additional evidence in favor of the proposition that a robust blockchain-driven framework is vital for the advancement of smart cities. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) offers important insights into the dynamic landscape of smart city security by employing several techniques such as pattern recognition, document or phrase clustering, and result visualization. Through the examination of patterns and developments, individuals in positions of political authority, urban planning, and security knowledge possess the ability to uphold their proficiency, render judicious choices substantiated by empirical data, and establish proactive strategies aimed at preserving the security, privacy, and sustainability of intelligent urban environments.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of information technology, software products are playing an increasingly important role in people’s production and life, and have penetrated into many industries. Software quality is the degree to which the software meets the specified requirements, and is an important in dicator to evaluate the quality of the products used. At present, the scale of software is increasing, and the complexity is increasing. It is an urgent problem to reasonably grasp and ensure the product quality. The measurement and evaluation of Software quality characteristics is an effective means to improve Software quality. Faced with the complex system of software, there are many factors that affect product quality. Current research mainly measures software product quality from a qualitative perspective. The computer software quality evaluation is a classical multi-attribute group decision making (MAGDM). Type-2 Neutrosophic Numbers (T2NNs) is a popular set in the field of MAGDM and many scholars have expanded the traditional MAGDM to this T2NNs in recent years. In this paper, two new similarity measures based on sine function for T2NN is proposed under T2NNs. These two new methods are built for MAGDM based on the sine similarity measures for T2NN (SST) and sine similarity weighted measures for T2NN (SSWT). At the end of this paper, Finally, a practical case study for computer software quality evaluation is constructed to validate the proposed method and some comparative studies are constructed to verify the applicability. Thus, the main research contribution of this work is constructed: (1) two new similarity measures based on sine function for T2NN is proposed under T2NNs; (2) These two new methods are built for MAGDM based on the sine similarity measures for T2NN (SST) and sine similarity weighted measures for T2NN (SSWT); (3) an example for computer software quality evaluation is employed to verify the constructed techniques and several decision comparative analysis are employed to verify the constructed techniques.},

Nevertheless, gait analysis is difficult to do because patients with different neurodegenerative diseases may have similar human gaits. Machine learning alg orithms may improve the correct identification of these pathologies. However, the problem with many classification algorithms is a lack of transparency and interpretability for the final user. Methods:In this study, we implemented the PS-Merge operator for the classification, employing gait biomarkers of a public dataset. Results:The highest classification percentage was 83.77%, which means an acceptable degree of reliability. Conclusions:Our results show that PS-Merge has the ability to explain how the algorithm chooses an option, i.e., the operator can be seen as a first step to obtaining an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI).},

  abstract     = {The selection of an appropriate third-party logistics (3PL) provider has become an inescapable option for shippers in today’s business landscape, as the outsourcing of logistics activities continues to increase. Choosing the 3PL supplier that best meets their requirements is one of the most difficu lt difficulties that logistics consumers face. Effective decision-making (DM) is critical in dealing with such scenarios, allowing shippers to make well-informed decisions within a restricted timeframe. The importance of DM arises from the possible financial repercussions of poor decisions, which can result in significant financial losses. In this regard, we introduce p, q-spherical fuzzy set (p, q-SFS), a novel concept that extends the concept of T-spherical fuzzy sets (T-SFSs). p, q-SFS is a comprehensive representation tool for capturing imprecise information. The main contribution of this article is to define the basic operations and a series of averaging and geometric AOs under p, q-spherical fuzzy (p, q-SF) environment. In addition, we establish several fundamental properties of the proposed aggregation operators (AOs). Based on these AOs, we propose a stepwise algorithm for multi-criteria DM (MCDM) problems. Finally, a real-life case study involving the selection of a 3PL provider is shown to validate the applicability of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is a strategy that leads the network via software by separating its control plane from the underlying forwarding plane. In support of a global digital network, multi-domain SDN architecture emerges as a viable solution. However, the complex and ever-evolving nature of network threats in a multi-domain environment presents a significant security challenge for controllers in detecting abnormalities. Moreover, multi-domain anomaly detection poses a daunting problem due to the need to process vast amounts of data from diverse domains. Deep learning models have gained popularity for extracting high-level feature representations from massive datasets. In this work, a novel deep neural network architecture, supervised learning based LD-BiHGA (Low Dimensional Bi-channel Hybrid GAN Attention) system is designed to learn class-specific features for accurate anomaly detection. Two asymmetric GANs are employed for learning the normal and abnormal network flows separately. Then, to extract more relevant features, a bi-channel attention mechanism is added. This is the first study to introduce an innovative hybrid architecture that merges bi-channel hybrid GANs with attention models for the purpose of anomaly detection in a multi-domain SDN environment that effectively handles real-time unbalanced data. The suggested architecture demonstrates its effectiveness on three benchmark datasets, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 7.225% on balanced datasets and 3.335% on imbalanced datasets compared to previous intrusion detection system (IDS) architectures in the literature.},

Therefore, the automatic identification of multimodal fake news has become an important research hotspot in academia and industry. The key to multimedia fake news detection is to accurately extract features of both text and visual information, as well as to mine the correlation between them. However, most of the existing methods merely fuse the features of different modal information without fully extracting intra- and inter-modal connections and complementary information. In this work, we learn physical tampered cues for images in the frequency domain to supplement information in the image space domain, and propose a novel multimodal frequency-aware cross-attention network (MFCAN) that fuses the representations of text and image by jointly modelling intra- and inter-modal relationships between text and visual information whin a unified deep framework. In addition, we devise a new cross-modal fusion block based on the cross-attention mechanism that can leverage inter-modal relationships as well as intra-modal relationships to complement and enhance the features matching of text and image for fake news detection. We evaluated our approach on two publicly available datasets and the experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms existing baseline methods.},

This paper present a new ensemble model for personal credit assessment. First, considering the conflicts and differences among multiple sources of information, a new method is proposed to correct the category prior information by using the difference measure. Then, the revised prior information is fused with the current sample information with the help of Bayesian data fusion theory. The model can integrate the advantages of multiple benchmark classifiers to reduce the interference of uncertain information. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, several typical ensemble classification models are selected and empirically studied using real customer credit data from a commercial bank in China, and the results show that among various assessment criteria: the proposed model not only effectively improves the multi-class classification performance, but also outperforms other advanced multi-class classification credit assessment models in terms of parameter tuning and generalizability.

  abstract     = {This paper explores the relationship between fuzzy logic algebra and non associative groupoid. As a groupoid which can satisfy type-2 cyclic associative (T2CA) law, T2CA-groupoid is characterized by generalized symmetry. Fuzzy logic algebra is a major direction in the study of fuzzy logic. Residuat ed lattices are a class of fuzzy logic algebras with widespread applications. The inflationary pseudo general residuated lattice (IPGRL), a generalization of the residuated lattice, does not need to satisfy the associative law and commutative law. Moreover, the greatest element of IPGRL is no longer the identity element. In this paper, the notion of T2CA-IPGRL (IPGRL in T2CA-groupoid) is proposed and its properties are investigated in combination with the study of IPGRL and T2CA-groupoid. In addition, the generalized symmetry and regularity of T2CA-groupoid are investigated based on the characteristics of commutative elements. Meanwhile, the decomposition of T2CA-root of band with T2CA-unipotent radical is studied as well. The result shows that every T2CA-root of band is the disjoint union of T2CA-unipotent radicals.},

  abstract     = {Timely detection of building damage after a disaster can provide support and help in saving lives and reducing losses. The emergence of transfer learning can solve the problem of difficulty in obtaining several labeled samples to train deep models. However, some degree of differences exists among d ifferent scenarios, which may affect the transfer performance. Furthermore, in reality, data can be collected from multiple historical scenarios but cannot be directly combined using single-source domain adaptation methods. Therefore, this study proposes a multi-source variational domain adaptation (MVDA) method to complete the task of post-disaster building assessment. The MVDA method consists of two stages: first, the distributions of each pair of source and target domains in specific feature spaces are aligned separately; second, the outputs of the pre-trained classifiers are aligned using domain-specific decision boundaries. This method maximizes the relevant information in the historical scene, solves the problem of inconsistent image classification in the current scene, and improves the migration efficiency from the history to the current disaster scene. The proposed approach is validated by two challenging multi-source transfer tasks using the post-disaster hurricane datasets. The average accuracy rate of 83.3% for the two tasks is achieved, obtaining an improvement of 0.9% compared with the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Accurate identification and monitoring of aircraft on the airport surface can assist managers in rational scheduling and reduce the probability of aircraft conflicts, an important application value for constructing a &quot;smart airport.&quot; For the airport surface video monitoring, there are small aircraf t targets, aircraft obscuring each other, and affected by different weather, the aircraft target clarity is low, and other complex monitoring problems. In this paper, a lightweight model network for video aircraft recognition in airport field video in complex environments is proposed based on SSD network incorporating coordinate attention mechanism. First, the model designs a lightweight feature extraction network with five feature extraction layers. Each feature extraction layer consists of two modules, Block_A and Block_I. The Block_A module incorporates the coordinate attention mechanism and the channel attention mechanism to improve the detection of obscured aircraft and to enhance the detection of small targets. The Block_I module uses multi-scale feature fusion to extract feature information with rich semantic meaning to enhance the feature extraction capability of the network in complex environments. Then, the designed feature extraction network is applied to the improved SSD detection algorithm, which enhances the recognition accuracy of airport field aircraft in complex environments. It was tested and subjected to ablation experiments under different complex weather conditions. The results show that compared with the Faster R-CNN, SSD, and YOLOv3 models, the detection accuracy of the improved model has been increased by 3.2%, 14.3%, and 10.9%, respectively, and the model parameters have been reduced by 83.9%, 73.1%, and 78.2% respectively. Compared with the YOLOv5 model, the model parameters are reduced by 38.9% when the detection accuracy is close, and the detection speed is increased by 24.4%, reaching 38.2fps, which can well meet the demand for real-time detection of aircraft on airport surfaces.},

  abstract     = {Optimizing the allocation of preschool education resources and improving the efficiency of resource allocation is of great strategic significance for the universal and inclusive development of preschool education and the realization of “education for young children&quot;. In recent years, the shift from high-speed development to high-quality development of the social economy has significantly improved the balanced development level of China’s preschool education industry. However, preschool education remains the weakest link in China’s education system and the most unfavorable aspect of educational resource allocation. Problems such as shortage of preschool education resources, insufficient investment, uneven regional development, imbalanced supply and demand structure, low resource allocation efficiency, and “difficult to enter, expensive to enter” are still prominent. How to optimize resource allocation and improve resource utilization efficiency in the limited resources of preschool education is the key to achieving balanced, fair, coordinated, and high-quality development of preschool education. The county preschool education resource allocation level evaluation is MAGDM problems. Recently, the TODIM and TOPSIS technique was employed to cope with MAGDM issues. The interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy sets (IVPFSs) are employed as a tool for characterizing uncertain information during the county preschool education resource allocation level evaluation. In this manuscript, the interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy TODIM-TOPSIS (IVPF-TODIM-TOPSIS) technique is built to solve the MAGDM under IVPFSs. Finally, a numerical case study for county preschool education resource allocation level evaluation is given to validate the proposed technique. The main contribution of this paper is managed: (1) the TODIM and TOPSIS technique was extended to IVPFSs; (2) Information Entropy is employed to manage the weight values under IVPFSs. (3) the IVPF-TODIM-TOPSIS technique is founded to manage the MAGDM under IVPFSs; (4) Algorithm analysis for county preschool education resource allocation level evaluation and comparison analysis are constructed based on one numerical example to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the IVPF-TODIM-TOPSIS technique.},

The paper is devoted to solving linear systems where the coefficients of the variables and right hand side values are Z-numbers.

  abstract     = {Corporate culture is an objective existence that arises with the rise and development of enterprises. It originates from enterprise practice and influences the behavior of employees. Whether it is intentional identification or unintentional avoidance, corporate culture is not a question of absence, but a question of quality; It’s not about non-existent issues, but about the magnitude of their influence. Therefore, building a corporate culture that conforms to the characteristics of the enterprise and is recognized by the majority of employees, continuously enhancing the influence of corporate culture, is a very important topic in the construction of corporate culture. The corporate culture influence evaluation is looked as the multiple attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) problem. The intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) are easy to depict the uncertain information during the corporate culture influence evaluation. Then, intuitionistic fuzzy Combined Compromise Solution (IF-CoCoSo) method is designed under IFSs. Furthermore, IF-CoCoSo is used to cope with the MAGDM. At last, an example is supplied for corporate culture influence evaluation to prove the practicability of the IF-CoCoSo method and some comparative analysis are conducted to verify the effectiveness of IF-CoCoSo method. Thus, the main objectives of this paper are outlined as follows: (1) the CRITIC method is used to obtain the weight information; (2) intuitionistic fuzzy Combined Compromise Solution (IF-CoCoSo) method is designed under IFSs; (3) IF-CoCoSo is used to cope with the MAGDM based on CRITIC weight information and Euclidean distance; (4) At last, an example is supplied for corporate culture influence evaluation to prove the practicability of the IF-CoCoSo method and some comparative analysis are conducted to show the effectiveness of IF-CoCoSo method.},

  abstract     = {With the development of digital creative industry and the use of more emerging digital technologies, the forms of digital cultural and creative design products are also increasingly diversified. Unlike traditional cultural and creative design products, digital cultural and creative design products are no longer limited to physical products, but appear more in the field of exhibition, virtual reality and product visualization. At the initial stage of the combination of digital information technology and cultural and creative content, digital cultural and creative design products, unlike ordinary cultural and creative design products, opened a new vision for users. The design quality evaluation of digital cultural and creative design products is viewed as a multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM). The single-value neutrosophic sets (SVNSs) concept and its interval-valued version (Interval-valued neutrosophic sets, IVNSs) are within the recent rapid developments for managing the uncertain representation problem in MCGDM. In SVNSs, decision makers (DMs) could portray membership, non-membership and hesitancy. IVNSs expands this useful feature through portraying intervals to these three information decision degrees. In this manner, the uncertainty, ambiguity and vagueness hidden in human judgements could be quantified more efficiently. IVNSs have been widely employed and researched in MCGDM. The main purpose of this paper is to proposed the Interval-valued neutrosophic number MABAC (IVNN-MABAC) technique based on prospect theory (PT) to address the MCGDM. Eventually, an example for design quality evaluation of digital cultural and creative design products and some comparative analysis was employed to demonstrate the superiority of the designed technique.},

  abstract     = {Big data analytics (BDA) is a systematic way to analyze and detect various patterns, relationships, and trends in vast amounts of data. Big data analysis and processing require significant effort, techniques, and equipment. The Hadoop framework software uses the MapReduce approach to do large-scale data analysis using parallel processing in order to generate results as soon as possible. Due to the traditional algorithm’s longer execution time and difficulty in processing big amounts of data, this is one of the main issues. Clusters are highly correlated inside each other but are not highly correlated with one another. The technique of effectively allocating limited resources is known as an optimization algorithm for clustering. For processing large amounts of data with several dimensions, the conventional optimization approach is insufficient. By using a fuzzy method, this can be prevented. In this paper, we proposed Fuzzy based energy efficient clustering approach to enhance the clustering mechanism. In summary, Fuzzy based energy efficient clustering introduces a function that measures the distance between the cluster center and the instance, which aids in improved clustering, and we then present the MobileNet V2 model to improve efficiency and speed up computation. To enhance the method’s performance and reduce its time complexity, the distributed database simulates the shared memory space and parallelizes on the MapReduce framework on the Hadoop cloud computing platform. The proposed approach is evaluated using performance metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), Recall, F1-Score, and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI). The experimental findings indicate that the proposed approach outperforms the existing techniques in terms of clustering accuracy.},

Meanwhile, the importance of imbalanced data has become increasingly prominent, it is necessary to find appropriate methods to enhance classifi cation performance of classifiers on such datasets. In response, this paper proposes a mixed sampling method (ISODF-ENN) based on iterative self-organizing (ISODATA) denoising diffusion algorithm and edited nearest neighbors (ENN) data cleaning algorithm. The algorithm first uses iterative self-organizing clustering algorithm to divide minority class into different sub-clusters, then it uses denoising diffusion algorithm to generate new minority class data for each sub-cluster, and finally it uses ENN algorithm to preprocess majority class data to remove the overlap with the minority class data. Each sub-cluster is oversampled according to sampling ratio, so that the oversampled minority class data also conforms to the distribution of original minority class data. Experimental results on keel datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other methods in terms of F-value and AUC, effectively addressing the issues of class imbalance and class overlap.},

  abstract     = {Awareness of Network Security Situation (abbreviated as NSS for short) technology is in a period of vigorous development recently. NSS technology means network security situational awareness technology. It refers to the technology of collecting, processing, and analyzing various real-time informati on in the network to understand and evaluate the current network security status. It can not only find network security threats, but also reflect the NSS in the system security metrics, and provide users with targeted security protection measures. Based on data mining methods, this paper analyzed and models perceived threats and security events with data mining algorithms, and improved information security measurement methods based on association analysis. This paper proposed network security information analysis and NSS based on data mining, and analyzed the experimental results of network awareness of NSS information security measurement. The experimental results showed that when the Timer was 8, the accuracy of the awareness of NSS information security measurement method based on data mining can reach 92.89%. The data mining model had the highest accuracy of 93.14% in situation understanding and evaluation of KDDCup-99 dataset. The results showed that the model can accurately predict the NSS. When Timer was 6, the highest accuracy of the model was 92.71%. In general, the NSS prediction mining model based on KDDCup-99 can better understand, evaluate and predict the situation.},

  abstract     = {Rice is a staple meal that helps people worldwide access sufficient food. However, this crop has several illnesses, significantly lowering its production and quality. Because of this, it is imperative to conduct early disease detection to halt the spread of infections. Because of this, it is desira ble to develop an automatic system that will help agronomists, pathologists, and indeed growers in directly diagnosing rice diseases. This would allow for preventative measures to be done as quickly as feasible. In this day and age of artificial intelligence, researchers have experimented with various learning approaches to discover diseases that can affect rice plants. Deep learning has recently seen considerable use in many computer vision and image analysis fields, becoming one of the most prominent machine learning algorithms. Deep learning has also recently found substantial usage in many computer vision and picture analysis fields. On the other hand, deep learning methods have seen very little application in plant disease recognition, except for some ongoing research centered on the problem and using a public dataset of pictures magnified to show plant leaves. Because of their high computational complexity, which requires a huge memory cost, and the complexity of experimental materials’ backgrounds, which makes it difficult to train an efficient model, deep learning methods have only seen limited use in plant disease recognition. This is due to several factors, including the following: The Inception module was improved to recognise and detect rice plant illnesses in this research by substituting the original convolutions with architecture based on modified-Xception (M-Xception). In addition, ResNet extracts features by prioritising logarithm calculations over softmax calculations to get more consistent classification outcomes. The model’s training utilised a two-stage transfer learning process to produce an effective model. The results of the experiments reveal that the suggested approach can achieve the specified level of performance, with an average recognition fineness of 99.73% on the public dataset and 98.05% on the domestic dataset, respectively. Our proposed work is better as per existing methods and models.},

  abstract     = {In agriculture, selecting an “appropriate plant for an appropriate soil” is a crucial stage for all sorts of lands. There are different types of soil found in India. It is necessary to understand the features of the soil type to predict the types of crops cultivated in a particular soil. This leads to significant inconsistencies and errors in large-scale soil mapping. However, manually analyzing the soil type in the laboratory is cost-effective and time-consuming, yet it produces an inaccurate classification result. To overcome these challenges, a novel AQU-FRC Net (Aquila – Faster Regional Convolutional Neural Neural) is proposed for the automatic prediction of soil and recommending suitable crops based on a soil-crop relationship database. The soil images were pre-processed using a Scalable Range-based Adaptive Bilateral Filter (SCRAB) for eliminating the noise artifacts from the images. The pre-processed images were classified using Faster-RCNN, which utilized MobileNet as a feature extraction network. The classification results were optimized by the Aquila optimization (AQU) algorithm that normalizes the parameters of the network to achieve better results. The proposed AQU-FRC Net achieves a high accuracy of 98.16% for predicting soil. The experimental results demonstrate that the model successfully predicts the soil when compared to other meta-heuristic-based methods.},

Thi s study aims to determine the most appropriate multi-UAVs formation shape in a specific mission to meet different and even conflicting requirements. The proposed approach introduces requirement satisfaction and spherical fuzzy analytic network process (SFANP) to improve the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). First, multi-UAVs capability criteria and their evaluation models are constructed. Next, performance data are transformed into requirement satisfaction of capability and unified into a same scale. Qualitative judgments are made and quantified based on spherical fuzzy sets and nonlinear transformation functions are developed for benefit, cost, and interval metrics. Then, SFANP is used to handle interrelationships among criteria and determine their global weights, which takes decision vagueness and hesitancy into account and extends decision-makers’ preference domain onto a spherical surface. Finally, alternative formation shapes are ranked by their distances to the positive and negative ideal solution according to the TOPSIS. Furthermore, a case study of 9 UAVs performing a search-attack mission is set up to illustrate the proposed approach, and a comparative analysis is conducted to verify the applicability and credibility.},

  abstract     = {Intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) information aggregation in multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) is a substantial stream that has attracted significant research attention. There are various IF aggregation operators have been suggested for extracting more informative data from imprecise and redundant raw information. However, some of the aggregation techniques that are currently being applied in IF environments are non-monotonic with respect to the total order, and suffer from high computational complexity and inflexibility. It is necessary to develop some novel IF aggregation operators that can surpass these imperfections. This paper aims to construct some IF aggregation operators based on Yager’s triangular norms to shed light on decision-making issues. At first, we present some novel IF operations such as Yager sum, Yager product and Yager scalar multiplication on IF sets. Based on these new operations, we propose the IF Yaeger weighted geometric operator and the IF Yaeger ordered weighted geometric operator, and prove that they are monotone with respect to the total order. Then, the focus on IF MCDM have motivated the creation of a new MCDM model that relies on suggested operators. We show the applicability and validity of the model by using it to select the most influential worldwide supplier for a manufacturing company and evaluate the most efficient method of health-care disposal. In addition, we discuss the sensitivity of the proposed operator to decision findings and criterion weights, and also analyze it in comparison with some existing aggregation operators. The final results show that the proposed operator is suitable for aggregating both IF information on “non-empty lattice&quot; and IF data on total orders.},

This paper proposed the new model based on the medical internet of things for predicting diabetic macular edema in retina fundus images.

The DMER method includes the following stages: (i) ResNet101 improved combining with feature pyramid network is used to extract features of the image and obtain the map of these features; (ii) a region proposal network to look for potential anomalies; and (iii) the predicted bounding boxes against the true bounding box by the regression method to certify the capability of macular edema. The MESSIDOR and DIARETDB1 datasets are used for testing with evaluation criteria such as sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. The accuracy of the DMER method is about 98.08% with MESSIDOR dataset and 98.92% with DIARETDB1 dataset.

  abstract     = {Data mining is one of the emerging technologies used in many applications such as Market analysis and Machine learning. Temporal data mining is used to get a clear knowledge about current trend and to predict the upcoming future. The rudimentary challenge in introducing a data mining procedure is, processing time and memory consumption are highly increasing while trying to improve the accuracy, precision or recall. As well as, while trying to reduce the processing time or memory consumption, accuracy, precision and recall values are reducing significantly. So, for improving the performance of the system and to preserve the memory and processing time, Three-Dimensional Fuzzy FP-Tree (TDFFPT) is proposed for Temporal data mining. Three functional modules namely, Three-Dimensional Temporal data FP-Tree (TTDFPT), Fuzzy Logic based Temporal Data Tree Analyzer (FTDTA) and Temporal Data Frequent Itemset Miner (TDFIM) are integrated in the proposed method. This algorithm scans the database and generates frequent patterns as per the business need. Every time a client purchases a new item, it gets stored in the recent database layer instead of rescanning the entire records which are placed in the old layer. The results obtained shows that the performance of the proposed model is more efficient than that of the existing algorithm in terms of overall accuracy, processing time, reduction in the memory utilization, and the number of databases scans. In addition, the proposed model also provides improved decision making and accurate pattern prediction in the time series data.},

  abstract     = {As society evolves, companies produce more homogeneous products, shifting customers’ needs from functionality to emotions. Therefore, how quickly customers select products that meet their Kansei preferences has become a key concern. However, customer Kansei preferences vary from person to person an d are ambiguous and uncertain, posing a challenge. To address this problem, this paper proposes a TF-KE-GRA-TOPSIS method that integrates triangular fuzzy Kansei engineering (TF-KE) with Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). Firstly, a Kansei evaluation system is constructed based on KE and fuzzy theory. A dynamic triangular fuzzy Kansei preference similarity decision matrix (TF-KPSDM) is defined to quantify customer satisfaction with fuzzy Kansei preferences. Secondly, dynamic objective weights are derived using Criteria Importance Though Intercrieria Correlation (CRITIC) and entropy, optimized through game theory to achieve superior combined weights. Thirdly, the GRA-TOPSIS method utilizes the TF-KPSDM and combined weights to rank products. Finally, taking the case of Kansei preference selection for electric bicycles, results indicate that the proposed method robustly avoids rank reversal and achieves greater accuracy than comparative models. This study can help companies dynamically recommend products to customers based on their Kansei preferences, increasing customer satisfaction and sales.},

  abstract     = {In this research, –coverage –connected problem is viewed as multi-objective problem and shuffling frog leaps algorithm is proposed to address multi-objective optimization issues. The shuffled frog leaping set of rules is a metaheuristic algorithm that mimics the behavior of frogs. Shuffled frog lea ping algorithms are widely used to seek global optimal solutions by executing the guided heuristic on the given solution space. The basis for the success of this SFL algorithm is the ability to exchange information among a group of individuals which phenomenally explores the search space. SFL improves the overall lifespan of the network, the cost of connection among the sensors, to enhance the equality of coverage among the sensors and targets, reduced sensor count for increased coverage, etc. When it comes to coverage connectivity issues, each target has to be covered using k sensors to avoid the loss of data and m sensors connected enhance the lifespan of the network. When the targets are covered by k sensors then the loss of data will be reduced to an extended manner. When the sensors are connected with m other sensors then the connectivity among the sensors will not go missing and hence the lifespan of the network will be improved significantly. Therefore, the sensor node number in coverage indicates the total number of sensor nodes utilised to cover a target, and the number of sensor nodes in connected reflects the total number of sensor nodes that provide redundancy for a single failed sensor node. Connectivity between sensor nodes is crucial to the network’s longevity. The entire network backbone acts strategically when all the sensors are connected with one or the other to pertain to the connectivity of the network. Coverage is yet another key issue regarding the loss of data. The proposed algorithm solves the connectivity of sensors and coverage of targets problems without weighted sum approach. The proposed algorithm is evaluated and tested under different scenarios to show the significance of the proposed algorithm.},
