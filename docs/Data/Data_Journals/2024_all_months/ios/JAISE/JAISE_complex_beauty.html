The high-resolution cameras open a window for different research studies, where the volume measurement is vital for different areas. This study aims to identify image processing techniques for measuring the object’s volume. Thus, a systematic review was performed with a Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based framework for identifying studies between 2010 and 2023 related to the measurement of object volume. As a result of this search, this paper reviewed and analyzed 25 studies, verifying that different computer vision methods accurately handle object recognition. Additionally, an evaluation of the databases presented by the studies above is performed to consider further the design of a new approach to infer the volume of objects from an image.},

  abstract     = {The manual sorting of recyclable garbage has caused several issues such as the wastage of human resources and low resource utilization. To solve this problem, an improved Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) deep learning approach has been developed for recyclable garbage detection. To reduce the number of parameters and make the model easier to deploy and apply, a lightweight network called RepVGG has been chosen to replace the VGG16 network in the SSD. Additionally, the auxiliary convolutional layer structure of the SSD has been modified to further reduce the number of parameters. Additionally, the SK module has been integrated to adaptively adjust the size of the receptive field and enhance the detection accuracy. Experimental results of Waste Classification data set from Kaggle website have demonstrated that the improved SSD model has better detection accuracy and real-time performance, with an accuracy of 95.23%, which is 4.33 percentage points higher than the original SSD, and a detection speed of up to 64 FPS. This algorithm can be better applied in industry.},

In this study, we propose a novel method that generates an image using wavelet transform to extract time-frequency features of the recorded signal. Our method employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and activity recognition, and a new loss function that produces denser representations for samples, improving the model’s generalization on unseen samples. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conducted experiments on multiple publicly available data sets. Our results demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods in terms of activity classification accuracy. Specifically, our method achieves higher accuracy rates and demonstrates improved robustness in real-world settings. Overall, our proposed method addresses the research gap of accurate and robust activity recognition from time-series data recorded from different sensors.

  abstract     = {Technological innovations in Internet of Things (IoT) have resulted in smart agricultural solutions such as a remotely monitored Aquaponics system and a wireless sensor network (WSN) of such systems (nodes). IoT enables continuous sensing of temperature and pH data at each node of the WSN, which is periodically transmitted to a remote fusion centre. In this regard, the data matrices acquired at the fusion centre often suffer from data vacancies and missing data problems, owing to typical wireless multipath fading environment, sensor malfunctions and node failures. This paper explores the applicability of different matrix completion approaches for missing data reconstruction. Specifically, the performance of baseline predictor, correlation based approaches such as baseline predictor with temporal model, k-nearest neighbors (kNN) and low rank based approaches such as Sparsity Regularized Singular Value Decomposition (SRSVD) and Augmented Lagrangian Sparsity Regularized Matrix Factorization (ALSRMF) have been explored. Reliable temperature and pH data for 19 independent acquisition hours with 60 samples per hour are acquired at the fusion centre via Ultra High Frequency (UHF) transmission at 470 MHz and suitable pre-processing. Simulating different data integrity scenarios, the reconstruction error plots from each of these matrix completion approaches is extracted. A hybrid of kNN and baseline predictor with temporal model rendered a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 1.75% for temperature and 0.86% for pH, at 0.5 data integrity. Further, with ALSRMF, which exploits the low rank constraint, the error reduced to 1.25% for temperature and 0.7% for pH, thus substantiating a promising approach for Aquaponics system data reconstruction.},

The present study employs a machine learning methodology to perform a global analysis of energy consumption and efficiency in smart homes. In This work we propose two advanced ensemble models to improve the performance of energy consumption in smart homes, the first one is a voting ensemble model based on a ranking weight averaging that combines following basic machine learning techniques: decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB). The second one is the stacking ensemble model in which the basic models (DT-RF-XGB) are combined through stacked generalization, then uses a secondary layer model or meta-learner (RF) to provide output prediction. The findings obtained show that the proposed ensemble model based on DT-RF-XGB using stacking technique surpasses all other basic algorithms with R 2 around 0.9825.},

  abstract     = {Task allocation is a vital challenge in a multi-robot environment. A hybrid fuzzy response threshold-based method is proposed to address the problem of task allocation in a heterogeneous mobile robot environment. The method follows a distributed task allocation approach where every robot chooses its task and performs it, resulting in concurrent execution. The algorithm uses a fuzzy inference system to determine the capability of the robot to carry out a task. Then, the robot employs the response threshold model, utilizing the obtained capability to decide on the task to complete. The objective here is to maximize the tasks completed with the resources available while balancing the affinity with which the task is done. The proposed algorithm is initially applied to the static scenario where there is no failure among the mobile robots. The algorithm is then improved to run in the dynamic scenario to study the effect on the allocation. The proposed algorithm is empirically evaluated in simulation for multiple runs under different environment instances. The results show a good increase in tasks performed successfully across all the instances in static and dynamic scenarios. The proposed algorithms are validated using FireBird V mobile robots in an experimental environment.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we present a novel framework for detecting anomalies in everyday activities within a smart-home environment. Our method utilizes the growing neural gas (GNG) concept to dynamically adapt to the changing behaviors of monitored individuals, eliminating the need for supervised input. To develop and evaluate our framework, we collected real-life data from environmental sensors that tracked the daily activities of 17 elderly subjects over a continuous two-year period. The proposed approach is highly versatile, capable of detecting a wide range of anomalies associated with daily living activities. We focus on activities that exhibit abnormal duration, frequency, or entirely new behaviors that deviate from established routines. The performance evaluation of our framework revolves around two key aspects: reliability and adaptability. Reliability measures the accuracy of detecting unusual events, while adaptability assesses the system’s ability to accommodate changes in user behavior. This involves recognizing recurrent anomalous behaviors as new norms over time and transitioning from persistent anomalies during an initial phase. Our proposed anomaly detection system demonstrates promising results in real-life scenarios. It achieves good reliability, with true negative rate and true positive rate exceeding 90% and 80% respectively, across all activities and users. Additionally, the system swiftly adapts to new individuals or their evolving behaviors, adjusting within a span of 3 to 7 days for new behaviors.},

In particular, more accurate control of soil moisture and pH allows improving soil microbial activity, optimizing nutrient uptake, increasing water utilization efficiency within the cultivated plants, which directly contribute to increased crop yields and sustainable resource management in agriculture.

To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed advanced system, the simulation experiments for automatic control of an irrigation process using the developed fuzzy controllers are carried out in this study at given optimal parameters (soil moisture and pH level) of growing conditions for two different crops: tomato and beet.

  abstract     = {The “Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)” has gained a lot of interest among research scholars and has been utilized in various advanced applications in distinct fields. Along with the load balancing techniques, the clustering scheme also prolongs the network’s overall lifespan. The “Cluster Head (CH)” performs the task of load balancing between the nodes in the “Clustering algorithm”; hence, the CH selection procedure is regarded as a critical task in the case of the clustering algorithms. Depending on the CH selection and cluster nodes, the rate of energy consumed by these CHs will be reduced in the wireless sensor. CH selection is a promising solution for the transmission of information within various parameters. Thus, CH selection leads to an increase in the duration of the system and a reduction in the energy utilization by the nodes. Therefore, an “optimization-based CH selection” mechanism in WSN is developed in this paper along with an enhanced node communication performance prediction strategy to provide better communication between the “Sensor Nodes (SNs)” with limited energy expenditure. The node’s communication performance is predicted using the Adaptive Fuzzy, in which metrics such as bit rate, latency, throughput, loss, and packet delivery ratio are specified as the input to the network. Here, the parameters within the fuzzy network are tuned with the help of the recommended “Hybrid Position of Heap and African Buffalo Optimization (HP-HABO)”. Then, to perform efficient node clustering, the “Optimal K-Means Clustering (OKMC)” approach is executed and the CHs are formed using the developed HP-HABO. The objective function depends on the constraints like energy, distance, and predicted communication performance attained by forming these CHs. The performance of the developed CH selection mechanism is verified by analyzing the experimental outcome of the proposed technique with different optimization algorithms and previous works concerning the objective constraints.},

  abstract     = {We propose a framework for predicting sensor event sequences (SES) in smart homes, which can proactively support residents’ activities and alert them if activities are not completed as intended. We leverage ongoing activity recognition to enhance the prediction performance, employing a GPT2-based model typically used for sentence generation. We hypothesize that the relationship between ongoing activities and SES patterns is akin to the relationship between topics and word sequence patterns in natural language processing (NLP), enabling us to apply the GPT2-based model to SES prediction. We empirically evaluated our method using two real-world datasets in which residents performed their usual daily activities. Our experimental results demonstrates that the use of the GPT2-based model significantly improves the F1 value of SES prediction from 0.461 to 0.708 compared to the state-of-the-art method, and that leveraging knowledge on ongoing activity can further improve performance to 0.837. Achieving these SES predictions using the ongoing activity recognition model required simple feature engineering and modeling, yielding a performance rate of approximately 80%.},

However, being the mobility of devices tightly correlated with mobility of their owners, the locations from which data are collected might be limited to specific su b-regions. We extend the data coverage capability of a traditional MCS platform by exploiting unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) as mobile sensors gathering data from low covered locations. We present a probabilistic model designed to measure the coverage of a location. The model analyses the user’s trajectories and the detouring capability of users towards locations of interest. Our model provides a coverage probability for each of the target locations, so that to identify low-covered locations. In turn, these locations are used as targets for the StationPositioning algorithms which optimizes the deployment of k UAV stations. We analyze the performance of StationPositioning by comparing the ratio of the covered locations against Random, DBSCAN and KMeans deployment algorithm. We explore the performance by varying the time period, the deployment regions and the existence of areas where it is not possible to deploy any station. Our experimental results show that StationPositioning is able to optimize the selected target location for a number of UAV stations with a maximum covered ratio up to 60%.},

  abstract     = {Road crash prediction is a fundamental key in designing efficient intelligent transportation systems. There has been a pronounced progress in the use of machine learning models for crash events assessment by the transportation safety research community in recent years. However, little attention has been paid so far to evaluating reduced-visibility crash occurrences within a heuristic ensemble system. This study presents a proactive multicriteria decision-making system that can predict crash occurrences based on real-time roadway properties, land zones’ characteristics, vehicle telemetry, driver inputs and weather conditions collected using a desktop driving simulator. A key novelty of this work is implementing a genetic algorithm-based feature selection approach along with ensemble modeling strategies using AdaBoost, XGBoost and RF techniques to establish effective crash predictions. Furthermore, since crash events occur in rare instances tending to be underrepresented in the dataset, an imbalance-learning methodology to overcome the issue was adopted on the basis of several data resampling approaches to increase the predictive performance namely SMOTE, Borderline-SMOTE, SMOTE-Tomek Links and ADASYN strategies. To our knowledge, there has been a limited interest at adopting an ensemble-based imbalance-learning strategy examining the impact of real-time features’ combinations on the prediction of road crash events under reduced visibility settings.},

The adoption of IoT networks still faces several challenges, despite the rapid advancement of low-power communication technology. Homogenizing this sector requires allowing interoperability between many technologies, which is now one of the largest obstacles. In this article, we present the design and implementation of the hybrid LPWAN architecture that can accomplish wide-area communication coverage and low-power consumption for IoT applications by leveraging two LPWAN technologies, Wireless Smart Ubiquitous Network (Wi-SUN) and Long Range (LoRa). In particular, LoRa is used for long-range communication, and Wi-SUN for a low-latency mesh network. Additionally, we implemented smart street light controlling system as a real-world deployment at the university campus to showcase the efficiency of the hybrid network. Our results demonstrate that the hybrid LPWAN architecture provides a better coverage and capacity while consuming less power than that of the LoRa or Wi-SUN network. The results of this study demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid LPWAN architecture as a viable solution for next-generation IoT applications.},

How to represent and analyse these patterns, however, remains a challenging task, especially when data is relatively scarce and an exp licit model is required to be fine-tuned for specific scenarios. This paper, therefore, presents a new approach for temporal modelling of long-term human activities with smart-home sensors, which is used to detect anomalous situations in a robot-assisted environment. The model is based on wavelet transforms and used to forecast smart sensor data, providing a temporal prior to detect unexpected events in human environments. To this end, a new extension of Hybrid Markov Logic Networks has been developed that merges different anomaly indicators, including activities detected by binary sensors, expert logic rules, and wavelet-based temporal models. The latter in particular allows the inference system to discover deviations from long-term activity patterns, which cannot be detected by simpler frequency-based models. Two new publicly available datasets were collected using several smart-sensors to evaluate the approach in office and domestic scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions and their successful deployment in complex human environments, showing their potential for future smart-home and robot integrated services.},

  abstract     = {Indoor air quality (IAQ) is a critical challenge much less controlled in comparison with outdoor air quality. Bad IAQ is related to significant health complications such as respiratory problems, heart disease, and cancer. Many people spend most of their days inside buildings and don’t have air quality monitoring systems. Therefore, the occupants don’t know when the space has a higher quantity of pollutants than recommended, saturating the environment, and compromising people’s health. This is a problem that can be addressed by using Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to develop monitoring systems that allow a greater number of possibilities regarding the storage and processing of data and access to information by the end user, assisting the decision-making process regarding the indoor air pollution problem. Real-time data can be compared to default values, alerting the user of that situation, and suggesting an action to decrease the air pollutants concentration. There already are multiple solutions involving IoT-based technologies, many of them using low-cost sensors. Those are analyzed in this systematic review. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic pointed out the importance of IAQ monitoring to evaluate the risk of contamination. The microcontrollers, IAQ parameters, sensors, data storage and visualization methods used in monitoring systems have been analyzed. The results show that most of the studies store data in Cloud systems and use Web platforms for data consulting.

Traditionally, measuring the well-being of building occupants has been addressed solely through objective physical variables such as temperature or relative air humidity. However, recent studies indicate that the built environment influences subjective aspects of human well-being. This article presents a scoping review to find information related to the use of BIM in the assessment of the mental and emotional state of inhabitants. A scoping review has been undertaken following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines by searching in Scopus, ACM, IEEE Xplore and PsycINFO databases. Fourteen articles meeting the inclusion criteria were found after the screening process, all of them published in the last decade, twelve in the last five years. Two ways of using BIM have been identified in relation to the subject matter of this review: (i) for visualization and monitoring of occupant well-being and (ii) for showing building design alternatives to future occupants. The included papers show that BIM has potential for assessing the mental and emotional state of building occupants. However, the results of these studies are still limited and much research in this area remains pending.},

  abstract     = {Since its introduction by Mark Weiser, ubiquitous computing has received increased interest in the dawn of technological advancement. Supported by wireless technology advancement, embedded systems, miniaturization, and the integration of various intelligent and communicative devise, context-aware ubiquitous applications actively and intelligently use rich contextual information to assist their users. However, their designs are subject to continuous changes imposed by external factors. Nowadays, software engineering, particularly in the fields of Model-Driven Engineering, displays a strong tendency towards developing applications for pervasive computing. This trend is also fueled by the rise of generative artificial intelligence, paving the way for a new generation of no-code development tools and models specifically trained on open-source code repositories to generate applications from their descriptions. The specificities of our approach lies in starting with a graphical model expressed using a domain-specific language (DSL) composed of symbols and formal notations. This allows for graphically instantiating and editing applications, guiding and assisting experts from various engineering fields in defining ubiquitous applications that are eventually transformed into peculiar models. We believe that creating intelligent models is the best way to promote software development efficiency. We have used and evaluated recurrent neural networks, leveraging the recurrence of processing the same contextual information collected within this model, and enabling iterative adaptation to future evolutions in ubiquitous systems. We propose a prototype instantiated by our meta-model which tracks the movements of individuals who were positive for COVID-19 and confirmed to be contagious. Different deep learning models and classical machine learning techniques are considered and compared for the task of detection/classification of COVID-19. Results obtained from all techniques were evaluated with confusion matrices, accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score. In summary, most of the results are very impressive. Our deep learning approach used a RNN architecture produced up to 92.1% accuracy. With the recent development of OpenAI Codex, optimized for programming languages, we provided the same requirements to the Codex model and asked it to generate the source code for the COVID-19 application, comparing it with the application generated by our workshop.},

However, respiratory diseases and accidents can occur due to the absence of gas masks. To prevent these accidents, this paper developed an object detector that uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect whether workers are wearing gas masks. To achieve this goal, a gas mask detection dataset was constructed derived from real industrial scenarios and Faster R-CNN was improved for gas mask wearing detection. Firstly, to address the multi-scale problem in real scenes, the Feature Pyramid Network was introduced into Faster R-CNN to effectively fuse features between different levels and improve the detection ability of small objects. Secondly, the Online Hard Sample Mining algorithm was used to alleviate the class imbalance problems in the dataset. Finally, Mixup and Mosaic were used in the training process to augment the data and make the model better adapt to different scenes and complex backgrounds. After multiple experiments, the combination of the three optimization strategies improved the mAP 0.5 : 0.95 by 23.2%. This work is an initial attempt at gas mask wearing detection and there is still much room for improvement in terms of model and dataset.},

  abstract     = {This paper discusses the development and design of two wheeled-type In-Pipe Inspection Robots (IPIRs), Kuzhali I and Kuzhali II, which were created to address the limitations of traditional human inspection methods and earlier robot designs. Specifically, the robots aim to overcome the motion singu larity experienced by IPIRs when navigating through curved pipes. Kuzhali I was developed with wheels mounted at an asymmetric angle, which enables the wheels to maintain contact with the pipe’s surface, preventing motion singularity. However, Kuzhali I had limitations due to its prismatic mechanism, and thus Kuzhali II was developed with a telescopic mechanism to allow it to pass through vertical pipes with obstacles. Motion analysis was conducted on both robots to demonstrate how they overcome motion singularity and navigate through straight and curved pipelines. Simulation results showed that the forces acting on the robots’ wheels fell within 5 N to 12 N, demonstrating stability while navigating pipeline junctions. Experimental tests were conducted on Kuzhali II, and the results were compared to simulation results, showing an error of less than 5%. The results of the experiments indicate that Kuzhali II is safe to use for pipeline inspection, can navigate through vertical pipelines with ease and can overcome motion singularity in curved pipes. These robots offer a faster, more accurate, and safer alternative to human inspection, which can reduce the risk of pipeline failures and associated environmental and safety hazards.},

  abstract     = {Over the last fifty years, societies across the world have experienced multiple periods of energy insufficiency with the most recent one being the 2022 global energy crisis. In addition, the electric power industry has been experiencing a steady increase in electricity consumption since the second industrial revolution because of the widespread usage of electrical appliances and devices. Newer devices are equipped with sensors and actuators, they can collect a large amount of data that could help in power management. However, current energy management approaches are mostly applied to limited types of devices in specific domains and are difficult to implement in other scenarios. They fail when it comes to their level of autonomy, flexibility, and genericity. To address these shortcomings, we present, in this paper, an automated energy management approach for connected environments based on generating power estimation models, representing a formal description of energy-related knowledge, and using reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to accomplish energy-efficient actions. The architecture of this approach is based on three main components: power estimation models, knowledge base, and intelligence module. Furthermore, we develop algorithms that exploit knowledge from both the power estimator and the ontology, to generate the corresponding RL agent and environment. We also present different reward functions based on user preferences and power consumption. We illustrate our proposal in the smart home domain. An implementation of the approach is developed and two validation experiments are conducted. Both case studies are deployed in the context of smart homes: (a) a living room with a variety of devices and (b) a smart home with a heating system. The obtained results show that our approach performs well given the low convergence period, the high level of user preferences satisfaction, and the significant decrease in energy consumption.},

  abstract     = {Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an incurable disease and a type of dementia. About 55 million people around the world have AD. However, technologies have been used to assist in the healthcare of AD, supporting physicians in the palliative care of patients. This article presents a systematic mapping study (SMS) to identify articles that use technologies to monitor patients with AD in order to show an overview of the literature, identifying gaps and research opportunities in this field. The scientific contribution of this work is to identify monitoring technologies related to AD and highlight current trends on the subject. The paper uses the term technologies as hardware infrastructure and devices or systems without considering software technologies. In addition, this article proposes a taxonomy for the domain of technologies applied to AD patients. The SMS study was conducted in six databases, including articles from 1997 to 2021. An initial search resulted in 7,781 articles. After applying filter criteria, throwing automatic selection on databases, and manual assortment, 171 articles were selected. Subsequently, a second search was performed to reduce the list of articles and filter by the specific search objective of articles focused on technologies for monitoring with tracking, resulting in 74 works. The main results obtained are: (1) a relevant number of articles (43.42%) reported solutions used in sensor-based devices; (2) several works (33.33%) have the interaction focus on Position/Distance/Proximity/Location sensor type; (3) another group of articles has a secondary focus on Emergency help (18.97%). The results indicated the need for technologies to help caregivers monitor patients, in addition to evidence of research opportunities in palliative care and support for the daily activities of AD patients.},
